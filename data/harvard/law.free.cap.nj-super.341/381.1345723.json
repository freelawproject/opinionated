The children have four grandparents. Harry is their paternal grandfather and Joan, his second wife, is their step-grandmother. Tracy appeals from an order denying her motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the statute is unconstitutional on its face and as applied. Although the facial attack has substance, we reverse because the GVS is unconstitutional as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">The parties recognize that the procedural posture of this case is somewhat irregular with respect to the \u201cas applied\u201d issue. Ordinarily, the anomaly would require a remand for further proceedings in the trial court; however, both sides urge us to conclude the litigation with finality, and we believe that course serves the interests of justice. To place our decision in perspective, we will first discuss the significant proceedings leading to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">After the initial pleadings had been filed, plaintiffs filed their first motion demanding immediate visitation with Tracy\u2019s children <em>pendente lite. </em>On April 24, 2000, faced with conflicting certifications reflecting intense animosity between the parties, the trial court entered an order that temporarily denied visitation and, instead, appointed a psychologist as a \u201ctherapeutic evaluator.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>was charged with the responsibility of interviewing and testing the parties and the children and making recommendations to the trial court respecting therapeutic mediation and visitation. Tracy was ordered to pay half of his bill. Both sides were permitted to retain their own experts, with each being obliged to cooperate with the other\u2019s expert. All discovery was to be completed by June 5, and a \u201cplenary\u201d hearing was set for June 27. Although the April 24 order seemed to be setting the date for trial, that is not what occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In late May, Tracy filed a motion seeking dismissal of the complaint on constitutional grounds. On June 28, the court-appointed psychologist, Dr. Edwin Rosenberg, testified. On July 14, the trial court entered an order requiring Tracy to \u201cseek intensive therapy in addition to the supportive therapy which she is currently receiving from her treating therapist....\u201d Five specific dates were scheduled for the therapy, which would \u201cspecifically focus on the displacement issues described by Dr. Rosenberg in his testimony____\u201d The order appointed Dr. Judith Brown Grief as \u201ctherapeutic mediator,\u201d with the costs of her services \u201cto be shared equally between the plaintiffs and the defendant.\u201d Visitation <em>pendente lite </em>was again denied. Finally, the order set a date in September for \u201cfurther argument on defendant\u2019s motion challenging the constitutionality of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-7, both on its face and as applied.\u201d By this time the Attorney General was involved in the case because of the facial attack on the GVS, and Tracy had moved unsuccessfully for the judge\u2019s recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">On July 28, plaintiffs moved for the third time for visitation <em>pendente lite. </em>The trial court again denied the motion and ordered the parties to \u201cbegin the process of therapeutic mediation with Dr. Grief.\u201d Before argument on the constitutional issues, joint mediation sessions were only to occur with the consent of all parties. However, Tracy was ordered to continue receiving therapy from her psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Tracy sought leave to appeal from those portions of the orders of July 14 and July 28 requiring intensive therapy and therapeutic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>mediation. On September 28, we granted leave to appeal. <em>R. </em>2:5-6. Since the dates set for defendant\u2019s intensive therapy had passed, we only ruled on that portion of the order requiring her to submit to therapeutic mediation with Dr. Grief. We summarily reversed that aspect of the orders because we believed Tracy was entitled to resolution of the constitutional questions before having to submit to psychological mediation. We remanded \u201cfor disposition of defendant\u2019s claim that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-7.1 is unconstitutional.\u201d We added, \u201cThis court will retain jurisdiction to review the trial court\u2019s decision on constitutionality and upon disposition of that issue on appeal, this court will then reconsider the trial court\u2019s decision as to the requirement that the defendant engage in therapeutic mediation, and such other issues as may arise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">On October 10, the trial court entertained oral argument on the constitutionality of the GVS, both facially and as applied, and rendered an oral opinion, which was subsequently placed in written form. Although the trial court was still confronted with certifications from the parties that conflicted in many important regards, neither side requested a plenary hearing before or after the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">After holding the GVS facially constitutional, the trial court turned to the question of the statute as applied. With respect to that issue, the trial court appears to have perceived defendant as arguing that she should not be forced to spend money defending her position and she should not be required to submit to individual psychological therapy or. therapeutic mediation with plaintiffs. The trial court rejected the first claim because the Legislature had provided for suits of this nature and deferred ruling on the second claim apparently because we had indicated in our remand order that we would address it subsequently. Then, without resolving the disputed facts, the trial court proceeded to hold that the GVS was constitutional as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">As should be evident, the trial court\u2019s opinion is anomalous. Generally, the \u201cas applied\u201d constitutional validity of a statute cannot be determined without first establishing relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>facts. Nevertheless, the opinion purports to do precisely that. Rather than speculate about the reasons that might have led the trial court to its resolution of the case, and rather than remand for a plenary trial on the constitutionality of the GVS as applied, we will exercise the original jurisdiction necessary to definitively conclude these proceedings. <em>R. </em>2:10-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We follow that course for three reasons. The first was articulated by Justice Kennedy and approved by the plurality in <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>57, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000), the Supreme Court\u2019s initial consideration of the constitutionality of nonparental visitation statutes. He wrote this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">It must be recognized, of course, that a domestic relations proceeding in and of itself can constitute state intervention -that is so disruptive of the parent-child relationship that the constitutional right of a custodial parent to <em>make </em>certain basic determinations for the child\u2019s welfare becomes implicated.... If a single parent who is straggling to raise a child is faced with visitation demands from a third party, the attorney\u2019s fees alone might destroy her hopes and plans for the child\u2019s future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">[530 <em>U.S. </em>at 101, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2079, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 78 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); approved by the plurality, 530 <em>U.S. </em>at 73, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 61.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Second, although the certifications conflict in many regards, the undisputed facts, coupled with Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s uncontested opinions, provide a sufficient basis for resolution of the case in Tracy\u2019s favor under a summary judgment model. <em>R. </em>4:46. And third, plaintiffs have specifically asked in \u201clight of the delay\u201d (they have not seen the children for over seventeen months) that we \u201cexercise original jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">Tracy and Russell Wilde were married in 1992 and had two children, Russell, Jr., now eight, and Hayden, now six. On September 18, 1999, Russell, Sr., a Cranford Police Department Lieutenant, committed suicide with a handgun at home and in Tracy\u2019s presence. Harry Wilde, the Chief of Police in Cranford, is Russell Sr.\u2019s father and the children\u2019s grandfather. He is divorced from their grandmother and is married to Joan, the children\u2019s step-grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The relations between plaintiffs and defendant had been strained for many years; nonetheless, Tracy\u2019s children had visited with Harry and Joan on numerous occasions though not regularly. Plaintiffs were permitted to visit briefly with the children on the day of the funeral and for a longer time the next day at Tracy\u2019s parents\u2019 home. Although Harry certified that after his son\u2019s burial on September 22, \u201cdefendant became very distant towards the plaintiffs and made it difficult for them to have any grandpar-enting time with their grandchildren,\u201d he did not specify any actions plaintiffs took to secure such time until December 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In the meantime, on four occasions in November, Harry went to the children\u2019s school, visiting there with Russell, Jr. three times and with Hayden once, all without asking Tracy\u2019s approval. On November 29, when Tracy came to the police station to complain about these visits, Harry rejected her complaint as unwarranted since the school had permitted them. He described the conversation as \u201cillustrative of the several conversations which plaintiffs had with defendant after the death of their son in which defendant expressed her hostility toward plaintiffs.\u201d About a month later, on December 21, Joan called Tracy, leaving a message that they wanted \u201cto schedule some time to spend with the grandchildren during the day on Christmas Eve.\u201d She left the same message on December 22, and the next day Tracy returned the calls and agreed that plaintiffs could see the children on Sunday, December 26, which they did, spending about two hours playing with the children. On December 29, Tracy returned the Christmas gift she had received from plaintiffs with a note that read, \u201cDue to the circumstances, I really cannot accept this. Tracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">On January 13, 2000, plaintiffs called Tracy and asked \u201cif they could pick up the children on January 17, 2000 (a school holiday) to celebrate Hayden\u2019s birthday and take them to breakfast\u201d and purchase some toys. Harry certified that \u201c[tjhere was a very long pause from defendant, after which time she told plaintiff that she had to work and that she would check her schedule. Plaintiffs have not heard from defendant since.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>On January 21, plaintiffs had their attorney write this letter to Tracy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">Please be advised that this firm has been retained by Harry and Joan Wilde to pursue their rights as grandparents with regard to Russell and Hayden Wilde.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">The Wildes have expressed a desire to have grandparenting time with their grandsons, a right which is recognized in New Jersey by both statute and case law. I would ask that you choose among the following three Sundays and advise me immediately on which Sunday it will be convenient for you to have the boys visit with their grandparents: January 30th, February 6th or February 13th. The Wildes would pick up the boys at 12 noon and would return them at 6:00 p.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">I would appreciate your prompt response in order to avoid the necessity for an application to the Court. As noted above, it is entirely appropriate for the Wildes to have frequent grandparenting time with their grandsons. However, if you wish to have an attorney contact me, I ask that you do so immediately. In the interim, I would like to arrange for this initial Sunday visit. After this has been arranged, I am happy to speak either directly with you or with any representative on your behalf with regard to setting up a schedule for future grandparenting time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">As you no doubt know, the Wildes are a wonderful resource for your children. Grandparents lend enormous emotional support to their grandchildren, as well as offering them a variety of experiences that parents often cannot. Particularly now, under these most stressful times, it would seem to me that the boys can benefit from all the love and support that they can receive from family. I cannot imagine that you wish to withhold this source of comfort from them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">I look forward to hearing from you and ask that you reply promptly. If I do not hear from you or a representative on your behalf within seven days, I will have no choice but to file an application with the Court. I hope that such action will not be necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">On January 28, Tracy\u2019s attorney rejected the demand, explaining that Tracy believed visitation was inappropriate \u201cat this time.\u201d Suit was filed on February 9, less than five months after the suicide. It was also less than a month after Tracy had failed to agree for the first time to visitation on a particular day.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">Harry\u2019s certifications include the following statements about Tracy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-13\">[Her] certification contains nothing but fabrications, lies and misrepresentations [and reveal] a desperate attempt to gain control of a situation over which she had no control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-14\">[She] neglects to tell the Court that the reason Russell was forced to work as hard as he did was because of defendant\u2019s frivolous spending, and the large credit card debt which she incurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>[She] should be sanctioned for her perjurous [sic] statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">We are seriously concerned about defendant\u2019s state of mind and ability to deal with situations in a rational manner in light of the contrived, vicious, and vindictive personal attacks on us. Defendant\u2019s certification is filled with outright lies. Defendant is attempting, out of desperation or greed, to defame our character and in her effort to do so, she is destroying our grandchildren and our relationship with them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The court-appointed psychologist, Dr. Rosenberg, testified that participation in therapeutic mediation with plaintiffs would be very difficult for Tracy. He also believed that without her participation in such mediation, visitation by plaintiffs, which he believed would ultimately be in the children\u2019s best interest, would \u201cexacerbate Tracy Wilde\u2019s anger and sense of betrayal,\u201d and would \u201csignificantly impact on the children in a negative way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">A. <em>The Grandparent Visitation Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">In its present form, the GVS provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">a. A grandparent or any sibling of a child residing in this State may make application before the Superior Court, in accordance with the Rules of Court, for an order for visitation. It shall be the burden of the applicant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the granting of visitation is in the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">b. In making a determination on an application filed pursuant to this section, the court shall consider the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-12\">(1) The relationship between the child and the applicant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-13\">(2) The relationship between each of the child\u2019s parents or the person with whom the child is residing and the applicant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-14\">(3) The time which has elapsed since the child last had contact with the applicant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-15\">(4) The effect that such visitation will have on the relationship between the child and the child\u2019s parents or the person with whom the child is residing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-16\">(5) If the parents are divorced or separated, the time sharing arrangement which exists between the parents with regard to the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-17\">(6) The good faith of the applicant in filing the application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-18\">(7) Any history of physical, emotional or sexual abuse or neglect by the applicant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-19\">(8) Any other factor relevant to the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>c. With regard to any application made pursuant to this section, it shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence that visitation is in the child\u2019s best interest if the applicant had, in the past, been a full-time caretaker for the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-7.1]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">To a limited degree and for the first time, the State Supreme Court considered the meaning of the statute in <em>In re Adoption of Child by W.P., </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>158, 748 A.2d 515 (2000), which held that the GVS must yield to the Adoption Act. Commenting on the importance and reason for the listing of factors, the Court said this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">In its original form, the bill did not enumerate factors, requiring only that visitation be in the best interests of the child, with no guidance to the courts. In an apparent response to concerns that it constituted \u201ca gross invasion of the sanctity and privacy of the family unit,\u201d the bill was amended, setting forth the eight factors as a way of limiting the intrusive elements of the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 166, 748 A.2d 515 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">The Court also inferred from the legislative history that \u201cthe Legislature believed that parental autonomy should be afforded deference.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, the Court indicated that grandparents were limited to \u201cblood relatives.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">In a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Stein, Chief Justice Poritz expanded on the Court\u2019s discussion of the meaning of the GVS. She said that the \u201cbest interests benchmark is ... circumscribed by the multiple-factor test, which guides but does not limit judicial discretion____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 748 A.2d 515. The statute \u201cmandates that courts give deference to parents\u2019 objections to visitation and to their beliefs concerning the best interests of their child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198-99, 748 A.2d 515. She also observed, \u201cOnly in those cases where the grandparents have had a relationship with the child, can they even make a threshold showing that they come under the visitation statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 748 A.2d 515. She added that \u201cgrandparent visitation cannot threaten the stability of the parent-child relationship in any way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 748 A.2d 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">A literal reading of the statute might not appear to readily support the inferences drawn by the Court and the Chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Justice, but as Judge Learned Hand observed, \u201cit is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaning.\u201d <em>Cabell v. Markham, </em>148 F.2d 737, 739 (2nd Cir.), <em>aff'd, </em>326 <em>U.S. </em>404, 66 <em>S.Ct. </em>193, 90 <em>L.Ed. </em>165 (1945). With varying turns of expression, the courts of this State have consistently expressed the same philosophy. <em>See, e.g., Leitner v. Citizens Cas. Co., </em>135 <em>N.J.L. </em>608, 611-12, 52 A.2d 687 (E. &amp; A.1947); <em>Dvorkin v. Dover Tp., </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>303, 313, 148 A.2d 793 (1959); <em>Valerius v. City of Newark, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>591, 598, 423 A.2d 988 (1980). Therefore, considering the GVS in light of the United State Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Troxel, </em>delivered after <em>W.P. </em>was decided, and our obligation to construe a statute to avoid constitutional defects if it may reasonably be so interpreted, <em>State v. Johnson, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>523, 540, 766 A.2d 1126 (2001), we are satisfied that the statute should be interpreted in the manner indicated by the Court and the Chief Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">B. <em>The Facial Validity of the GVS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In <em>Troxel, </em>the United States Supreme Court was asked to hold the State of Washington\u2019s nonparental visitation statute unconstitutional on its face. The plurality opinion noted that the primary constitutional question was whether the Due Process Clause requires all such statutes \u201cto include a showing of harm or potential harm to the child as a condition precedent to granting visitation.\u201d 530 <em>U.S. </em>at 73, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 147 L.Ed.2d at 61. The plurality declined to resolve the facial challenge, agreeing with Justice Kennedy \u201cthat the constitutionality of any standard for awarding visitation turns on the specific manner in which that standard is applied and that the constitutional protections in this area are best \u2018elaborated with care.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Facial invalidation \u201cis, manifestly, strong medicine\u201d that \u201chas been employed by the Court sparingly and only as a last resort.\u201d <em>Broadrick v. Okla</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>homa, </em>413 <em>U.S. </em>601, 613, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2908, 2916, 37 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 830, 841 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">We do not mean to suggest that Tracy\u2019s request that we declare the statute facially invalid lacks substance. As we have observed, the United States Supreme Court emphasized the point that the litigation itself is a burden on the parent\u2019s substantive due process rights. One can easily imagine circumstances in which that burden would be grave indeed. For example, suppose that Tracy had determined that the best interests of her children required no further visitation with any of the grandparents. She might then have been faced with three separate lawsuits, one from her parents and one from the children\u2019s paternal grandmother, in addition to this action, with each of them seeking visitation, either in the same action or in sequential lawsuits. In <em>WP, </em>the Court recognized conflicts of this nature as one of the reasons for denying visitation to grandparents whose grandchild had been adopted by third parties. 163 <em>N.J. </em>at 175, 748 A.2d 515. Thus, a constitutional principle of law prohibiting such lawsuits so long as the parent is fit, meaning potential harm to the child is absent, would appear to have considerable merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">We must, however, not lose sight of the general proposition that \u201cwhenever a challenge is raised to the constitutionality of a statute, there is a strong presumption that the statute is constitutional.\u201d <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>23, 41, 678 A.2d 164 (1996). Moreover, to succeed on a facial challenge, a party \u201cmust establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\u201d <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>739, 745, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2095, 2100, 95 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>697, 707 (1987). In light of those principles, the guidance provided by <em>Troxel, </em>and our ability to rule in Tracy\u2019s favor on an \u201cas applied\u201d basis, we decline the opportunity to resolve the facial validity of the GVS.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">C. <em>The Validity of the GVS As Applied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">The starting point for analysis of this issue must be the plurality opinion in <em>Troxel, </em>authored by Justice O\u2019Connor and joined by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Chief Justice and Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. However, before describing the principles she expressed, we should consider the effect of the concurring opinion by Justice Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">After noting that \u201cneither party has argued that our substantive due process cases were wrongly decided,\u201d 530 <em>U.S. </em>at 80, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2067, 147 L.Ed.2d at 65, while perhaps implying that the judicial enforcement of unenumerated rights should be precluded, <em>ibid., </em>Justice Thomas nonetheless agreed \u201cwith the plurality that this Court\u2019s recognition of a fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children resolves this case.\u201d 530 <em>U.S. </em>at 80, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2068, 147 L.Ed.2d at 65. He reasoned that strict scrutiny was required and that under that standard of review the state \u201clacks even a legitimate governmental interest \u2014 to say nothing of a compelling one- \u2014 in second-guessing a fit parent\u2019s decision regarding visitation with third parties.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Of necessity, the broad sweep of this concurrence reflects an implicit acceptance, if not endorsement, of the somewhat narrower principles expressed by the plurality. Thus, from a practical point of view, the opinion of Justice O\u2019Connor represents the present state of the law on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">After reviewing the relevant decisions, Justice O\u2019Connor began her analysis of parents\u2019 rights with this observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">In light of this extensive precedent, it cannot now be doubted that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">[530 <em>U.S. </em>at 66, <em>120 S.Ct. </em>at 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d at 57.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Addressing in particular the rights of a fit parent, she expressed the governing principle in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">[S]o long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent\u2019s children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">[530 <em>U.S. </em>at 68-69, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2061, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 58.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">Expanding on that theme, she observed that if the matter comes before a court and the parent is fit, the \u201ccourt must accord at least some special weight to the parent\u2019s own determination.\u201d 530 <em>U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>at 70, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2062, 147 L.Ed.2d at 51. Implicit in her opinion is the recognition that parental rights in this sphere are not absolute, a point thoroughly discussed by Chief Justice Poritz in her dissenting opinion in <em>W.P., </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 192-98, 748 A.2d 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">While the principles of law articulated above underlie and frame to some extent our consideration of Tracy\u2019s dilemma, this case turns on another point made by the <em>Troxel </em>court, to which we referred earlier. Justice Kennedy\u2019s words, endorsed by the plurality opinion, 530 <em>U.S. </em>at 73, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 61, bear repeating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">It must be recognized, of course, that a domestic relations proceeding <em>in and of itself </em>can constitute state intervention that is so disruptive of the parent-child relationship that the <em>constitutional right </em>of a parent to make certain basic determinations for the child\u2019s welfare <em>is implicated. </em>If a single parent who is struggling to raise a child is faced with visitation demands from a third party, the attorney\u2019s fees alone might destroy her hopes and plans for the child\u2019s future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">[530 <em>U.S. </em>at 101, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2079, 147 L.Ed.2d at 78 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Because the litigation itself \u201cimplicates\u201d the parent\u2019s constitutional rights, a grandparent\u2019s statutory right to hale a parent into court must be carefully circumscribed, particularly where, as here, the parent\u2019s fitness is not disputed. Moreover, the restrictions we advance will enhance the Legislature\u2019s policy of encouraging contact between children and their grandparents by avoiding precipitous and acrimonious resort to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Suits of this nature occur when relations between the parent and grandparent have deteriorated. Before engaging the courts, grandparents should be obliged to make substantial efforts at repairing the breach and, in addition, litigation ordinarily should not be threatened before visitation has been denied with finality. If litigation becomes necessary because the parent or parents have persistently resisted the grandparents\u2019 respectful and patient overtures, it must be conducted with restraint. In other words, the grandparents must refrain from denouncing, demeaning, and impugning the parent\u2019s character. <em>Cf. Smolen v. Smolen, </em>185 Misc.2d 828, 831, 713 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>903, 906 (N.Y.Fam.Ct. 2000) (\u201cWhile mere animosity between the parties is not consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>ered sufficient to deny standing, <em>if the animosity stems from the grandparents\u2019 behavior or attitudes, </em>then standing will not be conferred.\u201d (Citation omitted) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">This lawsuit violated those principles, which we believe are necessary to protect a parent\u2019s substantive due process rights. Plaintiffs showed little if any concern for the effect on Tracy of her husband\u2019s recent and violent death. Although she became increasingly distant from them after the tragic event, and, according to Harry, made it \u201cdifficult\u201d for them to see the children, she in fact permitted visitation on a number of occasions. Furthermore, completely absent from plaintiffs\u2019 certifications is any evidence of substantial efforts on their part to improve relations. Instead the opposite appears. For example, Harry repeatedly visited with Tracy\u2019s children in their school without her approval. When she confronted him on this issue, rather than apologize he claimed that he was within his rights because the school had not objected. Despite this affront, Tracy subsequently permitted a visit on December 26. A few weeks later, on January 13, 2000, plaintiffs asked to have the children visit with them four days later. Tracy\u2019s response was noncommittal. When the day passed for the proposed visit without a call from Tracy, plaintiffs apparently did not consider reaching out to her. Instead, they went to a lawyer who immediately sent Tracy the suit-threatening letter quoted above. When her attorney responded that Tracy believed it was not in the children\u2019s best interest to allow visitation \u201cat this time,\u201d suit was filed almost immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Once the action began, plaintiffs acted without restraint. In particular, Harry filed certifications asserting that Tracy was a liar, a slanderer, and a spendthrift who had caused her husband to overwork. Considering the nature of Russell Sr.\u2019s death, that last charge was particularly hurtful. Harry also asserted that Tracy was vicious, vindictive, and greedy, and that she was \u201cdestroying our grandchildren.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The effect of plaintiffs\u2019 behavior on Tracy and the children was explained by Dr. Rosenberg. Unless she participated in therapeu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>tic mediation with plaintiffs, visitation would aggravate her \u201canger and sense of betrayal\u201d and would \u201csignificantly impact on the children in a negative way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">As previously noted, on Tracy\u2019s motion for leave to appeal, we summarily reversed the trial court\u2019s order requiring her to participate with plaintiffs in therapeutic mediation with a psychologist. We took that course because in this context the order appeared to be a substantial invasion of Tracy\u2019s right to privacy. After further review, we reconfirm that ruling. <em>Cf. Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 <em>U.S. </em>479, 484-86, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1678, 1681-82, 14 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>510, 514-16 (1965). While there may be circumstances in which a fit parent is obliged to submit to psychological treatment in the context of a visitation action, they are not present here. A grandparent cannot demean a parent in the manner that took place here and then insist the parent engage in psychological therapy because without it visitation would be inconsistent with the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">For all of the above reasons, we hold that the GVS is unconstitutional as applied to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in refusing to recuse itself is without sufficient merit to warrant discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll~3(e)(l)(E). Therefore, we remand for the sole purpose of permitting Tracy to apply <em>to the </em>trial court for an award of counsel fees and costs, to include the cost of the proceedings in this court, pursuant to <em>R. </em>5:3-5(c) and <em>R. </em>2:11-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
