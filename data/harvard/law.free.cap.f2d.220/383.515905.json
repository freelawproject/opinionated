On their motion, the District Court dismissed for two,reasons: (a) failure to join as defendants the remaining members of the Civil Service Commission, who were nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>essary and indispensable parties; and (b) failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. This appeal is from the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The other members of the Civil Service Commission were, as the district judge held, necessary and indispensable parties. Blackmar v. Guerre, 1952, 342 U.S. 512, 72 S.Ct. 410, 96 L.Ed. 534. Courts will not review the action of executive officials in dismissing executive employees, except to insure compliance with statutory requirements. Bailey v. Richardson, 1950, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 248, 266, 182 F.2d 46, 64, affirmed, 1951, 341 U.S. 918, 71 S.Ct. 669, 95 L.Ed. 1352. There was such compliance here. It follows that the District Court was correct in ordering dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
