At the trial plaintiff and a fellow passenger called by her testified as to the manner in which the accident occurred. On cross-examination defendant attempted to impeach this testimony by cross-examining plaintiff on the basis of her deposition and of prior statements to her insurance company and to physicians, and by cross-examining both witnesses on statements given by them to an investigator for appellant\u2019s insurance company. The driver of the bus testified on behalf of the defendant. On this state of the record appellant alleges that there was insufficient evidence on which to base liability, citing Washington, Marlboro &amp; Annapolis Motor Lines v. Maske, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 36, 190 F.2d 621, certiorari denied, 1951, 342 U.S. 834, 72 S.Ct. 56, 96 L.Ed. 631. Here, however, the apparent conflicts of plaintiff\u2019s testimony with her prior statements were explained by her, and the positive testimony of herself and her fellow passenger as to defendant\u2019s negligence was not shaken by cross-examination. Under the circumstances, it was for the jury to accept or reject all or part of the testimony of each witness. Melville v. State of Maryland, 4 Cir., 1946, 155 F.2d 440. We cannot say, as in Maske, supra, that the jury\u2019s verdict lacks substantial support. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-19\">WILBUR K.
