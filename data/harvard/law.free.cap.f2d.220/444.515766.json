It was stated therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-17\">\u201cThe trade mark was first used on January 2, 1946, and first used in commerce among the several states which may lawfully be regulated by Congress on January 2, 1946. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-18\">In the application it was also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adb\">\u201cApplicant is the owner of trade mark No. 425,142.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-19\">Registration 425,142 was made under the Act of 1905 and is not involved in this opposition proceeding which is under the Act of July 5, 1946. It seems to have been cited by counsel for applicant merely as having some bearing upon alleged laches and acquiescence on the part of opposer, \u201camounting to an es-toppel\u201d of the right to oppose, a matter hereinafter discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-20\">In its Notice of Opposition, opposer alleged use of the notation \u201cSecret of the Odalisque\u201d as a trade-mark for perfume \u201clong prior to January 2, 1946, the date of first use [of \u201cOdalisque\u201d] alleged by the applicant,\u201d but did not name any specific date of beginning its use in the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-21\">The decision of the Examiner of Interferences is detailed and explicit upon every point raised on behalf of the respective parties, and that of the Examiner-in-Chief, while less elaborate, is in harmony with that of the Examiner of Interferences on all questions here material.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-22\">In defining the issue the Examiner-in-Chief said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-23\">\u201c* * * Both parties have filed testimony and briefs and were represented at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u201cThe opposition is predicated upon the allegation of prior use by the opposer of the mark \u2018Secret of the Odalisque\u2019 for perfume, and the statutory basis for the opposition is that clause of section 2(d) of the Act of 1946 which relates to confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">\u201cApplicant admits that the goods of the parties are substantially identical and that the marks are confusingly similar, so that the only question to be decided on appeal is whether or not the examiner\u2019s holding that the opposer has proven priority is correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In applicant\u2019s answer to the notice of opposition, it is admitted that the goods of the respective parties are (1) identical, and (2) of the same descriptive properties; also, it is admitted that the marks are confusingly similar, and the brief for applicant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">\u201cThis leaves for principal consideration the question as to whether or not the holding of the Examiner-in-Chief that appellee has proven priority is correct. * * Although other issues will also hereinafter be discussed, the principal argument of this appeal concerns itself with the issue of priority. Appellant accordingly propounds the issues herein as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">\u201c1) Has appellee sustained the burden of proof as to priority?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201c2) Does the mark Odalisque indicate origin in appellee or appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">\u201c3) Is appellee guilty of laches and acquiescence amounting to an estoppel ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The answer to the second of the foregoing questions is dependent, of course, upon the answer to the first and, in \u2022considering the first, the matter suggested in the third merits notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">It is proper to say that the substance \u2022of all three questions was before both -tribunals of the Patent Office (although \u00a1probably not stated there in the same form as here) and were fully discussed and passed upon by those tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">Before taking up those questions seriatim, it is proper to state that the only oral testimony introduced on behalf of opposer was that of Patricia F. B. Gordon, who seems to have become known in the perfume industry as \u201cPrincess Pat,\u201d and who was the president of opposer. In connection with her testimony, certain documentary and physical exhibits, claimed to be corroborative of her statements as a witness, were introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">With the exception of Exhibits 1, 2, 3, and 4, none of the documentary exhibits bear dates. Those four are said to be \u201cRadio commercial announcements broadcast for Princess Pat, Ltd.,\u201d and the witness testified that they were broadcast, respectively, one on February 2, 1945; two in April, 1945; and one in December, 1945. They made reference to \u201cSecret of the Odalisque\u201d perfume. The witness testified that commercial announcements were broadcast over many radio stations throughout the United States, but no dates were given except those named on Exhibits 1, 2, 3, and 4. She stated that she prepared the announcements and made many of the broadcasts herself. Other broadcasts or announcements she directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">With respect to the first question, <em>supra, </em>reading \u201cHas appellee sustained the burden of proof as to priority\u201d we first quote the following from the decision of the Examiner of Interferences :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-16\">\u201cThe Examiner finds nothing in the record that in any way would discredit the witness, Gordon, and her testimony stands uncontradicted and unimpeached. Corroboration of the testimony of a witness by other witnesses, and the production of records of sales are always helpful, but are not necessary in trade-mark eases. Oral testimony, if clear and convincing, is competent to establish use of a mark. B. R. Baker Co. v. Lebow Brothers, 32 C.C.P.A.

Inc., 69 U.S.P.Q. 20.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">\u201cLikewise, there is no requirement that a party to a proceeding of this character, prove the extent of the use of his mark and certainly he need not show that the purchasers of its goods resold them. As stated in Nims\u2019 work on Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks, Fourth Edition, Published by Barker, Vourhis &amp; Co. Inc. New York, Section 218:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\u201c \u2018No particular extent of use is necessary in the case of a fanciful trade-mark. For this purpose, one bona fide sale of goods bearing the mark is effective, but it must be bona fide. Thereafter, other (others) must avoid the mark, and between rival claimants, \u201cit is the priority of user alone that controls, even though, when the defendant comes into the field, it may not be fully established or may not even be enough established to have become associated largely in the public mind as the plaintiff\u2019s make;\u201d (citing authorities),\u2019 the last quotation being from the opinion of Judge Learned Hand in Waldes v. International Manufacturers Agency, 2 Cir., 237 F. 502, 505.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201cOpposer, in this case, has proven by a preponderance of the evidence, use of its mark prior to the year 1946, that is prior to the commencement of the use of the mark by Applicant. [,]*** the exact date of first use by it of its mark during the period of 1940 to 1945, inclusive, is immaterial here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The Examiner-in-Chief commented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">\u201cPatricia F. B. Gordon, the witness for the opposer, who is also president of the opposer company, testified that the opposer sold perfume bearing the trade-mark \u2018Secret of the Odalisque\u2019 early in 1940. There is, however, nothing in the record which corroborates this alleged date of use. The witness also identified opposer\u2019s exhibits 11 and 12, which appear to be made of plastic, as the wartime packages for the solid perfume which were used as early as 1943. The witness also stated that the opposer\u2019s exhibits 1, 2, 3 and 4 were radio commercial announcements that were broadcast on many radio stations throughout the United States and that the witness gave some of these broadcasts personally and in other instances directed the broadcasts. These exhibits are dated February 2, 1945, April, 1945 and December, 1945, respectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">\u201cIt is true that oral testimony of a <em>single </em>interested witness must necessarily have his [sic] weakness, nevertheless there is nothing in the trade-mark law which justifies its rejection if it is sufficiently probative. In the instant case the testimony of opposer\u2019s witness is not characterized by contradictions or inconsistencies and the testimony with respect to exhibits 1 to 4, inclusive, and 11 to 13, inclusive, is relied upon to show circumstances which are corroborative of the witness\u2019 oral testimony. I agree with the examiner that while the earliest date of use claimed by the opposer as 1940 has not been proven, the record does establish that opposer did use its mark on its goods prior to the first use alleged by applicant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">We turn at this point to the evidence introduced on behalf of the applicant. Two witnesses were called and examined by its counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">The first of these was Charles E. Gumprecht, the vice-president and general manager of the applicant company which, he stated, was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in May, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>This witness was asked by counsel for applicant during his direct examination: \u201cCan you tell us when Nettie Rosen-stein, Inc. first commenced to use this trade-mark?\u201d to which he answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">\u201c* * * In 1946, in January, application was made for the use of this name, through Mock &amp; Blum, to the Trade-Mark Office in Washington, and the trade-mark came through, I believe, in November * * * [o]f 1946.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The following then appears in the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">\u201cMr. Friedman [counsel for appellant] : I offer in evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 an ordinary copy of U. S. Registration No. 425,-142, issued November 5, 1946 to Nettie Rosenstein, Inc., the applicant herein, for the trade-mark \u2018Odalisque.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">\u201c(U. S. Registration No. 425,142 for trade-mark \u2018Odalisque\u2019 above referred to was received in evidence and marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 1, this date.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">We have examined the testimony carefully and the foregoing is the only date found anywhere claiming first use of the \u201cOdalisque\u201d mark by or on behalf \u2022of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Upon the question of priority, independent of any consideration of the allegation of laches and acquiescence on the part of opposer, which is hereinafter separately discussed, the brief before us on behalf of applicant alleges that \u2022opposer\u2019s failure to prove certain matters should be held fatal to its right to prevail. We here reproduce these allegations and comment upon them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">\u201c1. Appellee failed to explain in its record as to why the second witness mentioned in its notice of taking testimony dated June 1, 1951 did not testify;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">The notice of taking testimony, :so referred to, included the name of Mr. M. Martin Gordon, the husband of the witness, Patricia Gordon, the president of opposer who did testify. It is true that he did not testify and that no explanation as to why he did not testify was made or offered, but there was no requirement of law that he should do so or that his failure should be explained.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-13\">\u201c2. The single witness did not state that corroborating testimony was not available, although she stated on cross examination that the number of employees opposer had varied from 350 to 12 * * *. It would have been a relatively simple thing under such circumstances for appellee to have produced at least one corroborating witness or at least explained why it could not;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-14\"> Since there is no requirement of law that corroboration of the testimony of a witness in a trade-mark opposition case is essential to its probativeness \u2014 a matter conceded in applicant\u2019s brief and amply supported by authorities cited by the Examiner of Interferences in the excerpt from his decision hereinbefore quoted \u2014 we are of opinion that appellant\u2019s argument on allegation No. 2 is without any legal force.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-15\">\u201c3. Appellee did not furnish the name and address of the printer who printed its Secret of the Odalisque labels and the undated printed exhibits ;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">The labels referred to were introduced in evidence. Counsel for applicant made no inquiry in his cross-examination about the name and address of the printer, as he might well have done if he regarded them of importance. We are not impressed that they are of the slightest importance so far as the issue in this case is concerned. We hereinafter quote other testimony concerning the labels.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-17\">\u201c4. When queried by her counsel as to whether appellee had any invoices on the sales of Secret of the Odalisque perfume prior to 1946, ap-pellee\u2019s witness replied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-18\">\u201c \u2018We do not keep invoices that long \u2014 we just do not keep it longer than five years, at the most * *.\u2019 Despite this, appellee did not pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>duce a single invoice for 1946, although it is to be reasonably assumed from the foregoing that 1946 invoices were available (the witness having testified on June 22, 1951); * * *\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">With respect to this point, it doubtless would have strengthened opposer\u2019s case had it produced invoices of sales that would have established sales prior to applicant\u2019s first date of use, January 2, 1946, alleged in its application, but the fact that opposer\u2019s president and only witness was not able to produce such an invoice does not, in our opinion, justify any doubt of her truthfulness. Her full testimony upon this particular point, given during her direct examination, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">\u201cQ. 43. Do you have any invoices of sales of Secret of the Odalisque perfume prior to 1946? A. We do not keep invoices that long. We would have to have another warehouse for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">\u201cQ. 44. Why do you destroy them? A. Not enough space for storage, also it is a fire hazard. We just do not keep it longer than five years, at the most.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">\u201cQ. 45. Is Princess Pat, Ltd., selling Secret of the Odalisque perfume today? A. Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">\u201cQ. 46. And has Princess Pat, Ltd., continuously sold Secret of the Odalisque perfume since the time of your adoption in 1940 up to and including the present time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">\u201cMr. Mock: I am going to object to the question as leading. A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">While, as hereinbefore stated, the witness was not questioned during cross-examination about the names and addresses of the printers of the labels, the following testimony was given concerning them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">\u201cXQ. 68. Have you any record as to when you first ordered <em>printed labels </em>for showing the words Secret of the Odalisque? A. No doubt there are records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">\u201cXQ. 69. May I ask you to produce same? A. It would require quite a search. It is way back. I do not know whether we could. We had a fire at the comer building and everything was destroyed. It was burned down to the ground. The chances are I could not produce those early <em>invoices.\u201d </em>(Italics supplied by us.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">There seems to have been some confusion here between <em>labels </em>and <em>invoices, </em>but that does not appear to us of consequence. The fact that it is a common business practice to destroy invoices within a reasonable time after they have served their purpose is, we think, a matter of which judicial notice may be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">In the decision of the Examiner-in-Chief it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-16\">\u201c* * * Applicant states that <em>only a single invoice </em>showing the sale and shipment of the 'Secret of the Odalisque\u2019 solid perfume by opposer was offered in evidence, * -x- -x-y&gt; (Italics supplied by us.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-18\">In the brief before us it is alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afq-dedup-0\">\u201c1. <em>Not a single </em>invoice showing the sale and shipment of Secret of the Odalisque solid perfume by appellee was offered in evidence;\u201d (Italics supplied by us.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-19\">Of course, we have considered this question upon the basis of the representation made before us, and we deem it not improper to say that the reasons of appeal to us are not very clearly stated. However, as we view this matter, it is really not material whether \u201conly one invoice\u201d or \u201cnot a single invoice\u201d was offered in evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-20\">\u201c5. Appellee not having supplied the name of a single customer who allegedly sold Secret of the Odalisque perfume since 1940, appellant was not in a position to challenge the oral uncorroborated testimony of appellee\u2019s President.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-21\">The novel feature \u2014 at least novel to us \u2014 in point 5 is the implication that it was incumbent upon opposer to supply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the names of customers of those dealers to whom opposer sold. Otherwise, it is said that applicant here was not in a position to challenge opposer\u2019s oral testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The Examiner of Interferences took note of this - contention and passed upon it. Speaking of a party to a proceeding such as that here involved, he said: \u201cCertainly he [said party] need not show that the purchasers of its goods resold them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In the course of her testimony upon direct examination opposer\u2019s witness, Mrs. Gordon, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">\u201cQ. 4. How long have you been in the cosmetic business? A. Approximately forty years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">\u201cQ. 5. What is the business of Princess Pat, Ltd.? A. Manufacturing cosmetics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">\u201cQ. 6. Does Princess Pat, Ltd. have a perfume which is sold under the trademark Secret of the Odalisque? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">\u201cQ. 7. Will you give us the names of some of the more important customers of Princess Pat, Ltd. ? A. I would say Marshall Field, Mandel Brothers, Carson Pir-ie Scott &amp; Company, Bloomingdale, Macey\u2019s, May Company, Walgreen, Whelan, Stineway Drug Company, Broadway Department Store, practically every worthwhile store in the United States and Canada, Simpson\u2019s Eaton\u2019s, Sanborn\u2019s in Mexico, and all over the world, practically.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">It seems to us that the foregoing furnished applicant sufficient data to enable it to make whatever investigation it wished to make as a basis for challenging the testimony of appellee\u2019s president.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">The third and last of the three questions quoted, <em>swpra, </em>as propounded by applicant, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">\u201cIs appellee guilty of laches and acquiescence amounting to an es-toppel ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">We take it to be submitted as a question ancillary to the fundamental question of priority. In connection with it, the testimony of Herbert Rubin, the second and last of the two witnesses called by applicant, was introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">It appears that from 1934 to 1936, Rubin was employed as a \u201cbuyer of toiletries and cosmetics at Gimbel Brothers, New York,\u201d and that in 1936 he resigned from that position to go into business for himself. He \u201cstarted a company called Rubicon,\u201d which was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York. He identified a label bearing the notation \u201cRubicon Odalisque\u201d as being of the kind used by Rubicon, Inc., from the time it began business in 1936 \u201cuntil about 1941 or 1942\u201d when, he said, it discontinued \u201cthe manufacture of all perfume items in small bottles * * * because of the impossibility of obtaining small bottles at that time due to the war.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-16\">From a paper dated February 7, 1947, introduced in evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit No. 7 during the taking of Rubin\u2019s testimony, it appears that on November 2, 1946, Rubicon Inc. (of which Rubin was President), filed an application, serial No. 511,962 for the registration in the Patent Office of \u201cOdalisque\u201d as a trade-mark for perfume. It also appears from that exhibit that by it, Rubicon, Inc. undertook to convey its application to the applicant Nettie Rosenstein, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-17\">Evidently the application of Rubicon, Inc. so made was for registration under the trade-mark registration act of February, 1905. The Act of 1946 was approved by the President July 5, 1946. By section 46(a) it was provided that the Act should \u201ctake effect one year from its enactment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-18\">It further appears from the testimony of Rubin that in the latter part of 1945 or early in 1946, Rubicon, Inc. first learned of the use of the trade-mark \u201cOdalisque\u201d by Nettie Rosenstein, Inc., and that Rubicon, Inc. contacted Nettie Rosenstein in regard to the matter. This led to negotiations which ended in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>applicant Nettie Rosenstein, Inc. paying Rubicon, Inc., according to the witness Rubin\u2019s testimony, \u201caround three thousand dollars\u201d and he then executed the papers dated February 7, 1947, filed as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 6-A, 6-B and 6-C.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\">It is not deemed necessary to set out here all the testimony bearing upon that transaction, but the following testimony of Mr. Gumpreeht, President of applicant, given during his cross-examination is quite interesting and we quote it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">\u201cXQ. 59. Referring now to Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 7, the Rubicon Odalisque label, has Nettie Rosen-stein, Inc. ever sold any of its perfume under that label? A. Under that name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">\u201cXQ. 60. But not under that label, like Exhibit 7? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">\u201cXQ. 61. Did you receive any stock of those labels from Rubicon at the time you received the documents, Exhibits 6-A, 6-B and 6-C? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">\u201cXQ. 62. Did you receive any formula for the Rubicon Odalisque perfume? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">\u201cXQ. 63. Do you know what the formula was for the Rubicon Odalisque perfume? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">\u201cXQ. 64. Did Nettie Rosenstein, Inc. create its own formula for its Odalisque perfume? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">\u201cXQ. 65. From what source did you obtain your formula or your perfume? A. From Van Amering Haebler Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-12\">\u201cXQ. 66. And you obtained the perfume from that company? A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-13\">\u201cXQ. 67. And you obtained the perfume from them ever since you started using the name \u2018Odalisque\u2019? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-15\">\u201cXQ. 68. And it has been the same formula? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-16\">\u201cXQ. 69. You didn\u2019t change the formula after you bought out the rights of Rubicon? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-17\">XQ. 70. Did you ever obtain from Rubicon a list of the customers who had bought their Odalisque perfume? A. Never obtained a list. We just listened to them mention in conferences certain firms that they sold it to. <em>u</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-18\">\u201cXQ. 71. Were those conferences prior to the consummation of the deal between your company and theirs? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-19\">\u201cXQ. 72. Weren\u2019t those companies named for the purpose of showing that sales had been made by Rubicon? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-20\">\u201cXQ. 73. Did you receive any stock of the Rubicon Odalisque perfume from them at the time of the transaction with that company? A. No. I was only interested in the name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-21\">\u201cXQ. 74. You didn\u2019t receive any merchandise at all? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-22\">\u201cXQ. 75. Not even a single bottle? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-23\">\u201cXQ. 76. You didn\u2019t receive any empty bottles, either? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-24\">\u201cXQ. 77. You didn\u2019t receive any essences, oils, or ingredients for perfume? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-25\">\u201cXQ. 78. Prior to the execution of the papers, Exhibits 6-A, 6-B and 6-C, Rubicon, Inc. had filed in the Patent Office an application for registration of the trade-mark \u2018Odalisque\u2019 for perfume; is that correct ? A. I don\u2019t know that they had filed. All I know is that I had filed and received a registration. [It is supposed this referred to serial No. 425,142, hereinafter alluded to].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-26\">\u201cXQ. 79. I show you the document, Exhibit 6-C, which states in the first paragraph, \u2018Whereas Rubicon, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York, at 601 West 26 Street, New York, New York, is the owner of the trade-mark \u201cOdalisque\u201d, and of the application for registration in the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Patent Office, serial No. 511,962 dated November 2, 1946,\u2019 and ask if that refreshes your memory on that subject? A. Yes, it does. I know that they said that they applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">\u201cXQ. 80. Then in this document Exhibit 6-C, they assigned the application to you; is that correct? A. Yes, that is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">\u201cXQ. 81. What happened to that application after it was assigned to Nettie Rosenstein, Inc.? A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">\u201cXQ. 82. Do you handle the trade-mark matters for your company? A. Well, Mock &amp; Blum did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">\u201cXQ. 83. Was the prosecution of that application turned over to your attorneys, Mock &amp; Blum? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">\u201cMr. Friedman [counsel for applicant] : In order to apprise counsel for opposer as to what finally happened to the application about which this witness is now being interrogated, the following statement is made: From an investigation conducted by me, I have ascertained that the application in question was filed by Murray &amp; Parker, attorneys of New York City, and that the said application, after examination, was rejected on the Nettie Rosen-stein, Inc. Odalisque registration No. 425,142. The said rejection was never responded to and the application was allowed to lapse. Messrs. Mock &amp; Blum, the present attorneys for applicant, received no power of attorney to prosecute the said application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">\u201cXQ. 90. When did you first hear about the claimed rights of Princess Pat, Ltd.? A. Sometime recently; I don\u2019t remember just when.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">\u201cXQ. 91. You didn\u2019t hear about them in 1946 or 1947? A. I don\u2019t remember hearing about it that far back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-12\">\u201cXQ. 92. Were you handling the trade-mark matters of your company at that time? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-13\">\u201cXQ. 93. Were you working with the firm of Mock <em>&amp; </em>Blum? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-14\">\u201cXQ. 94. I show you what purports to be a carbon copy of a letter dated December 5, 1946, and addressed to Nettie Rosenstein, 36 West 47 Street, New York, and ask you if you have ever seen this letter or if it refreshes your memory on the matter ? A. I don\u2019t remember the letter, but I have no doubt that it was received, and if it was, at that time it would have been turn.ed over to the attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-15\">\u201cMr. Friedman [Counsel for applicant] : Counsel for applicant admits receipt of the letter handed to the witness, dated December 5, 1946.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-16\">\u201cMr. Comstock [Counsel for ap-pellee] : If it is all right with you, Mr. Friedman, I would like to state for the record that this is a letter written by our firm, on behalf of our client, Princess Pat, Ltd., notifying Nettie Rosenstein that our client claimed use of the trade-mark \u2018Secret of the Odalisque\u2019 on dry perfume since 1940 and requested that Nettie Rosenstein cease using the trade-mark. I would prefer to do that instead of placing the actual letter in evidence. Is that satisfactory ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-17\">\u201cMr. Friedman: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayi-dedup-0\">Rubin\u2019s testimony has been carefully studied and practically nothing is found in it which is of much aid in deciding the case. He stated that he \u201cnever actually owned a specific formula;\u201d that he \u201cbought a product that was already made up by a perfume supply house.\u201d He added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-18\">\u201c* * * As a matter of .fact, we have never concocted any of our perfumes; we have always bought perfumes made up by chemical supply houses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>With respect to the registration for which, he stated, Rubicon, Inc. applied (Serial No. 511,962) he gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\u201cXQ. 66.

No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201cXQ. 67. You don\u2019t know whether that ever resulted in a registration or what happened to it? A. No, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">\u201cXQ. 68. Was its prosecution taken over by the attorneys for Nettie Rosenstein? A. I don\u2019t know whether they prosecuted it under our name. I doubt that very much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">\u201cXQ. 69. Did you ever make an abandonment of the application ? A. I don\u2019t know. I would have to consult the patent attorney who handled the matter at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">\u201cXQ. 70. Who was that? A. Murray &amp; Parker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">\u201cXQ. 71. Of New York? A. Yes. The firm now goes under the name of Parker &amp; Graham.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-12\">\u201cXQ. 72. So that your company claimed to be the owner of the trademark \u2018Odalisque\u2019 continuously from 1936, when you adopted it, up until February 7 of 1946, when you executed these assignment documents, Exhibits 6-A, 6-B and 6-C; is that right? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-13\">\u201cXQ. 73. And you claimed to be the owner of the trade-mark and of all rights in it all during the year 1946; is that correct? A. That is correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">It is perfectly clear that Rubin did not sell applicant its <em>business or any interest therein. </em>The following statement from opposer\u2019s brief is accurate according to the record (References to pages of the record are deleted as indicated by asterisks):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-15\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s witnesses admitted that there was no going business which was transferred or which could have been transferred to applicant at the time of the alleged assignment * * *.
