We did not reverse the case, however, because of the court\u2019s instructions in this respect. On the contrary, after reviewing all the evidence, we held the confession was involuntary as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">It is ordered that the petition for rehearing in the above entitled and numbered cause be, and it is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-16\">HUTCHESON, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-17\">I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
