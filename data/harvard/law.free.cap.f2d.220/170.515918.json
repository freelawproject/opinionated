M. Rodgers, as sole devisee, which was duly witnessed.\u201d Appellant took no exception either in his brief or on oral argument to this finding of fact by the trial court. We therefore accepted as true this statement, which was in no way brought in issue except on the undisputed ground that there had been no probate of the will. \"Moreover, even if an issue had been made by attacking the court\u2019s finding, there was ample proof in the record to have sustained the court's finding. For instance, the complaint filed by appellant in the trial court alleged \u201cMrs. Minnie Bell Rodgers executed a document purported to be her last will and testament.\u201d This is clearly sufficient to justify the court\u2019s finding that Mrs. Rodgers executed such a document with whatever legal formalities may have been necessary to constitute a \u201cdue execution.\u201d Furthermore, the fact that appellant himself, shortly after his wife\u2019s death, executed a deed to his children in which he described himself as \u201cS. M. Rodgers, individually and as sole devisee under the will of M. B. Rodgers, deceased,\u201d is sufficient evidence of due execution of the will and its having been duly witnessed and thus of its \u201clawfulness\u201d for the trial court to make the above finding of fact. We think, therefore, the statements that appellant\u2019s wife left \u201ca will which was duly executed and witnessed,\u201d and that it was undisputed that there was \u201ca lawful will,\u201d are supported by the record. Even if they were not, it is clear that so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>as appellant is concerned, he is not in this court in a position to challenge a fact which, by his own act of signing a deed as \u201csole devisee under the will,\u201d was admitted in the court below, and thus raise for the first time, on motion for rehearing, an issue not presented there.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The motion is</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
