It is not necessary, however, for us to place our rejection of appellants\u2019 claim on that ground. For we are in no doubt that the fiat position taken by .the defendants: that the damage caused by the upset amounted to only $1,000; that the remainder of the damage was caused by the wrongful acts of the railroad company; and that they would not be liable for it; was such an absolute refusal to pay as waived further compliance with the policy provisions for additional proof of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\"> Defendants\u2019 other claims are no better taken. Indeed the claim that the admission of Hammond\u2019s testimony was error is frivolous. President of the trailer company and thoroughly familiar with trailer construction and the effect upon trailers of upsets and falls such as the one in question, it would have been difficult to find a person more qualified than he was to give an opinion as to the damage suffered by it. Besides, the question of qualification went not to the admissibility, but only to the weight, of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">As to the special charges, the refusal of which is claimed as error, appellants\u2019 claim seems to be that in refusing to give special charges 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the court in effect instructed' out of the case appellants\u2019 defense that the greater part of the damages were not the proximate result of the upset and overturn but of the gross negligence and wanton conduct of the railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">In a sense this is true, but the sense in which it is true favors the defendants and not the plaintiff. For, instead of charging the issue as defendants had requested it, so that defendants would1 have been relieved of the loss consequent on the removal from the tracks, only if the railroad company had been guilty of wanton or willful misconduct, the district judge gave the defendants the benefit of a much more favorable charge by authorizing the jury to find against the plaintiff for any damages resulting from the action of the railroad if it found merely simple negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">We agree with the appellees that no prejudicial error attended the trial and that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Affirmed,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-28\">. These in substance are: (1) that the verdict should have been directed for failure of plaintiff to file proofs of loss; (2) that it was error to admit the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>of one Hammond, that the trailer was a total loss; (3) that it was error to submit to the jury, questions of penalty and attorneys fees; and (4) that it was error to refuse defendants\u2019 requested charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\">. In substance these are the facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">On July 25, 1952, the insurance companies issued policies insuring the fleet of vehicles of the appellee against certain casualties, including collision and upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">On Oct. 8, 1952, at about 9:30 p. m., a tractor and trailer of the appellee, covered by the insurance policies, overturned from a clay road near Swainsboro, Georgia, onto the tracks of the Georgia and Florida Railroad paralleling the road and beneath it a distance of approximately fourteen feet. The road was very slippery because of constant rains.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">Appellee was notified of the accident by telephone, and he in turn telephoned the insurance agent who had issued the policies. Both the appellee and representatives of the insurance companies went to the scene of the upset as promptly as possible. The appellee personally assisted in salvage operations by the removal of the cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">He also endeavored to make arrangements for removal of the equipment from the right-of-way, but the job was a very difficult one. It was over 500 feet from where the equipment was lying on the track to the nearest opening into the cut and the slope of the cut was almost vertical. Very heavy wrecking equipment was needed and the available automobile wreckers apparently could not do the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">A civil engineer with the Georgia and Florida Railroad, was in Swainsboro and was told about the upset. He went to the scene a few minutes after 10 o\u2019clock, less than an hour after the accident had occurred. Later that night Mr. J. O. Strickland, adjuster for the insurance companies, arrived and discussed the situation with Mr. Austin and the appellee. Also present was the owner of the local automobile wrecking business.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-17\">The railroad had on the tracks a train which left Augusta about 10 o\u2019clock that night, and there was a northbound train carrying perishables, which was scheduled to arrive in Augusta shortly before 6 o\u2019clock the following morning. The first train was north of the site of the upset; the second was south of it. The nearest wrecker or crane was at Douglas, Georgia, and the evidence shows that it would have taken twelve to fourteen hours for it to have been brought to the scene. This would have tied up six trains, one of which was carrying perishable merchandise of $50,000 or $80,000 in value. Mr. Austin testified that even had a railroad crane been available, removal of the equipment by it would have probably resulted in extensive damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-18\">Between 3:00 and 4 o\u2019clock in the morning the railroad removed the equipment from the tracks by dragging it with the cables hitched to the engine of a freight train that had arrived in Swains-boro about 2 o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-19\">The insurance companies conceded by letter of Nov. 18, 1952, from their adjuster, that they are liable for the damage done to the equipment which occurred in the upset onto the railroad track and denied liability for the damage caused by the removal of the equipment from the track. They offered to pay $1,000, but no evidence was introduced to show how much damage was done by the upset itself and how much resulted from the removal from the tracks. The appellee introduced evidence to show that extensive damage was caused by the upset alone, but the insurance companies introduced no evidence whatever to show any segregation of the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-20\">Great Dane Trailer Sales, Inc., from whom the trailer had been bought, intervened as a holder of a lien, and as an additional insured.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
