The mark, applied to gasoline power driven lawn mowers, was registered on the Principal Register of the United States Patent Office on January 9, 1951, \u201cYard\u201d being disclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Yard-Man, Inc., appellant herein, adopted and has continuously used since 1933 the trade mark notation \u201cYardMan,\u201d as applied to hand and motor propelled lawn mowers. The mark was registered on the Principal Register on June 11, 1940, and republished July 6, 1948 under the Trade Mark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1051 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">On August 28, 1951, appellant petitioned for cancellation of appellee\u2019s mark on the ground that the latter\u2019s composite notation so resembled its mark, \u201cYard-Man,\u201d as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the parties, to cause confusion, mistake, or deception of purchasers as to the source of origin \u25a0of such goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">In lieu of taking testimony, counsel for the respective parties stipulated all facts deemed material to a proper determination of the controversy. Included in the agreed statement of facts was a concession by the cancellation petitioner (appellant) that appellee\u2019s composite mark was dominated by its corporate name, \u201cSavage,\u201d and the picture of the head of an Indian Chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">The Examiner of Interferences of the Patent Office, before whom the case came for hearing, held that the marks considered as a whole were not likely to cause confusion in trade if concurrently used. This decision dismissing appellant\u2019s petition was affirmed by the Assistant Commissioner of Patents. Yard-Man, Inc. v. Savage Arms Corporation, 99 USPQ 215. In the latter\u2019s opinion, confusion was unlikely for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-11\">\u201cThe two marks differ widely in appearance. An examination of respondent\u2019s mark shows that it is dominated by the word \u2018Savage\u2019 in large black letters and the representation of an Indian Chief\u2019s head in red. The words \u2018Yard Chief\u2019 are secondary in size and position. Petitioner\u2019s mark consists only of the compound word \u2018Yard-Man.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-12\">\u201cThe marks differ widely in significance. The word \u2018Savage,\u2019 the pictorial representation of the head of an Indian, and the word \u2018Chief\u2019 result in a single connotation completely different from the connotation of petitioner\u2019s compound word \u2018Yard-Man.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-13\">\u201cThe sound of the marks \u2014 \u2018YardMan\u2019 and \u2018Savage Yard Chief\u2019\u2014 is different.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">The appeal here is seemingly predicated on appellant\u2019s belief that \u201cYardMan\u201d and \u201cYard Chief,\u201d standing alone, are confusingly or deceptively similar and that such is sufficient reason to entitle appellant to prevail in a cancellation proceeding. Appellant contends that its mark is well established, unique, and of great value. It urges recognition of the asserted fact that appellee, a late-comer, has appropriated the essential portion of that mark by the mere addition of another word or feature, citing cases of this and other courts in condemnation of that practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">We do not think the appellant\u2019s position is well taken. First, it is elementary that trade marks alleged to be confusingly similar must be considered and compared in their respective entire-ties. Second, the word \u201cSavage\u201d and the pictorial representation of the head of the Indian Chief clearly dominate appellee\u2019s composite mark as conceded by appellant in the stipulation to which we have hereinbefore referred.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">The predominating features of appel-lee\u2019s mark have per <em>se </em>been in use as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>trade mark by appellee since 1906, presumably in 'connection with its manufacture and sale of firearms and ammunition. Appellant has stated in its brief that such trade mark usage by appellee is \u201cso well known as to warrant judicial notice of that fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">There is a likelihood of confusion between trade marks if their over-all presentations in any of the particulars of sound, appearance, or meaning are such as would lead the purchasing public into believing that the products to which the marks are affixed emanated from the same source. In applying this test, it is well settled that the dominant word or feature of a mark may be given greater force and effect than other portions thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">That \u201cYard-Man\u201d and \u201cSavage Yard Chief\u201d (\u201cSavage\u201d being dominant) differ sufficiently in sound to obviate any likelihood of confusion is manifest. Equally evident is the difference in appearance between the contested marks, the prominently displayed Indian head in appellee\u2019s mark being an eye-catching and well remembered medium of identification in combination with the compound word expression, \u201cSavage Yard Chief.\u201d In meaning, the word \u201cSavage\u201d has direct reference either to the Indian or appellee\u2019s corporate name, and thus is not comparable in significance to appellant\u2019s \u201cYard-Man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">We cannot divorce one segment of appellee\u2019s composite mark from the whole and then proceed to compare the portion so isolated with the mark of another. It becomes apparent, therefore, and as we view it free from any doubt, that the decision of the Assistant Commissioner of Patents is clearly correct and should not be disturbed. So clearly is this the case that nothing would be served by prolonging this opinion and discussing other questions raised in the appellant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The decision appealed from is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
