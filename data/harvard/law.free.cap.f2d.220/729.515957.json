The court in United States v. Simmons, 7 Cir., 1954, 213 F.2d 901 called attention to the fact that \u2018a claim of ministerial status\u2019 is susceptible of \u2018exact proof or disproof\u2019 whereas \u2018a claim of conscientious objector status\u2019 depends on properly and accurately appraising the claimant\u2019s conscience. The court went on to say at page 905:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-25\">\u201c \u2018Espousal of certain beliefs coincident with pressing induction de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>mands, when coupled with other evidence which casts a doubt on the sincerity of an individual claimant may well support an inference that the espousal of the religious beliefs was motivated not by conscience but by a desire to remain a civilian. We cannot close the door to the selective service board\u2019s use of any valid inference in ruling on classification questions. To do so would disembowel the statute and refute the express Congressional purpose in its enactment.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\">\u201cAppellee readily admits that several of the more recent Circuit Court decisions appear to stand for the proposition that appellant, by admitting he would use force to defend himself, his family and his fellow church members, does not thereby waive or lose his right to be classified as a conscientious objector. Taffs v. United States, 8 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 329 [certiorari] den[ied], [347 U.S. 928], 74 S.Ct. 532, [98 L. Ed. 1081]; United States v. Hartman, 2 Cir., 1954, 209 F.2d 366; United States v. Pekarski, 2 Cir., 1953, 207 F.2d 930; Annett v. United States [10 Cir., 205 F.2d 689], and Jessen v. United States, 10 Cir., 1954, 212 F.2d 897.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">\u201cAppellee takes the position, notwithstanding the above authorities, that the better rule is laid down and announced by the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Sicurella, [213 F.2d 911].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">After citing and analyzing numerous decisions, the Government bases its conclusions mainly upon the proposition that he, Mayfield, had sought exemption both as a minister and as a conscientious objector, and having found that only the lattpr was tenable, it concluded that since he was willing to fight in defense of himself, his faith and fellow members, he did not meet requirements, that he had to be opposed to war in any form. As shown by the foregoing quotation from its brief, the Government relies primarily upon the Simmons and Sicurella cases, both of which were reversed on March 14th by the Supreme Court, 75 S.Ct. 397; 75 S.Ct. 403, the Court holding that willingness to fight under the circumstances stated was not within the meaning of the Act and did not prevent his claiming the exemption as a conscientious objector.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">There being no evidence to dispute that offered by appellant in support of his exemption as a conscientious objector, the Board could not arbitrarily disregard it, and deny the exemption merely because he had also claimed to be a minister. Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 74 S.Ct. 152, 98 L.Ed. 132; Jessen v. United States, supra; Weaver v. United States, 8 Cir., 210 F.2d 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
