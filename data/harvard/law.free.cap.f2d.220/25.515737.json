Atty., Seattle, Wash., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b77-17\">Before MATHEWS and BONE, Circuit Judges, and HAMLIN, District Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b77-18\">MATHEWS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b77-19\">Appellant (Sam Blassingame) and Patricia Lewis<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were indicted in the District Court, were arraigned, pleaded not guilty, had a jury trial and were found guilty. Thereupon a judgment was entered sentencing appellant to be imprisoned for four years. This appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-20\">The question presented is whether the indictment charged an oifense against the United States. It alleged:</p>\n<p id=\"b77-21\">\u201cThat on or about January 5, 1953, at or near Portland, Oregon, [appellant] and Patricia Lewis, alias Pat Lewis, did conspire and agree together, and with each other, to commit an oifense against the United States, that is, to knowingly and unlawfully, and in violation of [18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2422],<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> cause the said Patricia Lewis, alias Pat Lewis, to go in interstate commerce from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle, Washington, with the intent and purpose on the part of [appellant] and Patricia Lewis that the said Patricia Lewis should engage in the practice of prostitution and that said defendants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did knowingly cause said Patricia Lewis to go and be carried as a passenger upon the line of a common carrier, to-wit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>United Airlines, in the said interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u201cIt was further a part of said conspiracy that [appellant] should accompany the said Patricia Lewis across the State line from Oregon to Washington, as a passenger upon the line of said common carrier, to Seattle, Washington, and in order to effect the object of the said conspiracy, [appellant] and Patricia Lewis did commit certain acts within the Northern Division of the Western District of Washington and within the jurisdiction of this court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to-wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u201cOvert Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u201c1. That [appellant] and Patricia Lewis bought airplane tickets at Portland, Oregon, via United Airlines, to Seattle, Washington, on January 5, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u201c2. That [appellant] and Patricia Lewis boarded United Airlines airplane, Flight No. 675, at Portland, Oregon, to Seattle, Washington, on January 5, 1953, at approximately 3:45 p. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">\u201c3. That [appellant] and Patricia Lewis arrived at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, located in King County, in the Northern Division of the Western District of Washington, on January 5, 1953, at approximately 4:45 p. m., on board the United Airlines airplane, Flight No. 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-17\">\u201c4. That [appellant] and Patricia Lewis, after arriving in King County as heretofore alleged in the preceding paragraph of this indictment, traveled by the same taxicab from said airport to an address near Jackson Street, Seattle, Washington, on January 5, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-18\">\u201c5. That [appellant] on January 5, 1953, transported Patricia Lewis by private automobile from the address near Jackson Street, Seattle, Washington, to 3009% E. Spruce, Seattle, Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-19\">\u201cAll in violation of [18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 371 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 2422].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-20\">Thus the indictment attempted to charge a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 2422 and thereby attempted to charge a violation of \u00a7 371. However, the indictment did not allege that appellant and Patricia Lewis conspired to persuade, induce, entice or coerce any woman or girl to go from any place to any other place. It therefore failed to charge a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 2422.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-21\">Conceding this failure, the Government contends that the indictment charged a conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2421<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and thereby charged a violation of \u00a7 371. However, the indictment did not allege that appellant and Patricia Lewis conspired to transport any woman or girl, or that they conspired to procure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>or obtain any ticket or tickets, or any form of transportation or evidence of the right thereto, to be used by any woman or girl. It therefore failed to charge a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 2421.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">It is not contended, nor is there any basis for contending, that the indictment charged any offense against the United States other than a violation of \u00a7 371, or that it charged any violation of \u00a7 371 other than a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 2421 or \u00a7 2422. We therefore hold that, having failed to charge a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 2421 or \u00a7 2422, the indictment failed to charge an offense against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-12\">.
