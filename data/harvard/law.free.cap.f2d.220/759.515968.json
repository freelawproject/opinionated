The date of first use \u25a0 of the mark in commerce among the several states was alleged in the application as January 17, 1949. The application was examined and passed for publication pursuant to section 12(a) of the Trade-Mark Act of 1946, and the mark was duly published in the Official Gazette on February 6, 1951. On March 7, 1951, appellee filed its notice of opposition to said registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In its notice of opposition, appellee alleged that it is the owner of trademark No. 419,561, registered in the United States Patent Office on February 19, 1946, for candy, which includes as prominent features the word \u201cTurkish\u201d and representations of figures in Turkish costume; that it has used its trade-mark since a date long prior to January 17, 1949, which is the date claimed by .'applicant; that it is still using the trade-mark on wrappers in which its candy is sold; and that the trade-mark which applicant seeks to register so resembles the marks used by op-poser as to be likely, when applied to candy, to cause confusion and mistake and to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">A stipulation under Rule 25 of this court, 35 U.S.C.A.Appendix, was filed by the attorneys representing both parties. It appears from the stipulation that opposer\u2019s labels and registration bore the words \u201cTurkish Taffy\u201d or \u201cTurkish Chewing Taffy,\u201d and above these words there appeared in the earliest label the word \u201cSchwarz\u2019s,\u201d and in subsequent labels the word \u201cBonomo\u2019s.\u201d Furthermore, opposer\u2019s labels and trademark registration\u2019at all times bore pictures which included four figures of people each wearing a red Turkish fez, red Turkish trousers, and Turkish slippers. It was set forth in the stipulation that opposer promoted sales by using persons dressed in Turkish costumes to distribute its coupons for candy. It was further stated in the stipulation that op-poser sells its candy both as low priced candy bars and as pound and half-pound packages. It also is shown in the stipulation that opposer sold 7,000,000 bars under its label in 1948 and that this figure increased to 39,000,000 bars in 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">As stated above, appellant\u2019s mark which is sought to be registered is. \u201cTurks.\u201d Appellee\u2019s mark which is used to oppose registration, in addition to having the aforementioned characteristics, may be best additionally described by quoting directly from the decision of the Examiner-in-Chief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaFh\">\u201c * * * Opposer\u2019s registration is a composite mark consisting of the name \u2018Bonomo\u2019s [sic] in script with the words \u201cTURKISH CHEWING TAFFY\u2019, all in a vertical column. At the left of the words is shown a relatively large kettle with a fire thereunder, and two small figures in Turkish garb pouring and mixing ingredients into the kettle. At the right of the words, two additional figures in Turkish garb are pictured as pulling taffy. * * <em>*n</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">The reasoning of the Examiner-in-Chief in affirming the decision of the Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences is as follows: The words in opposer\u2019s registration are supplemented by characters dressed in Turkish clothes, and thus render the word \u201cTurkish\u201d the dominant part of opposer\u2019s registration. It was further stated that since the words \u201cTurks\u201d and \u201cTurkish\u201d are substantially identical in meaning, appearance, and sound, that the use of the word \u201cBonomo\u2019s\u201d by opposer is not sufficient to avoid the likelihood of confusion, with an otherwise confusingly similar mark. Celanese Corporation of America, v. E. I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Company, 154 F.2d 143, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 857, was cited in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>The basic issue in this case is whether the registration of the trade-mark \"Turks\u201d would cause likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception of purchasers when applied to appellant\u2019s goods, namely candy, in view of the fact that appellee-opposer has used the above described registration, namely, \u201cBono-mo\u2019s Turkish Taffy\u201d with the accompanying picture, on candy.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">As stated above, the Examiner-in-Chief was of the opinion that the word \u201cTurkish\u201d in combination with the picture of Turks rendered the word \"Turkish\u201d the dominant portion of op-poser\u2019s mark, and that the word sought to be registered, \u201cTurks,\u201d was confusingly similar to this dominant portion. We do not feel that the word \u201cTurkish\u201d is the dominant portion of opposer\u2019s trade-mark. One criterion for determining the dominant portion of a trademark is set forth in the Celanese case, supra. This criterion is that if a purchaser would be more likely to remember and use one part of a mark as indicating <em>origin </em>of goods, this is the <em>dominant </em>part of the mark. Therefore, applying this criterion to the present case, it is our opinion that a purchaser would not be more likely to remember and use the word \u201cTurkish\u201d by itself, more than another word of opposer\u2019s mark, as indicating the origin of opposer\u2019s candy. This seems to be borne out by the testimony of a witness for opposer which was set forth in the stipulated facts wherein it is stated that opposer\u2019s candy is generally ordered as \u201cTurkish Taffy,\u201d and in a minority of the cases as \u201cBonomo\u2019s Turkish Taffy.\u201d In our opinion it is inconceivable that the origin of opposer\u2019s candy could ever be determined solely by the word \u201cTurkish\u201d without the use of other of the qualifying words which appear on the trade-mark. Yet it is Inherent in the Examiner-in-Chief\u2019s reasoning that the word \u201cTurkish\u201d is the outstanding feature of opposer\u2019s mark and is what one purchasing opposer\u2019s candy is most likely to remember about the origin of opposer\u2019s candy. We feel that the word \"Turkish\u201d is not the dominant portion of opposer\u2019s mark in the sense that, by itself, it could identify the origin of opposer\u2019s candy.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Since we have come to the conclusion that the word \u201cTurkish\u201d is not the dominant portion of opposer\u2019s mark, we feel that the holding of the Celanese case, supra, cited by the Examiner-in-Chief, is inapposite. In the Celanese case the mark sought to be registered was \u201cDuPont Clar-apel.\u201d Our court found that the word \u201cClar-apel\u201d and the trade-mark used as an opposition, \u201cClari-foil,\u201d were confusingly similar, and that the addition of the surname DuPont to one of two otherwise confusingly similar marks is not of itself sufficient to avoid the likelihood of confusion. In the present case that situation does not exist. Thus disregarding the surname \u201cBonomo\u2019s\u201d in opposer\u2019s mark, as the Examiner-in-Chief has done, there still remain the words \u201cTurkish Taffy\u201d plus the picture of the Turks in opposer\u2019s mark as compared with the sole word \u201cTurks\u201d in appellant\u2019s mark. It seems to us that, when these parts of the respective marks are compared, there is no confusing similarity since they do not look alike or sound alike. Thus, as we see it, the Celanese case, supra, is inapposite since it should be applied to discount the distinguishing value of a surname only after the other parts of the marks have been found to be confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">In determining the question of confusing similarity of trade-marks, similarities and dissimilarities therein should both be considered. Younghusband v. Kurlash Co., 94 F.2d 230, 25 C. C.P.A., Patents, 886. In the present case the similarities are that opposer\u2019s mark, \u201cBonomo\u2019s Turkish Taffy,\u201d contains the word \u201cTurkish\u201d and has a drawing which shows people dressed in Turkish costume, these people being referred to by appellee in the brief as \u201cTurks,\u201d while appellant\u2019s mark consists in its entirety of the word \u201cTurks.\u201d The dissimilarities are that appellee\u2019s mark contains the words \u201cBonomo\u2019s\u201d and \u201cTaffy\u201d in addition to the word \u201cTurkish\u201d while appellant\u2019s mark contains nothing in ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>dition to the aforementioned word \u201cTurks.\u201d Keeping these similarities and dissimilarities in mind, we must therefore analyze the two marks in the light of accepted rules of trade-mark construction to determine whether there is confusing similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Marks of the parties must be considered in their entireties. Valpo Co. v. Solis, Entrialgo y Compa\u00f1\u00eda, 175 F.2d 457, 36 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1160. But different features may be analyzed to determine whether the marks involved are confusingly similar. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., v. Kawerk, 148 F.2d 557, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 954. The common portions of the marks must be considered and cannot be disregarded. Schering &amp; Glatz v. Sharp &amp; Dohme, 146 F.2d 1019, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In analyzing the two marks in the light of the above cited rules of trade-mark construction, we find, when the two marks are viewed in their entireties, that \u201cTurks\u201d and \u201cBonomo\u2019s Turkish Taffy\u201d do not look alike or sound alike, and on this basis we do not find them to be confusingly similar. Even if the common portions of the marks, \u201cTurks,\u201d and \u201cTurkish,\u201d are considered, we do not feel that the word \u201cTurkish\u201d in opposer\u2019s mark is dominant so as to render the word \u201cTurks\u201d confusingly similar to opposer\u2019s entire mark. Furthermore, when the different features of both marks are analyzed we feel that the words \u201cTaffy\u201d and \u201cBono-mo\u2019s\u201d sufficiently differentiate the word \u201cTurkish\u201d in opposer\u2019s mark from the word \u201cTurks\u201d taken alone so that the marks are not confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we must therefore reverse the decision of the Examiner-in-Chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b814-8\">O\u2019CONNELL, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ad3\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Th\u00e9 concurrent decisions rendered by the office of the Commissioner of Patents sustaining Gold Medal\u2019s opposition to appellee\u2019s registration of the word \u201cTurks\u201d should be affirmed for the. reasons stated in the decision of the Examiner-in-Chief, 98 U.S.P.Q. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">Appellant has successfully relied upon certain weaknesses in appellee\u2019s mark which should not have been considered here. There is no escape from the acknowledged fact that appellee\u2019s mark and labels predominantly and pictorially emphasize a group of \u201cTurks\u201d illustrated in Turkish costume. Upward of 50 million bars of appellee\u2019s goods bearing such mark and label have been placed into the hands of customers, mostly children. Accordingly \u201cTurks\u201d is the concept most likely to be remembered as a lasting impression in the mind of the purchasing public with respect to the candy bars in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">Thus, in Coca-Cola Co. v. Koke Co., 254 U.S. 143, 145, 41 S.Ct. 113, 65 L.Ed. 189, the Supreme Court enjoined the defendant from appropriation of the word \u201cKoke\u201d by a newcomer because the public had often bought the plaintiff\u2019s soft drink by the abbreviated name or nickname of \u201cKoke\u201d or \u201cCoke,\u201d even though the trade-mark on plaintiff\u2019s label was \u201cCoca-Cola.\u201d Justice Holmes pointed out that any weakness in Coca-Cola\u2019s mark was no ground upon which its appropriation in abbreviated form by a newcomer may be justified to the detriment not only of the original trade-mark owner but also the public interest. That owner, under such circumstances, is entitled to relief not only by way of injunction but also damages for infringement. Coca-Cola Co. v. Koke Co., supra; Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S. S. Kresge Co., 316 U.S. 203, 62 S.Ct. 1022, 86 L.Ed. 1381; John Morrell &amp; Co. v. Doyle, 7 Cir., 97 F.2d 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">On the same basis this court recently held that the applicant\u2019s mark \u201cPalm Wave,\u201d enhanced by the illustration of the ocean waves therebelow, was confusingly similar to \u201cOcean Wave,\u201d owned and in use by another on identical goods. In re Goodall-Sanford, Inc., 195 F.2d 542, 39 C.C.P.A., Patents, 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-14\">.1 am authorized to state that GARRETT, Chief Judge, concurs in this dissent- ..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
