He was convicted on the conspiracy charge and on four substantive counts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment. His appeal lists thirteen specifications of error which may be condensed into three general questions: Did the Court err in admitting evidence of appellant\u2019s prior convictions for similar offenses? Was there sufficient evidence to support the verdict? Was the charge so erroneous and confusing as to require reversal?</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Appellant testified in his own behalf, and during cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney questioned him at length about prior convictions for similar violations. This was permitted over appellant\u2019s objection that his character was not in issue and that the information was not impeaching of any evidence given on direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Appellant had, of course, testified as to facts tending to exonerate himself of the charges, and his credibility as a witness was certainly in issue. The evidence of prior convictions was restricted in the offer and in the charge to impeachment of appellant\u2019s credibility, and was admissible for that purpose.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In attacking the sufficiency of the evidence, appellant points out that the only direct evidence of his complicity in the crimes was the testimony of one Willi-ford, a member of the \u201cring\u201d. He argues primarily that this informer\u2019s testimony is so contradictory and so patently false that the trial judge should have instructed the jury to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\"> Williford testified that he was employed by the Government as a spy or \u201cstool pigeon\u201d; that while hauling whiskey for the group, he used one of appellant\u2019s trucks; and that often appellant and others would unload whiskey from the truck into their private automobiles. On cross-examination, this witness became confused and made conflicting statements about the length of his Government \u201cservice\u201d and the procedure and amount of his payment. His testimony was clearly admissible; and we need not cite authority for the principle that an attack upon the credibility of a witness, being peculiarly a jury issue, presents nothing for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\"> In addition to the informer\u2019s testimony, there is evidence that one of the vehicles seized while transporting untaxed whiskey had been sold to appellant ten days prior to the seizure. There is also the testimony of a witness who said he had bought whiskey from a B. H. Newman, whom he found by consulting the telephone directory. He would not identify appellant personally, but it was shown that only one B. H. Newman was listed in the directory at the time in question and that the address listed under that name matched the place described by the witness. There is, of course, contrary evidence; but we think the record discloses ample evidence to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">In regard to the charge, it is sufficient to say that appellant entered only one objection thereto and that this alleged error was corrected by additional instructions. Nonetheless, we have reviewed the charge; and while we agree with appellant that it was not as comprehensive or as clear as it could have been, we think it sufficiently presented the issues to the jury. No patent error or substantial prejudice to the appellant is revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">No useful purpose would be served by detailed discussion of complaints made against remarks by the judge during the trial. It should suffice to say that we have examined the record thoroughly and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-15\">. Ilaiford and Tapley also .appealed, but only tlie appeal of Newman is considered here. Neither of the others perfected his appeal nor filed a brief.
