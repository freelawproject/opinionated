His gross income for 1950 was $78,200.35, out of which he paid for professional services relating to engineering, rendered by employees, \u201cfree lance\u201d draftsmen and independent contractors, $43,778.56; gross income for 1951 was $109,768.77, out of which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>paid for such services $48,421.81; gross income for 1952 was $76,247.67, out of which he paid for such services $30,760.-61. These payments were in addition to amounts paid office employees who performed primarily clerical duties, and duties relating to the maintenance and operation of the building where respondent\u2019s offices are located.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Respondent, under these circumstances, cannot be said to have produced more than 80% of the gross income of the business by \u201cpersonal services actually rendered\u201d by him. This distinguishes the instant case from that of District of Columbia v. Adair, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 368, 196 F.2d 603, 604, where we had under consideration the Section of the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1947 here involved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Here the total of salaries to engineering employees, \u201cfree lance\u201d draftsmen, and independent engineering firms not only was over 20% of the gross, but ranged between 55% and 40% in the three years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The decision of the Tax Court will be</p>\n<p id=\"Aps\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-14\">. The statute excludes from the tax \u201cany trade or business in which more than 80 per centum of the gross income is derived from the personal services actually rendered by the the individual or members of the partnership or other entity in the conducting or carrying on of any trade or business and in which capital is not a material income-producing factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">The regulations adopted under authority of the statute, and in force during the three years in question, provide that \u201cif 20% or more of- the gross income from the business is derived from charges for personal services rendered by employees or agents of the business (as distinguished from the owner or owners of the business)\u201d, the tax is applicable. (Regulations 8-1 (d), (e), (f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-6\">. In Adair this court found that the total of salaries paid <em>engineering </em>employees was under 20% of the gross. The court continued: \u201cThe fact that salaries paid to <em>employees of all types </em>exceed 20% of gross income does not of itself render erroneous the conclusion of the Board that Mr. Adair\u2019s personal services are nevertheless the derivation \u2014 the source\u2014 of more than 80% of such income.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
