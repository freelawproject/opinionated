We remanded it to the district, court to reconsider the motion in the light of its view of the weight of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>evidence and all other relevant factors. The district court did so and again denied the motion for a new trial. 124 F.Supp. 606. On this appeal from that decision the defendant, conceding that there was evidence to support the verdict, still urges that it was nonetheless against the weight of the evidence. But this argument, which was available to him in the district court, is not open to him here since we may not reverse upon that ground a judgment of a district court entered upon a verdict. Miller v. United States, 3 Cir., 1943, 137 F.2d 592, 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
