This contention is inconsistent with Dear Check Quong v. United States, 82 U.S. App.D.C. 8, 160 F.2d 251, and we think the present case presents no reason for reconsideration of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-17\">Error is also laid to the trial court\u2019s denial of oral motions made during the trial that the Government be required to produce for inspection by the defense certain notes or statements which the witness, testifying for the Government, had made during his investigation of the case. The motions were not within Rule 16 or Rule 17(c), Fed.R.Crim.P., 18 U.S.C., interpreted in Fryer v. United States, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 34, 207 F.2d 134, certiorari denied, 346 U.S. 885, 74 S.Ct. 135. That case accordingly is not applicable. Furthermore, the facts do not come within the limited situation discussed in Gordon v. United States, 344 U.S. 414, 418-419, 73 S.Ct. 369, 97 L.Ed. 447. Rather, we think Goldman v. United States, 316 U.S. 129, 132, 62 S.Ct. 993, 86 L.Ed. 1322, applies. The discretion there held to reside in the trial court in comparable circumstances cannot be said to have been abused in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-18\">We have also considered other questions presented and find no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-14\"> 53 Stat. 271, as amended 58 Stat. 721, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2553(a) (1952); 53 Stat. 272, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2554(a) (1952); 53 Stat. 281, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2593(a) (1952); 35 Stat. 614, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
