As strict compliance with this requirement of the rule is jurisdictional, we have no option but to dismiss the appeal. Appellant is not hurt by the dismissal, however, as we have examined the record on appeal and find that the points on which he relies are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-25\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
