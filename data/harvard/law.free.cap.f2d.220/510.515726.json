Appellant contends that the sentence should be set aside because the trial judge did not cause inquiry to be made as to defendant\u2019s sanity before accepting a plea of guilty and imposing sentence upon him. It appears, however, that counsel was duly assigned appellant before entry of the plea and that no question was raised on the hearing as to appellant\u2019s sanity. This being true, we do not think that appellant is entitled to relief under the petition which he has filed. If certificate should be made by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245, that there is probable cause to believe, after examination as therein provided, that appellant was mentally incompetent at the time of his trial, relief could be afforded him in accordance with the provisions of that section; but no such case is before us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
