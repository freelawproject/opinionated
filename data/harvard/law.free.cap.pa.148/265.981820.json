The auditor found that the services rendered consisted in claimant\u2019s performing the general housework of the family, in which she was assisted at times by her mother and sister; in addition to which, during the summer months, when occasion required, she would assist at haymaking, com husking, threshing, etc. For these services the auditor found that $1.75 per week would be a just compensation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-14\">He found also that there was no contract, nor was any con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>tract alleged, between appellant and her father, but on- the authority of Sinclair\u2019s Appeal, 116 Pa. 816, that the provisions of the testator\u2019s will (which are set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court) amounted to a legacy to his daughter, of such an amount as should be properly and legally established as a fair and just compensation for the services performed; that as a legacy, the amount found to be due bore no interest during testator\u2019s lifetime, but on the authority of Eyre v.

The testator after providing for the payment of his just debts and funeral expenses, and making provision for his wife, Catharine, directs his executors to sell the residue of his estate, and divide the same into six equal parts or shares. He then proceeds: \u201c To my daughter, Emma Catharine, intermar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ried to Milton Durn, the one-sixth part thereof, less the amount due me by her husband, Milton Durn (judgment .note of $400), and, also, the amount claimed or may be claimed by her or them, as wages coming from her work and labor done, over and above the age of twenty-one years, may be added to her portion whenever the same may be recovered against the estate by due course of law. And I do order, and it is my will, that the said judgment note of $400, and the interest due thereon, shall be deducted from her share coming to her, also the balance paid by me on the John J. Woodring\u2019s note, as security, dated Feb. 16, 1877, amounting to $32, together with the interest due thereon; and, also, the book account which I hold against her husband, Milton Durn, amounting to $93.63^, and the balance, after all said amounts be deducted from her share, to be paid to her by my said executors, and no more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The appellant claimed, before the auditor, for over four years services rendered her father after she was of age, at the rate of 82.25 per week. The auditor allowed her at the rate of $1.75 per week for the entire time, and awarded her the sum of $470.50. An exception having been filed in the orphans\u2019 court to this claim, the learned judge below sustained said exception, upon the ground that the appellant could not have recovered \u201cby due course of law\u201d because there was no contract to pay for her services.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">A considerable amount of learning has been wasted in this ease, in defining what is \u201c due course of law.\u201d It is sufficient to say, for the purposes of this case, that the presentation of the claim to the orphans\u2019 court, and its adjudication by that court, is \u201c due course of law.\u201d It may be conceded that, had there been no reference to this claim in the will, it could not have been recovered in the orphans\u2019 court, nor by a suit at law. There was no evidence, outside of the will itself, of a contract between the appellant and her father, that she was to be paid for her services. We regard the will, however, as a distinct recognition of such contract, and that she had performed the work and labor under it. But there was no recognition of the amount she was to be paid. Hence, the testator provided that her portion of the estate should be increased by whatever may be recovered against the estate by \u201c due course of law.\u201d In other words, her legacy was increased by that amount. Any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>other construction of the will renders it insensible in this respect. It is inconceivable that the testator would have recognized this claim, and have directed its payment, unless he considered that the appellant had a valid claim for some amount. Just what amount was due he left to be determined by due process of law. This was his obvious meaning. The case is somewhat analogous to Sinclair\u2019 Ap., 116 Pa. 816. There a testator in his will, made in 1885, provided: \u201c It is my will, and I do order, that the balance due my old creditors, whose claims were compromised, be paid in full.\u201d He had failed in 1877, and in 1883 had made a compromise with his creditors. It was held that, under this provision, the creditors were entitled to be paid their original claims, with interest, treating the composition payments as partial payments at date when made. Justice Clark there said: \u201c When the testator directed that \u2018 the balance due his old creditors, whose claims were compromised,\u2019 should be paid, he, of course, did not mean the balance which was legally due to them, for that would give the provision no effect whatever. He meant that his executors should pay to them the balance which was justly due and ought to be paid to them respectively, although there was no legal obligation resting upon him for payment thereof, either debt or interest. It is a legacy, the amount of which, however, is to be computed upon the footing of his previous claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We do not regard Geisinger\u2019s Ap., 1 Mona. 600, and Hancock\u2019s Ap., 112 Pa. 532, as applicable to the facts of this case. The gift to the appellant was a legacy, the amount of which was to be ascertained by a judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The decree is reversed at the costs of the appellees; the report of the auditor is affirmed, and it is ordered that distribution be made in accordance therewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
