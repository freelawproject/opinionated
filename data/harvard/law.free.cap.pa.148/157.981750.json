The defendants claim that she has not so proved her claim in this case \u2014 [that she has failed to furnish clear, full and satisfactory evidence that she purchased the property with money belonging to her own separate estate: and they claim that it was the money of her husband that paid for the property, and that the title was put in her name to cheat and defraud defendants\u2019 creditors, and particularly Thomas Connerton, one of the defendants. If you find such to be the ease, that the property was thus acquired and the title put in Honora Delaney for such purpose, then the defendants would be entitled to your verdict.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">\u201c But the plaintiffs deny that she acquired the property in that way, and [she testifies that her husband and one Crowe had an insurance policy on the life of her father-in-law, and that her husband, being unable to pay the assessments, she obtained the money to pay for the same from her mother and brother and friends as a gift, and did so pay the same with such money, and not one cent of the money belonged to her husband.] [2] [She testifies that when her husband\u2019s father died she received $750 of the insurance, by reason of her having furnished the money to take out the policy and to keep it up, and that every cent of the money paid by her for' the property in question was paid out of this money, and none of it belonged to her husband.] [3] She also testified that she got the money in March, 1879, more than two years before the debt due to Connerton by Matthew Delaney was contracted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">\u201c Now, if you find from the evidence before you that such is the fact, that she did thus acquire the money with which she bought and paid for the buildings and leased lot or property in question, and find that the transaction is honest, bona fide, and fair, and not intended to hinder and delay, or cheat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>and defraud creditors of the husband, Matthew Delaney, or the particular creditor, Thomas Connerton, then she is entitled to your verdict, and if you so find, you must render a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for the property described in the writ with six cents damages and costs.\u201d</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AiX\">March 28, 1892:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-4\">Verdict for plaintiff and judgment thereon.
