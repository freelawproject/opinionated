L. 871, an amount equal to the mortgage debt, with interest and costs in each case. There was a question as to liability for paving claims against the properties, which was referred to J. Alton Davis, Esq., as auditor, and by him determined in favor of the mortgagors. He imposed all the costs incurred in the proceeding upon the mortgagees. The court below modified this finding by holding that the mortgagors, the petitioners under the act of 1851, were liable for the prothonotary\u2019s fees and percentage, the opinion of the court, Gutnstee, J., being in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-4\">\u201c The sole question in dispute between these parties is who should pay the paving assessment. The learned auditor has found that it was the duty of the defendants under their covenant to have done so, and we approve of that finding. The question having been determined against the defendants, it is just that they should pay the costs of the proceedings in which it is determined, viz., the audit, but it does not follow that they should also pay costs which the law required the plaintiff to pay in order to entitle himself to the benefits of the act of assembly (1851) under which he paid the money into court It has been expressly decided that the act contemplates the payment into court of the full amount claimed by the mortgagee, with interest and all costs to the date of payment, and that nothing less will satisfy the requirements of the act: Pennock v. Stewart, 104 Pa. 184. At common law neither the plaintiff nor the defendant could recover costs, eo nomine: 72 Pa. 239. There is nothing in the act of 1851 which makes the mortgagee liable for them, and we know of no law which enables the mortgagor to recover what he is required under said act to pay as the price of the remedy. The distribution of the fund in court may be an equitable proceeding, but Pennock v. Stewart is binding upon us, and we do not see how we can relieve the plaintiff from the payment of the costs which are fixed upon him by the law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">Decrees accordingly, and the petitioners appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1-4) sustaining in part defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>exceptions to auditor\u2019s report, holding petitioners liable for prothonotary\u2019s fees and percentage and deducting these amounts from the sums due the petitioners in the distribution.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AVL\">March 28, 1892:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-3\"><em>James W. </em>Oaleford, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-4\"><em>Angelo T.
