It was \u201cagreed that the said lot and stables and the said horses, cars and vehicles are used only in and about the business of conveying passengers and produce, according to the defendant\u2019s corporate powers, and that they are appurtenant, necessary and indispensable therefor. It is further agreed that the lot aforesaid, with the improvements and also the horses, cars and other vehicles, are a part of the capital stock of the corporation, defendant, and are wholly included in the same, and as such pay the usual state tax to the commonwealth. The stock of the corporation defendant is owned by individuals, who are liable to and pay tax thereon to the said county plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-8\">The court Reeder, J., entered judgment for the defendant.

But it is there expressly agreed \u201c that the said lot and stables, and the said horses, cars and- vehicles are used only in and about the business of conveying passengers and produce, according to the defendant\u2019s corporate powers, and that they are appurtenant, necessary and indispensable therefor.\u201d This agreement, in regard to the facts, clearly brings the case within the ruling in West Chester Gas Company v. The County of Chester, 30 Pa. 232; The County of Erie v. The Western Transportation Company, 87 Pa. 434; and the Coatesville Gas Company v. The County of Chester, 97 Pa. 476, in which it was held that the property of canal and railroad companies, and other quasi public corporations, necessary for the exercise of their several franchises, as depots, toll houses and water stations, is not taxable for local purposes. The reason given for this exemption is, that these things enter into the very composition of the works of these corporations, and without; which they could not exercise their corporate functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">We need not pursue the subject further. Under the facts as agreed upon, the plaintiff has no case.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
