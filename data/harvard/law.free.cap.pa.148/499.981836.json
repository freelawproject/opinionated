Some nine months thereafter the plaintiff wrote in reference to these coats, alleging that he had been obliged to dispose of the same at auction and had lost a considerable sum by them. Defendant being anxious to retain plaintiff\u2019s good will, directed his son, Clarence Davies, who was employed as a traveling salesman, to allow plaintiffs\u2019 $50.00 on account of these goods when he should next be in Philadelphia. The son visited plaintiff\u2019s store for the purpose of endeavoring to sell goods, and offered to make the allowance of $50.00 as authorized. Plaintiff claimed that this was not enough and finally induced him to agree to take back the unsold coats. It then appeared that 170 of the original lot of 195 were still in plaintiff\u2019s hands. These he shipped to defendant in New York, who refused to receive them and repudiated the contract entered into by his son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-8\">The court charged the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-9\">\u201c In this case there can be no dispute that the contract is one which morality required the defendant to carry out, because it was in the line of the duty confided to his son to retain a customer, and therefore the contract made by the son for the purpose of carrying out his duty in this respect is one which morally ought to be carried out, but you. must decide not according to principles of morality but according to principles of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-10\">\u201c [The son was naturally interested in his father\u2019s business, and when he comes into the store he is known by the buyer as the son as well as the agent, and it is hardly fair therefore to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>consider him in the light of an agent only, but rather in his true light as that of an agent and son.] [1]</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AId\">April 18, 1892:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-4\">\u201c [It is conceded that the'dispute in this case as to these coats was of long standing, and it is conceded that the son was authorized to pay fifty dollars to settle the claim, but what I ask you to consider is whether you or any one would or would not have been led to believe that the son was authorized to settle this matter in full by the payment of fifty dollars, or more or less, or in any other way, and if you so find his contract was binding upon the defendant.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-5\">\u201c [There is no evidence that he was not authorized to settle in any other way than by the payment of fifty dollars, and when a man desires to avoid a contract made by his agent he must give such instructions to his agent as will preclude other persons from being misled.] [3] \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-6\">The defendant submitted, inter alia, the following points :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-7\">\u201c 2. That there is no evidence that Clarence Davies had authority to bind the defendant to accept a return of the coats, and your verdict, therefore, must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>I refuse this point. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-8\">\u201c 3. That if the jury believe that Clarence Davies had been instructed by the defendant to allow the plaintiff fifty dollars on account of the coats in question, he could not bind the defendant by his agreement to take back the coats, and your verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>I refuse this point.\u201d [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-9\">Verdict for plaintiffs for $272 and judgment thereon.
