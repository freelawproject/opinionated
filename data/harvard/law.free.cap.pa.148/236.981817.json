Clark, 16 S. &amp; R. 286, 290, a grant of the fee: 2 Blackst. Comm., p. 109. Moreover, the grant is of the land itself, subject to a conditional reservation (see Adams v. Valentine, 83 Fed. Rep. 1) of the use of the surface. There is, therefore, no room for the theory that the effect of the deed is to create an easement in favor of the grantees. An easement is a liberty, privilege or advantage which one may have in the lands of another without profit: Big Mount. Improvement Co.\u2019s Ap., 54 Pa. 361, 369. It may be merely negative : 4 Lead. Cas. Amer. L. Real Prop., p. 125; and may be created by a covenant or agreement not to use land in a certain way: Ibid., p. 131. But it cannot be an estate or interest in the land itself, or a right to any part of it: Ibid., p. 121; Huff v. McCauley, 53 Pa. 206, 209; Grubb v. Grubb, 74 Pa. 25, 33. If any easement is created by this instrument it is by the reservation and in favor of the grantor. It seems clear that had the grantor or his assigns undertaken to use the land in a manner different from that permitted by the reservation, coupled with the proviso, the grantees or their successors could, by ejectment, have ousted them altogether: See Bear v. Whisler, 7 Watts, 144. But ejectment does not lie to enforce an easement or privilege: Black\u2019s Lessee v. Hepburne, 2 Y. 331 ; Union Canal Company v. Young, 1 Whart. 410, 424.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">\u201c Iq. construing a deed, however, we are to look at it as a whole, so that no part of it may be rejected: Wager v. Wager, 1 S. &amp; R. 374, 375. \u2018The premises of a deed are often expressed in general terms, admitting of various explanations in the habendum,\u2019 which \u2018 may lessen, enlarge, explain or qualify the premises, but not totally contradict them: \u2019 Ibid; and for that purpose the court, in that case, interrogates the habendum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>and the declaration of uses. These, in the present instance, could not have the effect of reducing the grant of a fee in the premises to anything less than a fee, but they can explain the nature of that fee to be either an absolute or a base or qualified one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\">\u201c It must not be forgotten that such a fee is nevertheless a fee simple, because it may last forever in a man and his heirs, the duration depending upon the concurrence of collateral circumstances which qualify and debase the purity of the grant: 2 Blackst. Comm., p. 109. The qualification must be found in the instrument itself: Union Canal Co. v. Young, 1 Whart. 410; Kerlin v. Campbell, 15 Pa. 500. But no especial or technical words are required to establish it: 2 Am. L. C. R. P., p. 23. \u2018 The construction of a deed, as to its operation and effect,\u2019 says Kent, speaking of this very matter, 4 will after all depend less upon artificial rules than upon the application of good sense and sound equity to the object and spirit of the contract in the given case: \u2019 4 Kent, Comm., p. 132. What is needed is that the deed on its face contain a reservation or declare a specific purpose for which the land was conveyed and from which the reservation may be implied: CATON, J., in Adams County v. Logan County, 11 Ill. 336. Of course, the mere expression of a purpose will not of and by itself debase a fee. Thus, a grant in fee simple to county commissioners of land 4 for the use of the inhabitants of Delaware county to accommodate the public service of the county,\u2019 was held not to create a base fee: Kerlin v. Campbell, 15 Pa. 500; as also a grant to county commissioners and their successors in office of a tract of land with a brick court house thereon erected 4 in trust for the use of said county, in fee simple,\u2019 the statute under which the purchase was made authorizing the acquisition of the property for the purpose of a court house, jail and offices for the safe keeping of the records : Seebold v. Shitler, 34 Pa. 133. Similarly a devise of land to a religious body in fee 4 there to build a meeting house upon,\u2019 etc., was held to pass an unqualified estate: Griffitts v. Cope, 17 Pa. 96; as was also a grant to a congregation 4 for the benefit, use and behoof of the poor of said .... congregation .... forever, and for a place to erect a house of religious worship, for the use and service of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>congregation, and if occasion shall require a place to bury their dead : \u2019 Brendle v. Germ. Ref d Congregation, 33 Pa. 415.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\">\u201c There are, however, about these cases some features which must not be overlooked. In Kerlin v. Campbell, supra, the conveyance was absolute, and the matter relied on to debase the fee granted by it was contained in another instrument to which the original grantor was not privy: p. 506. In Seebold v. Shi tier, supra, the act of assembly authorizing the purchase required a conveyance to the commissioners of \u2018 a full and sufficient deed in fee simple.\u2019 The court says that \u2018 no conveyance for a less estate, or for a limited fee, clogged and confined with conditions or qualifications of any sort, would have fulfilled the requirements of the legislature; \u2019 and <em>1 </em>any other constructions would make the deed a fraud upon the citizens who erected the court house and upon the county that erected after-wards the county offices and the county jail, by a large expenditure of the county funds: \u2019 page 13T.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\">\u201c But further it is apparent in all the cases cited, that the purposes for which the grants were made were really all the purposes for which the grantees could lawfully hold real estate. Unless, therefore, the absurd position be assumed that a corporation can in no event take a fee simple absolute, because its power to hold land is limited to the uses for which it is authorized to acquire and employ it, a declaration, in the grant, that it is conveyed for those uses cannot be deemed to import a limitation of the fee. <em>JExpressio eorurn quae taoite insunt nihil operatur. </em>Such a declaration can amount to no more than an explicit assertion of the intended legality of the grant. As was said, in the case of Griffitts v. Cope, supraj at p. 100: \u2018 the use to which the granting clause declares that this land is to be applied is of the character which the law requires and is the most ordinary purpose for which religious societies require land. The presumption would therefore appear fair and obvious, that by that declaration, the devisor merely meant to make the grant lawful upon its face; \u2019 and in Brendle v. German Reformed Congregation, supra, at p. 435: \u2018 What then is the efficacy of the declaration. that the congregation holds the land for the use of its poor, for' a church,, and for a burial ground? Nothing, except to show that they hold it for the purpose for which the law allows congregations to hold land; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>not to limit their own title, but to recognize the uses allowed by law.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">\u201c It is at once apparent that the present case is wholly different, in that the purpose expressed in this grant is not one for which counties usually acquire a fee simple in lands. What those purposes may lawfully be, since the act of April 15,1884, is set forth in the proviso to section 3, clause 11, of that statute: 1 Purd. Dig., p. 364, pi. 14. Before its enactment, the general power of county commissioners to take lands was confined to such as were bought in by them to secure the county debts, on process from the courts, or their own process authorized by law, or mortgages given to secure the county debts: Vankirk v. Clark, 16 S. &amp; R. 286, 290. That they might enter into a valid agreement with a property holder adjoining, e. g., a county prison, not to build against its walls, with a view to preventing the escape of prisoners while the building was used as a place for their confinement, seems scarcely doubtful. And if they might do that by a mere agreement, they might, in order to be in position to insure the accomplishment of the purpose, do so by taking a fee in the property to be kept open for such purpose. But they could not take more, they could not make an investment of more, than was required by the immediate and lawful object in view; that is to say, whilst they could take a fee, that fee must be determinable upon the cessation of the necessity or occasion of its acquisition and the possibility of serving the purpose of its creation. <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">\u201c It is surely not unreasonable to suppose that this limitation upon the commissioners\u2019 powers, and the contingency that at some future time the use of their property as a jail should be abandoned, were in the minds of the parties to the deed of December 1, 1772, and had some influence in fixing the consideration for the grant. (The employment of the word \u2018 forever \u2019 seems insignificant in this connection; for, as has been seen, the estate might continue forever, and so in that case would the purpose. On the other hand, a grant of an estate \u2018forever\u2019 may yet be but of a life estate: 2 Blackst. Cornm., p. 107.) Hence there is a peculiar propriety in applying to the parties\u2019 declaration of purpose the familiar principle of interpretation, <em>expressum facit cessare taciturn. </em>That declaration shows but one purpose, and shows it clearly. It was not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>afford light, air or access to the adjoining tenement, to add anything to it that was needful or convenient to its use and enjoyment, nor to increase the size of the plot upon which the prison stood, or to enhance its value, set off its architectural proportions, or protect it against fire. It was simply to serve the one declared object \u2014 the hindrance of the escape of prisoners, which the erection of walls contiguous to those of the prison would facilitate. In view of all the circumstances, there seems to arise from the express declaration of purpose a necessary implication of the exclusion of every other. .It is a rule in the construction of a statute, pleading, contract, will and other instrument that what is clearly implied is as much a part of it as what is expressed: U. S. v. Babbit, 1 Black, 61; Hanchett v. Weber, 17 Ill. Ap. 114. The instrument under consideration is, therefore, to be treated precisely as if it contained a declaration that the grant was for the purpose mentioned and no other. But, where an estate is conveyed in fee for a specified purpose \u2018 and no other,\u2019 the fee is a base fee determinable upon cessation of the use of the property for that purpose: Kirk v. King, 8 Pa. 436'; Scheetz v. Fitzwater, 5 Id-126.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-4\">\u201c It is scarcely needful to add that those decisions which relate to the construction of a deed as conveying an estate on condition subsequent, and deny that effect to a recital that the grant is upon a certain consideration, or to a collateral covenant: see Cook v. Trimble, 9 Watts, 15; Union Canal Company v. Young, 1 Wh. 410; Perry v. Scott, 51 Pa. 119; Method. Ep. Ch. v. Publ. Ground Co., 103 Id. 608 \u2014 are inapplicable. The purpose here is not recited as part of the consideration, nor is its observance collaterally covenanted. Nor is the estate here granted one upon condition. Although there is some confusion in decisions and text books concerning these two species of estates, there is a radical distinction \u2014 and one, as we pointed out in the recent decision of this court in Schaeffer v. Messersmith, C. P. Berks County, No 105, May T., 1890, well established in the jurisprudence of this state \u2014 between a fee determinable by limitation and an estate upon condition subsequent: 2 Am. L. C. R. P., pp. 19, 20. Nor again does the case of Yeaton\u2019s Ap., 105 Pa. 125, relied on by respondents, bear upon the question in hand. That was the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>an easement created by a covenant contained in a deed, in terms perpetual, not to build upon the north or east of the grantor\u2019s church building, excepting that, if the same should at any time cease to be used for that purpose, a wall might be built on the east side. This was a limitation appointed by the parties themselves upon the effect of the abandonment of the then use of the dominant tenement, and in restricting the owner of the servient one to the terms of this limitation, the Supreme Court, in effect, but applied the principle which we have applied to this case : <em>iExpressumfacit cessare taeilum.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">\u201c Of course, upon the determination of a base fee, the property reverts to the grantor: 2 Blackst. Comm., pp. 109-110; without any claim or act on his part where it is determinable by limitation: Schaeffer v. Messersmith, supra. In the meanwhile, the estate is out of him, and all that remains to him is the mere possibility of reverter: 4 Kent, Comm., p. 10. Yet this mere possibility is capable of transmission to his grantees and will jjass to them under a conveyance of the reversion: Scheetz v. Fitzwater, 5 Pa. 126.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">\u201cWe have next to pass upon the questions raised by the demurrer and by the submission of the cause upon bill and answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-7\">\u201c <em>First. </em>As to the demurrer.

L. 537, provides in section 9,1 Purd. Dig., p. 364, pi. 18, that the titles to all and singular the court houses, jails, prisons and workhouses, together with the lots of land thereunto belonging or appertaining, as they now are or heretofore have been, vested in the commissioners of the respective counties for the several use of the said counties respectively, shall be, and they are hereby declared to be vested in the respective counties for the use of the people thereof and for no other use; and section 3 of the same statute: 1 Purd. Dig., p. 364, pi. 13, confers upon the several counties capacity, as bodies corporate, to sue and be sued as such by the corporate name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-11\">\u201c Whilst, as a general rule, land cannot be appurtenant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>land: Grubb v. Guilford, 4 W. 223, 244, yet it may be made so by the intent and acts of the parties: Ibid.; Grubb v. Grubb, 74 Pa. 25, 33.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">\u201c The use of this strip of land permitted by the deed of first December, 1772, indicates such an intention, at least sufficiently to permit it to he regarded as an appurtenance to the jail property within the spirit of the act of 1824, and as such to the extent of the estate held by the commissioners to have thereby become vested in the county of Berks. This suit, therefore, under the decision of Wilson v. Commissioners, 7 W. &amp; S. 197, should have been brought against the county. But counsel for plaintiff and for the demurrants have agreed that in event of the court\u2019s so holding the bill should be amended by substituting the county of Berks as defendant in place of the commissioners named. Accordingly we shall treat the bill as properly brought against the county, and the formal amendment may be made hereafter. The other defendants are not thereby prejudiced. Having answered to the merits the objection could not, it would seem, be now made by them: See Glover v. Wilson, 6 Pa. 290, 292: Fritz v. Commissioners, 17 Id. 130, 134, 135; and, besides, \u2018 if the misjoinder is of parties as defendants, those only can demur who are improperly joined: \u2019 Story, Eq. PL, sec. 544.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\">\u201c (2) The next ground of demurrer is that the interests of the defendants are not identical, but in conflict, and therefore \u25a0 they should not be joined in this proceeding. This assertion is based upon a misconception of the effect of the instrument of December 1, 1772. There cannot be any question of conflicting interests between these defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-7\">\u201c (3) It is next asserted that this court has no jurisdiction to declare null and void the deed of December 1, 1772, inasmuch as the same confers substantial rights upon the county of Berks or its grantee, and the title of said premises depends upon the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-8\">\u201c What was the nature and extent of these rights and what the character of the title has already been declared. It is only necessary in this connection to examine into the jurisdiction of this court to grant the relief prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-9\">\u201c The particular form of equity jurisdiction here invoked is that which is exercised to remove clouds upon title, the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>in such cases being granted on the principle quia timet; that is, that the deed or other instrument constituting the cloud may be used injuriously or vexatiously embarrass or affect the plaintiff\u2019s title to real estate : 3 Pomeroy, Eq. Jur., sec. 1398. The existence of this as an independent source or head of jurisdiction in the courts of this state, not requiring any accompaniment of fraud, accident, mistake, trust or account, or any other basis of equitable intervention, is abundantly established: Dull\u2019s Ap., 113 Pa. 510; Stewart\u2019s Ap., 78 Id. 88 ; Wilson v. Getty, 57 Id. 266; Eckman v. Eckman, 55 Id. 269, 273; Kennedy v. Kennedy, 43 Id. 413, 417. The rules as to the status of the plaintiff to invoke the exercise of this jurisdiction, as laid down in 3 Pomeroy, Eq. Jur., see. 1399, note 4, p. 36, approved in Dull\u2019s Ap., supra, at pp. 517, 518, are as follows: \u2018 When the estate or interest to be protected is equitable the jurisdiction should be exercised whether the plaintiff is in or out of possession; but when the estate or interest is legal in its nature, the exercise of the jurisdiction depends upon the adequacy of legal remedies. Thus, for example, a plaintiff out of possession holding the legal title will be left to his remedy by ejectment under ordinary circumstances, but when he is in possession, and thus unable to obtain any adequate legal relief, he may resort to equity.\u2019 The occasions for and the mode of the exercise of the jurisdiction are stated to be the following: \u2018 Whenever a deed or other instrument exists which may be vexatiously or injuriously used against a party after the evidence to impeach or invalidate it is lost, or <em>which may throw a cloud or suspicion over his title or </em>interest, <em>and he cannot immediately protect or maintain his right by any course or proceedings at </em>law, a court of equity will afford relief by directing the instrument to bo delivered up and canceled, or by making any other decree which justice or the rights of the parlies may require : \u2019 Martin v. Graves, 5 Allen (Mass.), 601, approved in Stewart\u2019s Ap., supra, at p. 96, and Dull\u2019s Ap., supra, at p. 516. And again : \u2018 If a case is made out which will justify the court in declaring a contract at an end, it will in general be ordered to be delivered up to be canceled: \u2019 Wilson v. Getty, supra, at p. 270.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-8\">\u201c'It is objected, however, that \u2018 the proper construction of a deed is not a subject of equitable jurisdiction: \u2019 Grubb\u2019s Ap., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>90 Pa. 228, 238. No doubt, there is not in this state, as there is in some others, any special jurisdiction conferred upon the courts of equity by reason of which they may be called upon to declare the construction of a deed, or will, or other instrument; nor, of course, will the mere fact that the proper construction of such is in dispute confer chancery jurisdiction, in the absence of some other recognized basis of equitable intervention. But it will scarcely be pretended, that, where a party has no legal remedy whereby to protect his property against the assertion of an unfounded or expired claim, the established equity jurisdiction is ousted by the mere fact, that, incidentally, it will be necessary to put a construction upon a written instrument. Such a doctrine would practically amount to a denial of the jurisdiction itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">\u201c Again it is urged upon us that a court of equity has no jurisdiction to settle a disputed legal right to land on a bill in equity filed by the party in possession, averring that a multiplicity of suits at law may result to redress threatened trespasses : Washburn\u2019s Ap., 105 Pa. 480. Of course not; but that, is not this case. In actions respecting real property, if there be no equitable ground of relief involved, the rights of the parties must be determined at law; the interference of equity in such a case resting on the principle of a clear right to the enjoyment of the subject in question and an injurious interruption of that right, which, upon just and equitable grounds, ought to be prevented, and the party, contesting that right, in the first instance dependent upon conflicting proofs, being entitled to have them passed upon by a jury : Ibid. A very different case is presented when the intervention of the court is asked upon a recognized ground of equitable jurisdiction; when the rights of the parties result from an undisputed written instrument, aided by facts that are admitted; when the injury complained of, arising from conceded acts, is partly subsisting and actual and partly anticipated, and of such a character as to afford no redress at law. No doubt, if the plaintiff were to proceed to build upon the strip of land in dispute, it is possible that a suit at law would be instituted against him in which his rights would eventually be passed upon. But it is equally possible that no such suit would be brought, at least for a period of years. In the meanwhile, the title, not merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the possession, would remain doubtful and unmarketable. But the owner of property has a right, not only to use it, but to sell it, and in that right, incapable of being enforced in any legal action he can institute, he is entitled to be protected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\">\u201c This ground of demurrer must, therefore, fall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">\u201c (4) The last ground is that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief in this proceeding under the premises, as her predecessor reserved for himself and his assigns certain rights, which it is not averred have been interfered with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">\u201c What has already been said sufficiently disposed of this ground of demurrer, which cannot be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-7\">\u201c <em>Second. </em>As to the answer: But little remains to be said in passing upon the submission on bill and answer. The allegation of the respondents is, in substance, that the instrument of December 1, 1772, invested the grantees therein with an indefeasible right, which, by the deed of April 2, 1849, passed to William Rhoads, Sr., as appurtenant to the Old Jail Property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-8\">\u201c The estate of the county of Berks, under the instrument of December 1, 1772, being a base fee, whether principal or appurtenant to the Old Jail Property, it could pass to its vendee nothing more than it had: i. e., as to this strip of ground, nothing, if the estate had terminated before the date of the conveyance by an abandonment of the purposes of the grant; or an estate determinable upon such abandonment, if prior to it in date. \u2018 If the owner of a determinable fee conveys in fee, the determinable quality of the estate follows the transfer, and this is founded upon the sound maxim of the common law, that <em>nemo potest plus juris in alium iransferre quam ipse habei: </em>\u2019 4 Kent, Comm., p. 10. Indeed it is not clear how under the act of assembly authorizing the sale and conveyance under which respondents claim anything more could pass. If it were conceded that the estate of the county under the deed of December 1, 1772, was a fee simple absolute, it would still be true that the statute authorized but the sale of \u2018 what is now called the Old Jail Property Ih the city of Reading, consisting of the old jail buildings and the appurtenances and <em>a lot of ground, </em>being on the corner of North Fifth and Washington streets, in the said city of Reading, and <em>having </em>60 <em>feet on said North Fifth </em>street, and 280 feet on Washington street.\u2019 It was held in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Seebold v. Shitler, 34 Pa. 133,137, that a deed from a private grantor to the county must be deemed to convey what the statute required. It would seem but a corollary to this rule that a deed from the county to a private grantee cannot convey more than the statute authorized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\">\u201c Upon the bill and answer it is clear that the respondents have no interest in or right over the eight feet wide strip of ground to the north of their tenement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">\u201c In the consideration of this case it has been assumed, nor was it questioned upon the argument, that the conveyances by plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in title, during the continuance of the estate granted by the deed of December 1, 1772, included the reversion of this strip of land. The usual form of conveyances in fee simple contains such a grant, and it may be supposed that those forming the chain of plaintiff\u2019s title were not exceptional in this respect. Yet the fact ought to be made to appear in this record, and for that purpose leave will be given to plaintiff to amend her bill by proper averments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-7\">\u201c That done, plaintiff will be entitled to the relief prayed for, and counsel will prepare and submit the necessary decrees in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion.\u201d Subsequently the court entered the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-8\">\u201c And now to wit, January 29, 1891, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that Gyrus Kauffman, Franklin Seidel and Jarius Reeser, county commissioners, representing the said county of Berks as defendants in above suit, do forthwith surrender and deliver up to the said plaintiff the deed from George Fleisher and Margaret, his wife, to Henry Reuthmeyer, David Brecht and Abraham Lincoln, county commissioners of said county, dated December 1,1772, and recorded 'in the recorder\u2019s office of Berks county in Deed Book B, vol. 2, page 71, and set forth in said plaintiff\u2019s bill, and that Simpson Becker, the recorder of said county, do forthwith cancel the same upon said record, and it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that the costs in this suit be paid by defendants.\u201d [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-9\">Defendant, Rebecca Lauer, appealed#</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-10\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) deciding that the conveyance of 1772 passed but a base fee determinable upon the abandonment of the use for which the strip of ground was originally granted; (2) deciding that respondents had no interest in or right over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the strip of ground in dispute; (8) the decree entered, quoting it.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A99\">March 28, 1892:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-5\"><em>J.
