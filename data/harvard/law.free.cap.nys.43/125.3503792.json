The answer denied that the defendant was the sole owner of the premises, and alleged that the same were owned by the heirs at law of his late father, of whose will he was sole acting executor, but without giving the names of such co-owners, and alleged that his custody of the premises was as such executor, and denied maintaining any nuisance. Upon the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the court directed a nonsuit, upon the ground that the other owners of the defendant\u2019s lot were not made parties. Other facts are stated in the opinion.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Appeal from Albany county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-11\">Action by Lena Garrett against Bradford B.

Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 488, 498, 499. Besides, the action was in tort, and plaintiff was at liberty to sue any one of the alleged wrongdoers, if there were more than one, which is by no means clear, under the evidence. The covenant in the deed from Bradford R. Wood, defendant\u2019s testator, under which deed plaintiff holds her lot, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">\u201cThe alleyway, eight feet, in the rear of the above-described premises, which is to be given by the said Wood, to be for the mutual benefit of the lots bordering thereon; said Judge agreeing, for himself, his heirs and assigns, to keep the said alley so conformed to the level of Colonie street that the lots on the west side of said alleyway can drain into and through the same to Colonie street.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">The defendant\u2019s lot adjoins the alley on the west its entire length, the plaintiff\u2019s lot adjoins it for 42 feet on the east, and the lots of other owners also adjoin the alley on the east for 202 feet from the plaintiff\u2019s lot to Colonie street. The use of the alley seems to be granted to the plaintiff, and to the owners of the other lots adjoining the alley on the east; and the plaintiff ought to keep that part of the alley adjoining her lot so conformed to the level of Colonie street that the defendant\u2019s lot on the west of the entire alley can drain into said street, if the rest of the alley is unobstructed. We think it would be unreasonable to hold that she should keep the whole alley so conformed. Upon the evidence, we think it was a question of fact whether the injury from the overflow of water was caused by the omission of the defendant to take reasonable care of the lot of which he was part owner and had sole possession and control, and, if so, whether the plaintiff, by breach of her covenant, or by obstructing the alley, contributed to the injury which she sustained by such overflow.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">Judgment reversed. New trial granted. Costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
