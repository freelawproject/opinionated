The proof upon the trial tended to establish that Dreyer was engaged in business as a florist, near Woodside, in Long Island City, where he had growing plants and numerous articles of personal property used about the business. He also had a farm and greenhouses at Newtown, in the county of Queens. Prior to July 11,1894, the sheriff levied upon plaintiff\u2019s property at Woodside to satisfy an execution issued upon a judgment against Dreyer, and on January 11th this property was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, and was bid in by the defendant, Clonin. The sale included all the personal property at Woodside, and Clonin continued to hold the same until a short time prior to the general assignment by Dreyer, when he transferred this property to his partner, Messenger, and the latter carried on the business for the benefit of those interested until the property was entirely sold out. The property which is the subject of this action was sent by the plaintiff to Dreyer at Wood-side, and, so far as appears, constituted a part of the property sold by Messenger. About two months after the sheriff\u2019s sale Dreyer made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors to Clonin. This assignment did not embrace the personal property at Wood-side, and Clonin did not take possession thereof, but conducted business as assignee at Newtown. The evidence offered by plaintiff tended to establish that, after the sheriff\u2019s sale, and also after the assignment, Dreyer continued in Clonin\u2019s employ at Woodside, and also at Newtown. Prior to \u00bfthe assignment Dreyer had ordered of the plaintiff the bulbs and flowers for which this action is brought, but, learning of the former\u2019s financial difficulties, plaintiff refused to ship the goods. Thereupon Dreyer requested plaintiff to see Clonin, and they called upon him. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony is to the effect that, after he had explained the situation, Clonin said that \u201che would guaranty me the money for the goods if I would send them, and he asked me how much the goods came to, and I told him in the neighborhood of $200. \"\"\" * He said, \u2018I will see you get paid.\u2019 And on Mr. Clonin\u2019s order I sent the goods; otherwise, I would not have done so.\u201d The defendant\u2019s version of this transaction is that plaintiff came to him, and he asked, \u201c What will the bill amount to?\u2019 He said, \u2018About $70.\u2019 I said, \u2018Send the goods along.\u2019 I did not tell him where to send them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">We think it is quite clear, if plaintiff\u2019s version be correct, that the legal effect of this transaction was to make Clonin individually liable for this debt;\u2019 at least, the jury would be authorized so to find. It is true that the plaintiff states that Clonin guarantied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>payment of the money, and in its ordinary sense the word imports an undertaking by one person that another will fulfill an obligation. But we are to construe' the word in connection with the circumstances surrounding its use. Here the plaintiff refused to sell to Dreyer; in fact, Dreyer had gone out of business, except as he acted for Clonin. The purchase, when made, was not for the benefit of Dreyer, but was for the benefit of the person who was carrying on the business. Plaintiff was not asking Clonin to guaranty that Dreyer would pay. He was asking pay for the goods if he shipped them, and the engagement of Clonin was not a guaranty that Dreyer would pay. Defendant does not so contend. It was a promise upon his part that he would pay. His order was absolute to send the goods, and it is clear that he understood that he was to pay. It was the amount of the bill that defendant disputed, not the fact that he was to pay for what he ordered. Upon the strength of this promise and order plaintiff shipped the goods. The jury would be authorized, therefore, to find that the engagement of the defendant was primary and personal to pay the purchase price of the goods. \u2019 Fitzgerald v. Tiffany, 9 Mise. Rep. 408, 30 N. Y. Supp. 195, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">We find no difficulty in sustaining this recovery upon this branch of the case. This is the only ground seriously argued for a reversal of the judgment. But we may not overlook the error which palpably appears upon the record, and which must result in the ordering of a new trial. The action was originally commenced in a justice\u2019s court The summons which was issued by the justice is against \u201cJames E. Clonin, as Assignee of Herman Dreyer.\u201d The return of the justice is entitled against \u201cJames E. Clonin, as Assignee for the Benefit of Creditors of Herman Dreyer.\u201d The complaint was oral, for goods sold and delivered, and the answer was a general denial. Nothing appears in the return to show how the parties were designated in the complaint and answer, as the terms \u201cplaintiff\u201d and \u201cdefendant\u201d are not recited to have been used therein, and no other designation appears except in the title. A bill of particulars was demanded and furnished, which is entitled \u201cB. H. Roozen against James E. Clonin.\u201d All the other papers are entitled as being against the defendant \u201cas assignee for the benefit of creditors of Herman Dreyer,\u201d and the judgment is in terms against the defendant \u201cas assignee for the benefit of creditors of Herman Dreyer.\u201d Shortly after the trial began, and when some testimony had been taken, the defendant moved. to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that the assignee only guarantied the payment of the goods, which he, as assignee, had no power to do. The motion was denied, and defendant excepted. The case was tried and submitted to the jury upon the theory that defendant was assignee for the benefit of creditors, and that the action was brought against him in his representative capacity, and that judgment might pass against him in that form. The questions submitted were whether he made an original promise to pay for the goods, or only guarantied to pay, and also whether he in fact purchased the goods which were sent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The court was asked to charge \u201cthat an assignee, in such a capacity, has no power to give a guaranty.\u201d This was refused, and defendant excepted. The case, as entitled' in the summons, was clearly not in a representative capacity. The words \u201cas assignee of Herman Dreyer\u201d are merely descriptio personae. \u2022 Merritt v. Seaman, 6 N, Y. 168; Litchfield v. Flint, 104 N. Y. 543, 11 N. E. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The complaint does not show that the action was brought against Olonin in a representative capacity, while the bill of particulars shows that it was against him individually. The proof given upon the trial does not support a cause of action against him in a representative capacity. It is Clonin\u2019s personal liability, or nothing. The confusion arises out of the fact that he was assignee, and that the goods sold were of the kind which he held as assignee. But the promise to pay, if he made it, was not in a representative capacity. It was personal upon his part, and the jury would be so authorized to find. True, he says that what he did he did as assignee. But this is not conclusive, as a legal construction of what he did, or in what capacity he acted. As assignee he could not bind the assigned estate by an executory contract having no relation to the obligations of the assignor. Schmittler v. Simon, 101 N. Y. 554, 5 N. E. 452. But this fact does not prevent his incurring a personal liability where another has acted upon the faith of his promise and parted with value. Rogers v. Wendell, 7 N. Y. Supp. 781, and 8 N. Y. Supp. 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The court was asked to dismiss the complaint, and also to charge that he could not create liability against the estate by guarantying the payment of the goods. If the action be treated as against the defendant in a representative capacity, then the motion should have been granted, and the charge made. The record, as we have seen, does not clearly disclose in just what capacity the defendant is sued. But the theory of the trial, and the judgment entered upon the verdict rendered, clearly show that it was treated as being in a representative capacity. This was error, for which the judgment must be reversed. Although we reach this result, the plaintiff is not left remediless. It is still open to him to apply in the county court to amend the proceedings by striking out the representative capacity of the defendant, and leaving it to stand as an action against the defendant personally. This will make the subsequent proceedings correspond to the summons as originally issued, and there is no reason to think that, upon a proper application, relief will be denied to him in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event, and with leave to plaintiff to move to amend in the county court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
