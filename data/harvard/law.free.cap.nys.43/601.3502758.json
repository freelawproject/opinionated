Judgment may be entered accordingly.\u201d When it was made does not appear. There was a trial of issues of fact by the court, and its decision is not in compliance with section 1022, Code Civ. Proc., and no question is brought before this court for review by an appeal from the judgment entered on this decision. Wood v. Lary, 124 N. Y. 83, 26 N. E. 338; Benjamin v. Allen, 7 Civ. Proc. R. 202. This decision does not \u201cstate separately the facts found and the conclusions of law,\u201d nor does it state \u201cconcisely the grounds upon which the issues have been decided.\u201d The motion should be dismissed, but, as no motion has been made for that relief, without costs to either party. Either party has leave to apply at special term for such relief as will enable a proper decision to be filed and judgment entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
