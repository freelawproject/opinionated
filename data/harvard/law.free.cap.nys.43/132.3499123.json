Parol evidence was therefore proper to give the court such an understanding of the situation as would enable it to understand the contract. The evidence given by the plaintiff was to the effect that the plaintiff had a cargo of potatoes upon the canal boat Quebec, lying at pier 6, East river; that the defendant proposed to buy 1,169 barrels of the potatoes at $1.50 per barrel, if plaintiff would deliver them at Blackwell\u2019s Island. The plaintiff owned no interest in the boat. [The plaintiff said to the defendant that Blackwell\u2019s Island was a hazardous place to take the boat to. The defendant said it was perfectly safe. The plaintiff said, \u201cIf it is, you will not have any objection to guarantying that I would not sustain any loss to my boat or cargo in going there.\u201d To which defendant said that he was willing to stand between the plaintiff and any loss he might sustain by taking the boat there]; and then this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>contract was entered into. The boat was taken to Blackwell\u2019s Island, the 1,169 barrels of potatoes delivered to defendant there, but the boat was sunk by ice and heavy waves while at the island, and the unsold part of the cargo damaged. With this explanation of the situation, it is possible that the words, \u201cDe Witt guaranties to return the boat without damage,\u201d meant damage to boat and cargo. The evidence in brackets was afterwards stricken out by the court upon the motion of the defendant. Such evidence does not vary or change the contract, but helps us to understand it. Where an ambiguity in a written contract is raised by extrinsic evidence, extrinsic evidence is admissible to solve it. Bowman v. Insurance Co., 59 <em>N. </em>Y. 521; Streppone v. Lennon, 143 N. Y. 626, 37 N. E. 638; Tilden v. Tilden, 8 App. Div. 99, 40 N. Y. Supp. 403. The court therefore erred in striking out the evidence of the conversation between the parties as to the damage to be guarantied against. Unless the guaranty covered the cargo, it was of no value to the plaintiff, and, under the circumstances, the parties may have intended the word \u201cdamage\u201d to apply to the cargo. The court should give the language the meaning in which the parties used it, especially when it is such as the language itself might bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">After the contract was made, and before the boat was taken to-Blackwell\u2019s Island, the defendant said to the plaintiff that he was in a hurry to have the potatoes delivered. The plaintiff said he did not want to take the boat there, without first having it insured. The defendant answered: 3 \u201cThere is no necessity of anything of that kind. It is a perfectly safe place, and I stand between you and any harm in going there, or any loss you may sustain in going there.\u201d This evidence was competent to show the practical construction which the defendant placed upon the contract, and upon which it might be found that the plaintiff relied in going to Blackwell\u2019s Island, without first securing the insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
