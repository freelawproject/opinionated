Proc. \u00a7 543, providing that when a pleading is amended under section 542, permitting amendments as of course, a copy must be served on the attorney for the adverse party, and section 727 providing that no pleading shall be altered without an order of court except where parties are authorized to amend as of course.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b366-11\">2.

The complaint made no personal claim against the appellant. She consulted counsel, and, acting upon his advice, did not appear or defend, but made default. The amended complaint was served upon her April 18, 1896. This contained a personal claim, and demanded judgment for deficiency. Not understanding that the amended complaint changed the situation, the appellant paid no attention to it. She had no actual notice of the provision in (He judgment for the deficiency till the day of sale. The sale resulted in a deficiency. The appellant makes an affidavit of merits.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b366-13\">Appeal from special term, Washington county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-14\">Action by Hannah A.

The appellant had no attorney. The amended complaint was not served until about six weeks after the service of the original complaint, and therefore was not within the time permitted by section 543. Where the defendant has no attorney, there is no authority for serving an amended pleading upon him, except by order of the court, under section 727. The appellant, under the circumstances, did not waive the irregularity of service by failing to return the amended complaint. As the service upon her was not authorized, she should not be prejudiced by it, in the absence of facts in the nature of an estoppel. We see no occasion to set aside the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">So much of the order as denies the motion to set aside the service of the amended complaint, and to strike out the judgment for deficiency, is reversed, with \u00a710 costs and disbursements, and the motion in these respects is granted. The order is affirmed in other respects. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
