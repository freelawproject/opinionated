Such examination having taken place before the court, and in the presence of the court, the presiding justice adjudged said judgment debtor guilty of contempt, and ordered him to pay to the clerk of the city court of New York a fine of $200 \u201cfor the indemnity and for the use of the said Charles Falkenberg, the judgment creditor herein, or, in default thereof, that the said Nathan Frank aforesaid shall be imprisoned in the common jail of the city and county of New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>for the period of thirty days.\u201d This order is recited in the warrant or commitment contained in the appeal book, but the appeal book does not show that an order in writing was ever made and entered in that respect, nor that such an order was ever served on the judgment debtor. A commitment was then issued by the court to the sheriff of New York county, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-5\">\u201cNow, therefore, you are required and commanded, and we do warrant and enjoin you, that you forthwith attach the said Nathan Frank, the judgment debtor herein, and commit him to the common jail of the city and county of New York, and detain him there for the term of thirty days, as a punishment for the said contempt of the city court of New York, unless he shall pay the sum of two hundred dollars, fine imposed on him as aforesaid; and for such arrest and imprisonment and detention this shall be your warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">The examinations of said judgment debtor and of his wife, the witness, were had pursuant to the order in supplementary proceedings, and, although uncompleted, constitute a part of the record of the court had in that proceeding, and should therefore be tiled as a record of the court. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 825; Fiske v. Twigg, 5 Civ. Proc. E. 41. There is no doubt that the said judgment debtor has been guilty of the contempt adjudged of, and that the warrant of commitment recites all the jurisdictional facts, and the causes of the delinquent\u2019s guilt. But the vice lies in the form of the order of commitment, in that it is made in the alternative, or rather upon a condition, namely, to pay a tine of $200, or, in default thereof, he be imprisoned. No formal order having been made, or served upon the judgment debtor, requiring him to pay said fine, or, in default thereof, to be committed to prison, and the commitment being granted in these alternative requirements, it was left to the executing officer, the sheriff, to exercise his judg-' ment; and upon a demand of the judgment debtor of said' tine of $200, and noncompliance therewith, he was allowed\u2019 at once to take the judgment debtor in custody, and commit him to the jail. Such a practice is not tolerated by our administration of justice.' The true rule of practice in such a proceeding is that an order should have first been made and entered, and served upon the judgment \u25a0debtor, and after he had failed to comply with the condition therein provided for, upon due proof of his failure to comply therewith, an absolute and final order should have been made, adjudging him guilty of the contempt absolutely, and issuing a commitment accordingly for his punishment. Bank v. Fitzpatrick, 80 Hun, 77, 30 N. Y. Supp. 15; Brinkley v. Brinkley, 47 N. Y. 46; Rice v. Ehele, 55 N. Y. 521. This not having been done, it follows that the order appealed from must be reversed, and the motion granted, with $10 costs, and the costs and disbursements of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">VAN WYCK, C.
