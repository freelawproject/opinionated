Proc. \u00a7 1209, provides that a final judgment dismissing the complaint does not prevent a new action unless it appears by the judgment roll that it was rendered \u201con the merits.\"</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-18\">In the year 1895 the board of water commissioners of the village of Canandaigua adopted a plan for supplying the village and its inhabitants with water, under the provisions of chapter 181 of the Laws of 1875. The plan contemplated the erection of a power house at the foot of Main street, in said village, near the foot of the lake; the construction of a reservoir on the west side of the lake, about 3,500 feet from the lake, and a pump house on the lake shore, the reservoir and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>pump house being about 3% miles from the power house*, and the transmission of power from the power house to the pump house by electricity, thereby forcing water from the lake to the reservoir, to be distributed from that point to and through the village by gravity pressure, through mains and pipes. The pole line extends upon the lands of several different owners, covered by the highway; and they severally conveyed the required easement to the village, except the defendant, who declined to receive a money compensation, and demanded the right to the use of water to be conveyed as long as the mains and pole lines should remain. On the 16th of July, 1895, the plaintiff\u2019s petition was prepared, asking that it be adjudged that the public use requires the condemnation of the real property described, and that it be permitted to hold the same for the public use specified, upon making compensation therefor. The petition was presented to a special term. The defendant prepared an answer, which was verified on the 27th of July, 1895. Upon reading the petition and the answer of Benedict, defendant, a reference was made to Abraham Benedict, Esq., \u201cto hear, try, and determine the issues raised by the answer of the defendant Robert M. Benedict herein.\u201d That order was entered on the 23d of August, 1895, in Ontario county. On the 26th of August, 1896, the referee made a report stating several conclusions of law, the fourth of which was as follows: \u201cThat the defendant Benedict is entitled to judgment dismissing the proceedings, with costs, but without prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s right to begin other proceedings, or to apply to the court for such relief as it may be advised.\u201d Upon that report the defendant entered judgment September 3, 1896, from parts of which he has appealed. The judgment, among other things, contains the following language: \u201cOrdered and adjudged that the plaintiff\u2019s proceedings herein be dismissed, without prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s right to begin other proceedings, or apply to the court for such relief as it may be advised, and that the defendant Robert M. Benedict recover of the plaintiff, village of Canandaigua, the sum of two hundred and seventy-six dollars and twenty cents, his costs and disbursements herein.\u201d</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b654-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Appeal from judgment on report of referee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-17\">Action by the village of Canandaigua, by Charles F.

Town of Greenwich (Sup.) 15 N. Y. Supp. 743; Stokes v. Railroad Co., 89 Hun, 2, 34 N. Y. Supp. 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">Chapter 95 of the Laws of 1890 is entitled \u201cAn act to amend the Code of Civil Procedure,\u201d and is known as \u201cChapter 23\u201d of that Code, and the first section of the chapter provides, viz. \u201cThis title shall be known as the condemnation law;\u201d and it contains 28 sections, and took effect May 1, 1890. In Railroad Co. v. Hammond, 77 Hun, 41, 28 N. Y. Supp. 454, it was said, viz.; \u201cA complete system of practice in condemnation proceedings is provided by chapter 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d In Re Trustees of New York and Brooklyn Bridge, 137 N. Y. 97, 32 N. E. 1054, that chapter was assumed to be a revision of the condemnation law; and those cases were approved and followed in City of Syracuse v. Stacey, 86 Hun, 450, 33 N. Y. Supp. 929. In section 3367 of the Code of Civil Procedure, provision is made for the trial of any issue raised by a peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>ti'on and answer, by the court, or before a referee; and it is provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">\u201cUpon such trial the court or referee shall file a decision in writing, or deliver the same to the attorney for the prevailing party, within twenty days after the final submission of the proofs and allegations of the parties, and the provisions of this act relating to the form and contents of decisions upon the trial of. issues of fact by the court or a referee, and to making and filing exceptions thereto, and making and settlement of a case for the review thereof upon appeal, and to proceedings which may be had, in case such decision is not filed or delivered within the time herein required, and to the powers of the court and referee upon such trial, shall be applicable to a trial and decision under this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">As already stated, it appears in the record now before us that the decision of the referee, and the judgment entered thereupon, were not upon the merits. Upon the contrary, the decision of the referee dismissing the proceedings is stated to be \u201cwithout prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s right to begin other proceedings,\u201d and in the judgment it is stated that the proceedings are dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice to the. plaintiff\u2019s right to begin other proceedings.\u201d Section 1294 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that \u201ca party aggrieved may appeal.\u201d It has been held that only the party who is aggrieved by the judgment can reverse it, and that the party in whose favor a judgment is given cannot be aggrieved by it.
