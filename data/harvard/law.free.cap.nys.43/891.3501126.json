The defendant is the owner of an hotel in the city of New York, known as the \u201cHotel Beresford,\u201d into which a Buffalo firm was putting a refrigerating plant. The plaintiff\u2019s employer, one Craig, a carpenter, sent him to the building upon the day in question, in order to do certain work in and about the elevator shaft of the hotel, which work was incident to the putting in of the refrigerating plant. He made an arrangement with the defendant\u2019s elevator man, whereby he was permitted to get upon the top of the elevator, and the latter notified him when he was about to move it up or down. The elevator man neglected to so notify him upon one occasion, and the sudden starting of the elevator caused the injuries for which the plaintiff seeks to recover.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b915-8\">Appeal from trial term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b915-9\">Action by Maurice P.

The defendant was not notified of the arrangement made between the plaintiff and Paxter, nor was it shown that he was aware of the use to which the elevator was being put under that arrangement. There was, in fact, no proof that he ever assented, expressly or impliedly, to that use. The question, then, is, was that use within the scope of Paxter\u2019s authority? We think not. Paxter was the defendant\u2019s servant to operate the elevator for the service of the hotel and its guests. Whatever was necessary or proper for that service was within his authority. But there his authority ceased. It was limited to the appropriate use. He was not authorized to depart from his defined function, nor to operate the elevator in a direction foreign to its proper purpose. Here he permitted the plaintiff to utilize this elevator as a species of scaffold upon which to do his work. This work was not done under the defendant\u2019s direction. It was work which the plaintiff did, primarily, for one Craig, a carpenter, and it was incident to the putting into the hotel of a refrigerating machine by a firm in Buffalo. The elevator was not placed where it was, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>was it intended to be used, for any such purpose as that to which it was here applied. Baxter\u2019s act in permitting that use was entirely outside the scope of his employment as elevator man of the hotel. He thus diverted the elevator from its normal and legitimate use, and put it to a use which was not contemplated either in its construction or operation, or in his employment with regard thereto. It follows that Baxter\u2019s negligence was his own, and not the defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The judgment and order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
