Striker paid an assessment for the opening of Twelfth avenue. Laws 1895, c. 442, authorized the comptroller to refund all assessments for that improvement. Relator claimed under an assignment of the right of James A. Striker to the refund, executed October 31, 1887, by one Van Auken as attorney in fact, and produced a power of attorney from Striker to Van Auken dated October 13, 1887. Relator conceded the claim of Blsworth L. Striker to one-half the refund. James A. Striker claimed the refund, making affidavit that he had never given the power of attorney, or authorized the assignment, and had received no consideration therefor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b466-10\">Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-11\">Application by Anthony Gross, as assignee \u201eof James A.

The city concedes the possession of a sum of money which the relator claims as assignee of one James A. Striker. This same sum of money, however, is claimed by said Striker (he claiming that the assignment by his attorney to the relator was invalid), and also by one Elsworth L. Striker. It is perfectly apparent that there is here presented a serious dispute between different claimants for the same fund, and we do not think that, upon this proceeding, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>relator has shown such a clear legal right to the money in the hands of the comptroller as would justify a peremptory writ of mandamus. We think the proper course would be for an action to be brought for the money, in which the claims could be inter-pleaded, and the money paid into court, where, upon the trial, such, a judgment could be entered as would protect all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The order appealed from should, therefore, be reversed, with costs and disbursements, and the application denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
