The items of the account were disputed by the defendant, and upon this point the evidence of the parties was in conflict. This condition presented a disputed question of fact for the referee\u2019s determination, and his decision thereon is conclusive upon this court. The main reliance of the defendant upon this appeal is that the books containing the account were improperly admitted in evidence. The coal, which furnished the bulk of the bill, was weighed at the scales by plaintiff, and the quantity entered upon a slip of paper at the time. Subsequently the item was transcribed by plaintiff\u2019s wife, under his direction, into the book kept by Mm. Plaintiff and his wife both testified that the items thus entered were correctly entered, and correctly represented the transaction. There was also some testimony independent of the plaintiff\u2019s to show that in fact coal was delivered by the plaintiff to th\u00e9 defendant, and that some was delivered is undisputed by the defendant. The relation sustained by plaintiff\u2019s wife to the transaction did not constitute her a clerk, within the rule established by the decisions. Atwood v. Barney, 80 Hun, 1, 29 N. Y. Supp. 810; Taggart v. Fox, 11 Daly, 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">The defendant\u2019s main contention, however, is that no foundation was laid for the admission of the books in evidence, as there was no competent testimony to show that the plaintiff kept fair and honest accounts by any persons who had settled with him. The plaintiff called two witnesses upon this subject. Mr. Havens testified that he had settled with the plaintiff by his books yearly for eight or ten years; had always found the books correct, to the best of his knowledge. On cross-examination he testified to the extent of his dealings, and stated that the only reason he knew the accounts were correct was because he had confidence in plaintiff, and paid what he asked. Being re-examined, he said he remembered what he ordered, and paid for what he believed was right; but that he relied upon Ms honesty, and not witness\u2019 recollection. Mr. Hallo ck testified that he had dealt with the plaintiff, bought coal upon credit, and settled with him according to his books and according to his own four or five times, and always found them correct. It appeared on cross-examination that tMs witness was bookkeeper for the firm of Bishop &amp; Hallo ck, the junior member of the firm being the father of the witness; that Ms father ordered most of the goods charged, and that the account was not against the witness personally. We tMnk the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>latter was competent to testify upon the subject. While the charge was not against the witness personally, yet he had knowledge of some of the items, and kept an account. The settlement was made from plaintiff\u2019s books and books kept by the witness, as we infer, of the same transaction. The testimony, therefore, bore directly upon the subject of the correctness of the plaintiff\u2019s books, and witness\u2019 knowledge related to them, although the account was against another party. We think that, in principle, the present case is brought within McGoIdrick v. Traphagen, 88 3ST. Y. 334, and that the testimony in this respect was sufficient to authorize the reception of the books in evidence. This case is clearly distinguishable from Beatty v. Clark, 44 Hun, 126. In that case neither witness saw the books or settled therefrom. The bills which were used in one case were not shown to have been copies from the books, and there was no evidence that the party kept correct books. Respecting any inaccuracies which were shown to have existed in the plaintiff\u2019s account, appearing in the books, it did not show conclusive reasons for the rejection of the books. That matter became a question for the referee to determine to what extent he would regard the claim as established by the books. This related to the weight of the testimony, not its competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">We have examined the other questions raised by appellant, and find no error or merit therein. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
