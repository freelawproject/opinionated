It required a statute to make the owner of a dog not known to him to be vicious liable for killing or wounding sheep. Auchmuty v. Ham, 1 Denio, 495. But if a dog become vicious, then he is a nuisance, and as soon as his master has notice of his vicious propensity he lets him rove at his peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">But it is now held that a dog is property and the subject of larceny. Mullaly v. People, 86 N. Y. 365. Hence it is contended that the owner\u2019s liability for his dog\u2019s trespass upon another\u2019s land is like that of his sheep, cattle, poultry, or other animals, in which the law gives him property. But such animals, when roving at large, are apt to- do damage to the premises they invade, and hence it is the duty of the owner to restrain them from entering upon another\u2019s premises. But dogs are not apt to do such damage. It would be strange, indeed, if the master should be liable for trespass every time his dog or cat set foot upon another\u2019s premises. In Brice v. Bauer, 22 Wkly. Dig. 273, the court held that, where defendant\u2019s dog entered upon plaintiff\u2019s premises, and bit the plaintiff, the defendant was liable, because the dog was a trespasser upon plaintiff\u2019s land, although the defendant did not know/the dog to be vicious. The court of appeals (108 N. Y. 428, 15 N. \u00c9. 695) affirmed the judgment upon the ground that the record showed that the defendant did know the dog to be vicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">But if the same rule should apply to dogs as to horses and cattle and other animals because of their property value, the action must be for breaking and entering the plaintiff\u2019s close, and the particular mischief, sudh as killing another animal, must be alleged in aggravation of damages. Van Leuven v. Lyke, 1 N. Y. 515. Here the plaintiff did not own the premises. He had the right to be upon them as the child of his father, and under his protection. The plaintiff, therefore, has no substantive cause of action to which to annex the aggravation of damages caused by the bite of the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The judgment is reversed, and new trial granted, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
