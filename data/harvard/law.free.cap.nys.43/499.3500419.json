The action was one for negligence. On the trial the plaintiff recovered a verdict for $300. On appeal, the general term of this court affirmed the judgment. 40 N. Y. Supp. 362. On appeal to the supreme court, the appellate term reversed \u2022 the judgment, and ordered a new trial, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. 40 N. Y. Supp. 1131. The plaintiff, before the trial, duly obtained an order granting leave to sue in forma pauperis, which order has ever since been in force. The reversal was on the ground that the specific acts of negligence alleged in the complaint were not proved on the trial, and therefore it was error to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, made at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and again at the close of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">On the motion to amend the complaint at the special term, the judge had the undoubted right to impose terms on the plaintiff, notwithstanding the order permitting him to sue in forma pauperis. Moore v. Cooley, 2 Hill, 412; Elwin v. Bouth, 1 Civ. Proc. B. 131. The amount to be imposed would seem to be settled by the case of Walton v. Mather, 10 Misc. Rep. 261, 24 N. Y. Supp. 307, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The appellant urges with a good deal of force and apparent consistency that the orders appealed from practically operate as a denial of justice, insomuch as the cost taxed under the order of October 12, 1896, and wMch was to be deducted from any judgment the plaintiff might recover on the trial, was $40 more than the recovery had at the former trial. The appellate term reversed the trial term and the general term, with costs against the plaintiff, who was protected by a pauper order, to abide the event; and the event occurred when the plaintiff served a new complaint, setting up a new cause of action, thereby in effect abandoning the original complaint. We have looked for some way to relieve the plaintiff from what seems to be a hardsMp, but the opinion of the court above awarding costs leaves nothing for us to do but to affirm the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Order affirmed, with coste.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">McCARTHY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
