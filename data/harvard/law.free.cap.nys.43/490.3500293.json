Proc. \u00a7 3228, subd. 2, providing that in replevin, if the value of the chattel recovered, \u201cas fixed,\u201d together with damages, is less than $50, the amount of plaintiff\u2019s costs cannot exceed the amount of value and damages. The value of the chattel may be shown by affidavit, where the jury failed to fix it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-10\">Plaintiff commenced an action in replevin, and took the goods. The jury awarded possession to it, and fixed the damages at $25, but did not fix the value. Plaintiff presented a bill of costs for $115.91. Defendant objected to its taxation at that amount on the ground that under section 3228 of the Code, subd. 2, no more than $25 could be taxed. Plaintiff moved for a new taxation. Its motion was denied. On motion for reargument, which was granted, the justice reversed his former decision, and on the authority of Claflin v. Davidson, 53 N. Y. Super. Ct. 122, directed the clerk to retax on proof as to value in the form of affidavits. A retaxation was had, and plaintiff presented an affidavit that the value was $100, and the full bill of costs was taxed. This appeal is taken from the order directing a retaxation.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b514-8\">Appeal from special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-9\">Action by the Rapid Safety Filter Company of New York against Sarah J.
