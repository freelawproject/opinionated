'While an admission is the weakest kind of evidence, it is nevertheless sufficient to charge the party making it. The claim in this case is made by a livery stable keeper for damages to a hearse, the glass door of which was broken by the pole of a coach alleged to belong to defendant, and to be in charge of one of his drivers. The driver gave defendant\u2019s address as that of his employer, and when the latter was called upon by the plaintiff\u2019s manager with a bill for the damage he said he would give it to his driver to pay. This was denied by the defendant, but the justice, who had the witnesses before him, decided the conflict in favor of plaintiff. The admission was sufficient to sustain an inference that the driver who did the damage was in defendant\u2019s employ, and that the accident had been reported to him. The judgment in favor of the plaintiff therefore cannot be disturbed. It appears, however, that while the damages proved were only $3.50, a judgment for $8 was rendered. It must be modified and reduced to the former amount, and, as so modified, will be affirmed, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
