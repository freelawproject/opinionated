He makes two points upon this appeal: First, that the indictment failed to charge a crime; and, second, that the trial judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury upon a crucial question. The particular objection which he makes to the indictment is that it fails to state the obscene matter, but merely gives the pleader\u2019s conclusions therefrom. The indictment, however, states the name of the book, and excuses a statement of the obscene matter by distinctly averring that the book is so obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, indecent, and disgusting that the same would be offensive to the court, and improper to be placed upon the records thereof. \u2018Wherefore,\u201d it is added, \u201cthe grand jury aforesaid to not set forth the same in this indictment.\u201d The current of authority in this country favors an exception to the general rule of pleading in this class of offenses. It may now fairly be said to be the settled American rule that it is not necessary to set out matter in an indictment which the grand jury asserts to- be too obscene for recital. It is only necessary to identify the \u00f3bscene book or publication sufficiently to apprise the defendant of what particular book or publication is intended, and to aver its obscenity, giving as an excuse for not setting forth the obscene matter that it is so gross as to be offensive to the court, and improper to be placed upon its records. 1 Bish.

A rigid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>adherence, in such cases, to the ordinary rule that it must appear upon the face of the indictment that the printed matter was of the character charged, would, as was said in Com. v. Holmes, supra, \u201crequire that the public itself should give permanency and notoriety to indecency in order to punish it.\u201d Courts will not allow their records to be polluted by obscene matter. \u201cTo do this,\u201d observed the court in People v. Girardin, supra, \u201cwould be to require a court of justice to perpetuate and give notoriety to an indecent publication before its author could be visited for the great wrong he may have done to the public or to individuals.\u201d By the American doctrine and practice on this head, as Mr. Bishop points out, the avoiding of obscene allegation in the record, breeding corruption, is a necessity, excusing the setting out of the words. It is claimed, however, that the obscene matter should have been described, at least in general terms. The answer to this is that, if the matter is too\" obscene to be set out, it is also too obscene to be properly described. An accurate description of obscene matter, however general, would itself be obscene. Nothing would be gained by condensation. How, indeed, can obscenity be condensed so as to be descriptive, and yet sufficiently decent to be placed upon record? We refer now to such a description as would enable the court, upon the face of the indictment, to determine whether the book or publication is, in fact, obscene. Any merely general description would not be a description at all; that is, of the obscene words or matter. A mere description, for instance, of the subject-matter,\u2014of what, in general, the book is about,\u2014would, not be a description of the actual obscenity charged. It would not apprise the defendant of the particular facts upon which the charge is based. It would simply be a means of identifying the book or publication, and that is as well, if not better, effected by stating its title. In none of the cases which have been referred to, with the possible exception of Com. v. Sharpless, \u2018did the indictment contain a description, either minute or general, of the nature of the obscenity, and in none of them was a descriptive statement of the obscene matter required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">The rule to which we have referred is not in conflict with that laid down in People v. Hallenbeck, 52 How. Prac. 502, and People v. Danihy, 63 Hun, 579, 18 N. Y. Supp. 467. In neither of these cases was the omission of the obscene matter excused by the statement, in the indictment itself, that it was too gross to be placed upon record. We agree that, where this excuse is not made by the grand jury upon the face of the indictment, the obscene matter must be set out. Where, however, that excuse is thus made, we think the general rule should be modified in the interest of public decency; and the defendant must then be satisfied with such descriptive allegations as clearly identify the book or publication intended, together with the statement that the obscene matter which the grand jury deem too foul to be spread upon the record is contained therein. If anything more is requisite for the protection of the defendant\u2019s rights, it may well be left to the discretion of the court to compel the public prosecutor to furnish such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>further information or specification as may be needful. We think, therefore, that the indictment here was sufficient. We may add that it is quite evident that the defendant was not, as matter of fact, prejudiced by any omission therein. He did not demur thereto. Upon the trial he conceded that the book in question was obscene, and that he purchased it for, and delivered it to, the prosecuting witness, Joel. Upon this very appeal, too, he stipulated that the book should not be printed, nor made part of the record, for the reason that it was \u201cconcededly obscene.\u201d We think the motion to acquit upon this point, and the motion in arrest of judgment, were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">We have, however, reached a different conclusion as to the defendant\u2019s second point. The sole question presented to the jury was whether or not the defendant sold the book. Joel testified to the sale as alleged. The defendant denied it, and testified that he purchased the book for Joel. This was th\u00e9 crucial question,\u2014 was it a sale or a purchase? If \u00e1 sale, the defendant was guilty; if a purchase, he was not. The learned trial judge left it to the jury to say whether there was or was not a sale. He pointed out to them very clearly the testimony upon which the prosecution rested; but the only reference which he made to the defendant\u2019s testimony was that he (the defendant) had the book, delivered it to the person who went to his shop to purchase (Joel), and received a dollar from that person for it. He \"omitted to refer to the defendant\u2019s statement that Joel gave him the dollar to go out and purchase the book. This omission is quite significant, in view of what occurred when the learned judge closed his charge. The following colloquy was then had:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-6\">\u201cThe Third Juror: If the defendant sold that book merely as an agent, should we convict? The Court: Certainly; if he sold it under any circumstances. The Third Juror: If he took the dollar, and made no profit? The Court: It is not necessary for a profit to have been made. If he sold it in any way. Defendant\u2019s Counsel: Do I understand your honor to say, if the defendant merely got it for the complainant? The Court: But he sold it. Defendant\u2019s Counsel: If he merely got it for him? The Court: Where is the man from whom he got it? Defendant\u2019s Counsel: We have been asked that question, and we don\u2019t know. The Court (continuing): We ask the defendant, and he does not know. Defendant\u2019s Counsel: He does not know; therefore he cannot be produced. The Court: If he sold the book, and got a dollar for it, it is a violation of the law. If you, gentlemen of the jury, come to \"the conclusion -he did not, then the defendant should be acquitted. Defendant\u2019s Counsel: I ask your honor to charge the jury that if this defendant obtained this book, and parted with it in the manner testified,\u2014 if the jury believe that the defendant received a dollar from this man Joel to get the book, then that is not a sale. The Court: Except as I have already charged, I decline to charge upon the subject. Defendant\u2019s Counsel: We except. The jury then retired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">It is apparent from all this that, after hearing the learned judge\u2019s charge, the third juror was still in doubt as to the precise issue to be passed upon by the jury. It is equally apparent that the learned judge, inadvertently, of course, made an observation\u2014\u201cBut he sold it\u201d\u2014which, if taken seriously by the jury, would have probably concluded the question that they were called upon to consider. The defendant\u2019s counsel sought to neutralize the effect of that observation by presenting the defendant\u2019s contention interrogatively. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>The learned judge, however, parried the counsel\u2019s interrogation as to the law by some pointed observations upon the facts. The conclusion of it all left the defendant without much hope; that is, unless the learned judge should assent unreservedly to the final proposition which he was asked to charge. We think, under the circumstances, that the defendant was entitled to have that proposition specifically charged. After what had occurred, a clear statement of the precise issue, and of the effect thereon of crediting the defendant\u2019s story, was the least that the defendant had a right to expect. It will not do to say that the proposition in question had already been charged. What the learned judge had already charged and all that he had so charged, was that, if the defendant sold the book, he was guilty, and if he did not he was innocent. But the defendant had a right to an instruction that his own testimony, which had seemingly been treated as valueless, was sufficient, if credited, to establish that there had been no sale. From the confusion which must have resulted from the previous colloquy, the jury could only have been relieved by the clear statement that procuring the book in the manner testified to by the defendant was not a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">We are constrained, therefore, for this error, to reverse the judgment and order a new trial. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
