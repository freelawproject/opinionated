The trial and appeal in the court below having resulted favorably to the plaintiff, the defendant contends that, because the contract was made abroad, and the plaintiff resided in the city of Brooklyn, the city court, being a local court, having no power to send original process out of the county, had no jurisdiction of the action. There is no statute so circumscribing the jurisdiction of the city court. Section 315 of the Code expressly confers jurisdiction upon that court in an action against a foreign or domestic corporation, and the only limitation on the power thus given (so far as the question raised is concerned) is contained in section 1780, which provides that \u201can action against a foreign corporation may be maintained by a resident of this state * * * for any cause of action.\u201d Under this last provision it was held that the superior court of the city of New York, though a local court, had jurisdiction of an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>by a resident of Brooklyn against a foreign corporation on a cause of action arising without the state (Flynn v. Railroad [Super. Ct. N. Y.] 15 N. Y. Supp. 328); and on appeal from a judgment subsequently recovered in the case cited the court of appeals held that this construction was right (142 N. Y. 439, 37 N. E. 514). Perry v. Transfer Co., 1 Misc. Rep. 208, 20 N. Y. Supp. 891; Id., 4 Misc. Rep. 598, 23 N. Y. Supp. 878; Id. (Com. PL) 19 N. Y. Supp. 239,\u2014is inapplicable, for the plaintiff there was a nonresident of the state. The plaintiff here is a resident of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The objection stated is the only one urged, and, as it is without merit, the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
