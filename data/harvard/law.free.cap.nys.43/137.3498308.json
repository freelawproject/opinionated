On the 4th day of August, 1892, the jury was drawn from the persons summoned, and the parties proceeded to trial. The jury disagreed, and they were thereupon discharged, all parties being present. The record of the justice shows that the parties then consented to an adjournment until August 10, 1892. The plaintiff then stated to the court \u201cthat he waived a trial by jury, and did not call a new jury. The attorney for the defendant then stated that did not demand a jury, but stated that he wanted the case tried according to law. I did not issue a new venire. On the adjourned day, August 10, 1892, the parties appeared as before, and the attorney for the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that the justice had no jurisdiction to try the said cause, for the reason shown in the written motion, made by said attorney, which is hereto attached. The motion was granted, and judgment was therefore entered against the plaintiff for $11.75.\u201d The written motion which is referred to in the minutes of the justice was filed on the last adjourned day, and in it the defendant demurred to the jurisdiction of the court to further hear and determine the case, upon the grounds, to state them briefly, that, after the jury had failed to agree, \u201cthe court failed to immediately call and draw <em>k </em>new jury, as required by law; second, that the court has failed to draw any jury, since such disagreement, to try the cause; and, third, that, when the jury had disagreed, and was discharged, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney said to the court that he waived a jury, and did not want a jury drawn on his account,\u201d etc. It was insisted, on the part of the defendant, \u201cthat the plaintiff could not waive a jury; that, the plaintiff having called a jury, and such jury having failed to agree, it was the duty of the justice to immediately draw a new jury to try the cause; that the law must take its own course; that he would not agree to dispense with a jury.\u201d</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-5\">Appeal from Ulster county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">Action by George Suitor against Charles Kent, as administrator, substituted in place of Oliver'P.

The justice\u2019s record states the justice\u2019s version of what took place at the time of the disagreement and discharge of the jury and of the agreement to adjourn to the subsequent day. The filing of the written motion, which contains a statement of facts as to what took place before the court at such time, and which is at variance with the justice\u2019s record, cannot be taken, and considered by the court upon appeal, as a correct statement of the facts upon which the appeal is to be heard and decided. Such appeal must be heard upon the record of the justice. If that is not correct, either party has his remedy by moving for a further return. The record, if incorrect, cannot be changed by filing,' upon a motion, a statement containing facts different from those set forth by the justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The fact that the defendant had not previously demanded a jury trial, coupled with the fact that the plaintiff announced that he waived his right of trial by jury, and the statement of the defendant\u2019s attorney that \u201che did not demand a jury,\u201d it seems to me, amply justified the justice in adjourning, without issuing a new venire, to the time agreed upon by the parties, and that thereby he did not lose jurisdiction. If the defendant\u2019s attorney, while stating that- he did not demand a jury, meant to be understood, by his statement \u201cthat he wanted the case tried according to law,\u201d that he thereby did not waive a jury trial, but desired the case to be again submitted to a jury, he should have made his purpose and intent more distinct and clear. Parties desiring to raise objection, or to seek rulings of the court, must make their objections and requests plain and precise, so that there can be no misunderstanding, and neither the court nor their adversaries be misled. In this case both the court and the plaintiff were justified in believing that the defendant did not require a trial by jury, and the defendant, in consenting to an adjournment without a venire for a new jury being issued pursuant to the provisions of the Code, lost all right to object to the jurisdiction of the court to try the case on the adjourned day without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\">The judgments of the county court and of the justice\u2019s court should be reversed, with costs and disbursements of this appeal, and costs and disbursements in the county and justice\u2019s courts. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
