The action was brought to recover upon three promissory notes, two of the said notes being dated June, 1881, and the other dated November, 1881, all of which were payable within four months of their date. It is conceded that these notes were barred by the statute of limitations, the action having been commenced in 1894, but for the effect off the letter before referred to. It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff met the defendant in New York City, a short time prior to the writing of this letter. The plaintiff then said to the defendant: \u201cYou ought to settle up these differences between us represented by those notes, upon which I loaned you money when you were poor.\u201d The defendant said: \u201cThat is so; I ought. I wish you would make up the account, and send it to me. I will come over, and take lunch with you next week, and bring a check, and whatever the difference is I will pay you.\u201d As the defendant did not comply with this promise, the plaintiff wrote him a note on February 19th, saying: \u201cKindly send me a note by bearer, stating when you will come and see me, or whether I shall come and see you; and tell me also, please, whether you will pay me the balance due me on account of the money I have loaned you.\u201d In answer to that letter, the defendant wrote the letter relied on by the plaintiff, in which he says: \u201cNow, Mr. Shaw, I don\u2019t know if I can help you in the matter to look over those old figures together. I would prefer you make yourself a statement of your own. In my opinion, all what I remember is those accounts were settled long ago. If not, I am willing to do so now. Please let me hear from you, and excuse my long silence.\u201d By section 395 of the Code, it is provided that \u201can acknowledgment or promise, contained in a writing signed by the parties to be charged thereby, is the only competent evidence of a new or continuing contract, whereby to take a case out of the operation of this title.\u201d And the question is whether or not this letter contains an acknowledgment or promise, within the meaning of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>There has been much discussion in the reported cases as to just what words will suffice to make an acknowledgment of, or promise to pay, an existing indebtedness sufficient to take a claim out of the statute; and learned judges have commented upon the little assistance that reported cases give in determining the effect of the particular language used. There must be, however, an acknowledgment of a debt or a promise to pay a debt; and, in dealing with each particular case, what has to be ascertained is the intention of the writer of the instrument upon which is based the acknowledgment of the existing liability or the new promise to pay the debt. Was it his intention to acknowledge that an obligation or debt existed, or was it his intention to promise to pay a demand made upon him? The writing must show that it was the intention of the writer to either acknowledge the debt, \"or promise to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">As was said by Judge Spencer in Sands v. G-elston, 15 Johns. 519:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">\u201cCourts of law seem to have been convinced that the construction which has .sometimes been adopted to get rid of the operation of the statute has been carried too far, and hence a disposition has been evinced to put a reasonable interpretation upon the language of the parties,\u2014an interpretation that shall be consonant to the meaning and intention of the speaker,\u201d and that \u201cit would be doing violence to this admission to say that there is evidence from which a promise may be inferred to pay a demand the justice and equity of which, as well as the defendant\u2019s liability to pay it, is utterly denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">It is clear that there is no acknowledgment that, at the time of the writing of the letter, there existed any indebtedness in favor of the plaintiff against this defendant. In answer to a request of the plaintiff\u2019s to know when the defendant would come and see the plaintiff, and whether the defendant would pay to the plaintiff the balance due him on account of the moneys loaned to the defendant, the defendant said that he did not know that he could help in looking over these old figures, and that he would prefer that the plaintiff make a statement of his own. There is certainly nothing here to acknowledge that any indebtedness of the defendant ever did exist, and there follows a statement that, \u201cin my opinion, all what I remember is that these accounts were settled long ago.\u201d The letter to the defendant makes no specific demand for any definite amount, nor for any notes mentioned. A demand for the balance due on account of money loaned is made, and the answer to that, in effect, is that the defendant has some sort of a remembrance that those accounts had been long settled. Is there a new promise to pay what is actually due? The plaintiff claims such a promise is found in the words added, \u201cIf not, I am willing to do so now.\u201d In determining just what this defendant intended when he used these words, we must look to the demand that was made upon him, and to which this letter was a reply. The plaintiff asked defendant whether \u201cyou [the defendant] will pay me [the plaintiff] the balance due me on account of the money I have loaned you.\u201d To that the defendant answered: \u201cSend me a statement of your account. In my opinion, all that I remember is that these accounts were settled long ago. If not, I am willing to do so now.\u201d Taking these two letters together, what was it that this defendant intended to say that he was willing to do now? When, in answer to the plaintiff\u2019s letter asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>for payment, he wrote these words, is it not clear that he intended to say that, if his recollection about the settlement of these accounts was wrong, he would now pay what was due? He meets a demand for a payment of a balance due by a statement of a recollection that the account was settled, and then says, in case it should appear that his recollection is wrong, he would now settle the account. Is it ^possible that this defendant could have intended, when he wrote that letter, to have his compliance with the plaintiff\u2019s demand depend upon anything but the correctness of his recollection that the accounts had been settled? The defendant was called as a witness after this letter was put in evidence. He was not examined about the letter; nor were any facts shown to justify an inference that he did not fully appreciate the demand which was made upon him, or that there was any other intention than that to be inferred from the words used. The utmost that could in justice be claimed by the defendant is that there was a question for the jury as to whether or not the defendant intended to promise to pay whatever should be ascertained to be actually due in case his recollection that the accounts were settled was not correct. But the defendant did not ask that that question be submitted to the jury, and there was no exception to the charge of the court in not allowing the jury to pass upon it. Many cases might be cited tending to sustain this conclusion, but I do not think they would be of material assistance in determining what it was that the defendant intended when he wrote this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The case that is nearest to the case at bar, but which goes further than is necessary to sustain this judgment, is the case of Mosher v. Hubbard, 13 Johns. 510. There the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u201cIn the conversation stated to have taken place between the defendant and Brown, it was not intimated by the defendant that he intended to avail himself of the statute, but the only question in his mind seemed to be whether the order had not been paid, and he promised to examine his papers, and, if he found he had paid the order, he was to write to the witness; but, as the witness testified, he never has written.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">It was held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">\u201cThis was sufficient to raise an implied promise to pay the money, unless, on examination, it should be found that the order had been paid; and there was no evidence whatever of any payment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">What we really have to determine here is what did this defendant intend when he wrote this letter; and we can see no other construction that can be given to the words used except that above indi- . cated. That this was defendant\u2019s intention is corroborated by his reply to the plaintiff\u2019s letter, containing the full statement of his claim. Then defendant merely expressed surprise at the figures, and says that, before he gives an answer, he desires \u201cto look over back for fourteen years all correspondence and memorandums I have got at home,\u201d and then says: \u201cIn the meantime, in plowing my papers through, I will be more able to explain.\u201d Thus, when the items of the plaintiff\u2019s claim were presented to him, there is nothing but a surprise at the figures, with a request for time to look at his letters and memoranda, and an expression of confidence in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>being able to malee an explanation. Considering this correspondence as a whole,, we can come to no other conclusion than that there was here an express promise by defendant that he would pay what was due upon his claim in case his recollection that it had been settled was not correct. As the jury have found by their verdict that defendant\u2019s recollection was not correct, and that there is due from, the defendant to the plaintiff the sum of-$891.02, we think the de-\u00ab fendant is liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
