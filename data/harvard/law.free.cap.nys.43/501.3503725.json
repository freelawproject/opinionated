Kemp against Peter F. Elliott. From so much of an order made in supplementary proceedings as imposes a tine on the judgment debtor for violation of an order against disposing of his property, he appeals; and, from so much of the same order as discharges the application of the judgment creditor for a further fine, he appeals.

The judgment debtor is clearly guilty of a contempt of court in violating the injunction order; and the court, in fixing the amount that the judgment creditor had been damaged by reason of such violation, must have found that the difference between the amount of the fine, $130, and the amount of the judgment, $202.06, was expended for reasonabl\u00e9 and proper necessities, and not, therefore, a violation of the order. We think this is the interpretation the order appealed from should receive; that the same should be affirmed; and no costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">McCARTHY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
