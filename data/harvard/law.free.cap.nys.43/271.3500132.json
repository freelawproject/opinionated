There is no question that the plaintiff was employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>by one of these parties, either by the defendant or by Dreyfuss, Kohn &amp; Co.; nor is it disputed that he performed the required services, and was entitled to the installment of salary in suit from either one or the other, but the appellant claims that there was a failure of proof to charge it with liability growing out of the contract of employment, and, further, that the preponderance of the evidence was in favor of the defense that Dreyfuss, Kohn <em>&amp; </em>Co. were the parties so contracting. The plaintiff shows that he was engaged by one Rosenheim, the secretary of the defendant, and, by concession of record, its general manager. According to the defendant\u2019s evidence, Rosenheim was also an employ\u00e9 of Dreyfuss, Kohn &amp; Co., and his authority extended to the employment of salesmen on behalf of that firm. Kohn, the defendant\u2019s president, was a member of the firm of Dreyfuss, Kohn &amp; Co., and this firm controlled the sale of the defendant\u2019s entire output of goods, under a commission, as selling agents. It is therefore to be observed that the business relations existing between the defendant corporation and this firm of Dreyfuss, Kohn &amp; Co. were of a very close nature, and that, when it became a question as to whether the firm was acting in a particular matter relating to the sale of the corporation\u2019s goods, either as principal or as agent for the corporation, the distinction to be drawn merely from observation would necessarily be of extreme nicety. To the place of business so conducted the plaintiff came, with the intention of seeking employment by the defendant, and had an interview with Rosenheim, whom at that time he knew only as the secretary of the defendant. In the course of this interview Rpsenheim made no allusion to his connection with Dreyfuss, Kohn &amp; Co., but did advert to his connection with the defendant corporation, and, finally, after some negotiations, agreed with the plaintiff that the latter should be employed as salesman of the defendant\u2019s goods at a stated annual compensation. For his use upon the road, cards were given the plaintiff by Rosenheim, which read, \u201cParagon Silk Company, Manufacturer. Dreyfuss, Kohn &amp; Co., Selling Agents,\u201d and the plaintiff was told by Rosenheim that he might \u201csend orders to the selling agents, Dreyfuss, Kohn &amp; Co.\u201d Accordingly, the plaintiff did send orders, and his personal letters explaining the result of his efforts, to Dreyfuss, Kohn <em>Sc </em>Co., in whose name also he sent advices to the parties placing such orders; and it is this fact, together with the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s salary was paid by the firm\u2019s checks, upon which reliance is placed by the defendant in support of the contention that the employment was recognized to have been on behalf of tire firm. In view of the apparent connection between the corporation and the firm, however, we find nothing in this method of payment strong enough to overcome the situation presented by the plaintiff\u2019s evidence,\u2014his employment by the defendant\u2019s agent, who was reasonably assumed, under the circumstances, to have been acting for no other than the defendant. Rosenheim\u2019s authority to bind the defendant to this contract of employment was conceded; and, since the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract amply justified the plaintiff\u2019s belief that this agent was acting for the defendant, the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>is certainly to be held, rather than that the plaintiff should suffer for the agent\u2019s failure to define the capacity in which he was truly acting, when held out by the defendant as its agent. Not only did Rosenheim fail to enlighten the plaintiff, during the course of his duties, as to the facts now contended for, but there was an apparent concealment of the matter, since all communications to the plaintiff from his supposed employer or employers were signed by Rosenheim individually; and it certainly would seem that, if the plaintiff had actually been engaged by this agent in his capacity as an employ\u00e9 of Dreyfuss, Kohn &amp; Co., rather than as a managing officer of the defendant corporation, express information of the fact would at some time have been given; but Rosenheim himself, when called as a witness, did not dispute the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that no such information had been given. To recapitulate, the plaintiff was justified in his reliance upon the reasonably apparent fact that Rosenheim employed him on behalf of the defendant, and, if there was a mistake as to this, the defendant is chargeable with the result for the failure of its agent to give notice of a fact particularly within his knowledge, and not to be assumed by the plaintiff under the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">A point is made that this installment of salary was not legally due until the end of the year of employment, the agreement not having expressly provided for monthly payments, and that there should, therefore, have been no recovery; but the evidence shows that the plaintiff was discharged at the end of the month in question, without apparent cause, and his right to maintain an action was for this reason obvious. \"While the action was not framed as for the breach of the contract, no point such as is now taken was made upon the trial, and the recovery is supported by the evidence. Apart from this, however, the contract of employment, as practically construed by the parties to it, appears to have been recognized as calling for monthly payments, since this was the method of payment uniformly adopted, and, in the absence of existing terms to the contrary, the justice was well authorized to give weight to the parties\u2019 understanding, and to construe the agreement accordingly. An examination of the exceptions taken by the appellant to rulings upon evidence discloses no prejudicial error; and the judgment, being quite clearly in accord with substantial justice, should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
