The property was taken by the defendant, as sheriff, by virtue of requisitions in two actions\u2014one brought by Milton A. Fowler against John and James Glanfield, and the other by Alonzo and William Covert against the same defendants\u2014to recover the possession of the property in question. Thereupon the plaintiffs in the present action, claiming the right to the possession of the property, delivered to the sheriff, an affidavit as provided by section 1709 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the plaintiffs in those two actions furnished to the sheriff indemnity as provided in the same section.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-19\">The question presented is whether the defendant, upon his motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>may \"be relieved from the defense of the action by substitution of his indemnitors as defendants. The only statute upon the subject is that \u201cthe sureties are entitled to be substituted as defendants in an action brought as prescribed\u201d in section 1710 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \u201cas if the chattel had been levied upon by virtue of an execution.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1711. As the plaintiffs proceeded to assert their claim to the property with a view to have it delivered by the sheriff to them, pursuant to the' statute (Id. \u00a7 1709), and notwithstanding the conflicting affidavits as to the fact whether the property was in the possession of the defendants in the replevin actions at the time it was taken by the sheriff by virtue of the requisitions, it is, for the purpose of the questions on this review, assumed that it was then in the possession of the defendants in those actions, and that this action is one brought as prescribed in such section (1710).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The power of the court to substitute sureties as defendants in an action within that section is dependent upon the statute before referred to, which does not provide that .they may be required to submit to such substitution, but it merely gives them the right to assume that relation to such ah action brought against their principal whom they have undertaken to indemnify. The ultimate liability of the sureties in the event of recovery by the plaintiff in an action where the defendant is so indemnified furnishes some reason why it may be desirable for them nominally and in fact to have the control, as well as the responsibility, of the defense. This, we have seen, is their right. And the plaintiff can make no effectual objection to its exercise. Hein v. Davidson, 96 N. Y. 175. The statute, however, is in contravention of the common law, and will not, by construction, be extended beyond the plain import of its terms. The plaintiff in such case cannot be required, on application of the defendant, to submit to his discharge and the substitution of his sureties as defendants. It is their right alone, and is to be granted by the court (without the consent of the plaintiff) only on motion made by them or in their behalf. It does not appear that the defendant\u2019s indemnitors elected or consented to take substitution. It is true that service of the motion papers was admitted by attorneys who assumed to represent the sureties, but this did not purport their consent; nor does it appear that the sureties even consented that the motion should be granted, and it may be that, so far as they were concerned, no consent on their part was necessary to charge1 them with the effect of an order substituting them as defendants. Dyett v. Hyman, 129 N. Y. 351, 29 N. E. 261. They were not repre-' sented in court upon the hearing of the motion. It apparently was made in behalf of the defendant only, and, being resisted by the plaintiffs, was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In relation to indemnitors of a sheriff on account \"of the levy by him of an execution upon a chattel, it may be observed that the provision of the statute on the subject, as it existed at the time of the adoption of section 1711, was to the effect that the sureties might apply to the court to substitute themselves as defendants in an action brought against the sheriff', and that afterwards, in 1887, the right to have his sureties so substituted was, by amendment of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ute, extended to the officer. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1421. This amendment has no bearing upon the construction o\u00ed the provision of section 1711.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The order should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
