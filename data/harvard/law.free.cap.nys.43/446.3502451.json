Upon the abolition of that court, it was, under the provisions of the constitution, transferred to the supreme court for hearing and determination. Const, art. 6, \u00a7 5. To secure that hearing and determination in an orderly and proper manner, the plaintiff was required, by rule 8 of the rules for the regulation of the special terms in the First judicial district (adopted by this appellate division on the 25th day of November, 1895), to file a note of issue with the clerk of part 3 of the special term at least 20 days before the first Monday of January, 1896. This rule provided that no case should be placed upon the special term calendar, which was then directed to be made up, unless such note of issue were so filed. The plaintiff apparently neglected to comply with this rule. At all events, his action was not placed upon that calendar, and he does not pretend that he filed the required note of issue. He was not remediless, however. The riile made further provision for just such a case. That further provision was that a motion to add to the calendar in question \u201cany cases which have been left off by mistake may be made to the court at part 3 of the special term on the first Monday of each term on two days\u2019 notice to the adverse party.\u201d This rule was applicable, even though the mistake were that of the clerk. The plaintiff did not avail himself of this permission, but simply filed a note of issue for the October special term of 1896. This would have been well enough if he had served a notice of trial for that October term. But he did not do so. He was, therefore, irregular in either aspect of the practice. If he desired to correct the calendar made up for January, 1896, by having his cause added thereto, he should have moved as indicated in the rule. If, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ever, he simply wished to have his cause placed upon the general calendar of the special term independently, he should have served his notice of trial for the term for which he filed his note of issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\">The order appealed from should, therefore, be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to strike the cause from the special term calendar granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
