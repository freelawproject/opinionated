The only question presented for our de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>termination is one relating to the costs awarded by the decision of the general term upon the appeal from the judgment on the first trial. The plaintiffs contend that, having succeeded in the action, they are entitled to tax the costs of the first trial, and insist that the \u201ccosts to the appellant to abide the event\u201d upon the reversal of the judgment on the first trial relate to the costs of the appeal only. It was so held in Howell v. Van Siclen, 8 Hun, 524, affirmed in the court of appeals (70 N. Y. 595); and we would follow the decision in that case were it not for the fact that the court of common pleas, at general term (our appellate tribunal), in Cash-Car Co. v. Reinhardt, 26 N. Y. Supp. 746, have laid down a different rule. It was there held that an order reversing a judgment, and directing a new trial, \u201cwith costs to the appellant to abide the event,\u201d included the costs in the trial court, as well as the costs upon appeal, and, where the respondent prevails on the new trial, the costs mentioned in the order of reversal cannot be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">We are compelled to follow the decision of our appellate court, and, upon authority of the case cited, the order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
