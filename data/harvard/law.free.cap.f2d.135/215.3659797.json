Hayes, 6 Cir., 58 F.2d 34, upon the authority of Prairie State Bank v. United States, 164 U.S. 227, 17 S.Ct. 142, 41 L.Ed. 412, and other cases; and it being also the view of the court that there is no merit to the contention of the First State Bank that it has a set-off against funds on deposit with it at the time of the adjudication in bankruptcy, because such funds were never the property of the contractor: It is ordered that the judgments below, 49 F.Supp. 709, be and they are hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
