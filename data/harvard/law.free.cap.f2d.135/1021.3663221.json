Whitehead, of Washington, D. C., of counsel), for the Commissioner of Patents.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1086-8\">Before GARRETT, Presiding Judge, and BLAND, HATFIELD, LENROOT, and JACKSON, Associate Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1086-9\">GARRETT, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\">This is an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents affirming the decision of the Examiner of TradeMarks denying the application of appellant for registration, under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 81 et seq., of the notation \u201cElmwood Farm\u201d as a trade-mark for \u201cCanned Chicken, Egg Noodles and Chicken, Chicken a La King, Chicken Fricassee, Chicken Shortcake, Sandwich Spread, Chicken Broth, Chicken Soup with Noodles, and Chicken in Glass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">The basis of the rejection is that the term \u201cElmwood,\u201d which was held to be the dominant feature of the mark, is merely a geographical name and hence falls within the inhibition of the language in the second proviso of section 5 of the 1905 TradeMark Act which reads, \u201cThat no mark which consists * * * 0f * * * merely a geographical name or term, shall be registered under the terms of this Act.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-13\">The examiner, after holding \u201cElmwood\u201d to be the dominating feature of the mark, said: \u201cElmwood as a single word is geographical being the name of several towns, one of which is incorporated and located in Hartford County, Connecticut.\u201d And added: \u201cFurther, the word \u2018Farm\u2019 is considered to be publici juris, and has been so construed by this Office. When the word \u2018Farm\u2019 has been presented associated with a geographical term, such marks have been registered under the Act of 1920.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-15\">The finding of fact as to \u201cElmwood\u201d being the name of a number of towns is not disputed by appellant, but it is insisted, first, that the commissioner erred in dissecting the mark \u201cand refusing registration by reason of the alleged geographical character of the word Elmwood,\u201d and, second, \u201cin holding that the word Elmwood is merely geographical within the meaning of the Trade-mark Statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-16\">In his decision the commissioner said, inter alia: \u201cThere are a. few old cases, some of which are cited in the brief, lending support to the argument that the association of an arbitrary term with a geographical word results in a combination which is not \u2018merely geographical, within the meaning of the statute, and that such a mark may be registered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-18\">He then pointed out, quoting from the statute, that geographical words and descriptive words are placed in precisely the same category with respect to registration \u201cso that the question of their registraability is necessarily governed by the same considerations\u201d and cited the decision of this court in the case of In re American Cyanamid &amp; Chemical Corporation, 99 F.2d 964, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 712, as containing \u201ca complete answer to applicant\u2019s argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-19\">In that case the applicant sought to register, under the act of 1905, the notation \u201cGypsteel gypsum Plank\u201d as a trade-mark for reinforced slabs composed of cementitious material. The word \u201cgypsum\u201d was disclaimed in the application but the applicant declined to acquiesce in the requirement that the word \u201cPlank\u201d be disclaimed also. The applicant there not only insisted that \u201cPlank\u201d was not \u201cmerely descriptive,\u201d but that the question of its descriptiveness standing alone was not at issue. In other words, it was contended that in order to fall within the inhibition of the statute it was required that the composite mark taken as a whole must be found to be merely descriptive and that since \u201cGypsteel\u201d was not descriptive (and was the subject of another registration) no such finding was tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-20\">In our decision we cited and reviewed many cases, found, for the reasons stated, that the word \u201cPlank\u201d was descriptive of the applicant\u2019s product and sustained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>action of the commissioner in denying the registration sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\">We agree with the commissioner\u2019s construction of the statute, as stated above, to the effect that geographical words and descriptive marks are in the same category with respect to registrability. This is clear, as appears from the language reading: \u201cThat no mark which consists merely * * * in words or devices which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods, or merely a geographical name or term, shall be registered under the terms of this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">No question relating to disclaimer is involved here, since appellant did not disclaim any part of the mark, but, in view of the character and meaning of the word \u201cFarm,\u201d we agree with the holding of the commissioner to the effect that a disclaimer of that portion of the mark would not affect the situation here because \u201cElmwood\u201d is clearly the dominant part of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">So, the only question is whether the term \u201cElmwood\u201d is merely geographic. Appellant contends that it \u201cclearly has a meaning entirely independent of and predominating over any geographical significance that it may have. The word is obviously a combination of two accepted dictionary words, Elm and Wood, and particularly as used in association with the word Farm, the word Elmwood carries the idea of these constituent words Elm and Wood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">Appellant itself thus dissected the dominant part of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-10\">The commissioner said: \u201cApplicant suggests that \u2018Elmwood\u2019 is not \u2018merely\u2019 geographical, because it is formed by combining the two words \u2018elm\u2019 and \u2018wood,\u2019 and hence means the wood of the elm tree. So far as I am aware, however, the single word is never used in that sense, and possesses none other than a geographical significance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-13\">We agree with the finding so made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-14\">The several cases cited in the brief filed on behalf of appellant have been examined, but we find nothing in them which would, in our opinion, justify a conclusion different from that reached by the commissioner, which is particularly in accord with the reasoning in numerous decisions made during comparatively recent years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-15\">One of the cases referred to in appellant\u2019s brief is that of In re Plymouth Motor Corporation, 46 F.2d 211, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 838, in the decision of which this court indicated that the term \u201cPlymouth\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning which rendered it something more than a \u201cmerely geographic\u201d word. Our grant of the application there, however, did not rest upon that suggestion alone, and in the later case of In re Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Inc., 86 F.2d 830, 24 C.C.P.A., Patents, 804, we overruled the decision in the Plymouth Motor Corp. case, supra, so far as it rested in any part upon the matter of secondary meaning, or was inconsistent with a decision of ours in the case of Barber-Colman Co. v. Overhead Door Corporation, 65 F.2d 147, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-16\">We have deemed it proper to again direct attention to the foregoing decisions (they have been recited in other cases) to the end that those interested may understand that what was said with respect to \u201csecondary meaning\u201d in the Plymouth Motor Corp. case, supra, is not to be relied upon as a basis for securing the registration of trade-marks under the act of 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-17\">In the instant case the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-18\">Affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
