What else could a knee line hose be except one that reached to the knee ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-28\">\u201cThe equivalence of phonetic spelling to authorized spelling is too well established to require citation of <em>authorits. </em>[authorities] <em>The </em>[that] \u2018ne\u2019 and \u2018knee\u2019 are phonetically the same has not been challenged by the applicant. It is believed that \u2018ne line\u2019 is descriptive whether one is speaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of knee length hose or of a knee length line of hose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\">\u201cIt is believed that registration is properly refused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The commissioner in his decision stated: \u201cI agree with the examiner that the word \u2018Ne\u2019 would be considered by the purchasing public of hosiery to be a mere misspelling of the word \u2018knee\u2019, and the entire expression to have the same meaning as the expression \u2018line of the knee\u2019 would have, and to designate the region of the knee. It seems to me that purchasers of hosiery, seeing or hearing the words \u2018Ne Line\u2019 applied to those goods, would believe the expression described the hosiery as being knee length. Accordingly, I deem the expression descriptive of knee length hosiery and misdescriptive of hosiery that is not knee length. The fact that hosiery not of knee length is named in the application as the goods to which the mark is applied does not warrant granting the registration. In re Bonide Chemical Company, Inc., 46 F.2d 705, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 909, 407 O.G. 4.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">It is the position of appellant that anatomically there is no part of the body which is designated as the \u201cknee line\u201d; that the knee \u201cis a ball and socket joint having such a movement in connection with the knee cap as to effectively preclude the termination of any hose top anywhere on this knee cap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">This definition, as above stated by appellant, is narrower than that given by lexicographers.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In Funk &amp; Wagnall\u2019s New Standard Dictionary (1931), the word \u201cknee\u201d is defined as follows: \u201cThe joint or <em>region about the joint </em>between the thigh and the leg.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">The words \u201cknee line\u201d and the notation \u201cNe Line\u201d when spoken sound exactly alike, and when pronounced a person listening could not distinguish between \u201cknee line\u201d and \u201cNe Line.\u201d Therefore, if the words \u201cknee line\u201d would not be registrable for hosiery, appellant\u2019s mark is not registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">In view of the foregoing, we have no doubt that appellant\u2019s mark, as it is pronounced, is descriptive of hosiery of knee length, or hosiery, the tops of which extend to the knee, and that purchasers of hosiery hearing the notation \u201cNe Line\u201d applied to hosiery would naturally conclude that it described hosiery of knee length.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Whether or not the term \u201cknee line\u201d is in current use, or has ever been used, in the hosiery trade is immaterial. The question is, does appellant\u2019s mark indicate to purchasers of hosiery origin of the goods? If it does not, and merely indicates the length of hosiery, it is not registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">In the case of Estate of P. D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Commissioner of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 40 S.Ct. 414, 416, 64 L.Ed. 705, the court stated: \u201cIt was settled long prior to the Trade-Mark Registration Act that the law would not secure to any person the exclusive use of a trade-mark consisting merely of words descriptive of the qualities, ingredients, or characteristics of an article of trade; this for the reason that the function of a trade-mark is to point distinctively, either by its own meaning or by association, to the origin or ownership of the wares to which it is applied, and words merely descriptive of qualities, ingredients, or characteristics, when used alone, do not do this. <em>Other like goods, </em>equal to them in all respects, <em>may </em>be manufactured or <em>dealt in by others, </em>who, with equal truth, may use, and must be left free to use, the same language of description in placing their goods before the public.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">So here any manufacturer of hosiery may hereafter rightfully use, in so far as the law of trade-marks is concerned, the term \u201cknee line\u201d in describing a particular length of hosiery. Therefore, appellant has no right to secure a monopoly in the use upon hosiery of the equivalent term \u201cNe Line\u201d and the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
