Bury appeals from the sentence imposed pursuant to his conviction for petty theft with a prior, alleging several errors in relation to the sentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-7\">In an amended information filed March 22,1995, by the District Attorney of Riverside County, defendant was charged with petty theft with a prior conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 666).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Three prior offenses were alleged: robbery in 1975 (\u00a7 211); possession of controlled substances in 1981 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377); and petty theft with a prior in 1990 (\u00a7666). It was also alleged that for each of these three prior offenses, defendant did not remain free of prison custody, and committed another crime resulting in a felony conviction during, a period of five years, within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). Three special prior offenses were also alleged: forcible rape in 1980 (\u00a7 261, subd. (2)); forcible oral copulation in 1980 (\u00a7 288a); and robbery in 1975 (\u00a7 211). It was also alleged that each of the three special prior offenses were serious and violent felonies within the meaning of sections 667, subdivisions (c) and (e) and 1170.12, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-8\">A jury found defendant guilty of petty theft and, in a separate proceeding, found that all allegations of prior convictions were true. The court denied motions to strike the prior convictions for forcible rape and forcible oral copulation and to reduce the section 666 violation to a misdemeanor. Defendant was sentenced to 28 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-9\">II.-VI.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-10\">VII. Application of the Three Strikes Law to Petty Theft With a Prior</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-11\">The three strikes law only applies if the current offense is a felony and the defendant has prior violent or serious felony convictions. (\u00a7 667, subds. (b) &amp; (c).) California defines \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d in terms of the prison sentence imposed. \u201cSection 16 classifies \u2018crimes and public offenses\u2019 as felonies, misdemeanors and infractions. A felony is a crime punishable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1876\">*1876</page-number>with death or by imprisonment in the state prison. (\u00a7 17, subd. (a).) Every other crime or public offense not an infraction is a misdemeanor. <em>(Ibid.) </em> If a given statute, however, does not define the nature of the crime as either a felony or a misdemeanor, but merely specifies a punishment, the test of the nature or status of the offense, which only applies to this special class of felony-misdemeanor offenses or so-called wobblers, becomes the actual punishment imposed. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Perez) </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 347, 355 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 107]; see also <em>In re Jovan B. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 801, 808, fn. 2 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 428, 863 P.2d 673].) Section 17, subdivision (b) delineates other circumstances under which a wobbler may be a misdemeanor: if the court imposes a punishment other than imprisonment in the state prison, or if the prosecuting attorney files a complaint specifying that the offense is a misdemeanor without objection by the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">In a supplemental brief, defendant contends the three strikes law may not be applied to petty theft with a prior because the underlying offense, petty theft, is itself a misdemeanor. He cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Bouzas </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 467 [279 Cal.Rptr. 847, 807 P.2d 1076] as supporting his contention, in that the court held that the prior offense is a \u201csentencing factor,\u201d rather than an element of petty theft with a prior. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 474-475.) While <em>Bouzas </em>does indeed hold this, it does not support defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">Section 666 provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvery person who, having been convicted of . . . robbery . . . and having served a term therefor in any penal institution ... is subsequently convicted of petit theft, then the person ... is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year, or in the state prison.\u201d The court therefore has the discretion to treat petty theft with a prior as either a misdemeanor or a felony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bouzas, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 467, 471.) Because defendant had been previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1877\">*1877</page-number>convicted of robbery, he was subject to the instant theft being treated as a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">Here, the court specifically considered and denied a motion to reduce the crime to a misdemeanor, choosing instead to treat it as a felony. The court based its decision on defendant\u2019s long and continuous history of recidivism. None of the factors delineated in section 17, subdivision (b), defining a crime as a misdemeanor, apply. Therefore, the crime of petty theft with a prior was a felony. It was not a misdemeanor that carried the potential for a longer sentence. It was, simply, a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">Because the court chose to consider the charge of petty theft with a prior as a felony, and because the three strikes law is applicable when a defendant is convicted of a felony and has one or more prior convictions for one or more serious or violent felonies, defendant was properly sentenced according to the provisions of the three strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">VIH. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-9\">Ramirez, P. J., and Ward, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-10\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 12, 1997. Chin, J., did not participate therein.

HQ (2) When the court, upon committing the defendant to the Youth Authority, designates the offense to be a misdemeanor. HQ (3) When the court grants probation to a defendant without imposition of sentence and at the time of granting probation, or on application of the defendant or probation officer thereafter, the court declares the offense to be a misdemeanor. RQ (4) When the prosecuting attorney files in a court having jurisdiction over misdemeanor offenses a complaint specifying that the offense is a misdemeanor, unless the defendant at the time of his or her arraignment or plea objects to the offense being made a misdemeanor, in which event the complaint shall be amended to charge the felony and the case shall proceed on the felony complaint. HQ (5) When, at or before the preliminary examination or prior to filing an order pursuant to Section 872, the magistrate determines that the offense is a misdemeanor, in which event the case shall proceed as if the defendant had been arraigned on a misdemeanor complaint.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
