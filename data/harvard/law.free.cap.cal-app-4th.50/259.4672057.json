Code, \u00a7 667.61, subd. (b)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and he thereafter admitted allegations that he had suffered a prior attempted robbery conviction in 1982 and two prior felony convictions in 1993 (unlawfully taking a vehicle and possession of a firearm by a felon) for which he served a single prior prison term.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ervin was sentenced to state prison for a term of 15 years to life for the rape (\u00a7 667.61, subd. (b)), plus 5 consecutive years for the 1982 prior (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)), with a 4-year concurrent sentence imposed for the burglary count, a term of 20 years to life. The \u201cremaining priors\u201d were stricken.  Ervin appeals, contending the maximum sentence the trial court should have imposed was a determinate 16-year sentence under the three strikes law, not an indeterminate life sentence with a 15-year minimum term under section 667.61, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   ^e People also appeal, contending Ervin should have been sentenced for the rape under <em>both </em>the three strikes law <em>and </em>section 667.61, subdivision (b), to a term of 30 years to life.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">With one qualifying prior, Ervin\u2019s rape sentence <em>under the three strikes law </em>would have been a determinate term (three, six or eight years), doubled\u2014a maximum of 16 years, with his conduct credits limited so that he would have to serve at least 80 percent of the term. (\u00a7\u00a7 261; 264, subd. (a); 667, subds. (c)(5), (e)(1); 1170.12, subd. (c)(1).) As imposed, Ervin\u2019s sentence <em>under subdivision (b) of section 667.61 </em>is an indeterminate term of 15 years to life, with his conduct credits limited so that he must serve at least 85 percent of 15 years.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ervin contends that, because he has a prior, he should have been sentenced under the three strikes law and not under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>667.61, subdivision (b). The People not only object to Ervin\u2019s attempt to reduce his sentence, but contend the statutes are cumulative, not alternative, and that Ervin\u2019s sentence under section 667.61 should have been doubled. We agree with the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">About six months after the Legislature enacted the three strikes law as urgency legislation (Stats. 1994, ch. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2), it adopted section 667.61 (Stats. 1994, ch. 447, \u00a7 1), the \u201cone strike law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rayford </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 1, 8 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 884 P.2d 1369] [\u00a7 667.61 is commonly known as the \u201c \u2018One Strike\u2019 \u201d law].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, our analysis of the issue before us begins with the presumption that the Legislature was aware of the three strikes law when section 667.61 was enacted <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bunyard </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1189, 1238 [249 Cal.Rptr. 71, 756 P.2d 795])\u2014and ends with the fact that there is no apparent reason in law or logic to believe the Legislature intended either law to operate exclusively of the other. As relevant to this issue, we do not find any ambiguity in section 667.61 or in any part of the three strikes law, and where, as here, two statutes are not inconsistent, both will be given effect. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bunyard, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 1238.) What this means is that Ervin, convicted of a violent rape during a burglary, must be sentenced to a term of 15 years to life under section 667.61, subdivision (b), and that his sentence must be doubled under the three strikes law. <em>(Hsu </em>v. <em>Abbara </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 863, 871 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 824, 891 P.2d 804] [the words of a statute are the most reliable indicator of legislative intent]; <em>Kizer </em>v. <em>Hanna </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1, 8 [255 Cal.Rptr. 412, 767 P.2d 679]; <em>Cisneros </em>v. <em>Vueve </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 906, 910 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 682].) As the People point out, the three strikes law and section 667.61 serve different objectives\u2014the former punishes recidivism, the latter aggravated sex offenses\u2014and there is simply no reason for suggesting that a recidivist criminal ought to be rewarded rather than penalized because his latest offense is sufficiently heinous to bring him within the provisions of section 667.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>To avoid this conclusion, Ervin contends the two statutes should be \u201creconciled by applying the three strikes law to recidivists whose present crimes are punishable under the three strikes law and by applying section 667.61 to first time offenders and to recidivists whose prior crime does not fall within the scope of the three strikes law.\u201d The problem with this approach is that it is contrary to the language of both statutes. Section 667.61 applies to certain first time sex offenders and to recidivists who have previously committed any of seven specified sex crimes, six of which are \u201cserious\u201d felonies within the meaning of the three strikes law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under Ervin\u2019s approach, we would effectively gut section 667.61 by eliminating the very persons clearly included by the language of that statute. We would also have to ignore the provisions in section 667 that it is to be applied \u201cm <em>addition to any other enhancement or punishment provisions </em>which may apply\" and that, \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other law, [its provisions] shall be applied <em>in every case </em>in which a defendant has a prior [serious or violent] felony conviction.\u201d (\u00a7 667, subds. (e), (f)(1), italics added.) Ervin\u2019s interpretation cannot be what the Legislature intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Finally, Ervin relies on a sentence taken out of context from a footnote in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 234 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 903, 893 P.2d 1224], to support his assertion that the \u201cSupreme Court has indicated . . . the three strikes law controls over section 667.61.\u201d His analysis fails. In <em>Jenkins, </em>the Supreme Court considered the relationship of the three strikes law to the old habitual offender scheme under section 667.7. In that context, the Supreme Court suggested that \u201c[i]f the prosecution pleads and proves that a defendant qualifies for sentencing under the three strikes scheme . . . , the defendant must be sentenced pursuant to its provisions, even if he or she otherwise would qualify for sentencing under section 667.7 or some other sentencing statute.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 238, fn. 2.) What this means is that a second or third strike defendant is not entitled to a <em>benefit </em>(that is, a shorter sentence) under section 667.7 or some other sentencing statute, not that he cannot be punished <em>more severely </em>when the three strikes law is permissibly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In <em>Jenkins, </em>the defendant was convicted of second degree murder, with an allegation that he was an habitual offender (\u00a7 667.7) found true, and the issue was whether he should be sentenced under section 190, subdivision (a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>to a term of 15 years to life, or under section 667.7. As the Supreme Court explained, the evident purpose of section 667.7\u2014to provide a distinct and <em>more severe </em>sentencing scheme for violent habitual offenders\u2014plainly means that the statute applies to murderers as well as criminals who commit other less serious felonies. \u201c[T]he court must choose among three alternatives in determining the minimum period of imprisonment\u2014one being \u2018any period prescribed by Section 190 ... .\u2019 Therefore, when the qualifying felony conviction is murder, the minimum period of required imprisonment under section 667.7 must be determined <em>with reference to the term of imprisonment that a murderer otherwise would be required to serve if he </em>or she were sentenced under section 190 (provided section 667.7\u2019s threshold of a 20-year minimum term is met).\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 243-244, italics added.) Under the three strikes law, a second striker\u2019s \u201cdeterminate term or minimum term for an indeterminate term shall be twice <em>the term otherwise provided as punishment for the current felony conviction.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(1), italics added.) Ervin\u2019s punishment for the current felony conviction is found in section 667.61, subdivision (b). Following the reasoning of <em>Jenkins, </em>therefore, we use both statutes to determine Ervin\u2019s sentence, not just one as suggested by Ervin. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruiz </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1653, 1658-1661 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 561].)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">For these reasons, Ervin\u2019s sentence cannot stand. Although we could certainly modify it ourselves if there was any certainty about the priors, this record does not permit that shortcut. As noted at the outset, remand is necessary so that the trial court can exercise its discretion and decide whether to strike any of Ervin\u2019s priors. By way of illustration only (and without expressing a view about the manner in which the trial court ought to exercise its discretion), we note that, assuming one qualifying prior (the 1982 attempted robbery) and one prior prison term (the 1993 crimes), the maximum sentence the trial court could impose would be an indeterminate term of 15 years to life (\u00a7 667.61, subd. (b)), with the 15-year minimum doubled (\u00a7\u00a7 1170.12, subd. (c)(1); 667, subd. (e)(1)), plus five years for the prior (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)), plus one year for the prior prison term (\u00a7 677.5, subd. (b)), and with a concurrent four-year term for the burglary, for a total term of 36 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The judgment is affirmed but Ervin\u2019s sentence is vacated and the matter is remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Ortega, Acting P. J., and Masterson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 12,1996, and the petition of appellant Christopher Lepte Ervin for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 5, 1997.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-4\">A11 section references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-5\">When Ervin telephoned his former girlfriend, Thelma S., Thelma told him not to come to her apartment, but he said he was coming over to \u201ckick her ass.\u201d When he arrived, he kicked in her door, pulled her telephone off the wall, hit Thelma in the face and dragged her out of a closet when she attempted to get away from him. He then followed her into her kitchen and watched while she fed lunch to her three-year-old son. When she was finished, Ervin told her he wanted sex. When Thelma refused, Ervin grabbed her. When she pleaded with him not to do anything in front of her son, Ervin told her, \u201cShut up, bitch.\u201d He then forcibly raped her, and left when he was finished. Thelma went to a phone booth and called 911.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Ervin also contends his sentence on the burglary count should have been stayed (rather than run concurrent with his sentence on the rape), a contention we summarily reject. The fact that he committed the rape after he burglarized his victim\u2019s house does not mean he entered the house with only one objective. (\u00a7 654.) Ervin\u2019s intent and objective were factual questions for the trial court <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 346, 355 [187 Cal.Rptr. 505]) and the finding of separate objectives is supported by the record <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ratcliff </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1401, 1408 [273 Cal.Rptr. 253]). The People\u2019s theory was that Ervin entered the apartment with the intent to commit an assault by means of force likely to produce great injury, and the jury was so instructed. The prosecutor argued to the jury that at the time Ervin broke down Thelma\u2019s door, he was carrying out his threat to come over and \u201ckick her ass.\u201d It was only after he hit and kicked her several times over a half-hour period, and after he watched her feed her child, that he decided to and did rape her. The concurrent sentence was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The People also contend the trial court should not have stricken the prior conviction allegations, which it seems to have done solely for sentencing after it determined that the three strikes law did not apply to a sentence imposed under section 667.61. As a result (and because Ervin was sentenced before the Supreme Court filed its decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628]), the trial court did not indicate one way or the other whether it would have exercised its discretion to strike the 1982 prior under the circumstances permitted by <em>Romero. </em>For these reasons, remand for resentencing is required. In this regard, we note that the record is not a model of clarity. The minute order does not specify what it was that Ervin admitted vis-\u00e1-vis the priors. According to the reporter\u2019s transcript, Ervin admitted that he was convicted of attempted robbery in 1982 (People v. Ervin (Super. Ct. L.A. County, No. A373050)) within the meaning of section 667, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>subdivision (a)(1); of unlawfully driving or taking a vehicle in 1993 (People v. Ervin (Super. Ct. L.A. County, No. SA002287)) within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b); and of possession of a firearm by a felon in 1993 (People v. Ervin (Super. Ct. L.A. County, No. NA013843)), within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). Since only the 1982 conviction was alleged as a strike, it appears that Ervin\u2019s maximum sentence would be 36 years to life.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Ap\">As relevant, section 667.61 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">\u201c(a) A person who is convicted of an offense specified in subdivision (c) under one or more of the circumstances specified in subdivision (d) or under two or more of the circumstances specified in subdivision (e) shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life and shall not be eligible for release on parole for 25 years ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">\u201c(b) Except as provided in subdivision (a), a person who is convicted of an offense specified in subdivision (c) under one of the circumstances specified in subdivision (e) shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life and shall not be eligible for release on parole for 15 years except as provided in subdivision (j).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-13\">\u201c(c) This section shall apply to any of the following offenses: HQ (1) A violation of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 261 [forcible rape]. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-14\">\u201c(d)....................................</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-15\">\u201c(e) The following circumstances shall apply to the offenses specified in subdivision (c): HQ ...
