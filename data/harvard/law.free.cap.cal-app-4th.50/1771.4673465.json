He took this action under section 3060 after another elected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1775\">*1775</page-number>official, County Treasurer Robert Citron, made speculative high-stakes financial investments, which suffered a precipitous downturn and plummeted the county into bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">The district attorney instituted proceedings before the grand jury, which issued substantially identical accusations<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against Steiner and Stanton, alleging, in essence, they failed to adequately carry out their duties to supervise Citron and other county officials. The accusations are divided into four sections, lettered \u201cA\u201d to \u201cD.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">Section A alleges Steiner and Stanton jeopardized the county\u2019s financial health by violating their duties to protect county finances under sections 23005,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 25207,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 25303.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It alleges they voted in 1993 and 1994 to issue short-term notes of approximately one and a half and two times the amount of discretionary revenue for those years respectively without adequate inquiry as to the necessity of borrowing, utilization of the proceeds, safety of the investment, ability of the county to repay the debt, and reliability of the pledged revenue stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">Section B alleges Steiner and Stanton violated their duties under section 25303 by failing to adequately supervise Citron and his successor, Matthew Raabe, and to see that they faithfully performed their duties. It alleges Steiner and Stanton failed to read and analyze the treasurer\u2019s monthly investment reports under section 53607,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to adequately monitor the treasurer\u2019s activities and to communicate regarding investments, inquire into interested third parties\u2019 accusations concerning risk and the possibility of loss, actively and adequately investigate the treasurer\u2019s investment practices, offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1776\">*1776</page-number>assistance to county staff in analyzing or solving problems in the treasury and investment pool, adequately investigate problems with the pool, and take action to enable Raabe and other staff members to attempt solutions to the financial crisis in the pool.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">Section C alleges Steiner and Stanton violated their duties under section 25303 by failing to adequately supervise Auditor-Controller Steve Lewis, and to see he faithfully performed his duties. It alleges that although they had the authority under section 26883,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> they failed to require Lewis to perform audits and prepare and file reports on the treasurer\u2019s accounts and records to assure he was performing his duties to preserve and safeguard public moneys under section 53649.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">Section D alleges Steiner and Stanton violated their duties under section 25303 by failing to require reports <em>from </em>county administrative officer Ernie Schneider necessary to adequately supervise Citron, Lewis, and Schneider, and to see they faithfully performed their duties. It alleges Steiner and Stanton failed to ensure that Schneider controlled and screened board agendas to ensure important matters regarding the safekeeping, management and disbursement of public funds were brought to the board\u2019s attention for public and open discussion on the board\u2019s discussion calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">In a nutshell, the accusations assert Steiner and Stanton did a shoddy job of minding the store while Citron committed acts which plunged the county into bankruptcy. Steiner and Stanton filed objections to the accusations,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the trial court granted them as to section A, but denied them as to the other sections. In this proceeding they contend the accusations: (1) do not state facts constituting willful misconduct; (2) violate the constitutional principles of separation of powers and legislative immunity; (3) assert a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1777\">*1777</page-number>nonexistent duty to act individually; and (4) are impermissibly vague and nonspecific.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We find the first two contentions have merit, so we do not address the others.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">Steiner and Stanton contend the alleged acts do not constitute the \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d required to trigger removal from office under section 3060 et seq. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">Cases construing section 3060 consistently reiterate the proposition \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d only requires a volitional act or failure to act. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawes </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 930, 938 [181 Cal.Rptr. 456]; <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 141, 149-150 [169 Cal.Rptr. 127]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hale, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.2d at pp. 118-119; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mullin </em>(1961) 197 Cal.App.2d 479, 486 [17 Cal.Rptr. 516]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Elliott </em>(1953) 115 Cal.App.2d 410, 419-420 [252 P.2d 661].) This construction of section 3060 goes back to <em>Coffey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1905) 147 Cal. 525 [82 P. 75], where the court observed the phrase \u201c \u2018misconduct in office\u2019 is broad enough to include any willful malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office[,] . . . \u201c even if it is not accompanied by any \u201ccriminal intention.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 529.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">But despite these pronouncements, the cases require more serious misconduct. The late eminent scholar Bernard Witkin recognized as much. We set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1778\">*1778</page-number>forth his cogent analysis at length: \u201cSince the punishment is only removal from office, it has been said that the \u2018misconduct\u2019 need not constitute a violation of any specific criminal statute. [Citations.] [^ It is, however, difficult to conceive of an act constituting \u2018wilful or corrupt misconduct in office\u2019 which does not violate one of the long list of crimes of public officers ... or the many prohibitions in local ordinances. And the cases, though few and not helpful in their discussions of this point, almost invariably deal with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1779\">*1779</page-number>acts which are prohibited by statute or ordinance. [Citations.] [&lt;fl] The opinions are also unclear on the mental element required. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Harby </em>[(1942) 51 Cal.App.2d 759, 767 (125 P.2d 874)], the court said: \u2018Such official misconduct does not necessarily imply corruption or criminal intention. The officer who, by the exercise of the power of his office, does an act forbidden by a penal statute is guilty of the conduct contemplated.\u2019 And the earlier opinion in <em>Coffey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>147 [Cal. at p.] 529, uses similar language: \u2018[M]isconduct in office does not necessarily imply corruption or criminal intention. The official doing of a wrongful act, or official neglect to do an act which ought to have been done, will constitute the offense, although there was no corrupt or malicious motive.\u2019 [Citation.] [t]D These statements, however, appear in cases in which the defendant knowingly violated a criminal statute, and there was, therefore, some kind of criminal intent. [Citations.]\u201d (2 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Crimes Against Governmental Authority, \u00a7 1219, pp. 1396-1397; see also <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at p. 150, citing the text with approval.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">We have reviewed the cases dealing with section 3060 and conclude Witkin is correct. In the seminal case, <em>Coffey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>147 Cal. at page 530, the court upheld a police chief\u2019s ouster for failing to seek prosecution of an illegal gambling ring even though the evidence did not show a corrupt intention or bad faith. But in reaching this result, the court observed, \u201cThe accusation . . . charges . . . [Coffey] knew of [the unlawful gaming], and refused and failed to prosecute the offenders. <em>... It was not a mere neglect of duty. </em>It was a failure to discharge his duty with knowledge of the facts calling for official action; a failure which was willful, and which evidenced a fixed purpose not to do what <em>actual knowledge </em>and the requirements of the law declare he shall do.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Thus, <em>Coffey, </em>the font of section 3060 cases, engrafted a knowledge element to the required mental state. None of the cases that came after <em>Coffey </em>contravenes that principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Harby, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.2d 759, the defendant, a city councilman, was accused of willfully, fraudulently, and corruptly taking a city car on a long vacation trip, in violation of a city ordinance on which he had voted prohibiting private use of a county car. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 763-765.) Although the Court of Appeal recited the litany of <em>Coffey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>147 Cal. 525 concerning the mere doing of a wrongful act, the evidence was sufficient to show knowledge of the wrong. (51 Cal.App.2d at pp. 767-768.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Becker </em>(1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 324 [246 P.2d 103], Becker received portions of insurance premiums for policies insurance companies provided for the school district on whose board Becker sat. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1780\">*1780</page-number>court found Becker could be ousted even though he had legal advice his conduct was proper. The court noted he violated the express terms of a statute prohibiting conflicts of interest, and the evidence was susceptible to the inference Becker intentionally omitted material facts in obtaining the legal opinion. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 325-326.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Elliott, supra, </em>115 Cal.App.2d 410, another contract conflict of interest case, the court cited the standard definition of \u201cwillful\u201d but expressly found the conduct was corrupt. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 419-420.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Mullin, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.2d 479, the court affirmed the removal of a sheriff from office after he forced a girl to go with her father, whom she accused of molesting her, provided no protection for her, and did not report the claim to the district attorney or juvenile authorities as the law required, even though the girl\u2019s aunt had corroborated the allegations. The father was eventually convicted of statutory rape of his daughter. In addressing a claimed instructional error, the court stated misconduct did not require corruption or criminal intention, but only a purpose or willingness to commit the act. The court also recognized, however, \u201c[wjilful misconduct is something more than an act or omission resulting from a mistake of judgment. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 485-486.) The court found sufficient evidence Mullin willfully failed to investigate a crime, noting nonfeasance was sufficient to support the allegations. But in doing so, the court pointed to evidence Mullin destroyed eight pages of interview notes, and the jury could believe he intentionally suppressed or concealed them from prosecuting authorities. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 487-488.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hale, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 112, the court stated that an official may be removed for \u201cgross and repeated failure to carry out his official routine .... Such misconduct . . . may be corrupt or <em>merely wilful.\" (Id. </em>at p. 119, italics added.) Unfortunately, the court did not give meaning to the emphasized phrase. And, providing an example of how mixed up the characterizations of the requisite mental state can be, the court also noted, \u201c[T]he misconduct referred to simply requires a purpose or willingness to ... be guilty of the omission.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Willingness to be guilty of an omission is a term unknown to us in the law, but at the very least, it connotes a conscious decision not to act as opposed to mere negligent failure to act. In any event, the statements are dictum because the allegations were Hale <em>intentionally </em>covered up management and accounting irregularities in a waste disposal company holding the county\u2019s trash collection franchise, which employed him before he became the county auditor-controller. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 115-116.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hulburt </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 404 [142 Cal.Rptr. 190], a pleading case, the court noted section 3060 proceedings are not a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1781\">*1781</page-number>prosecution in the ordinary sense. But Hulbert\u2019s alleged conduct constituted criminal felony violations, including that he used his authority and influence to force other sheriff\u2019s deputies to support the incumbent, allegations that connoted intentional misconduct. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 408.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Hanson) (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 396, 401 [168 Cal.Rptr. 21], the court observed, \u201cThe act or omission for which an officer may be removed does not necessarily imply corruption or criminal intent or the commission of a crime in the ordinary sense of that term. [Citations.]\u201d The court did not expound on the statement, probably because it was dictum. The comment occurs in the court\u2019s discussion of the different purposes of section 3060 proceedings and criminal actions, where the court concluded those accused under section 3060 are not so similarly situated with charged felons as to require a preliminary hearing. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 400-401.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawes, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.3d at page 940, the court found intoxication during working hours was grounds for removal, affirmative conduct which connotes knowledge at least.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">Taken as a whole, these cases affirm that something more than neglect is necessary to constitute willful conduct. Virtually all of them involved conduct that was otherwise criminal, conduct which was corrupt and malum in se. And, in contrast to Steiner\u2019s and Stanton\u2019s cases, none of them involved a failure to act where the duty to act is premised on something the official <em>should have known. </em>But that is what the district attorney has charged here. He alleges Steiner and Stanton failed to realize Citron\u2019s investment decisions could bring financial ruin to the county because they did not pay close enough attention to his activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-6\">One court, recognizing the term \u201cwillful\u201d requires more than a volitional act or omission, found the alleged acts were insufficient to justify removal under section 3060. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Tice </em>(1956) 144 Cal.App.2d 750 [301 P.2d 588], a jury found Tice, the marshal, had issued county checks drawn on insufficient funds. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 751.) The uncontroverted evidence showed the checks were written by Tice\u2019s assistant and honored by the bank, without Tice\u2019s knowledge. In upholding the trial court\u2019s decision to grant a new trial, the Court of Appeal observed the concept of willfulness under section 3060 includes an element of knowledge: \u201c[M]isconduct for which a public officer may be removed from office on accusation by a grand jury may be either wilful or corrupt. \u2018Wilfully,\u2019 in this connection, \u2018implies simply a purpose or willingness to commit the act, or make the omission referred to. It does not require an intent to violate law, or to injure another, or to acquire any advantage.\u2019 However, \u2018knowingly\u2019 requires \u2018knowledge that the facts exist which constitute the transgression.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (144 Cal.App.2d at p. 754.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-7\"><em>Tice </em>involved a situation analogous to Steiner\u2019s and Stanton\u2019s. Although Orange County residents undoubtedly would have been thankful had Citron\u2019s sin merely been to write a few bad checks, the alleged role of Tice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1782\">*1782</page-number>the supervisors are the same: they allowed misfeasance on their watch. But the accusations here do not allege Steiner and Stanton knew of the misfeasance, and the district attorney conceded at oral argument the accusations allege only negligence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\">To adopt the district attorney\u2019s proposed negligence standard would have ominous public policy implications. It would effectively make the district attorney a performance monitor of elected officials, and allow him to subject them to the expense and rigors of accusation and trial if he deemed their performance to fall below that of the \u201creasonable\u201d public official. In plain terms, he could try to oust them for getting a C minus on their report cards. We cannot believe the Legislature intended to give the district attorney that power when it enacted section 3060. The procedure must be reserved for serious misconduct, such as that found in the cases we have reviewed, misconduct that involves criminal behavior or, at least, a <em>purposeful </em>failure to carry out <em>mandatory </em>duties of office.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The allegations against Steiner and Stanton fall well short of that standard, and they should have been set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">Even if Steiner\u2019s and Stanton\u2019s alleged nonfeasance fell within the ambit of section 3060, the district attorney would still face another barrier: the separation of powers doctrine. The California Constitution recognizes the doctrine in article III, section 3: \u201cThe powers of state government are legislative, executive, and judicial. Persons charged with the exercise of one power may not exercise either of the others except as permitted by this Constitution.\u201d In the context of federal separation of powers, the United States Supreme Court recognized, \u201cIf it be important thus to separate the several departments of government and restrict them to the exercise of their appointed powers, it follows, as a logical corollary, equally important, that each department should be kept completely independent of the others\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1783\">*1783</page-number>independent. . . in the sense that the acts of each shall never be controlled by, or subjected, directly or indirectly, to, the coercive influence of either of the other departments.\u201d <em>(O\u2019Donoghue </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1933) 289 U.S. 516, 530 [77 L.Ed. 1356, 1360, 53 S.Ct. 740].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">This concept manifests itself in various ways.  For example, courts may not compel a legislative body to act. In <em>Sklar </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 616, 618 [230 Cal.Rptr. 42], the court held taxpayers could not invoke judicial power to force the Franchise Tax Board, an administrative body, to control the use of alcohol entertainment expenses as a business deduction on state income tax returns. In doing so the court noted \u201c \u2018the well-established principle, rooted in the doctrine of separation of powers [citation], that the courts may not order the Legislature or its members to enact or not to enact, or the Governor to sign or not to sign, specific legislation.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . \u2018[B]y virtue of the separation of powers doctrine courts lack the power to order the Legislature to pass a prescribed legislative act.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . Were it otherwise, courts would be involved in \u2018an attempt to exercise legislative functions, which ... is expressly forbidden . . . .\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 624; see also <em>Mandel </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 531, 551, fn. 9 [174 Cal.Rptr. 841, 629 P.2d 935]; <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 728, 751 [135 Cal.Rptr. 345, 557 P.2d 929]; <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 228, 235 [138 Cal.Rptr. 101].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-6\">An equally important corollary of the separation of powers doctrine is courts cannot inquire into the impetus or motive behind legislative action. <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 721, 726 [119 Cal.Rptr. 631, 532 P.2d 495]; <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 898 [120 Cal.Rptr. 707, 534 P.2d 403].) <em>Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1616 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 876], typifies the proposition. A judges\u2019 association brought suit to challenge the board of supervisors\u2019 decision to consolidate court services in the sheriff\u2019s department on the ground the board did not consider the judges\u2019 \u201cadvisory recommendation,\u201d as is statutorily mandated. The court reversed an order allowing discovery to determine whether the board had considered the recommendation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1619.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-7\">In doing so, the court acknowledged the applicability of the separation of powers doctrine (32 Cal.App.4th at p. 1626), and reasoned, \u201cJudicial reluctance to explore the thought process of legislators emerged very early in American jurisprudence. The California Supreme Court [citation] [has] called <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Peck </em>(1810) 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 87 [3 L.Ed. 162] \u2018the classic statement of the policies behind the rule.\u2019 Even when a legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1784\">*1784</page-number>stood accused of corruption in its lawmaking, Chief Justice Marshall wrote: \u2018It may well be doubted how far the validity of a law depends upon the motives of its framers, and how far the particular inducements, operating on members of the supreme sovereign power of a state, to the formation of a contract by that power, are examinable in a court of justice. If the principle be conceded, that an act of the supreme sovereign power might be declared null by [a] court, in consequence of the means which procured it, still would there be much difficulty in saying to what extent those means must be applied to produce this effect. Must it be direct corruption, or would interest or undue influence of any kind be sufficient? Must the vitiating cause operate on a majority, or on what number of the members? Would the act be null, whatever might be the wish of the nation, or would its obligation or nullity depend upon the public sentiment? [&lt;H If the majority of the legislature be corrupted, it may well be doubted, whether it be within the province of the judiciary to control their conduct, and, if less than a majority act from impure motives, the principle by which judicial interference would be regulated, is not clearly discerned.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at p. 1623.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">A third corollary of the separation of powers doctrine as it impacts legislatures is legislators have absolute immunity from damage suits based on legislative acts. <em>(Cinevision Corp. </em>v. <em>City of Burbank </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 745 F.2d 560, 577.) In <em>Traweek </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(N.D.Cal 1984) 659 F.Supp. 1012 (affd. as mod. on another point in <em>Traweek </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 920 F.2d 589), the court applied the rule to hold city and county officials could not be forced to sponsor or enact legislation that would alter existing legislation. (659 F.Supp. at p. 1031.) In doing so, the court held the rule applied to immunity from damages as well as declaratory or injunctive relief. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1030.) The court rejected the contention the conduct about which the plaintiffs complained consisted of nonlegislative administrative acts, such as meeting with lobbyists and interests groups, noting \u201c \u2018long-standing and wise [is the] tradition that legislators are immune from legal responsibility for their intra-legislative statements <em>and </em>activities.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) The court elaborated, \u201cThe doctrine of absolute legislative immunity has been construed expansively. . . .

Synthesizing the rules, we conclude legal action may not be taken against supervisors for their activities involving planning or enacting legislation. And, because the revocation of legislative action is itself legislative <em>(Santa Barbara County Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 940, 946-947 [257 Cal.Rptr. 615]; <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 708, 714 [86 Cal.Rptr. 754] [rescission of zoning ordinance]), such action may not be taken when the issue involves revocation, a concept which, as we shall discuss, is germane to Steiner\u2019s and Stanton\u2019s cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">We recognize some cases have held court intervention is permissible in some instances to force a local government to act.

Because the accusations allege Steiner and Stanton failed to obtain reports under section 53607, we may infer they had delegated investment power to Citron under that section. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>supra, 232 Cal.App.2d at p. 123 [use of the title \u201cauditor-controller\u201d in pleading allowed inference county adopted resolution creating that position].)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>\n                   Having delegated the power, the only way to remedy any imprudent or wrongful action by Citron would be to revoke his power.

As noted in <em>Cinevision Corp. </em>v. <em>City of Burbank, supra, </em>745 F.2d at p. 580, \u201cAlthough a local legislator may vote on an issue, that alone does not necessarily determine that he or she was acting in a legislative capacity.

Budgetary functions are generally legislative. \u201cThe budgetary process entails a complex balancing of public needs in many and varied areas with the finite financial resources available for distribution among those demands. It involves interdependent political, social and economic judgments which cannot be left to individual officers acting in isolation; rather, it is, and indeed must be, the responsibility of the legislative body to weigh those needs and set priorities for the utilization of the limited revenues available.\u201d <em>(County of Butte </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 693, 699 [222 Cal.Rptr. 429]; see also <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Common Council </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 684, 692, 698 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 161] [embracing the rule, but finding the legislative authority may not use the budget to prevent a government official from carrying out the office\u2019s duties]; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Buff </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 384, 390 [218 Cal.Rptr. 249] [governmental actions involving essentially political decisions are immune from liability, including budgetary and fiscal questions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">Investment strategy is an integral part of the budgetary process.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Even if the decision to make certain individual investments might not be considered purely legislative,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the decision to vest another elected county official with the power and discretion to make all investments plainly is. It is \u201cmacro\u201d in nature, constituting a major policy decision. For these reasons, delegating investment power to Citron under section 53607 was legislative. The decision to revoke that power would be legislative as well. <em>(Santa Barbara County Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at pp. 946-947.) Because revocation of the investment power was the only way to \u201csupervise\u201d Citron, and later Raabe, allegations of a failure to supervise are really allegations of a failure to revoke, in other words a failure to exercise legislative discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">The allegations concerning the failure to supervise and gain information from Lewis and Schneider are just another way of saying Steiner.and Stanton failed to be well enough informed to properly legislate. Although, under certain circumstances, court intervention might be appropriate to force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1789\">*1789</page-number>supervision by supervisors in their administrative capacity,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the failure to perform supervisory duties may not be invoked as a ground for intervention where it relates to gaining information regarding the legislative function. <em>(Traweek </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>659 F.Supp. at pp. 1030-1031.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">The district attorney attempts, to distinguish the law on legislative immunity by asserting none of the cases involved commission of a crime. Even assuming a crime exception exists,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the type of \u201ccrime\u201d he suggests is applicable is not apt for the exception. The district attorney claims the exception applies because section 3060 proceedings are criminal. True, they have been characterized as such, but they are not in the ordinary sense of the word. <em>(Boags </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 65, 69 [242 Cal.Rptr. 681]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawes, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.3d at p. 939; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Hanson), supra, </em>110 Cal.App.3d at p. 400; but see Pen. Code, \u00a7 15 [defining crime, among other things, as an act or omission violating the provisions of a law that results in a loss of public office].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">To the extent section 3060 defines a crime, there are compelling reasons for exempting it from any crime exception to the legislative immunity rule. In <em>Boags </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.3d 65, the district attorney invoked Penal Code former section 1222 to criminally charge a sitting judge with willfully failing to disqualify himself when it was required by law. (197 Cal.App.3d at pp. 67-68.) The section made \u201c\u2018[e]very willful omission to perform any duty enjoined by law upon any public officer\u2019 \u201d a misdemeanor. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 68, fn. 2.) The court found that applying the section to a judicial officer violated the separation of powers doctrine. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">The court\u2019s reasoning is cogent and compelling: \u201cUnder Section 1222 as the prosecution asks us to construe this provision, the executive would be given discretion to commence a criminal action against a judge whenever it considered he had failed to properly perform his judicial duties. Hence the executive would be able to charge a judge with a misdemeanor merely for the erroneous exercise of the judicial powers vested in him by the Constitution. The doctrine of separation of powers demands that the branches of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1790\">*1790</page-number>government be coequal. The judicial power therefore must be independent, and that power is compromised when an individual judge wishes to perform his functions but must first consider the possibility the prosecutor may disapprove and charge him criminally. Section 1222 construed as the prosecution asks would make the performance of the manifold judicial duties and functions a very risky business. For example, should the executive have the option of prosecuting a judge criminally if he failed to maintain order and decorum in proceedings before him or demonstrated impatience with a lawyer or a witness [citation]? If he failed to comply with the requirement in Penal Code section 987.9 that application for funds for the preparation or presentation of the defense of a capital case be kept confidential [citation]? If he communicated with a judge of the reviewing court concerning the facts of a case on appeal [citation]? If he failed to decide cases within 90 days of their submission [citations]? If he failed to render a timely decision to impose consecutive sentences [citations]? If he failed to impose a prison term made mandatory by the Penal Code [citation]? If he failed to give a proper instruction to the jury [citations]? If after imposing sentence he failed to advise a defendant not represented by counsel of the right to appeal [citation]? If he failed to conduct a hearing on a petition for order permitting abortion without parental consent within three days after the date of filing [citations]? We submit the answer to the foregoing questions is self-evident and demonstrates the constitutional infirmity of Section 1222. To allow Section 1222 to be used in this manner would place the entire judiciary at the mercy of the executive.\u201d <em>(Boags </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.3d at pp. 69-70.)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">Similarly, if we held section 3060 falls within the crime exception to legislative immunity because it makes criminal the failure of supervisors to adequately carry out their general duties, it would put the district attorney in the position of a super-governor in the county. Supervisors would look over their shoulders before taking any discretionary action for fear the district attorney would find they had not passed muster and would subject them to the expensive and protracted proceedings we have seen in this case. On the other hand, if the supervisors failed to act, they would fear \u201ccriminal\u201d prosecution for a negligent omission. They would be hard pressed to function adequately in such an environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">We stress our holding is narrow. We find section 3060 violates the separation of powers provision of the California Constitution insofar as it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1791\">*1791</page-number>used to accuse county supervisors for acts or omissions committed as a part of their legislative functions and which violate no penal statute.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Because that is what happened here, the objections should have been sustained.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">Let peremptory writs of mandate issue directing the trial court to vacate its orders overruling Steiner\u2019s and Stanton\u2019s objections to their accusations in case Nos. 95ZF0060 and 95ZF0061, and to enter orders granting the objections and dismissing the accusations.

And, the accusations are arguably vague and ambiguous because they allege, in essence, failures to adequately perform certain duties of a supervisor without suggesting how and by how much the supervisors fell short of the mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1205-11\">Steiner cites authority holding \u201cwillful misconduct\" requires \u201cbad faith.\u201d <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 866, 877 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 606, 897 P.2d 544]; <em>Wenger </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 615, 622 [175 Cal.Rptr. 420, 630 P.2d 954]; see also <em>Dodds </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 163, 172 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 906 P.2d 1260].) But those cases were decided under California Constitution, article VI, section 18, which deals exclusively with removal of judges. Although article VI, section 18 and section 3060 arise from the same constitutional source, the bad faith requirement under the former provision arose independently from the source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-12\">Both provisions sprang from former article IV, section 18 of the California Constitution, which provided, among other things, that \u201cjudges. . . shall be liable to impeachment for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1778\">*1778</page-number>misdemeanor in office,\u201d and \u201c[a]ll other [lesser governmental officials] shall be tried for misdemeanor in office in such manner as the Legislature may provide.\u201d (Cal. Const., former art. IV, \u00a7 18; see Webster\u2019s New Internal. Dict. (3d ed. 1981) p. 1443 [\u201cmisdemeanor\u201d is \u201cmisbehavior,\u201d \u201can act of bad conduct\u201d]; see also <em>Coffey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 147 </em>Cal. at p. 529 [noting Webster defines \u201cmisconduct\u201d as synonymous with \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d].) Article IV, section 18 begat Penal Code section 758, the precursor of section 3060, which contained almost identical language. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hale, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.2d at p. 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">When the present version of article IV, section 18 was enacted in 1966, providing for impeachment of judges for \u201cmisconduct,\u201d article VI, section 18 was also enacted. It states, in relevant part, the Commission on Judicial Performance may \u201cremove a judge for action . . . that constitutes willful misconduct in office, persistent failure or inability to perform the judge\u2019s duties, habitual intemperance in the use of intoxicants or drugs, or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute.\u201d Because the original constitutional source of the two provisions is the same and both use the term \u201cmisdemeanor in office,\u201d one might conclude the meaning of the term \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d in section 3060 and article VI, section 18 involves the same mental state, bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">But in <em>Geiler </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Qualifications </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 270 [110 Cal.Rptr. 201, 515 P.2d 1], the case that gave rise to the bad faith requirement for removing judges, the court observed, \u201cAs indicated above, the Commission in the instant matter concluded that the conduct proven in the previously discussed specifications constituted \u2018willful misconduct in office\u2019 and \u2018conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute.\u2019 As we have noted above, the second ground for imposing discipline was added to the Constitution in 1966. We believe this mandates our construing \u2018willful misconduct in office\u2019 as connoting something graver than the \u2018lesser included offense\u2019 of \u2018conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute.\u2019 The more serious charge should be reserved for unjudicial conduct which a judge acting in his judicial capacity commits in bad faith, while the lesser charge should be applied to conduct which a judge undertakes in good faith but which nevertheless would appear to an objective observer to be not only unjudicial conduct but conduct prejudicial to public esteem for the judicial office.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 283-284.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-7\">Because the <em>Geiler </em>court premised its construction requiring bad faith for willful misconduct on the presence of a \u201clesser included offense\u201d in article VI, section 18, and section 3060 describes no such lesser offense, we hesitate to conclude bad faith is required for a section 3060 violation. (But see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Caudillo </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 562 [146 Cal.Rptr. 859, 580 P.2d 274] [when provisions are enacted contemporaneously, the rule that statutes in pari materia, containing similar phrases, should be construed together is most justified] overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Escobar </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 740, 749-750 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 586, 837 P.2d 1100].) One could forcefully argue \u201cwillful misconduct\" requires bad faith only when it appears in a provision listing another sort of misfeasance, such as \u201cconduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d The cogent counterargument is, however, the addition of a \u201clesser included offense\u201d in the new constitutional provision could not make the term mean something it had not before, i.e., that it could have added the bad faith requirement to \u201cwillful misconduct.\u201d We need not resolve these arguments because we shall find section 3060 requires more than a mere volitional act or omission without regard to other provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1210-7\">The accusations mention allegations of investment risks and possible losses made against Citron by now-Treasurer James Moorlach and others which were conveyed to the supervisors, but the district attorney apparently concedes these allegations by private citizens, one of whom sought and ultimately assumed Citron\u2019s job, do not constitute allegations of knowledge. The accusations charge a failure to \u201cactively and adequately inquire into, examine, and investigate\u201d Moorlach\u2019s allegations, not a failure to act with knowledge they were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-8\">Stanton\u2019s accusation alleges he \u201cmade deliberate attempts to distance himself from responsibility for the [investment] pool and urged others to do so.\u201d Although this allegation involves affirmative conduct, the district attorney does not expressly allege the conduct was wrongful. The allegation merely forms part of the purported factual basis supporting the general claim he \u201cwilfully failed to actively and adequately inquire, examine and investigate the operations of the Treasurer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1210-9\">This construction would help ameliorate the separation of powers problem we discuss in the next part.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">The court also found the result would be the same under California law because \u201cstate law mirrors federal law in this area.\u201d (659 F.Supp. at p. 1033.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1213-7\">The district attorney correctly notes county supervisors possess quasi-legislative, quasi-executive, and quasi-judicial powers, but that begs the question whether the separation of powers doctrine prevents undue interference with their quasi-legislative function. The district attorney suggests that because supervisors sometimes exercise a nonlegislative function, the separations of powers doctrine does not apply even when legislative powers are exercised. In making this suggestion, he is at odds with California Supreme Court authority, as we explain next.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1213-8\">In <em>Knoff v. City etc. of San Francisco </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 184 [81 Cal.Rptr. 683], the court held mandate was available to compel the board of supervisors to supervise the county assessor. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 196.) The separation of powers issue was apparently not raised, as the court never addressed it. The court simply held mandamus lies to compel performance of a mandatory duty. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Because the separation of powers issue was not considered, <em>Knoff </em>does not impact our analysis. <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>City of Palmdale </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 363, 372 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 330, 853 P.2d 496] [cases are not authority for propositions not considered].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">The district attorney correctly points out the California Constitution contains no provision like the \u201cSpeech or Debate Clause\u201d of the federal Constitution. (U.S. Const., art I, \u00a7 6.) The California separation of powers provision, however, provides a sufficient ground to protect legislators from punitive action that unduly impinges on their function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">Because this is so, we need not address Steiner\u2019s contention the trial court erred by failing to take judicial notice of the resolution delegating the power.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">At oral argument, we asked the parties to brief the issue whether section 27000 provides independent authority for the treasurer to manage county investments. The section reads: \u201cThe county treasurer shall receive and keep safely all money belonging to the county and all other money directed by law to be paid to him and apply and pay it out, rendering the account as required by law.\u201d Several reasons compel the conclusion the section does not provide independent investment authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">On our own motion, we take judicial notice of various legislative documents dealing with section 27000 furnished by the Legislative Intent Service. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452, subd. (c), 459; <em>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 211, 218, fn. 9 [185 Cal.Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912]; <em>Grubb &amp; Ellis Co. </em>v. <em>Bello </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 231, 240-241 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 281].) The section was enacted in 1872 as section 4144 of the Political Code using substantially the same language. Amendments over the years changed the section numbering, but did not impact the language materially. Although the legislative history provides no enlightenment on the issue, sections that accompanied section 4144 suggest it did not contemplate investment power. Indeed, the ensuing sections describe a bookkeeper\u2019s tasks. (See, e.g., former Pol. Code \u00a7\u00a7 4146 [must give receipt for payments], 4147 [must write \u201cpaid\u201d on face of paid warrants], 4149 [must give notice of funds available to pay warrants drawing interest], 4155 [must report on moneys received and paid and debts due].) None of the sections use the words \u201cinvest\u201d or \u201cinvestment\u201d or suggest the Legislature contemplated the power to invest. (See <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224] [statutes should be construed in light of the statutory framework as a whole].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">Another reason to find section 27000 does not grant the treasurer investment powers is section 53607 itself. If the treasurer had investment powers under section 27000, section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1787\">*1787</page-number>53607 would be superfluous. In interpreting statutes and statutory schemes, we presume the Legislature did not intend to engage in an idle act. (See <em>International Business Machines </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 923, 932 [163 Cal.Rptr. 782, 609 P.2d 1] [courts should construe statutes so one does not effectively repeal the other].) We attempt to give effect to the statutes as written. <em>(Dix </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 442, 459 [279 Cal.Rptr. 834, 807 P.2d 1063] [courts avoid constructions rendering statutory provisions superfluous or unnecessary].) We assume section 53607 was enacted to give investment powers because they were not included in section 27000.</p>\n<p id=\"A93\">For the same reason, the enactment of section 27000.1 in 1995 (Stats. 1995, ch. 784, \u00a7 3) bolsters our conclusion. It provides in relevant part: \u201cThe board of supervisors may, by ordinance, delegate to the county treasurer the authority to invest. . . the funds of the county . . . pursuant to [section 53600 et seq.]. The county treasurer shall <em>thereafter </em>assume full responsibility for those transactions until the board . . . revokes its delegation of authority.\u201d (\u00a727000.1, italics added.) The section, which specifically applies the delegation powers under section 53607 to county supervisors, would be superfluous if the power to invest already belonged to the treasurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1215-10\">Section 50002 provides: \u201c \u2018Legislative body\u2019 as used in this division, means board of supervisors in the case of a county or city and county . . . unless the context otherwise requires.\u201d (See also \u00a7 53000 [\u201cAs used in this chapter, \u2018legislative body\u2019 means the board of supervisors in the case of a county or a city and county . . . unless the context otherwise requires.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">In plain terms, what the county can spend is a function of its income from taxes, fees, and earnings on investments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1216-8\">\u201cThe test [for whether an action is legislative] is not precise, and there is some inconsistency of approach between the published decisions.\u201d <em>(Fishman </em>v. <em>City of Palo Alto </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 506, 509 [150 Cal.Rptr. 326].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1217-8\">\u201cSupervision\u201d is limited, however.

But well-established federal law supports the exception. (See <em>Traweek </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>659 F.Supp. at p. 1030.)

The electorate has the recall process available, one which was used successfully in this county in the last year. In a recall election, more than 12 people are required to vote out those who were duly elected to use their best judgment in governing.
