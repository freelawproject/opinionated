He waived jury trial on allegations that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number>suffered two prior felony convictions pursuant to Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 667, subdivisions (c)-(j) and that he had served two prior separate prison terms pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b). The court found both strike priors and one of the separate prison term allegations to be true. The other prior prison term allegation was found not true.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Appellant objected on grounds of insufficient evidence to the court\u2019s using one of the prior convictions as a strike for sentencing. He also asked the court to strike one of the priors in the interest of justice, and alternatively moved to reduce the present offense to a misdemeanor. The objection, request, and motion were all denied. Appellant was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison with 288 days\u2019 credit for time served.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">On appeal Williams contends the trial court erred in denying his suppression motion. He further argues that the evidence was insufficient to show one of his prior convictions was a \u201cstrike\u201d under the three strikes law. He also raises a number of sentencing issues. We will find no error in the suppression motion ruling. We agree with appellant, though, that the prosecution proved only one prior strike conviction. Thus, the matter will be remanded for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">1. <em>The Court Properly Denied the Section 1538.5 Motion.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">\n<em>2.

The abstract reflects that on August 18, 1983, in case No. 26018, appellant pleaded guilty to one count of assault on a peace officer in violation of section 245, subdivision (b). It also reflected a plea of guilty to second degree burglary on October 7, 1985, in case No. 30231, and a plea of guilty to first degree burglary on June 30, 1986, in case No. 31442. He was sentenced to four years in prison on the latter conviction, and sentences in the other cases were run concurrent with that one. Also admitted into evidence was a certified copy of a section 969b packet from the State of California, Department of Corrections, consisting of a chronological history, an abstract of judgment (identical to the one above), a fingerprint card which lists appellant\u2019s offenses, and a California prison photograph of appellant. The fingerprint card, which appellant signed, indicated appellant\u2019s offenses included \u201cADW on P/O (245(b) PC).\u201d There was no judicial notice taken of any part of the file for case No. 26018. The court found true the allegation that Williams had previously been convicted of \u201c[ajssault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer, violation of Penal Code Section 245(b), within the meaning of subdivision (c) through (j) of the Penal Code and Penal Code Section 667.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">At the sentencing hearing Williams\u2019s counsel objected to use of the assault conviction as a strike. He argued at length that under section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(ll), an assault on a peace officer is a serious felony only if it involves a deadly weapon or instrument, that former section 245, subdivision (b) included assaults on a peace officer \u201cby any means likely to produce great bodily injury,\u201d and there was no substantial evidence showing that a deadly weapon or instrument was used in the assault for which Williams was convicted. The court rejected Williams\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">On appeal, Williams renews his argument. He points out that former section 245, subdivision (b) (now section 245, subdivision (c)) penalizes \u201can assault with a deadly weapon or instrument, other than a firearm, <em>or by any means likely to produce great bodily injury </em>upon the person of a peace officer or fireman . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Section 1192.7, subdivision (c) provides that a \u201cserious felony\u201d includes \u201c(11) assault with a deadly weapon or instrument on a peace officer; . . . (23) any felony in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>which the defendant personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon . . . According to appellant, no evidence before the trial court showed that a deadly weapon or instrument was used in the assault upon a peace officer for which he was convicted. Thus, the conviction does not fall within the provisions of section 1192.7 and is not a \u201cserious felony,\u201d hence not a strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Before determining whether there was substantial evidence that a deadly weapon or instrument was used in Williams\u2019s prior offense, we must first address the premise of his argument; i.e., that a conviction under former section 245, subdivision (b) is not a serious felony under section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(ll) unless the assault was made with a deadly weapon or instrument. We know of no published cases dealing with this precise issue. A recent decision concerning an analogous question, however, persuades us that Williams\u2019s premise is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 806 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 890], the defendant was convicted of second degree robbery with the use of a firearm, and the court found he had two prior convictions of a serious felony. One of the priors was based on the defendant\u2019s guilty plea to an information charging him with violating section 245, subdivision (a)(1), \u201c \u2018Assault Great Bodily Injury and With Deadly Weapon.\u2019 \u201d The information specifically alleged that the assault was committed \u201c \u2018with a deadly weapon, to wit, Hands, and by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d (42 Cal.App.4th at p. 812.) The question on appeal was whether the phrase \u201cpersonal use of a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d in section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23) encompassed an assault committed with the hands. (42 Cal.App.4th at p. 815.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">The Second Appellate District, Division Seven, concluded that \u201c. . . one equipped only with his naked hands or fists does not \u2018personally use a dangerous or deadly weapon\u2019 under . . . section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23) . . . .\u201d (42 Cal.App.4th at p. 820.) In reaching its conclusion, the court relied on the usual, ordinary, and commonsense meaning of \u201cweapon.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>at pp. 815-816.) It also traced the statutory language used in section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23) through various legislative enactments dating back to 1927 and concluding with the addition of section 1192.7 by voter approval of Proposition 8 in 1982. (42 Cal.App.4th at pp. 816-317.) The court also relied on reasoning used in other cases, including <em>People </em>v. <em>Equarte </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 456, 465-466 [229 Cal.Rptr. 116, 722 P.2d 890]. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>at pp. 817-820.)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>A concurring opinion summarized \u201cthe essence of the matter\" in language which is particularly pertinent to the issue before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-5\">\u201cSince 1872 . . . section 245 has made two quite different kinds of assaults\u2014felony assaults. Assaults \u2018with a deadly weapon or instrument\u2019 are a felony assault. So also are assaults <em>without </em>a deadly weapon or instrument but by \u2018means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.\u2019 Either type of assault may result in a felony conviction of . . . section 245, subdivision (a)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-6\">\u201cAt issue is whether or not the phrase \u2018any felony in which the defendant personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon\u2019 (. . . \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(23)) includes <em>both </em>types of felony assault described in . . . section 245, those committed with a weapon <em>and </em>those committed <em>without </em>a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-7\">\u201cI agree the most reasonable interpretation is that . . . section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23), insofar as it applies to felony assaults, refers only to those committed <em>with </em>a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-8\">\u201cIf the intent of . . . section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23) was to include <em>both </em>types of felony assault, those with and those without weapons, less apt language can hardly be imagined. Moreover, if such was the intent, apt language was at hand: the disjunctive language of section 245, subdivision (a)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-9\">\u201cBy restricting the scope of . . . section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23) to any felony where \u2018the defendant personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon\u2019 the drafters clearly exempted less serious felonies where, e.g., a defendant falsely <em>claimed </em>to have a deadly weapon and those where he used a nondangerous \u2018weapon.\u2019 It also exempted, as here, a felony where <em>no </em>weapon was used.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at pp. 820-821 (conc. opn. of Woods (Fred), J.).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">The same reasoning applies here. Section 245, subdivision (a)(1), which the <em>Davis </em>court considered, read in pertinent part: \u201c(a)(1) Any person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury . . . .\u201d At the time of Williams\u2019s 1983 offense, section 245, subdivision (b) read in pertinent part: \u201c(b) Every person who commits an assault with a deadly weapon or instrument, other than a firearm, or by any means likely to produce great bodily injury upon the person of a peace officer or fireman . . . .\u201d Under each statute, a conviction could be supported by evidence of an assault with a deadly weapon or instrument, other than a firearm, <em>or </em>by means likely to produce great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">The language used in section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23) makes a conviction under section 245, subdivision (a)(1) a serious felony only if a deadly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>weapon is personally used by the defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Equarte, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 466; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 820.) Section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(11) differs only slightly in its pertinent language from that used in subdivision (c)(23). The former applies to a specific type of assault on a specific type of individual which does not necessarily entail personal use of a weapon, as is required under section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arwood </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 167, 173 [211 Cal.Rptr. 307].) The only other difference is that subdivision (c)(11) refers to \u201ca deadly weapon or instrument\u201d while subdivision (c)(23) refers to \u201ca dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d We see no significance in this slight variation in wording. What is significant is that neither subdivision (c)(11) nor subdivision (c)(23) includes language describing convictions based on use of means likely to produce great bodily injury, but without use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or instrument. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 821 (conc. opn. of Woods (Fred), J.).) We conclude that unless there is substantial evidence that Williams\u2019s assault conviction was based on use of a deadly weapon or instrument, either personally or by an accomplice, it cannot be treated as a serious felony for purposes of the three strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\"> According to the Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343, 355-356 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150], the court may look to the entire record in determining whether a conviction under former section 245, subdivision (b) is in fact an assault with a deadly weapon or instrument on a peace officer (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(11)). As noted earlier, the record presented to the court here consisted of an abstract of judgment and a section 969b packet comprised of several certified documents from the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Williams argues the abstract of judgment fails to convey the true and complete nature of the prior because it does not show whether a deadly weapon or instrument was used. Respondent does not dispute this contention, and we agree with it. The abstract of judgment merely reflects that Williams was convicted of violating section \u201c245(b) . . . Assault Pea.Ofc.\u201d without any indication that a weapon was or was not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">The only other evidence which could possibly support a finding that a weapon was used in the assault was a notation on the Department of Corrections fingerprint card: \u201cCt. 1B, ADW on P/O (245(b) PC) (Prob Rev) CC.\u201d During the sentencing hearing the trial court referred to that notation, saying \u201cADW, which means\u2014I translate to mean assault with deadly weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">The question then is whether the fingerprint card notation, as interpreted by the trial court, is substantial evidence of the deadly weapon element. We conclude it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>The definition of substantial evidence in a criminal case is a familiar one. It is \u201cevidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 314 [270 CaLRptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643].)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">A trier of fact is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from certified records offered to prove a defendant suffered a prior conviction and served a prison term. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Haney </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 472, 475 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 547].)  Here the trial court\u2019s inference that the fingerprint card notation \u201cADW\u201d was a shorthand reference to \u201cassault with a deadly weapon\u201d appears reasonable. Our concern, however, is with the further inferences that whoever made the notation meant to differentiate between the two types of conduct which violate former section 245, subdivision (b)\u2014use of a deadly weapon or instrument extrinsic to the perpetrator\u2019s body or by means likely to produce great bodily injury\u2014and had sufficiently reliable information upon which to make that differentiation. In our opinion these further inferences are not of \u201csolid value\u201d for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">First, the fingerprint card is a record of the Department of Corrections, not the court in which the conviction occurred.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We know of no reasonable basis to believe that the Department of Corrections employee who made the notation had any information concerning the underlying conviction other than that revealed in the abstract of judgment. The abstract did not refer to use of a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Second, when the question was raised at the sentencing hearing the prosecutor expressly stated he had looked at the record of the assault case \u201ca long time ago\" and although he could not remember what was used in the assault \u201cit wasn\u2019t a deadly weapon or firearm.\u201d He later told the court that \u201c[factually I don\u2019t think a gun or a knife or anything like that [was involved].\u201d He also told the court that \u201cI don\u2019t know what they mean by instrument [in section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(ll)] and I couldn\u2019t find anything to say what they meant by instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">The prosecutor did not offer any evidence directly from the assault case file. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 217, 223-230 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 914 P.2d 184] [preliminary hearing transcripts admissible to show personal use of deadly weapon, making prior conviction of assault under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>section 245, subdivision (a)(1) a serious felony].) The Attorney General describes this failure as \u201cinexplicable.\u201d The only possible explanation we can imagine is that the prosecutor may have believed it made no difference whether Williams or an accomplice used some weapon or instrument extrinsic to the body in the assault on the peace officer\u2014that is, that an assault with the hands or feet likely to produce great bodily injury falls within the serious felony definition in section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(ll).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We have decided, <em>ante, </em>that such an assault does not constitute a serious felony. Thus, in order to prove the conviction was of a serious felony, it was the prosecution\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault involved a deadly weapon or instrument. That burden was not met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The true finding of the 1983 prior serious felony conviction must be stricken and appellant sentenced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">3.-7.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed. The matter is remanded with directions to strike the finding that appellant\u2019s prior conviction of violating former section 245, subdivision (b) was a conviction of a serious felony within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (d), and to resentence appellant in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">Vartabedian, Acting P.
