The court entered judgment finding the State was immune from liability under the Emergency Services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1806\">*1806</page-number>Act. The primary issue we address is whether the State is immune from liability under the Emergency Services Act for intentionally lying to persons about the health and safety of chemicals they handled during a state emergency to eradicate an infestation of pests. We conclude in such situations the State is not immune from intentional concealment of known dangers which cause personal injuries. We therefore reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">This case arises out of the Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) eradication program of 1989. Plaintiffs and appellants (plaintiffs) were hired by the State to hang Medfly traps by the State. Plaintiffs became ill after handling the chemical used in the traps. Plaintiffs\u2019 supervisors knowingly lied to plaintiffs about the effect of the chemical, told plaintiffs the chemical was completely safe and refused to allow plaintiffs to wear protective clothing. As a result of exposure to the chemical, plaintiffs incurred physical injuries. The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion for nonsuit after plaintiffs\u2019 opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">A. Facts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-9\">In 1989 the Medfly struck Southern California, leading the Governor to declare a state of emergency aimed at stopping the infestation. <em>(Macias </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 844, 848 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 592, 897 P.2d 530].) The Governor declared an emergency on August 9, 1989.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-10\">Plaintiffs Domingo Dominic Adkins, Dante Anthony Adkins, Dreco L. Adkins, Andre Jerome Adkins and Fernando Terence Snow, collectively referred to as plaintiffs, were hired as Medfly trappers by the California State Department of Food and Agriculture as part of the Medfly project.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs worked at the Elysian Park facility. Neil Wright and Marcella Zita supervised plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-11\">In 1981 Wright was trained by the State to use the chemical Trimedlure. Wright had used Trimedlure for eight years. Wright had a bachelor\u2019s degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1807\">*1807</page-number>in entomology, the study of insects. Although plaintiffs were high school graduates, they did not have backgrounds in science or entomology. Plaintiffs looked up to and trusted Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-4\">Plaintiffs primarily handled Jackson traps. These traps included a basket into which a plug of Trimedlure was placed. When placed into the basket, the plug was in solid form; when opened and exposed to the air, the plug crystallized. The plug was intended to lure Medflies into the trap.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">Plaintiffs were first exposed to Trimedlure when employed as Medfly trappers. Plaintiffs baited the traps at the Elysian Park facility, loaded a large number of traps onto vehicles and then put the traps in trees. Since the traps were baited before being placed in the vehicles, plaintiffs breathed escaping fumes as they drove to the various locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">Packets of Trimedlure have writing on the front and back which read: \u201c \u2018The toxicological properties of this composition have not been studied. Use with appropriate caution. . . . Refer to the material safety sheets.\u2019 \u201d Wright had material safety sheets; however, at no time did he or anyone else from the State provide them to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">Plaintiffs were not given any protective clothing. Plaintiffs asked if they could wear gloves. Wright told them gloves were not necessary and wearing protective clothing might alarm the public. Plaintiffs offered to buy gloves with their own money, but Wright told plaintiffs they could not wear them. Wright also told plaintiffs they would be fired if they wore any type of protective clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">Trimedlure is absorbed rapidly though the skin and by breathing. The longer the exposure, the worse the symptoms. Plaintiffs began to feel ill from the first day of employment. They experienced fatigue, nausea, muscle cramps, breathing problems and stomach cramps. Plaintiffs repeatedly asked Wright and Zita if Trimedlure or any other substances they were handling could be making them ill. Plaintiffs were told constantly Trimedlure was completely safe and could not make them ill. Although they continued to feel ill, plaintiffs continued to work, doing a good job. Plaintiffs\u2019 symptoms became worse, developing into rashes and the loss of hair. Due to the exposure, all plaintiffs developed neuropathy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All of plaintiffs\u2019 symptoms were the result of toxic exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-9\">Wright knew plaintiffs\u2019 symptoms could have been caused by exposure to Trimedlure. Wright intentionally withheld this information from plaintiffs. Further, Wright advised Zita not to provide any information to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1808\">*1808</page-number>While baiting a trap in February 1990, one of the Adkins plaintiffs rubbed his eye with his hand while holding a crystal; the chemicals from the crystal got into his eye severely burning it. Three days after this incident, one of the Adkins brothers was fired. Wright stated the termination was due to falsifying records, but this statement was untrue. The firing was actually because Wright was upset with the eye accident and because of plaintiffs\u2019 repeated complaints about Trimedlure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">Domingo Adkins went to the news media and discussed plaintiffs\u2019 concerns about Trimedlure. When Wright learned of the contact with the media, Domingo Adkins was fired. A few weeks later, the other plaintiffs were fired. By the end of March 1990, plaintiffs were no longer working for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">B. <em>Procedure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">Plaintiffs filed charges with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and governmental claims with the State. Both were rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-7\">Plaintiffs Domingo Dominic Adkins, Dante Anthony Adkins, Dreco L. Adkins and Andre Jerome Adkins filed a civil suit alleging causes of action for wrongful termination, employment discrimination based on physical handicap, defamation, violation of Labor Code section 1050, intentional infliction of emotional distress and fraudulent concealment. In the same lawsuit, plaintiff Fernando Terence Snow alleged causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and fraudulent concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-8\">Named as defendants in the civil complaint, and appearing as respondents on appeal, are the State of California, the California Department of Food and Agriculture, Neil Wright and Marcella Zita, collectively referred to as the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-9\">After plaintiffs\u2019 opening statement, the State brought a motion for nonsuit. The State asserted plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action were barred for a number of reasons, including immunity of a public entity under the Emergency Services Act, Government Code section 8655.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion for nonsuit ruling plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the immunity contained in the Emergency Services Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1809\">*1809</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">\u201cThe standard of review for a nonsuit after [the] conclusion of the opening statement is well settled. Both the trial court in its initial decision and the appellate court on review of that decision must accept all facts asserted in the opening statement as true and must indulge every legitimate inference which may be drawn from those facts. [Citations.] A nonsuit at this early stage of the proceedings is disfavored. [Citation.] It can only be upheld on appeal if, after accepting all the asserted facts as true and indulging every legitimate inference in favor of plaintiff, it can be said those facts and inferences lead inexorably to the conclusion plaintiff cannot establish an essential element of its cause of action or has inadvertently established uncontrovertible proof of an affirmative defense. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Abeyta </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1037, 1041 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 680]; accord, <em>Di Palma </em>v. <em>Seldman </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1499, 1505-1506 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 219].) On appeal from an order granting a nonsuit, we consider the grounds specified by the moving party in support of the motion, unless there is an incurable defect. <em>(Carson </em>v. <em>Facilities Development Co. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 830, 839 [206 Cal.Rptr. 136, 686 P.2d 656]; <em>Lawless </em>v. <em>Calaway </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 81, 92-94 [147 P.2d 604] .)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">The nonsuit here was granted solely on the grounds the Emergency Services Act provides the State with an immunity. We reverse that conclusion (pt. III).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We also conclude, in part V, plaintiffs may not go forward with their cause of action for discrimination based upon physical handicap.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1810\">*1810</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">The Emergency Services Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">A. <em>Statutory Scheme and the Medfly Emergency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">\u201cThe Mediterranean fruitfly (the \u2018Medfly\u2019) is a pest not native to California .... The pest poses a severe threat to the economy and welfare of the Sate of California and can infest over 200 varieties of fruit.\u201d <em>(Talevich </em>v. Voss (C.D.Cal. 1990) 734 F.Supp. 425, 427.) The incidents giving rise to this case occurred after the Governor, acting pursuant to his extraordinary powers under the California Emergency Services Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 8550 et seq.), declared a state of emergency due to \u201c. . . conditions of extreme peril to the agricultural industry and the safety of agricultural properties . . . caused by the discovery of an infestation of the Mediterranean Fruit Fly . . . .\u201d (Executive Dept., State of Cal., Proclamation of State of Emergency, Aug. 9, 1989, signed by Gov. George Deukmejian.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">Pursuant to a state\u2019s police powers, it may enact legislation aimed at protecting the life and health of its citizenry. The State\u2019s sovereign powers permit it to promote the order, safety, health, morals and general welfare of society. <em>(McKay Jewelers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bowron </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 595, 600 [122 P.2d 543, 139 A.L.R. 1188]; <em>People </em>v. <em>H &amp; H Properties </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 894, 900 [201 Cal.Rptr. 687].) Police powers are rooted in the law of necessity. Thus, in an emergency, the scope of permissible regulation may increase. (E.g., <em>Macias </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 854; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 693, 698 [196 Cal.Rptr. 218].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">In prior cases courts have concluded the California Emergency Services Act was a valid exercise of the State\u2019s police powers. <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 494, 501-502 [221 Cal.Rptr. 225]; <em>Macias </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 853-856.) \u201cThe California Emergency Services Act recognizes and responds to a fundamental role of government to provide broad state services in the event of emergencies resulting from conditions of disaster or of extreme peril to life, property, and the resources of the state. Its purpose is to protect and preserve health, safety, life, and property. ([Gov. Code,] \u00a7 8550 et seq.) A state of emergency may be proclaimed by the Governor under the conditions proscribed for any area affected ([Gov. Code,] \u00a7 8625). The act confers broad powers on the Governor to deal with emergencies.\u201d <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.3d at p. 696.) \u201c[T]he Emergency Services Act makes clear that in situations of \u2018extreme peril\u2019 to the public welfare the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1811\">*1811</page-number>State may exercise its sovereign authority to the fullest extent possible consistent with individual rights and liberties.\u201d <em>(Macias </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>at p. 854.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[T]here is no question that the State, in prosecuting the Medfly eradication program, was acting pursuant to its authority under the Emergency Services Act to safeguard the property and security of its citizens.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 856-857.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\">As part of an eradication program, the State is obligated by the Food and Agricultural Code to comply with strict notification requirements expressly designed for such programs. (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5029, 5771 et seq.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cUnder Food and Agricultural Code section 5029, the State Department of Food and Agriculture is required to \u2018design and implement a program to provide information to persons who reside in areas scheduled to be treated with pesticides, on an emergency basis in order to eradicate plant pests.\u2019 (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 5029, subd. (a).) As provided by statute, the purpose of the program \u2018is to provide information about the health effects of the pesticides used in eradication projects. The program shall be designed to provide the greatest amount of information practicable to affected citizens. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1812\">*1812</page-number>The department shall conduct outreach efforts to inform the public about the existence of this program.\u2019 (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 5029, subd. (b).)\u201d <em>(Macias </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 855.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">\u201cOther statutes delineate in precise and detailed terms the nature of the \u2018outreach\u2019 efforts required of the State during an eradication project.\u201d <em>(Macias </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 855.) Before aerially applying a pesticide (or economic poison) to effect the eradication, Food and Agricultural Code sections 5771, 5773 and 5774 require the State to notify residents, physicians, and the local media.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Some notices must be hand delivered. (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 5774.) The State must act promptly in providing notice and must notify if the scheduled date of application is changed. (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5772, 5775.) \u201cThe State\u2019s notices must be in both English and in any other language if over 5 percent of persons receiving the notice speak only that language. (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 5777.) [H The contents of the State\u2019s notice is also statutorily prescribed. (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 5776.) It must contain the \u2018date and approximate time\u2019 of all proposed pesticide applications, the \u2018type of economic poison\u2019 to be applied, any \u2018health and safety precautions that should be taken,\u2019 and the address and telephone numbers of \u2018public health personnel . . . familiar with the eradication program.\u2019 <em>(Ibid.) </em>In addition, the State is required to establish and operate telephone \u2018hot lines\u2019 to \u2018provide information to the public on health issues related to application of the economic poison.\u2019 (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 5778.)\u201d <em>(Macias </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>at p. 856.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">The state and counties are immune from civil actions from the administration of the notice requirements designed for eradication programs if \u201cthe director or the commissioner utilizes his or her best efforts to comply with the requirements of the article.\u201d (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 5780.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">B. <em>Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">1. <em>Immunity Under the Emergency Services Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">The State contends it is immune from civil liability under the Emergency Services Act immunity provision, Government Code section 8655. This section reads: \u201cThe state or its political subdivisions shall not be liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1813\">*1813</page-number>any claim based upon the exercise or performance, or the failure to exercise or perform, a <em>discretionary </em>function or duty on the part of a state or local agency or any employee of the state or its political subdivisions in carrying out the provisions of this chapter.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-4\">A number of cases have addressed the immunity codified in Government Code section 8655 in connection with Medfly eradication programs. In <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d 494, insurance companies sought recovery for payments made to their policy holders. The companies paid their insureds after malathion, the chemical mixture used by the State in the Medfly aerial spraying, damaged car surfaces. In discussing the negligence cause of action, <em>Farmers </em>addressed which governmental decisions are discretionary and thus covered under the immunity umbrella: \u201cIt is clear that the Governor\u2019s proclamation under express authority of Government Code section 8625, and the subsequent spraying of malathion were policy level decisions. This would be true as well with respect to the myriad decisions regarding the implementation of the program, such as the length of spraying, size of droplets, type of mixture, area to spray, etc. Since plaintiffs\u2019 claim is based directly upon these acts, section 8655 applies to provide the state with immunity from liability. The purpose of the statute is obvious. In those cases where the state must take the steps necessary to quell an emergency, it must be able to act with speed and confidence without fear of incurring tort liability. [Citation.] [&lt;H Plaintiffs take the position that the spraying of malathion was ministerial rather than discretionary conduct. A ministerial act takes place on the purely operational level rather than the policy making or planning level. [Citation.] We have no difficulty concluding as a matter of law that the acts complained of[, being negligent and careless in the formulation and spraying of the malathion mixture,] were an exercise or performance (i.e. carrying out) of a discretionary function on the part of the state. Thus the state has absolute immunity from liability for negligence under Government Code section 8655.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 505.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">In <em>LaBadie </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1366 [256 Cal.Rptr. 604], the trial court sustained a demurrer on plaintiff\u2019s one cause of action against the State for negligent misrepresentation. Plaintiff alleged she left her home during the time malathion spraying was to occur. On return to her home, she telephoned the State\u2019s telephone information service and was informed the spraying in her area was completed. Notwithstanding these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1814\">*1814</page-number>statements, the spraying continued and as a result, plaintiff suffered physical injuries. The appellate court concluded the State was immune under Government Code section 8655 because the alleged wrongful conduct was discretionary rather than ministerial. \u201cDue to mechanical difficulties, the malathion spraying could not be completed in accordance with the original schedule. A decision had to be made whether to continue to spray. Whether there was time to fully inform the public or other state information services and whether to continue the spraying are policy level decisions. [T]he acts complained of . . . were in the exercise or performance of, or the failure to perform, a discretionary function and were part of the \u2018myriad decisions regarding the implementation of the program\u2019 [citation], for which there is governmental immunity pursuant to Government Code section 8655.\u201d (208 Cal.App.3d at p. 1369.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">In <em>Macias </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 844 the Supreme Court addressed the responsibility of manufacturers to warn the public after learning governmental entities were providing defective warnings during the Medfly eradication efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\"><em>Macias </em>is instructive in resolving our issue, i.e., whether the State may be liable for intentional misrepresentation or intentional concealment of a known danger resulting in personal injuries. In <em>Macias, </em>a 14-year-old boy received injury to his eyes from malathion spraying by the State during an emergency Medfly program. The boy and his parents sued the State as well as the manufacturers of the malathion based upon a failure to warn. They alleged the health warnings actually given by the State were grossly inadequate, and differed markedly from product labeling approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA). The EPA warning followed the package labeling pointing to the dangers of malathion if allowed to contact the skin, eyes or if swallowed. In contrast, the warning flyers distributed by the State stated in relevant part: \u201c \u2018No Health Hazard: [H Malathion is considered one of the safest insecticides in use today. . . .\u2019\u201d (10 Cal.4th at pp. 848-849). The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the manufacturers and the plaintiffs appealed. The Court of Appeal reversed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1815\">*1815</page-number>finding the manufacturers had not discharged its duty to warn. When the matter was before the Supreme Court, the State was not a party to the appeal and plaintiffs\u2019 action against the State was still pending. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 852, fn. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\">The Supreme Court concluded the <em>private manufacturer </em>had no affirmative duty to warn the public about potential problems due to exposure to malathion spray. The Supreme Court emphasized that the Emergency Services Act, in conjunction with the Food and Agricultural Code designed and implemented to provide the public with certain information, made it clear the State had the responsibility of conveying the \u201c. . . most complete and accurate health information practicable to the affected citizens. (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 5029, subd. (b).) It is probably no exaggeration to state that the program\u2019s ultimate success depended upon the public\u2019s complete trust and confidence in the medical information contained in the State\u2019s official findings and public pronouncements. \u201d <em>(Macias </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 859.) The eradication program would be compromised if the public received conflicting public and private health alerts. However, while the private manufacturer had no affirmative duty, \u201c[w]e do not mean by this to suggest that the State may <em>withhold </em>critical information during an agricultural emergency to suppress public opposition.  On the contrary, the Food and Agricultural Code clearly requires full disclosure. (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 5029.)[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] [I]t is the <em>State\u2019s </em>responsibility to design and implement an informational protocol, and that responsibility, as we have seen, cannot as a practical and prudential matter be <em>divided </em>during an emergency. . . . [Thus,] the imposition of a private tort duty to warn or otherwise intervene in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1816\">*1816</page-number>these circumstances could severely compromise the State\u2019s efforts . . . <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 859-860, original italics.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">Here, the State is trying to avoid its responsibility by suggesting Goyemment Code section 8655 immunizes it for all acts, including intentional misrepresentations relating to health and safety, because such acts were discretionary. However, this approach fails to recognize the State\u2019s mandatory obligation to provide complete and accurate information and fails to recognize that the exercise of the State\u2019s police powers must be reasonable and proper under the circumstances. <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 501.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">The Legislature authorized the Governor to declare an emergency under the Emergency Services Act. However, it also spelled out in the Food and Agricultural Code specific steps the State must take to notify its citizens of critical safety information during an eradication program. The Legislature provided wide authority to the Governor to declare an emergency by the Emergency Services Act, but also mandated through the Food and Agricultural Code attendant notification responsibilities if that emergency required an eradication program. Thus, while the State had the discretion to formulate the eradication program and had the discretion to carry out that function, the State had no discretion not to use its best efforts to accurately notify its citizens of health and safety precautions to be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">Food and Agricultural Code section 5780 specifically exonerates the State from civil actions when \u201cbest efforts\u201d are used to comply with the notice requirements designed for eradication problems. Intentionally misrepresenting the toxic nature of a chemical used in the eradication program could not possibly be considered \u201cbest efforts\u201d to comply with the strict notice requirements or to comply with the State\u2019s obligation to provide complete and accurate information relating to health and safety. Unlike <em>LaBadie </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d 1366, the allegations here are not that the State made negligent misrepresentations. The lawsuit before us does not involve a request for relief based upon minor violations of the notice provisions, such as a notification delivered a few hours late or to the wrong area or written in the wrong language. The State would be immune for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1817\">*1817</page-number>these type of errors as they would be an exercise or performance of a discretionary function. <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 505.) Rather, plaintiffs allege the State knew Trimedlure could cause the symptoms being suffered by plaintiffs, specifically withheld the material safety sheets from plaintiffs which may have given plaintiffs that information, lied to plaintiffs when asked if the chemical was safe, rejected plaintiffs\u2019 pleas to wear protective clothing for fear of alarming the public and fired plaintiffs for discussing those fears and informing the media of their concerns. The error complained of in this case, if proved, is a purposeful attempt to subvert the State\u2019s responsibility to provide accurate information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\">We recognize in a state of emergency it is imperative the State must be able to act with haste in exercising its sovereign powers to protect the public. <em>(Macias </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 856.) However, in exercising that power in situations in which the State is also obligated to provide accurate information to the public in the context of an eradication program, there can be no reason for the State to purposefully withhold health and safety information from persons most likely to be injured. The State cannot thwart plaintiffs\u2019 claims by labeling their actions as \u201cdiscretionary acts\u201d or acts which are but a \u201cmyriad of decisions regarding the implementation of the Medfly program.\u201d The statutes do not provide the State with any decisionmaking in this arena. The State is required to use its best efforts to provide accurate and complete health and safety information; no decision-making is required.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, the Emergency Services Act does not immunize the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">2. <em>Immunity Under the Government Codes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">The Government Codes discussing governmental tort liability supports our conclusion the State is not immune for an actual misrepresentation resulting in personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">Under the Government Tort Claims Act, \u201cgovernmental tort liability must be based on statute; all common law or judicially declared forms of tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1818\">*1818</page-number>liability, except as may be required by state or federal Constitution, were abolished.

The Government Code does not define \u2018misrepresentation[]\u2019[; however,] courts have assumed that the immunity includes all types of fraud and deceit cases including fraudulent concealment.

Rather, it applies only when the negligent or intentional wrongdoing involves interferences with financial or commercial interests. <em>(Garcia </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 728, 738, fn. 8 [268 Cal.Rptr. 779, 789 P.2d 960]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 782, 800 [73 Cal.Rptr. 240, 447 P.2d 352] clarified on another point in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 741 [167 Cal.Rptr. 70, 614 P.2d 728, 12 A.L.R.4th 701]; <em>Michael J. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Dept. of Adoptions, supra, </em>201 Cal.App.3d at p. 867.)

(Cf. <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 738, fn. 8 [plaintiff may be able to state cause of action when parole officer knowing parolee is a danger to plaintiff\u2019s safety makes a misrepresentation].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-4\">Here, the intentional misrepresentations were not related to a commercial or financial transaction. Rather, plaintiffs alleged they were personally injured due to the intentional concealment of health and safety information. When the Legislature enacted the Government Torts Claims Act it narrowly proscribed when a public entity could be responsible for misrepresentations. Under the Government Tort Claims Act, governmental entities such as the State would not be immunized for the misrepresentations alleged to have occurred here as they related to a risk of physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">Because the immunity contained in the Emergency Services Act is broader than that contained in the Government Tort Claims Act (cf. <em>LaBadie </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d at p. 1369), the State is immune for negligent misrepresentations. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1368.) However, when the misrepresentation is intentional and relates to physical safety, the State is not immune from liability.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">Governmental Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">Discrimination Based Upon Physical Handicap</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">In addition to the facts delineated above, plaintiffs alleged, in their complaint or in their opening statement, that the State punished them for seeking medical attention for their ailments caused by the chemicals, first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1820\">*1820</page-number>through harassment and intimidation while plaintiffs were employees, and subsequently by terminating their employment. Based upon these allegations, plaintiffs asserted a cause of action for discrimination based upon physical handicap.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">The State contends the cause of action for discrimination based upon a physical handicap is precluded because plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive remedy for this cause of action is workers\u2019 compensation. This contention is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">Government Code section 12940 makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee for a number of things, including physical handicap.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">\u201cSection 3600 of the Labor Code provides that an employer is liable for injuries to its employees arising out of and in the course of employment, and section 3601 declares that where the conditions of workers\u2019 compensation exist, the right to recover such compensation is the exclusive remedy against an employer for injury or death of an employee.\u201d <em>(Johns-Manville Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 465, 467-468 [165 Cal.Rptr. 858, 612 P.2d 948, 9 A.L.R.4th 758], fn. omitted.) Thus, \u201c[a]s a general rule, an employee injured in the course of employment is limited to the remedies available under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Lockheed Corp. </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 519, 521 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 233].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">A number of cases have addressed whether workers\u2019 compensation is the exclusive remedy for an employee discriminatorily terminated due to a physical handicap arising from a work related injury.

Workers\u2019 compensation is based upon a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d The Legislature has balanced the benefits and burdens to employers and employees. Employees receive payment for injuries in the work place without having to prove fault and employers receive an exemption from civil suit. Workers\u2019 compensation is intended to include all claims for all risks reasonably encompassed within the compensation bargain. Tort claims are permitted when injuries occur while the employee performs services incidental to the employment and which are viewed as risks of employment. Labor Code section 132a provides for an increase in compensation to any employee discriminated against as a result of an injury incurred in the course and scope of employment.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Labor Code section 132a applies only to injured workers. Unlike other situations, such as when an employee is discriminated against in violation of the whistle-blower statutes <em>(Shoemaker </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 20-23 [276 Cal.Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054]; <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 713 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 665]), with the enactment of Labor Code section 132a the Legislature specifically intended claims of discrimination based upon physical injury to be included within the workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1822\">*1822</page-number>scheme.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus, Labor Code section 132a is the only remedy for an employer\u2019s discriminatory actions against an employee based upon a work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">Plaintiffs may not proceed with their claim for discrimination based upon physical handicap.

Plaintiffs are not suggesting their cause of action is based solely upon specific Food and Agricultural Code notice requirements. Rather, plaintiffs suggest the notice scheme shows the Legislature\u2019s intent to command the State to provide accurate information.
