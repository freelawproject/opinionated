Babcock, the mortgagee under a first mortgage of the same property, and the William W. Babcock Company, a corporation, the assignee of the first mortgage, which had foreclosed that mortgage and sold the property under a power of sale in the mortgage, for an accounting, alleging that the defendants had included in the amount claimed to be due under the first mortgage certain items which should not have been so included, and praying that the surplus in the hands of the defendants over the amount actually due under the first mortgage might be paid over to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\">In the Superior Court the case was referred to George D. Burrage, Esquire, as master. A part of the master\u2019s report was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\">No contention was made by the defendants, or any of them, that the rights of Any <em>Iona fide </em>holders for value without notice had intervened as against the plaintiff\u2019s rights if he had any, and the case was treated and argued as if Babcock was the sole defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-8\">On November 5, 1908, the plaintiff was the owner of certain real estate on Lindsey Street in Dorchester. This and other real estate then was subject to a first mortgage for $4,200 held by the Roxbury Institution for Savings, and to a second mortgage for $800 held by one Charles G. Smith. Arrangements having been made with the holders for the subsequent release of these mortgages as far as the real estate in question was concerned for $2,800, the plaintiff conveyed such real estate, subject to these mortgages, to one Abner N. Garland, by deed dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>November 5, 1903. This deed contained the following recital: \u201c This conveyance is subject to mortgages of 2300 dollars to the Eoxbury Institution of Savings and Charles G. Smith, and to all municipal liens and assessments,\u201d the parties agreeing that the mortgage incumbrances above mentioned should be thus apportioned. By a mortgage of the same date, in the usual form, Garland mortgaged a portion of the real estate so conveyed- to him to the defendant Babcock for $5,000; and by a mortgage of the same date in the usual form again mortgaged the same portion to the plaintiff for $500, \u201csubject to a mortgage of $5,000 to William W. Babcock of even date herewith.\u201d The deed to Garland, and the two mortgages by Garland to Babcock and the plaintiff, respectively, were all recorded together on November 6, 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\">The remaining portion of the land conveyed by the plaintiff to Garland was mortgaged by Garland to one McKenney for $5,000, and, subject to the mortgage to McKenney, was mortgaged to the plaintiff for $500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-6\">The $2,300 necessary to pay off the mortgages to the Eoxbury Institution and to Smith, above mentioned, was to be raised as follows: $1,100 out of the consideration of each of the two first mortgages to Babcock and McKenney, respectively, and the remaining $100 to be paid by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-7\">The price at which the land sold to Garland was taken by him was $3,200; and the second mortgages for $500 each, given to the plaintiff, were taken by him as payment for his equity in the land. At the time he took the first mortgage Babcock knew that the plaintiff was taking back a second mortgage to pay for the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-8\">The mortgages to the Eoxbury Institution and to Smith after-wards were released as far as this land was concerned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-9\">No part of the consideration for the mortgage to the defendant Babcock was paid when the mortgage and note were delivered, but an agreement was executed and delivered at that time in regard to the payment of the consideration. This agreement provided in substance that the $5,000 should be paid in six instalments as the building which it was contemplated to erect on the premises should reach certain stages of completion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-10\">Certain sums were paid by the defendant Babcock, from time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>to time, on account of the consideration for the first mortgage.

On the same day on which the latter mortgage was delivered and before such delivery Babcock and McKenney, at the request of Garland, assigned the mortgageon Lot 57 for $5,000. At that time there was due on the mortgage so assigned $5,494. It was agreed orally between Garland, the defendant Babcock and McKenney that the $494 due on the mortgage on Lot 57 over and above the $5,000 received for such mortgage should be covered and secured, one half by the mortgage taken by Babcock, dealt with in this suit, and the other half by the mortgage taken by McKenney on the adjoining real estate, as hereinbefore set forth; and that the $247 to be secured by the Babcock mortgage should be deducted from the first instalment to be paid on account of the consideration thereof. Promissory notes were taken by the defendant Babcock and by McKenney, each for $247, and on November 28, 1903, the note held by the defendant Babcock was surrendered to Garland, and the charge of $247 covered by this item was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-9\">The plaintiff contended that this transaction was, in effect, the payment of a prior debt of Garland\u2019s; and that the defendant Babcock had, as against the plaintiff, no right to include the $247 in the account; that the first mortgage was a \u201c construction loan mortgage,\u201d so called; and that Garland and the defendant Babcock had no right to agree that such construction loan mortgage should cover and be security for any amount other than amounts actually expended in connection with the building of the house contemplated by the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-10\">\u201c I find that the Babcock mortgage was in the usual form; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>the consideration was recited to be \u2018$5,000 paid by William W. Babcock \u2019; that the condition was for the payment of \u2018 $5,000 in four months from this date with interest monthly at the rate of l-] per cent per month\u2019; and that there were no other or special provisions in regard to the consideration, or the manner of its payment, contained in the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\">\u201c I find that there was no statement or representation by the defendants, or any of them, made to the plaintiff that the first mortgage was a \u2018 construction loan mortgage \u2019; and that there was no statement or representation whatever made to the plaintiff by the defendants, or any of them, in regard to the consideration of the first mortgage or the manner of its payment. I find that the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage recited that it was \u2018 subject to a mortgage of $5,000 to William W. Babcock of even date herewith \u2019; and that the agreement in regard to the consideration was not recorded and was not in any other way brought to the attention of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-6\">\u201c I find that the agreement between\u201eGarland and Babcock that the amount in question should be covered and secured by the mortgage which Garland was about to give was made in good faith; that such agreement on the part of Garland was part of the consideration for the taking of such mortgage by Babcock; and that the assignment of the mortgage on Lot 57 for $5,000 (being less than the amount then due on the mortgage) was. made in part consideration of the agreement that the $247 was to be secured by the new mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-7\">\u201c I find and rule that this item was included properly in the account.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-8\">Item 11 was a charge for a premium on a policy of fire insurance on the house for three years paid by Babcock.

On the facts found by the master, the fourth item in the defendant\u2019s account for $247 was rightly allowed. This amount was really paid by Babcock to Garland in the manner agreed upon between them when the mortgage was given. The fallacy of the plaintiff\u2019s argument is in its assumption that it was the duty of Babcock to see to _it that what he advanced under the mortgage went, after the dischai\u2019ge of the previous mortgages, to pay for the expenses of improving the property by erecting a building thereon. But this is not so, nor did Babcock owe any duty to the plaintiff to see that this should be so. Even independently of his oral agreement with Garland, he was to make advances to Garland when the building to be erected by the latter should have reached certain stages of completion; Garland might make such application of the advances as he should choose. If Babcock had so advanced $247 more than he did, and then Garland had paid Babcock that sum for the other indebtedness, either out of the money so advanced or from other resources, the result would have been the same; but the plaintiff could have made no complaint. The plaintiff has lost nothing by having that done directly which might have been done indirectly. But besides this the master has found that Babcock\u2019s mortgage was taken with the express agreement that this item should be secured by it, and that only subject to this agreement was it what is popularly called a \u201c construction loan mortgage.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s claim could not be supported without affirming that a first mortgagee who learns that part of the purchase money is secured by a second mortgage must at his peril see that all his future advances are applied to increasing the value of the property. None of the authorities cited by the plaintiff go to this length; and we are not willing to take such a positon. <em>Johnson, </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>129 Mass. 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>2. The Superior Court was right in its ruling as to interest. Garland had agreed to pay interest on the full amount of $5,000. This appears by the terms of both the note and the contemporaneous agreement between them. As Babcock was required to keep the full amount in readiness, this was necessary to his full compensation. But when Garland went into bankruptcy Babcock\u2019s duty to make further advances ceased; and, as against the plaintiff at any rate, he no longer should be allowed interest on anything more than the amount actually advanced. <em>Bangs </em>v. <em>Fallon, </em>179 Mass. 77. <em>Lewin </em>v. Folsom, 171 Mass. 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">No other questions were argued before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
