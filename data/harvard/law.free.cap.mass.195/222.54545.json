J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASo\">At the last annual election in the town of Plymouth, the votes upon the question, \u201c Shall licenses be granted for the sale of intoxicating liquors in this town ? \u201d were counted by the tellers, who reported that six hundred and thirty-six ballots had been cast in the affirmative, and six hundred and thirty-seven in the negative, and that there were thirty-eight blank ballots. Two days later a petition for a recount of these ballots was filed with the town clerk, and, accordingly, the registrars of voters, who are the respondents in this suit, recounted them. In their certificate they declared and certified the vote on this question to be six hundred and thirty-eight ballots in the affirmative, six hundred and thirty-seven in the i negative, and thirty-six blank ballots. It appears that, among the ballots counted as affirmative, there is one that shows, in the square opposite to the word \u201c Yes \u201d which follows the question, a diagonal mark, and nothing more. In this ballot it appears that, in voting for town officers, the voter made a cross in the squares opposite the names of the officers for whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>he voted, showing that he was of sufficient intelligence clearly and legally to indicate his choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\">This is a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the registrars of voters not to count this ballot, and to make and file with the town clerk a new and amended certificate of the recount of ballots, in which it shall be stated that the total number of votes in the affirmative on said question was six hundred and thirty-seven, and the total number of votes in the negative was six hundred and thirty-seven, and that the number of blank ballots was thirty-seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The petitioner is a voter and taxpayer of the town, and the first question raised is whether he is a proper party to invoke a remedy of this kind. It is contended that, to maintain a petition for a writ of mandamus, he should have a private right or interest in the matter, beyond the right and interest of all the citizens of the town. The proposition contended for has sometimes been stated as the rule, and it is correct in its application to some cases. See <em>Wellington, petitioner, </em>16 Pick. 87, 105; <em>Pearsons </em>v. <em>Ranlett, </em>110 Mass. 118, 126. The general doctrine is stated in High, Ex. Leg. Rem. (3d ed.) \u00a7 431, as follows : \u201c When the question is one of public right and the object of the mandamus is to procure the enforcement of a public duty, the people are regarded as the real party in interest, and the relator at whose instigation the proceedings are instituted need not show that he has any legal or special interest in the result, it being sufficient to show that he is a citizen and as such interested in the execution of the laws.\u201d In support of this proposition he cites cases from many States, although decisions from four States are cited to the contrary. This is the rule applied in <em>Union Pacific Railroad </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>91 U. S. 343, 354, 355, and, as shown in that case, it prevails also in England. See <em>The King </em>v. <em>Severn Wye Railway, </em>2 B. &amp; Aid. 646; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Westmorland, </em>1 Wils. 138; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>14 East, 395 ; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Cumberland, </em>1 M. &amp; S. 190. In <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>123 Mass. 460, 479, Chief Justice Gray says: \u201cThere is a great weight of American authority in favor of the doctrine that any private person may move, without the intervention of the attorney general, for a writ of mandamus to enforce a public duty not due to the government as such,\u201d and he inti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>mates, without deciding, that this is the law of Massachusetts. See <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Mayor \u00a7 Aldermen of </em>Charlestown, 2 Gray, 84; <em>Larcom </em>v. <em>Olin, </em>160 Mass. 102,110. Inasmuch as the proceedings are instituted under our statute by a petition, and the trial is usually had upon the petition, there is a peculiar reason why the general rule should apply in this Commonwealth. R. L. c. 192, \u00a7 5. In regard to the question whether licenses shall be granted for the sale of intoxicating liquors in Plymouth, no private right is involved, as distinguished from that of all the inhabitants of the town. The petitioner is a proper party to sue for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj54\">The single justice was unable to find as a fact that the diagonal mark constituted a cross, or indicated that the voter intended to vote and had voted \u201c Yes \u201d upon the question submitted. He found that \u201cthe voter either may have intended to vote \u2018Yes,\u2019 and then failed to complete the cross necessary to express his purpose; or he may have begun with such an intention, and then concluded not to do so, when, instead of erasing or crossing out the mark already made, he left it as it appears.\u201d Having found that the ballot was defective, and improperly counted, he ordered a peremptory writ of mandamus to issue, and reported the questions of law to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">That a writ of mandamus is the proper remedy in a case of this kind was decided, after full consideration, in <em>Flanders </em>v. Roberts, 182 Mass. 524. See also <em>Keough </em>v. Holyoke, 156 Mass. 403; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>180 Mass. 382; <em>Blackmer </em>v. Hildreth, 181 Mass, 29; <em>O</em>\u2019 <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>177 Mass. 518. The R. L. c. 11, \u00a7 421, which gives the courts \u201c jurisdiction at law or in equity to enforce the provisions of this chapter,\u201d etc., includes jurisdiction in the Supreme Judicial Court to issue a writ of mandamus in a proper case. The facts and the appropriate remedy in <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>180 Mass. 547, relied on by the respondents, were very different from those in <em>Flanders </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>and from those in the present case. The decision in <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hull </em>was simply that the court will not issue a writ of mandamus in a case where an appropriate and effectual remedy in equity is given by the statute. In a case like the present, the remedy in equity referred to in the statute was not intended to take the place of a remedy by a writ of mandamus, and it would not be adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The findings of the judge in regard to the ballot were well warranted. The manner of voting in a case of this kind is by the voter\u2019s \u201c making a cross in the square at the right of the answer which he intends to give,\u201d as prescribed by the R. L. c. 11, \u00a7 227. The voter failed to do this. His intent, and the reason for his failure to express it, are left to mere conjecture. The difficulty of finding an intention to vote in a particular way, when the intention is not expressed as prescribed by the statute, is pointed out in <em>Flanders </em>v. Roberts, 182 Mass. 524, and in the numerous decisions there cited. See also <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. Mathews, 177 Mass. 518. In the R. L. c. 11, \u00a7 288, it is expressly provided that a ballot shall not be counted if the voter\u2019s \u201cchoice cannot be determined.\u201d There was no error of law in the rulings or findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\n<em>Peremptory writ of mandamus to issue.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
