L. c. 159, \u00a7 3, cl. 7, as amended by St. 1902, c. 544, \u00a7 23, the rule of <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Mass. 58, that a temporary injunction on a bill to reach and apply equitable assets of the principal defendant in payment of his debt to the plaintiff issued more than four months before an adjudication of bankruptcy creates a lien good against the trustee in bankruptcy, applies to the interest of the principal defendant in a partnership adjudicated bankrupt which is contingent on there being assets of the partnership in excess of the partnership debts.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b30-12\">A temporary injunction issued in a suit in equity under R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 3, cl. 7, as amended by St. 1902, c. 544, \u00a7 23, to reach and apply in payment of a debt to the plaintiff, not reduced to a judgment, the interest of the principal defendant in a certain partnership, merely enjoins the withdrawal of any part of the principal defendant\u2019s share or interest in the business of the partnership and does not forbid the further prosecution of that business, and the defendant partners may carry on their business as before, may dispose of their stock and buy new merchandise, may pay off old debts and incur new ones, and the shares of all the partners remain subject to the ordinary hazards of business. The interest of the principal defendant which the plaintiff can reach by his bill is only in such surplus as may remain after all the partnership debts new as well as old have been discharged, and whether there is such a surplus must be determined by the settlement of all debts and accounts of the partnership in existence when the court interposes and takes possession of the partnership property through a receiver appointed to wind up the partnership affairs.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>In a suit under B. L. c. 159, \u00a7 3, cl. 7, as amended by St. 1902, c. 544, \u00a7 23, to reach and apply in payment of a debt to the plaintiff, not reduced to a judgment, the interest of the principal defendant in a certain partnership, a temporary injunction issued. Later a final decree was made establishing the debt and ordering the application to its payment of the interest of the principal defendant in the partnership, and still later a receiver of the property of the partnership was appointed. About two years after the issuing of the temporary injunction the partnership was adjudicated bankrupt, and the trustee in bankruptcy of the partnership filed an intervening petition in the suit, praying that the receiver should be ordered to deliver the property to him. <em>Held, </em>that if the parties could agree that the final liquidation of the partnership would show that the partnership property was insufficient to pay the partnership debts, the receiver after the payment of his fees and charges should turn over the property and assets in his hands to the trustee in bankruptcy; that if, on the other hand, the parties should agree that after the liquidation of the partnership there would be a balance left in which the principal defendant had an interest, the application of the trustee in bankruptcy should be denied, and the receiver should proceed to wind up the business, so far at any rate as to determine the value of the interest of the principal defendant in the balance, and to pay the amount of that interest to the plaintiff so far as necessary to satisfy his demand, and then should turn over the remainder of the balance to the trustee in bankruptcy; but that, if the parties were unable to agree whether there would be a balance or not, the trustee in bankruptcy must be allowed to become a party to the suit, and the receiver must wind up the partnership business, and the amount of the partnership debts must be ascertained, before final action could be taken; and that in any event the disbursements made by the receiver and the proper fees for his services should be ascertained and he should not be ordered to turn over the property in his hands until these had been paid either out of the fund or otherwise.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b31-5\">In a suit in equity under B. L. c. 159, \u00a7 3, cl. 7, as amended by St. 1902, c. 544, \u00a7 23, to reach and apply in payment of a debt to the plaintiff, not reduced to a judgment, the interest of the principal defendant in a certain partnership maintaining a store in Boston, a temporary injunction issued enjoining the withdrawal of the principal defendant\u2019s share or interest in the business of the partnership but not enjoining the defendant partners from carrying on their business or forbidding them to carry on stores in other places. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant partners after the issuing of the temporary injunction withdrew a part of the partnership assets in cash and merchandise and employed such assets in carrying on a store in a city outside the Commonwealth. <em>Held, </em>that whether the business done in the store outside the Commonwealth should be included in determining the value of the share of the principal defendant in the assets of the partnership depended on whether the business carried on in the city outside the Commonwealth should be found to be simply an extension of the original partnership business, as alleged by the plaintiff, or whether, although carried on by the same partners, it was a new and independent venture unconnected with the original partnership.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-6\">Bill in equity, filed in the Supreme Judicial Court on February 5, 1904, under R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 3, cl. 7, to reach and apply to the payment of a debt owed by the defendant Ray to the plaintiff the interest of Ray in a partnership called the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>George W. McPherson Store Company and in shares of stock held by Ray in a corporation called the Coe-Ray-Creelman Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\">On February 6, 1904, a temporary injunction was ordered, and a writ of injunction issued, restraining the defendants from the sale, withdrawal or other disposition of any portion of the defendant Ray\u2019s share or interest as a copartner in the property of the partnership of the George W. McPherson Store Company until further order of the court or of some justice thereof. The writ of injunction was served upon each of the defendants upon the same day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-6\">The case was heard by <em>Lathrop, </em>J., who on June 27,1904, made a decree establishing the debt in the sum of $5,484.76, which the defendant Ray was ordered to pay, and ordering that upon its non-payment the interest of the defendant Ray in the partnership be reached and applied as prayed for in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-7\">The defendant appealed, and this court in a decision reported in 189 Mass. 112 ordered that the decree be confirmed. On September 19, 1905, a final decree was entered in accordance with the rescript. On December 22, 1905, upon motion of the plaintiff a receiver of the property of the partnership was appointed, who took possession of the property and thereafter held it. On January 11, 1906, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against the partnership, the partnership was adjudged bankrupt and Frank M. Hill was appointed trustee in bankruptcy of the partnership. Thereafter Hill, as such trustee, filed an intervening petition in the suit, praying that the receiver be ordered to deliver the property to him. This petition and the answer of the plaintiff thereto were referred to Winfield S. Slocum, Esquire, as master, to hear the parties and their evidence, to find the facts and to report them to the court. The master filed a report concluding as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-8\">\u201c The plaintiff contended that by virtue of the temporary injunction of February 6, and the final decree entered June 27, 1904 (each more than four months before the proceedings in bankruptcy), he was entitled to have the assets held and applied to the satisfaction of his debt as against the trustee in bankruptcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-9\">\u201c I admitted evidence as to the value of the property of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>firm upon each of the dates of February 6 and June 27, to determine whether there , was any valuable interest therein of the defendant Ray which could be applied in satisfaction of the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">\u201c This evidence was admitted against the objection of th\u00e9 petitioner, the trustee in bankruptcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-6\">\u201c The business was dealing in furnishing goods, hats, caps and like property in a store at the corner of Hanover Street and Elm Street in Boston, and had been for a long time established there.

We regard this question as settled by the decisions in <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Mass. 58, <em>Metcalf </em>v. Barker, 187 U. S. 165, and <em>Pickens </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>187 U. S. 177. And see 5 Cyc. 865, and the cases there cited. It was assumed that this was the correct rule in <em>Mauran </em>v. <em>Crown Carpet Lining Co. </em>23 R. I. 324; 6 Am. Bankr. Rep. 734, relied on by the trustee in bankruptcy, though there the equitable lien did not avail because it antedated the bankruptcy proceedings by less than four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">But the trustee in bankruptcy contends that the rule of <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Smith, ubi supra, </em>ought not to govern this case, because here no tangible assets have been attached, but simply an interest depending upon a contingency. J3e contends that there was no tangible thing to which the lien could attach itself, and draws the inference that for this reason there could be no lien in existence. But this conclusion does not follow. There is no greater difficulty in attaching an equitable lien to an interest which, though contingent, is hereafter to be worked out and made tangible by proceedings in equity, than there is in attaching a common law lien to a tangible and visible entity. So the ordinary attorney\u2019s lien upon a judgment obtained by him may be extended by statute to cover a mere cause of action upon its being put in suit. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chicago, Bock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad, </em>56 Iowa, 720. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Anders, </em>5 Bush, 601. <em>Kansas Pacific Railway </em>v. <em>Thacher, </em>17 Kans. 92. Our statute expressly provides that in such a suit as this, <em>\u201c </em>the interest of the defendant in partnership property may be reached and applied in payment of the plaintiff\u2019s debt.\u201d R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 3, cl. 7. St. 1902, c. 544, \u00a7 23. Bull effect could not be given to this statute and the legislative intent would be frustrated if it should be held that the rule of <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Smith </em>did not cover such a proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The interest of Ray which was held by this process was manifestly his share in the partnership, that is, the balance which would become due to him after the payment of all the firm debts and the adjustment of the accounts of the partners. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Rawson, </em>185 Mass. 264, 272. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>McGruinness, </em>173 Mass. 170, 172. <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Royce, </em>132 Mass. 594. <em>Tobey </em>v. <em>McFarlin, </em>115 Mass. 98. <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Hunkins, </em>14 Allen, 15, 17. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>7 Cush. 386. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Wells, 22 </em>Pick. 450, 455, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>456. <em>Hawes </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>18 Pick. 451. The statute which gives this remedy expressly provides that unless the bill is brought to recover a judgment debt, \u201c the business of the partnership shall not be enjoined or otherwise interrupted further than to restrain the withdrawal of any portion of the debtor\u2019s share or interest therein until the plaintiff\u2019s debt is established.\u201d R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 3, cl. 7. St. 1902, c. 544, \u00a7 23. In this case, accordingly, the injunction issued did not forbid the further prosecution of the business; and the defendants were at liberty, until the receiver was appointed on December 22, 1905, to carry on their business as before, and the-right to dispose of their stock and buy new merchandise, to pay off old debts and to incur new ones continued; and the interest of both partners remained subject to the ordinary hazards of business. Plainly the rights of new partnership creditors whose claims accrued in the meantime must be superior to the rights of either partner; and it is equally plain that the plaintiff can hold the interest of Ray only as that interest wah found to be, when the court finally interposed, took hold of the partnership property through its receiver, and proceeded to wind up the partnership affairs, and so to reach an actual determination of the amount of Ray\u2019s interest, \u2014 the amount to which he would be entitled after payment of all the firm debts and a settlement of all the partnership accounts. If there is found to be any such interest in existence, the plaintiff is entitled to hold it; if not, the plaintiff\u2019s lien is lost by the destruction of the fund upon which it was a charge. The value of Ray\u2019s interest must therefore be settled as of the time when it can be actually determined, that is, at the time when the result of the liquidation of all partnership accounts shall have been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">It may be that the present state of affairs is such as to make it now evident to the parties whether the final liquidation of the partnership will show that the firm property is insufficient to pay the firm debts or whether there will be a- balance left belonging to Ray which the plaintiff can hold. If the former is the case, then, subject , to the payment of his fees and charges, the receiver appointed by the justice of this court should turn over the property and assets in his hands to the trustee in bankruptcy. <em>Mauran </em>v. <em>Crown Carpet Lining Co. </em>23 R. I. 324. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Gafford, </em>78 Iowa, 65. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Parr, </em>115 Ga. 629. <em>Matter of Lengert Wagon Co. </em>6 Am. Bankr. Rep. 535. <em>In re Lesser, </em>100 Fed. Rep. 433. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Walton &amp; Whann Co. </em>64 Fed. Rep. 664. <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Davis Pyrites Co. </em>67 Fed. Rep. 45. If the latter is the fact, the application of the trustee in bankruptcy should be denied, and the receiver should proceed to wind up the business, so far at any rate as to determine the value of the defendant Ray\u2019s interest; and the amount of that interest should be paid to the plaintiff so far as necessary to satisfy his demand, and the balance of Ray\u2019s interest and the whole interest of the other partner should be turned over to the trustee in bankruptcy. If however the parties are unable to agree which of these alternatives will turn out to be the true one, then, in order to preserve the rights of all parties, the trustee in bankruptcy must be allowed to become a party to the case as in <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Mass. 58, and the receiver must wind up the partnership business, and the amount of the partnership debts must be ascertained; and then final action may be had in the manner already stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">For the determination of the issues now involved it does not seem to be material to ascertain whether either of the defendants has been guilty of any breach of the injunction issued in the action. If such is the case, the court, upon the matter being brought to its attention in the proper way, will be able to vindicate its authority. Nor have we before us the means of determining the effect of the opening of the George Oliver store by the defendants in another State, if this is the fact. They were not enjoined from carrying on their business; they were not forbidden to open other stores in other places, even beyond the jurisdiction of our State courts. Whether the business done in Pawtucket, if there was such business, should be brought into the firm accounts in the case to affect the value of the defendant Ray\u2019s share must depend upon whether it shall be found that this business was simply an extension of the original firm business, or whether, though carried on by the same partners, it was in fact a new and independent venture, wholly unconnected with the original partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In any event, the receiver\u2019s proper fees for his services, and his disbursements, should be ascertained; and he should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ordered to turn over the property in his hands to the trustee in bankruptcy until these have been paid, either out of the fund or otherwise. <em>Wilson </em>v.
