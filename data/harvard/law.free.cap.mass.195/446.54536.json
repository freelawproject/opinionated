At these elections John F. Tobin and Thomas B. Hickey, the petitioner, were the only candidates for president, and Collis Lovely and Charles P. Murray, the petitioner, were the only candidates for .vice-president, and these four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>were all members of the union, 'qualified to serve as president and vice-president, if elected. The ballots cast at the local unions were sent to the general offices in Boston, and there came into the hands of Michael H. Lydon, Edgar Y. Lucas and Walter H. Edmonds, who were, at the time of the returns of these votes, the lawfully constitued board of inspectors of elections, provided for by section 20 of the constitution. This board met in accordance with section 20 and voted by a majority vote to make a report to the general secretary-treasurer declaring the petitioners elected general president and general vice-president respectively. Michael H. Lydon, who voted against the making of such report, sent to the general secretary-treasurer a \u201c minority report \u201d setting forth various irregularities in the election, particularly as to local unions numbered 44 and 192, and stating:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-5\">\u201c If this ballot is to stand, I would throw out the entire vote of Unions No. 44 and No. 192 as being the most flagrant cases of wholesale fraud, and would declare the following results:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-6\">\u201c For General President\u2014 John F.

There have not been two reports submitted by the general inspectors. The constitution provided that they shall \u2018 prepare a report.\u2019 It does not provide for the submission of two reports by them, and a so-called minority report of the dissenting members is not a report of the general inspectors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-5\">\u201c The general executive board has no authority to pass upon, revise or affect in any way the report of the general inspectors of election; and if you attempt to interfere with or nullify in any way the report of the general inspectors of election, I will invoke the aid of the courts to protect and inforce my rights, and the rights of the people who have elected me general president of the Boot and Shoe Workers Union.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-6\">The general executive board held its meeting on October 24 and 25, 1906, the two reports from the general inspectors of election and the letter from the petitioner Hickey were read and, the candidates Tobin and Lovely having authorized a statement to the board that they would abide by any decision that the board might make other than declaring them, Tobin and Lovely, elected to office, the board after extended deliberation voted to \u201c sustain the appeal of M. H. Lydon and order a new election to fill the offices of general president and general vice-president, the same candidates to contest,\u201d and subsequently ordered such election to be held on December 6, 1906, giving notice to the local unions on October 29, 1906. On the latter date the secretary of the general board of inspectors wrote to the petitioner Hickey as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-7\">\u201c Dear Sir: A canvass of national election of 1906 by General Inspectors of Election shows that you have been elected President of the Boot and Shoe Workers Union.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-8\">\u201c Edgar Y.

Parker, (J. W- McAnarney </em>with him,) for the petitioners.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-7\"><em>L. D. Brand\u00e9is, (B. S. Groulston </em>with him,) for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b474-8\">Sheldon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AD3\">If we assume that a writ of mandamus may properly be issued to secure possession of such offices as are here in question, and that these petitions could be brought against the respondent alone although this would involve passing upon the rights of Tobin and Lovely without their being made parties or having any opportunity to be heard, yet we are of opinion that the petitions cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The rights of all the members of this voluntary association must be settled according to the provisions of the constitution which they have adopted. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Boyal </em>Arcanum, 192 Mass. 150. Accordingly, before these petitioners can invoke the aid of the court to secure them in the offices to which they severally claim to have been elected, it must be shown that they have exhausted the remedies available to them within the association and according to its rules. <em>Oliver </em>v. Hopkins, 144 Mass. 175. <em>Karcher </em>v. <em>Knights of Honor, </em>187 Mass. 368. <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>129 Mass. 70. The general inspectors of elections have counted and passed upon the ballots cast at the election at which the petitioners claim to have been elected, and have made a majority and a minority report thereof. The general executive board have passed upon these reports, and have ordered a new election. The power of the board to take this action under the circumstances of these cases is disputed, and has been argued with much learning and at considerable length. But we have not found it necessary to pass upon this question ; for if the action of the board was wrong, whether because they had no jurisdiction of the question or because they took an erroneous view of either the law or the facts, there was a further remedy open to the petitioners under the constitution by appeal under \u00a7 106 to a convention to be held under \u00a7 108. It is impossible to read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>this constitution without seeing plainly that it was intended and purported to supply a full system of government by which the rights of all its members and the rights and duties of all its officers among themselves should be determined and regulated, under the management and control of the general executive board, which, according to \u00a7 8, is to decide all questions of usage wherein the constitution is silent, but with a final and complete control in a convention to be held, subject to the desire of a majority of the local unions, in June of each year, or at any other time, upon vote of such a majority. In our opinion, according to the decisions above cited, it was the duty of the petitioners to exhaust their remedy by appeal to such a convention before coming into the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\n<em>Petitions dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
