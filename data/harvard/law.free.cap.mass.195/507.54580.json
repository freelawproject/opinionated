The first count was upon an account annexed which contained several items, apparently for services and disbursements in connection with funeral and burial services. The name of the deceased was not stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-8\">The fifth count was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-9\">\u201c Count five.

The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-12\">The material facts were as follows: One Lenix, who had been general baggage agent of the defendant, died at the house of a Mrs. Benson in South Weymouth, where he was a lodger. The attending physician, not in the employ of the defendant, summoned the plaintiff, an undertaker, who came and laid out and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>embalmed the body. After he had done so, the plaintiff had a conversation with one Harris, then a clerk in the defendant\u2019s general passenger and ticket office, as to which he testified that Harris gave him the order for the funeral in detail, selected a casket from a catalogue and told him that the defendant was owing Lenix a little over $150 and that he, Lenix, had some money in the bank and it was thought he owned a block in the city somewhere and that he, Harris, thought the amount the defendant owed Lenix was sufficient for a proper burial. The plaintiff further testified that Harris was at the house with some half dozen railroad people when the casket was delivered, that they looked it over and discussed it and that Harris said it was very satisfactory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-4\">Harris was called as a witness for the plaintiff and denied that he had ordered the funeral or the casket, but stated that the plaintiff had asked him in detail as to Lenix\u2019s affairs which he gave as fully as he was able because, he supposed, the plaintiff was looking for information as to who would be responsible for his bill, that, on his return to Boston, he had told one Hanson, the defendant\u2019s general passenger agent, of the information he had given as to Lenix, and Hanson had said that what he had told the plaintiff was <em>\u201c </em>all right.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-5\">The plaintiff wrote letters to both Harris and Hanson seeking to make the defendant pay the amount of his claim. They denied owing him and referred him to the representative of Lenix\u2019s estate, to whom the defendant had paid what had been owing Lenix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-7\"><em>D. P. </em>Rice, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-8\">Cr. <em>P. </em>Purler, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b531-9\">Sheldon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgJ\">There is no useful purpose to be served by recapitulating the evidence in this case. The plaintiff contends that Harris, acting for the defendant and with its authority, employed the plaintiff to make all the arrangements for the funeral of Lenix, who had been in the defendant\u2019s service, and also that the action of Harris in so employing the plaintiff was afterwards ratified by the defendant acting through its managing officers. If this contention were supported by the evidence, doubtless it might be a good one. But this is not the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Harris did not bold himself out as representing the defendant; he made no promise that the defendant would meet the expenses of the funeral; on the contrary, he spoke of the means of payment that were expected to be available from Lenix\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Nor was there any evidence that Harris had authority to bind the defendant or to make any promise in its behalf. He was a clerk in the general passenger agent\u2019s office. Neither by implication from his position nor by express delegation was there anything to show that he had, or that he was held out as having, any such authority. Nor is there evidence of a subsequent ratification by the defendant\u2019s managing officers of any agreement made by him. A simple denial of liability is not evidence of a ratification. There is nothing in the cases cited by the plaintiff that can help him. He cannot recover upon either of the counts relied on.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The presumption is that funeral expenses are incurred on the credit of the estate of the deceased. <em>Sweeney </em>v. Muldoon, 139 Mass. 304, 308. <em>Constantinides </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>146 Mass. 281. <em>Pettengill </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>167 Mass. 307. There is nothing in the case to overcome this presumption, so far as the defendant is concerned. Whether the plaintiff could hold Harris for his bill, is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
