The plaintiff\u2019s evidence established the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\">The plaintiff brought an action in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston against one Field of Boston, two other parties described in the writ as of Salem, and the defendant Cook described in the writ as of Lynn in the county of Essex and having a usual place of business in Boston in the county of Suffolk. He procured judgment, execution, and under R. L. c. 168, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 18, a citation in the poor debtor session of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston against the defendant and others, all of whom appeared <em>pro se </em>in that court. In the citation and several successive executions the defendant was described as he had been in the original writ. After several continuances, the defendant Cook was defaulted and, a certificate of arrest under R. L. c. 168, \u00a7 20, issuing, he was arrested at Lynn by a Lynn constable and taken before the judge of the Lynn Police Court, to whom he protested that his arrest was illegal and that the court had no jurisdiction. The judge of that court declined to hear the question of jurisdiction until the defendant had entered into a poor debtor recognizance. The defendant under protest thereupon entered into such recognizance, the condition of the bond being as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\">\u201c That the said Herbert W. Cook within thirty days from the time of his arrest, as above-mentioned, will deliver himself up for examination, before some magistrate authorized to act, giving notice of the time and place thereof in the manner provided in and by the one hundred and sixty-eighth chapter of the Revised Laws of the said Commonwealth, and the Acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto, and appear at the time fixed for his examination, and from time to time, until the same is concluded, and not depart without leave of the magistrate, making no default at any time fixed for his examination, and abide the final order of the magistrate thereon; and if the said Herbert W. Cook shall in all respects observe, perform and keep the said condition, then this recognizance to be void, otherwise to be and abide in full force.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\">Eight days afterwards, having given the notice required by R. L. c. 168, \u00a7 33, the defendant was heard on the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>jurisdiction, and the judge found that at the time of the application for the certificate authorizing the arrest of the defendant he had no place of abode or place of business in Suffolk County but that he both lived and had his usual place of business in Lynn in said county of Essex at the time of said application. He therefore found that the arrest was illegal and discharged the defendant for want of jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant requested the presiding judge to rule that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover against the defendant, which he declined to do, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">The defendant thereupon offered evidence to prove that at the time of the issuance of the certificate of arrest by virtue of which he was arrested he neither lived nor had a usual place of business in Suffolk County, but that he lived and had a usual place of business in Lynn in the county of -Essex. The evidence was excluded as immaterial and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-7\">The defendant made several requests for rulings among which was the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-8\">2. That upon all of the evidence in the case there was and has been no breach of recognizance declared on and judgment must be rendered for both of the defendants. The request was refused and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-9\">At the close of the evidence the presiding judge at the request of the plaintiff and against the objection and subject to the exception of the defendant directed the jury to find for the plaintiff, which they did.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-10\"><em>F. FJ. </em>Shaw, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-11\"><em>W. B. Orcutt, </em>for the plaintiff, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b464-12\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJO\">We have not found it necessary to pass upon all the questions raised by the defence. The plaintiff finds himself face to face with a dilemma either horn of which is fatal to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">If, as is contended by the defendants, the arrest was illegal, then the recognizance is invalid <em>(Atwood </em>v. Wheeler, 149 Mass. 96), the invalidity was not waived by the application to take the oath for the relief of poor debtors <em>(Smith </em>v. Bean, 180 Mass. 298), and hence the plaintiff has no case.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">If, as is contended by the plaintiff, the arrest was legal, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the recognizance was valid. When in accordance with its-terms the judgment debtor, after due notice to the judgment creditor, submitted himself to the magistrate and was discharged, he had done all the recognizance required. He had appeared and abided the final order. It is immaterial whether or not the order proceeded from an erroneous view of the law on the part of the magistrate. It was the order of a magistrate having jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties, and was the final order which under the terms of the recognizance the debtor was to \u201c abide\u201d; and hence there has been no breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The remedy, if any the plaintiff has, is not by a suit upon the recognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\"><em>Exceptions </em>sustained,.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
