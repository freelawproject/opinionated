He did so on December 12, 1892, and, Miss Bone, coming in later, Mrs. Allen handed it to her and said: \u201c This is yours, and the income of it you will receive and you can do what you like with it, but if you think it would be a good thing we will have it for theatre tickets, we will buy theatre tickets and go together to the theatre with it.\u201d On the back of the bond was the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-9\">\u201c Boston, Dec. 12, 1892.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-10\">\u201c I, Angie N.

Miss Bone subsequently gave up that box, and the bond was put back in Mrs. Allen\u2019s box, where it was found after her death in an envelope marked <em>\u201c </em>Sundries.\u201d There was no evidence that the bond and assignment had ever been presented to the company for transfer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-5\">The evidence as to the bond of the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-6\">Mrs. Allen some years before her death handed the bond to Miss Bone saying \u201c This is yours, but if you will cut off the coupons and give them to me during my life.\u201d At the same time Mrs. Allen gave Miss Bone the receipt for the bond and told her at any time she wanted to sell it \u201c to take it back to Mr. Arthur Stevens and he would buy it.\u201d Miss Bone testified on cross-examination:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-7\">\u201c Q. Why should Mrs. Allen have any control over it if it was given to you absolutely? A. Well, I don\u2019t know about law, of course. I did not understand it; she gave it to me, said it was mine, and when the coupons were paid she used to laugh when we went down ; she said, \u2018 I want you to come and to cut off coupons.\u2019 I cut them off.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-8\">Other facts appearing from Miss Bone\u2019s testimony as to this bond were:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-9\">The bond was kept in Mrs. Allen\u2019s box at the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company until Miss Bone had a box of her own at the Bay State Trust in March, 1902, when it was put there. When she gave up that box in March, 1903, it was returned with other papers of Miss Bone\u2019s to Mrs. Allen\u2019s box. In November, 1903, Miss Bone took a box of her own at the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company, and she put the bond with other things of her own in there, where it stayed for six months, until the day that Mrs. Allen died. The day previous to that Mrs. Allen and ' Miss Bone had planned a trip abroad and Mrs. Allen had stated that she did not think she had enough money for a letter of credit and had asked Miss Bone \u201c if she were willing to give \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>lier 44 the bond and sell it,\u201d saying that in the autumn she would buy another bond for Miss Bone and give her $1,000. Miss Bone assented and they went together to Miss Bone\u2019s safety deposit box, got the bond and then went to the New England Trust Company where Mrs. Allen asked for her balance and, learning that it was sufficient for the expenses of the proposed journey, told Miss Bone that she would not sell the bond. Mrs. Allen then felt ill and, on the two returning to the safety deposit vaults intending first to cut a coupon from a bond in Mrs. Allen\u2019s box and then to return the Bangor and Aroostook bond to Miss Bone\u2019s box, Miss Bone would not let Mrs. Allen remain long enough for the bond to be put in Miss Bone\u2019s box, but it was put in Mrs. Allen\u2019s box. That evening Mrs. Allen died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">The envelope containing the bond had written upon it the following: \u201c This document is to be given to Alice H. Bone if she survives me, and in the event of her death and mine at the same time, I wish this given to Elizabeth A. Elliott, 16 Stevens Street, Winchester, Mass. Angie N. Allen, March 14, 1904.\u201d Miss Bone testified that this was written upon the envelope by Mrs. Allen on the day of her death and on the occasion just mentioned at Miss Bone\u2019s suggestion. \u201c She said, 4 Supposing, Alice, as we are going to Europe \u2014 supposing we should die together, would you like Miss Ward well or Mrs. Elliot to have this? Which would you rather ? \u2019 And I said,4 Mrs. Elliot \u2019; and with \u2022that she wrote it on it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-6\">44 Q.

As to the first certificate, she testified that Mrs. Allen told her she was going to have one Hallett, who was her business adviser but not a lawyer, tell her, Mrs. Allen, how to give it to her, Miss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Bone, and they went to his office for that purpose on October 19, 1900. The blank on the back of the certificate was filled in on that day, excepting that the name of Hallett as attorney to transfer was not written in then. On that same day the certificate was handed to her by Mrs. Allen. \u201c She said I could have the income of that to use while her estate was being settled, so that I would at no time be without an income.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">\u201c Q. Did you understand it was to be transferred as soon as she died ? A. Yes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-6\">\u201c Q. Was that the agreement you understood Mrs. Allen to make ? A. Yes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-7\">\u201c Q. What was the agreement as to dividends ? A. That she would receive the dividends during her life.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-8\">According to instructions by Mrs. Allen, never revoked, the dividends on the Sugar stock were in fact always sent by the company to the New England Trust Company, where Mrs. Allen had a check account, to be deposited to Mrs. Allen\u2019s credit. The envelope containing the certificate was at the time of the gift put in Mrs. Allen\u2019s safety deposit box and remained there until March, 1902. On the 8th of February, 1901, Mrs. Allen gave to Miss Bone a note reading in part as follows: \u201c I wish to tell you in writing, although I told you at the time I did it, that I have given you my Sugar Preferred stock (fifty shares). It is enclosed in an envelope addressed to you and deposited in the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Co., No. 87 Milk St., in my box, and I wish you to have it to do as you please with.\u201d On October 19,1901, Mrs. Allen wrote to Holmes a letter reading in part as follows:\u201c... let me tell you right here something I have intended to tell you before ; about twelve or thirteen years ago I bought with some money I had, some shares of Sugar stock, and I have the certificate in my safe deposit, when I die, I wish Alice to have it and I do not wish to bother about getting my will and putting it in it, and I do not wish to transfer it to her while I am alive for fear something might happen to her and I could not get it back. It is, as I said, in the safety deposit, in an envelope, and I have written on the back of it, \u2018 This is the property of Alice H. Bone,\u2019 will she, dear Artemas, have it all right in case of my death. I have told her about it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-9\">On the back of this certificate at the time of the trial appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the following, all in Mrs. Allen\u2019s name excepting the name of Hallett:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-3\">44 For value received I hereby sell, assign, and transfer unto Alice H.

She said she wished to make a gift to Miss Alice or Miss Bone. And I said, 4 There are two ways in which I should advise you to. have that done. The first would be that you could give it to her absolutely by filling in her name and let it stand, and let her transfer it, and then she to give you an order for the dividends on the stock.\u2019 And she said then, \u2018 What position would I be in, supposing Miss Alice died?\u2019 I said, \u2018 Then it would go to her heirs.\u2019 She said, 4 Then I won\u2019t have that.\u2019 Then, \u00a3 What is the next condition ? \u2019 4 The next is that you can sign it in blank and I will witness it, and if you put it in an envelope and mark on it, \u201cThe property of Miss Alice H. Bone,\u201d and date and your name, I should consider it a gift to her, and the only thing about it would be that you would require the assent of the executor or executors of your estate.\u2019 She said, 4 Well, that is all right. Mr. Holmes is one of my executors and he will do as I request him to do.\u2019 ... At that time there was no writing on the back of the certificate except Mrs. Allen\u2019s name and my own as witness. I neglected to put in the date. She put that in an envelope which I gave her, and wrote as I suggested.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-6\">Both Hallett and Miss Bone testified that the occurrences as stated by them respectively regarding the first certificate were, on January 17, 1902, repeated as to the second.

Hallett.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-5\">As to the second certificate Miss Bone testified: \u201c Mrs. Allen was to have the income of it during her lifetime. Mr. Hallett was to transfer it to me after her death so that I could have the income of it immediately and not wait for the settling of the estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-6\">She further testified that in March, 1902, she hired 'a safety deposit box of her own, and that the two certificates were put into it and remained there till March, 1903, when she gave up this box, and they were then again put into Mrs. Allen\u2019s box with a slip of paper pinned on, on which was written in Mrs. Allen\u2019s handwriting, \u201c This is the property of Alice H. Bone, put here for safe keeping.\u201d This paper was in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-7\">On May 11, 1903, Mrs. Allen wrote her executor a letter the opening sentence of which is \u201c Independent of the amount I have given her in my will, I wish the sixty shares of Sugar stock that I own given to her, and the certificate of which [is] in my safety deposit box.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-8\">In November, 1903, Miss Bone took a new box, and the certificates were transferred to it with certain other securities of her own, and remained there during the rest of Mrs. Allen\u2019s lifetime, but the dividends continued to be paid to Mrs. Allen\u2019s account at her bank even after Mrs. Allen\u2019s death. Miss Bone wrote several times to the executor and in one letter said: \u201c I am writing to ask you if it will be agreeable to you to let me have the dividends of the Sugar stock for April and July for my immediate expenses. When Mrs. Allen gave me this stock several years ago it was her wish and intention that in case of her death it would be transferred to me at once so that I should receive the interest as soon as possible. I have had many expenses since Mrs. Allen died and need the money very much.\u201d She also testified that until some months after Mrs. Allen\u2019s death she did not consult counsel and that previous to such con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>sultation she knew nothing of the law as to gifts or wills and was ignorant of the process necessary to establish her rights to stock standing in Mrs. Allen\u2019s name; that after consulting counsel she made claim by her counsel to all the properties in litigation here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">The evidence as to the deposit in the Boston Five Cents Savings Bank was that at some time before November 1,1908, Mrs. Allen handed to Miss Bone the bank\u2019s pass book as to this deposit and said: \u201c This is yours. I give this to you, but I' should like to have the income of it during my life.\u201d On November 13, 1903, Mrs. Allen wrote out and delivered to Miss Bone the following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-6\">\u201c 220 Beacon St., Boston, Nov. 13, 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-7\">\u201c To the Treasurer of the Five Cents Savings Bank, Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-8\">\u201c Pay to Alice H.

There was evidence that Mrs. Allen executed a formal assignment of the Tyler Street Day Nursery bond to Miss Bone, and delivered the bond and the assignment to her; that it was then put in Mrs. Allen\u2019s box in a safety vault for safe keeping, marked, \u201c This is the property of Alice H. Bone, and is here for safe keeping \u201d; that Miss Bone afterwards took a box of her own, and put the bond in that for a time, until she gave up that box and put the bond back in Mrs. Allen\u2019s box, where it remained until the latter\u2019s death. On this evidence the court had a right to find that there had been a sufficient delivery of the bond to Miss Bone, with intent to pass the title. The fact that the bond was found in Mrs. Allen\u2019s box after her death was of course to be considered; but it was not necessarily decisive. <em>Scrivens </em>v. <em>North Easton Savings Bank, </em>166 Mass. 255. The same may be said of the fact that the assignment had not been presented to the obligor or the bond transferred upon its books. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Worcester, Nashua &amp; Rochester </em>Railroad, 159 Mass. 64. And the talk at the time of the delivery of the bond and assignment to Miss Bone did not amount to a reservation of the interest during Mrs. Allen\u2019s life, nor would such a reservation have conclusively avoided the gift. <em>Stone </em>v. Hackett, 12 Gray, 227. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Ney, </em>125 Mass. 590. <em>Tyndale </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>154 Mass. 103. <em>Bromley </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>155 Mass. 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">As to the bond of the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad Company there was evidence that Mrs. Allen, some years before her death, handed it to Miss Bone, saying, <em>\u201c </em>This is yours, but if you will cut off the coupons and give them to me during my life.\u201d This warranted a finding that the property passed absolutely to the donee, and such a reservation of the interest for the life of the donor would not prevent the gift from taking effect. See the cases cited above. The donor trusted the donee to give back the coupons as they should become due. Nor did the testimony as to the subsequent custody of the bond or the direction after-wards written by Mrs. Allen upon the envelope containing it necessarily show that there had been no previous delivery of the bond and vesting of the title, subject to a qualified reservation of the interest, in the donee. <em>Kendrick </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>173 Mass. 305, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>308, 309. <em>Chase </em>v. Perley, 148 Mass. 289. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Berkshire County Savings </em>Bank, 140 Mass. 157. We do not mean to say that this evidence, under the circumstances of the ease, was inadmissible, or that with the other evidence it might not have warranted a different finding from that which was made; but we cannot pass upon the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">2. As to the sixty shares of Sugar preferred stock which are the subject of the second suit, the facts which might be found do not differ essentially from those which have been stated in considering the first suit. The stock was not transferred on the books of the corporation, and it was intended that the dividends should be paid to Mrs. Allen for her life. But we have already seen that these circumstances are not conclusive against Miss Bone\u2019s contention that as between the parties there was an absolute transfer of the title to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The executor relied strongly on the evidence that Mrs. Allen expressed at one time an unwillingness to transfer and deliver the stock during her own life to Miss Bone, but wished to retain it in her own control and allow the title to pass only after her own death, which would make the inference of a present gift taking effect during the life of the donor impossible. <em>Duryea </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>183 Mass. 429,433. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>114 Mass. 30, 32. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>12 Gray, 227. But there was also evidence that subsequently Mrs. Allen wrote Miss Bone\u2019s name as transferee into the blank assignment and delivered the certificates to Miss Bone, and that they remained in the latter\u2019s exclusive possession for a year, when they were put into Mrs. Allen\u2019s box, with a paper pinned upon them, reading in Mrs. Allen\u2019s handwriting: \u201c This is the property of Alice H. Bone, put here for safe keeping.\u201d The court had a right on this evidence to find that the gift which Mrs. Allen intended to make to Miss Bone had been carried into effect by an absolute delivery. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Worcester, Nashua Rochester Railroad, </em>159 Mass. 64. The evidence of statements by and conduct of Mrs. Allen inconsistent with such a finding simply presented a question of fact which was passed upon at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">3. The questions raised in the third suit, brought to recover the deposit in the Boston Five Cents Savings Bank, are sufficiently disposed of by what has been said. The judge had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>right to find that there had been a completed and absolute gift and delivery of the bank book made by Mrs. Allen to Miss Bone, and to sustain the latter\u2019s claim to the deposit. <em>Peck </em>v. Scofield, 186 Mass. 108. <em>Debinson </em>v. <em>Emmons, </em>158 Mass. 592. <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Woronoco Savings Bank, </em>136 Mass. 208. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Boston Five Cents Savings Bank, </em>129 Mass. 425. The mere fact that there was also evidence which would have warranted a different finding is not for us to consider. <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Lawler, </em>190 Mass. 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\">It may well be, as contended by the executor, that if there had been here no completed and absolute gift the attempted dispositions could not have been sustained by treating them as declarations of trust; but that question does not arise, and his claim that Miss Bone is absolutely bound by admissions to be inferred from her language and conduct, and cannot explain these away or stand upon any ground inconsistent with them, is not to be supported. <em>Baldy </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>11 Penn. St. 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">It is not necessary to consider the exceptions saved by Miss Bone.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In each case the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
