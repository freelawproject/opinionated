The judge excluded evidence offered by the plaintiff to show that the oiled clothing made by the plaintiff was difficult to ignite and upon ignition did not burst into flame but only charred. <em>Held, </em>that the usage proved by the defendant to exist and to have been known to the plaintiff became part of the contract of shipment, and that the evidence offered by the plaintiff properly was excluded as immaterial.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-10\">Contract for alleged breach of an agreement in a bill of lading to transport twenty cases of oiled clothing from New York to Galveston, Texas, by a steamship of the defendant.

There is not sufficient evidence of a well-defined, uniform, universal practice among carriers by sea to stow oiled clothing on deck to warrant a finding that there was a custom of which the plaintiff had knowledge and by which it was bound.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-4\">The evidence offered by the plaintiff and excluded by the. judge is described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions in these two matters, as well as other exceptions which the court did not consider because they were not argued.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-6\"><em>A.

It also was further held, that while knowledge of the custom by the plaintiff could be found, this question was one of fact for the jury, to whom it should have been submitted, and consequently the exceptions were sustained. <em>Tower Co. </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>184 Mass. 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">At the second trial, under full and accurate instructions the jury have found that such a custom not only existed, but was known to the plaintiff. For reasons stated in the former opinion, upon these facts being established, this course of dealing became a part of the contract of shipment, and the defendant, therefore, was not liable for the loss of the plaintiff\u2019s goods which were washed overboard while in transit. The plaintiff\u2019s offer of evidence, that the oiled clothing made by the company was difficult to ignite, and upon ignition did not burst into flame, but only charred, was excluded properly. If combustion from extraneous causes was unlikely, there still existed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the probability shown by common experience of such clothing taking fire by spontaneous combustion, which, upon communication to other goods, might destroy both the cargo and the ship.

It was to guard against this danger that the terms of the contract contained the exception as to the carriage of inflammable goods, by which the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery has been found to be limited. <em>Tower Co. </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
