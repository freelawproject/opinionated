Parker died leaving no estate of any kind upon which to administer; that no estate of the decedent ever had come into her hands or possession, that she knew of none that could be collected or received by her as executrix, and that she was possessed of no estate of the testator wherewith to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s claim; and denied that there had been any breach of her bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-12\">At the trial in the Superior Court before <em>Bishop, </em>J., without a jury, it appeared that the judgment in favor of Hanscomb had been obtained and remained unsatisfied as alleged in the declaration. The defendant testified, and her evidence was uncontradicted, that Isaac W. Parker, the testator, at his decease was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>possessed of no property or estate, and that no property of the said Isaac since had come to her knowledge or possession. The judge ruled that this evidence constituted no defence to the action. He found that there had been a breach of the condition of the bond, and ordered that judgment be entered for the plaintiff in the penal sum of $1,000 and that execution issue against the defendant for the sum of $276.27.

Under R. L. c. 149, \u00a7 20, her probate bond, given without sureties, has been put in suit for his benefit, and in defence it is said that the deceased left no estate, and neither at the time of appointment, nor since, have any assets come into the defendant\u2019s possession. By the conditions of the bond she undertook to pay, if demanded, and the estate was solvent, all debts, judgment for which had been rendered against her as executrix. ' Until its insolvency had been ascertained, and declared by a decree, the estate must be presumed and treated as solvent in suits by creditors, and the entire failure in fact of assets to satisfy the judgment is immaterial. He<em>ard </em>v. <em>Lodge, </em>20 Pick. 53, 58. <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Goss, </em>1 Met. 333. <em>McKim </em>v. <em>Glover, </em>167 Mass. 280, 283. <em>McKim </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>173 Mass. 112, 114. <em>McKim </em>v. <em>Roosa, </em>183 Mass. 510. The defendant relies upon the case of <em>Keith </em>v. <em>Molineux, </em>160 Mass. 499, as an authority sustaining her position. It there was held that the administrator having exhausted the assets in the payment of debts entitled to a preference, and his final account having been allowed by the Probate Court, the suit brought by the plaintiff, who was a common creditor of the deceased, could not be maintained. R. L. c. 141, \u00a7 5. But in the present case there has been no administration of the estate, and instead of a compliance with the provisions of R. L. c. 142, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, by representing the estate of her testator as insufficient to pay all his debts, after full knowledge of its insolvent condition, she chose to remain inactive, and suffered judgment to be obtained. A failure to pay the judgment, therefore, was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>unjustifiable breach of the bond, and the judge correctly ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment for the penal sum. <em>McKim </em>v. <em>Haley, ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
