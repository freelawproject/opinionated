In the petition there were libellous statements, but there were none in the certificate. <em>Held, </em>that the question whether the certificate incorporated into itself the libellous statements in the petition was a matter relating to the construction of a written instrument, and was for the court, and not for the jury, to determine.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Tort for libel.

What they did was to sign a certificate of Mr. Fernald\u2019s character, and to request that his petition for a rehearing should be granted. Although the petition begins, \u201cWe the undersigned do most respectfully petition and pray that the dismissal of a libel for divorce may be reconsidered and granted from the evidence of the following witnesses for Charles A. Fernald, physician, in good standing, and son of,\u201d etc. it concludes, \u201c I most respectfully petition and pray,\u201d etc., and is signed by Fernald alone and must be regarded as his petition and not that of the defendants. The reference to it in the certificate is not for the purpose of incorporating it into the certificate, but to show for what purpose the certificate is given, and the petition is not thereby incorporated into the certificate. Whether the certificate does incorporate the petition into it is a matter relating to the construction of a written instrument, and, therefore, for the court and not for the jury. We think that the court was right in directing a verdict for each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
