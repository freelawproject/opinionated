J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ath\">This bill is brought to charge the individual defendants, as officers of the defendant corporation, for a debt of the corporation due the plaintiff, contracted before the capital stock of the corporation was fully paid in. The corporation was organized under the laws of New Jersey, and the question is whether the liability of officers of domestic corporations for such debts, under the R. L. c. 110, \u00a7 58, cl. 6, is extended to officers of foreign corporations by the R. L. c. 126, \u00a7 17. The plaintiff relies upon no other ground of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">This section makes the officers and members or stockholders of foreign corporations, which have a usual place of business in this Commonwealth, jointly and severally liable for its debts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>contracts, on the same conditions and in the same manner as is provided for domestic corporations by \u00a7\u00a7 58 to 68, inclusive, of c. 110, except cl. 4 of said \u00a7 58. Clause 6 of \u00a7 58 makes the president, directors and treasurer of a domestic corporation liable \u201c for debts contracted before the original capital has been fully paid in and the certificate of such payment has been filed in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 43. There is no provision for the filing of such a certificate by the officers of a foreign corporation, as the provisions of \u00a7 43 apply only to domestic corporations. It is, therefore, impossible for the officers of a foreign corporation to file a certificate in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 43.\u201d Any argument to the contrary must go upon the ground that the enactment in R. L. c. 126, \u00a7 17, as to the liability of officers and stockholders of foreign corporations, through the R. L. c. 110, \u00a7 58, cl. 6, makes \u00a7 43 of c. 110 applicable to foreign corporations. This would be finding a legislative intent which is not expressed, when there is little to warrant an inference of its existence. Indeed the R. L. c. 126, \u00a7 6, which provides for the filing of a certificate by a foreign corporation having a usual place of business in this State, before transacting business here, requires that the certificate shall contain \u201c a statement of the amount of its capital stock, of the amount paid in thereon to its treasurer,\u201d etc., thus implying that it may be qualified for the proper transaction of business here before the whole amount of its capital stock is paid in. We are of opinion that the sections relied upon by the plaintiff do not make R. L. c. 110, \u00a7 43, applicable to foreign corporations. The provisions of the section show plainly that it was intended to apply only to domestic corporations. The master\u2019s report in this case shows that the commissioner of corporations has never received or required from a foreign corporation such a certificate as is prescribed in this section, and no such certificate has ever been offered to him by a foreign corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\">The provision in \u00a7 17 of c. 126 puts upon officers and stockholders of foreign corporations the liabilities mentioned in c. 110, \u00a7\u00a7 58 to 68, only so far as these liabilities are of a kind to which such officers and stockholders may be subject, under existing laws. So far as there are provisions in these sections creating liabilities of officers and stockholders of domestic corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>rations which are founded on other statutes peculiar to these corporations, they are inapplicable to the officers and stockholders of foreign corporations. This liability, mentioned in cl. 6 of \u00a7 58, is not included in the provision of \u00a7 17, because it cannot exist as against the officers of a foreign corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The decision in <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Pictorial Press, </em>182 Mass. 530, is not pertinent to the question before us. The decision in <em>Anthony Scovill Co. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Art Co. </em>190 Mass. 35, deals principally with the effect of the exception of cl. 4 of \u00a7 58. The court had no occasion'to consider the question whether any of the grounds of liability under R. L. c. 110, \u00a7\u00a7 58, 59 were such as would be inapplicable to the officers and stockholders of foreign corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">As this bill is brought only to enforce a liability existing under R. L. c. 110, \u00a7 58, cl. 6, we have no occasion to consider whether, if proper averments were made and proofs established, the defendants would be liable under the R. L. c. 110, \u00a7 59, cl. 1, nor whether a liability of this kind would be enforceable against a stockholder of a foreign corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
