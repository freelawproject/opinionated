ARTHUR KELSEY\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Two insurers paid claims for property damage to a Harris Teeter grocery store arising from the malfunctioning of a county sewer line. Exercising their subrogation rights, the insurers filed an inverse condemnation suit against Arlington County on the theory that the sewer backup constituted a taking and/or damaging of private property for a public use without just compensation in violation of the Constitution of Virginia. The circuit court dismissed the insurers' complaint with prejudice and denied their motion for leave to file an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We agree with the circuit court that the original complaint failed to state a claim for inverse condemnation. We disagree, however, with the court's denial of the insurers' motion for leave to amend their complaint. The allegations in the proffered amended complaint, coupled with the reasonable inferences arising from these allegations, assert a legally viable claim for inverse condemnation. We thus affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because this appeal arises from the grant of a demurrer, we state the factual allegations in the complaint in the light most favorable to the insurers, giving them the benefit of all reasonable inferences that arise from those allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coutlakis v.

The insurers together paid approximately $1.8 million under their policies to Harris Teeter for property damage resulting from the backup of a county sewer line that caused raw sewage to flow into the grocery store in May 2012. The subrogated insurers filed suit against the County alleging only one count-an inverse condemnation claim under Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The original complaint stated that the sewer line and the sewage treatment plant for the sewer line \"were maintained for the public purpose of supplying Arlington County with water and sewage disposal services.\" J.A. at 3. The sewage backup, the complaint alleged, \"was caused by the failure of Arlington County to properly maintain and operate the sewage treatment plant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=695%20S.E.2d%20173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The complaint provided several specific examples of this overall failure, including that the County (1) failed to \"properly operate, inspect, maintain\n   and test\" the sewer system; (2) failed to maintain and repair the pumps in the plant; (3) failed to supervise its employees at the treatment plant; (4) \"ignored warnings from its employees\" about the equipment; (5) \"bypassed safety features of the equipment\"; and (6) neglected necessary repairs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=695%20S.E.2d%20173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nothing in the complaint expressly or impliedly alleged that the County purposefully caused the backflow of raw sewage into the Harris Teeter grocery store. Nor did the complaint allege that anyone working for the County either purposefully caused the backflow or deliberately allowed it to happen in order to keep the entire system operating for all other users of the county sewer system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The County demurred on several grounds, the principal one being that the allegations asserted, at best, a negligence claim barred by sovereign immunity and not cognizable as a constitutional violation. The County also argued that the sewer backup did not itself constitute a public use of Harris Teeter's property. The insurers disagreed and contended that it did not matter that \"the\n   <em>\n    sewage backup\n   </em>\n   \" itself did not constitute a public use because the only question was \"whether the\n   <em>\n    sewage treatment plant\n   </em>\n   serves a public purpose, which it obviously does.\" R. at 29 (emphases in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 90 (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The circuit court granted the County's demurrer and dismissed the case with prejudice. The insurers moved to reconsider and requested leave to file a proffered amended complaint that amplified their claim. The court denied both motions and entered final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, the insurers argue that their original complaint stated a viable claim for inverse condemnation and that, even if it did not, the proffered amended complaint provides whatever amplification of the claim may be necessary. Like the circuit court, we conclude that the original complaint sounded wholly in tort and did not state a prima facie cause of action for inverse condemnation. We disagree, however, with the circuit court's decision to deny the insurers leave to amend their complaint. The amplified allegations in the amended complaint, coupled with the reasonable inferences that one could draw from them, state a viable claim for inverse condemnation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A. THE FOR-PUBLIC-USE REQUIREMENT OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Constitution of Virginia states\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [T]he General Assembly shall pass no law whereby private property, the right to which is fundamental, shall be damaged or taken except for public use. No private property shall be damaged or taken for public use without just compensation to the owner thereof. No more private property may be taken than necessary to achieve the stated public use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 11. The power of eminent domain is thus limited. Private property cannot be \"damaged or taken except for public use,\" and, even then, the power can be exercised only to the extent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"necessary to achieve the stated public use.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

For good reason, we have never accepted such a hyper-literal reading of this provision. From ancient times, ad hoc seizures of property without direct legislative approval were understood to violate the requirement of just compensation no less than outright legislative confiscations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Magna Carta, ch. 28 (prohibiting the King's officers\n   from taking \"the corn or other goods of any one without instantly paying money for them, unless he can obtain respite from the free-will of the seller\"),\n   <em>\n    reprinted in\n   </em>\n   Boyd C. Barrington, The Magna Carta and Other Great Charters of England 228, 237 (1899). That ancient maxim found its voice in the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a provision that St. George Tucker believed was meant \"to restrain the arbitrary &amp; oppressive measure of obtaining supplies by impress[ment] as was practiced during the last war, not infrequently without any Compensation whatsoever.\" 4 St. George Tucker, Ten Notebooks of Law Lectures 147 (in the Tucker-Coleman Papers on file with the Earl Gregg Swem Library, College of William and Mary);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1 St. George Tucker, Blackstone's Commentaries, Editor's App. Note D, at 305-06 (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following in this tradition, the Constitution of Virginia declares the right to private property to be \"fundamental.\" Va.

In inverse condemnation cases, the law implies the constitutional duty of compensation in circumstances where the taking or damaging of private property would be compensable under traditional eminent domain principles.

Like the circuit court, we find no legal significance in the added specificity of these negligence allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   That said, several allegations in the amended complaint assert or at least imply that the County purposefully took or failed to take certain actions that, when combined, intentionally caused the sewer line at Harris Teeter to back up\n   <em>\n    so that\n   </em>\n   the entire system could continue to operate. Prior to the backup at Harris Teeter, the insurers allege, \"the County\n   <em>\n    purposefully\n   </em>\n   diverted sewage and/or storm water from another County treatment facility or pump station that it had closed\" yet never increased the capacity of the plant or followed the recommendations of engineers for other changes \"even though in doing so\n   <em>\n    it knew\n   </em>\n   that a sewage back-flow onto\n   the property of others\n   <em>\n    would occur\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. at 153-54 (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The insurers also allege that the County adopted \"policies, procedures and practices\" that \"made it\n   <em>\n    most probable\n   </em>\n   that a sewage backup would occur.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). A reasonable inference from these allegations appears to be that the County was willing to incur the \"most probable\" risk of damaging the Harris Teeter property to keep the sewer system operational for all other users.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 153-55. The County allegedly did so to compensate for its underfunded and poorly managed maintenance program.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   If the insurers could prove that the policies, procedures, and practices of the County consisted of a plan or design to use the Harris Teeter property in this manner, they may have an inverse condemnation claim. Despite these new allegations, the circuit court denied the motion for leave to amend and dismissed the case with prejudice. While we acknowledge the circuit court's apparent skepticism of these allegations, the court should nonetheless have permitted the amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"On appeal, review of the trial court's decision to grant or deny a motion to amend is limited to the question whether the trial judge abused his discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Lucas v.

For as long as the power of eminent domain has existed, so too have the limitations on this power applied to the confiscation of personal property. The barons at Runnymede demanded just compensation for personal property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Magna Carta,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at ch. 28 (requiring compensation for the taking of \"corn or other goods\").

And St. George Tucker concluded that the seizure of personal property was the probable reason for the adoption of the federal Takings Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   4 Tucker, Ten Notebooks of Law Lectures,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 147 (stating that the Takings Clause \"was probably intended to restrain the arbitrary &amp; oppressive measure of obtaining\n   <em>\n    supplies\n   </em>\n   by impress[ment] as was practiced during the last war, not infrequently without any Compensation whatsoever\" (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1 Tucker, Blackstone's Commentaries,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Editor's App. Note D, at 305-06 (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Consistent with this view, the General Assembly defines property for eminent domain purposes to include \"land and personal property, and any right, title, interest, estate or claim in or to such property.\" Code \u00a7 25.1-100. While this definition does not directly address inverse condemnation claims, it has the indirect effect of doing so because such claims presuppose a constitutionally \"implied contract\" arising out of a de facto use of the eminent domain power,\n   <em>\n    Nelson Cty. v.

The implied constitutional right of action for inverse condemnation likewise contains no such distinction.

Our entire analysis, save one sentence, responded solely to VDOT's specific argument. \"We reject[ed] VDOT's contention\" because nothing in our precedent prohibited inverse condemnation liability for personal property not included within the condemning authority's grant of eminent domain power and because\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fugate\n   </em>\n   supported recovery for personal property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 160-61,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=726%20S.E.2d%20264\">\n    726 S.E.2d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   This single-sentence, \"appurtenant to\" qualification alluded to, but did not mention, any factors relevant to fixtures. The parties' briefs in\n   <em>\n    Livingston\n   </em>\n   similarly failed to address the law of fixtures in any detail. Nor did our opinion or the parties' briefs cite any supporting authority that might illuminate the precise meaning of this caveat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   While often used interchangeably, \"appurtenances\" and \"fixtures\" are not identical synonyms in the lexicon of law. All fixtures are appurtenances, but not all appurtenances are fixtures. A fixture is but one kind of appurtenance. For example, an above-ground hot tub may or may not be an appurtenant fixture, but a custom-built, in-ground swimming pool could be considered an appurtenance but not a fixture. We thus find it implausible that the ambiguous \"appurtenant to\" sentence in\n   <em>\n    Livingston\n   </em>\n   was meant to overrule\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fugate\n   </em>\n   and thereby establish a per se rule under Virginia law that inverse condemnation liability can never extend to personal property that does not become transformed into realty under fixture principles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Our reluctance to adopt such a per se rule is confirmed by\n   <em>\n    Livingston\n   </em>\n   's earlier citation with approval of\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fugate\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Livingston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20Va.%20140\">\n    284 Va. at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=726%20S.E.2d%20264\">\n    726 S.E.2d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the County's interpretation had been the true ruling of\n   <em>\n    Livingston\n   </em>\n   , we would have just as well have said that Article 1, Section 11 of the Constitution of Virginia applies only to real property because that is what personal property essentially becomes when it constitutes a fixture.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State Highway &amp; Transp.
