She appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress all evidence resulting from an allegedly invalid search warrant, urging that the court erred in concluding that she was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing regarding the search warrant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">In November, 1992, Toole County Deputy Sheriff Glenn Kurkowski (Kurkowski) met with a confidential informant who told Kurkowski he had recently visited the home of Diane Feland (Feland). The informant stated that, while at Feland\u2019s home, he was shown a plastic bag purportedly containing marijuana, a dragon-shaped pipe, rolling papers, and other items of drug paraphernalia stored in a lamp stand located in the living room. The informant also described a marijuana plant growing in the living room and said he had been told another plant was growing in the first-floor bedroom. Finally, the informant said that Feland\u2019s daughter told him Feland recently had purchased $300 worth of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">Based on this information, Kurkowski applied for and received a search warrant. Containers of marijuana, items of drug paraphernalia, and a grow light were found during the search of Feland\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">Based on the items seized during the search and Feland\u2019s admissions that she had drugs and paraphernalia on the premises and smoked the marijuana, the Toole County Attorney moved for leave to file an information. The District Court granted the motion and the County Attorney filed an information charging Feland with felony possession of dangerous drugs and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia. Feland pled not guilty to both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">Feland then challenged the validity of the search warrant and moved to suppress all evidence and admissions obtained via that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>warrant. She asserted that certain of. the informant\u2019s statements contained in Kurkowski\u2019s application for the search warrant (warrant application) were knowingly or intentionally false or made with reckless disregard for the truth. She argued that if the false material were excised from the application, insufficient information remained to establish probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant. The District Court denied Feland\u2019s motion to suppress without holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Feland subsequently entered, and the court accepted, guilty pleas to the offenses charged. The District Court imposed a two-year deferred sentence on the felony offense and a six-month suspended sentence on the misdemeanor offense. The court\u2019s judgment authorizes Feland to appeal the denial of her motion to suppress pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA. Feland appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In denying Feland\u2019s motion, the District Court concluded that she failed to make a substantial preliminary showing that false information was contained in the warrant application and, thus, that she was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the veracity of the statements in the warrant application. Feland contends that she made the showing necessary to entitle her to an evidentiary hearing. We review a district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing for a clear abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 359, 363, 708 P.2d 270, 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution specifically provides that \u201cno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation....\u201d The assumption underlying the issuance of a search warrant is that the factual showing establishing probable cause must be \u201c \u2018truthful\u2019 in the sense that the information put forth [in the warrant application] is believed or appropriately accepted by the affiant as true.\u201d <em>Franks v. Delaware </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 154, 165, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 2681, 57 L.Ed.2d 667, 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In <em>Franks, </em>the Supreme Court adopted a procedure for challenging the truthfulness of factual statements contained in an application for a search warrant. An evidentiary hearing on such a challenge is not required unless the defendant first makes a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant [application],\u201d and that the false statement was necessary to a finding of probable cause. <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. at 2676.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>We adopted the <em>Franks </em>procedure for challenging the validity of a warrant affidavit in <em>State v. Sykes </em>(1983), 194 Mont. 14, 20, 663 P.2d 691, 695. A substantial preliminary showing of a deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth requires more than a conclusory statement. <em>State v. Mosley </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 109, 116, 860 P.2d 69, 73 (citation omitted). The defendant must make an offer of proof containing \u201caffidavits, sworn statements or other rehable witness statements which tend to prove that false statements in the application were deliberately made.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>860 P.2d at 73 (citation omitted). We emphasized in <em>Mosley, </em>as had the Supreme Court in <em>Franks, </em>that \u201c[i]nformation contained in a warrant application will be deemed truthful when the information put forth is believed or appropriately accepted <em>by affiant.\u201d Mosley, </em>860 P.2d at 73 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Feland challenged the veracity of the informant\u2019s statements set forth by Kurkowski in the warrant application in a brief submitted to the District Court; no affidavits or sworn statements were appended. With regard to the informant\u2019s statements describing marijuana and drug paraphernalia stored in a lamp stand, a marijuana plant growing in the living room, and an alleged discussion with her daughter about a marijuana purchase, she asserts that she or a member of her family is prepared to deny the truth of each of those statements. On that basis, Feland argues that the brief constitutes a sufficient preliminary showing to entitle her to an evidentiary hearing under <em>Sykes. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Feland\u2019s challenge to the informant\u2019s statements is similar to the general challenge presented by the defendant in <em>Sykes. </em>There, the defendant produced an affidavit by his wife stating that she was at home and that no stranger or person \u2018likely to have seen the marijuana\u201d was in the house the day preceding the search. <em>Sykes, </em>663 P.2d at 692-93. We observed that although the affidavit alleged that no strangers were present, it did not preclude an acquaintance who saw the marijuana and reported it to the police. <em>Sykes, </em>663 P.2d at 695. We concluded that the defendant\u2019s affidavit was insufficient to make a substantial preliminary showing that the warrant affidavit contained false information. <em>Sykes, </em>663 P.2d at 695-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Here, Feland\u2019s challenge relates to the alleged falsity of the confidential informant\u2019s statements and contains no affidavits, sworn witness testimony, or other reliable witness testimony. She relies on unsupported, general denials of the informant\u2019s statements. As in <em>Sykes, </em>we conclude that Feland\u2019s challenge does not constitute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>substantial preliminary showing of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth required to entitle her to an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">More importantly, however, Feland\u2019s focus on the alleged falsity of the informant\u2019s statements does not address the primary factor required for a substantial preliminary showing under <em>Franks </em>and <em>Mosley, </em>which is that the <em>affiant </em>\u2014 deliberately or with reckless disregard for the truth \u2014 included false statements in the warrant application. Feland did not allege, much less make any showing in support of such an allegation, that a single one of <em>Kurkowski\u2019s </em>statements was deliberately false or made by him with reckless disregard for the truth. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Feland an evidentiary hearing on the veracity of the information contained in the warrant application and in denying her motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b138-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES WEBER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b138-7\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"A1z\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">I concur with the result of the majority\u2019s opinion. However, I do not agree with all that is said by the majority in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Specifically, for the reasons stated in my dissent to <em>State v. Mosley </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 109, 860 P.2d 69, 1 would not mechanically follow the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Franks v. Delaware </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">In the determination of what information should be excised from an application for a search warrant before considering whether there was probable cause to issue the search warrant, I would excise all false information. I fail to see why a search is reasonable when based totally on misrepresentations simply because the person whose privacy has been invaded cannot prove a dishonest intent by the person who sought the warrant. As stated by Judge Frankel in <em>United States v. Halsey </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1966), 257 F. Supp. 1002, 1005, affd, Docket No. 31369 (CA2, June 12, 1967) (unreported), and quoted with approval in <em>Franks:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">[Wlhen the Fourth Amendment demands a factual showing sufficient to comprise \u2018probable cause,\u2019 the obvious assumption is that there will be a truthful showing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-13\"><em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 164-65, 98 S.Ct. at 2681 (alteration in original). The Court went on to state that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>[t]his does not mean \u201ctruthful\u201d in the sense that every fact recited in the warrant affidavit is necessarily correct, for probable cause may be founded upon hearsay and upon information received from informants, as well as upon information within the affiant\u2019s own knowledge that sometimes must be garnered hastily. But surely it is to be \u201ctruthful\u201d in the sense that the information put forward is believed or appropriately accepted by the affiant as true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 165, 98 S. Ct. at 2681.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Based on Montanans\u2019 independent state right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures provided for in Article II, Section 11, of the Montana Constitution, I would adopt the following variation of the rule established in <em>Franks </em>for challenging the veracity of a sworn statement used by police to secure a search warrant: When a defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that false information was included in the application or affidavit offered in support of a search warrant, a hearing must be held at the defendant\u2019s request. At that hearing, the defendant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the information offered is untrue. The untruthful information must be excised from the application, and a determination must be made whether there is sufficient probable cause without the excised information. If not, the search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">I agree with the <em>Franks </em>decision, and with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mosley, </em>that to mandate an evidentiary hearing, the challenger\u2019s attack must be based on more than conclusory statements made by counsel, but instead must take the form of an affidavit or some other reliable form of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">I also agree with this Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>State v. Sykes </em>(1983), 194 Mont. 14, 20, 663 P.2d 691, 695, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">Where the affidavits contain factual inaccuracies that do not go to the integrity of the affidavit because they are of only peripheral relevance to the showing of probable cause, the search warrant remains valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">I concur with the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the District Court for two reasons. First, defendant\u2019s attack on the State\u2019s search warrant in this case was not supported by affidavits or other reliable information, but merely by counsel\u2019s conclusory statements. Second, even if all the statements and the application were excised, except the statement that the State\u2019s informant had seen a plastic bag of marijuana being stored in a lamp stand in the living room, there was still sufficient probable cause to issue the search warrant. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>disputes that the plastic bag of marijuana was stored in a lamp stand. She contends it was actually stored in an end table. However, to the extent that the distinction between a lamp stand and an end table is a factual inaccuracy, it did not go to the integrity of the affidavit and was of peripheral relevance to the showing of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Therefore, while I decline to follow lock-step with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s erosion of Fourth Amendment rights in <em>Franks, </em>I concur with the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
