Koepplin appeals the Memorandum Opinion and Order of the District Court of the Seventeenth Judicial District, Phillips County, which granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">The sole issue for review is whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant on Koepplin\u2019s claims for wrongful discharge, invasion of privacy and malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Ronald C. Koepplin (Koepplin) worked for Zortman Mining, Inc. (Zortman) from October 1991 until his termination on February 17, 1993, when Zortman discharged Koepplin from his job as a haul truck driver. Koepplin had worked at the Zortman mine in other capacities dating back to 1986 when the mine was under other ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Frank Green (Green) supervised Koepplin. In January of 1993, Green noticed there was tension and discord among crew members. Upon inquiry of crew members, Green was told that Koepplin had been verbally deriding and \u201cdowngrading\u201d co-employees, intimidating them and throwing items on the lunch bus. On February 14,1993, a female crew member reported to Green that she had experienced numerous incidents of egregious sexual harassment from Koepplin. Green transcribed the employee\u2019s oral statement onto an Employer Personal File Entry form on February 14, 1993 and called Mine Superintendent Clayton Krall (Krall) because of the seriousness of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">On February 15, 1993, Zortman management employees Green, Krall, George Lytle (Lytle), and Jim Geyer (Geyer) began to investigate the complaints against Koepplin. Their investigation included interviews with persons who had witnessed Koepplin\u2019s treatment of the female employee. These interviews indicated that there were more problems with Koepplin\u2019s conduct than the sexual harassment incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">As a result of the interviews, Koepplin was called into Lytle\u2019s office later that day to meet with Geyer, Krall and Lytle so that he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>tell his side of the story involving the female employee and also his side of an incident involving a scuffle with another male employee. Koepplin denied the sexual harassment and termed the scuffle \u201ccalisthenics.\u201d Krall advised Koepplin in detail regarding the complaint from the female employee; Koepplin denied the sexual harassment. At the conclusion of the meeting, Koepplin was suspended pending further investigation of the complaint and was asked to return the morning of February 17,1993 for another meeting with management. Koepplin was told specifically not to threaten or intimidate anyone involved in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Despite being told not to threaten or intimidate investigators, Koepplin made telephone calls to his supervisor (Green) and the three other mine managers (Krall, Lytle and Geyer) after 10:00 p.m. that same evening. Krall, Lytle and Geyer all testified they felt threatened by Koepplin\u2019s calls to them. Geyer testified that from the tone of voice and the words used, he felt threatened and believed that Koepplin was trying to intimidate him. Geyer immediately reported the threat to the Phillips County Sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The next day, after discovering Koepplin had similarly called other mine managers, Geyer provided the sheriff with information about these calls also. Geyer specifically reported Koepplin\u2019s intent to take Lytle on a \u201ctrip to hell.\u201d Koepplin testified in his deposition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">[By Mr. Hattersley]... As you left the meeting from George\u2019s office, when George, Jim, Clayton and you were there. You know what meeting I\u2019m talking about, right, when they told you you were suspended. You know what meeting I\u2019m talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">Q. You were also told that you were not to threaten or intimidate anyone involved in the investigation; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">Q. Clearly told that, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">Q. Who told you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-12\">A. Jim Geyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-13\">Q. Then you called George Lytle, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-14\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-15\">Q. And you said to George, \u201cDo you have a suitcase?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-16\">A. I asked him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-17\">Q. You asked him if he had a suitcase?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">Q. Why did you ask if he had a suitcase? What was your purpose in asking that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">A. Because he was going to need it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">Q. \u201cWhy did you think he was going to need it? Did you tell him he was going to need it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">A. I asked him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">Q. You asked him if he had a suitcase?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">Q. And you said the reason you asked is because you felt he was going to need it, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">A. Best get \u00a3er packed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-12\">Q. And that\u2019s what you said to him, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-13\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-14\">Q. Why in your mind did you think that he needed a suitcase?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-15\">A. Because I do believe George Lytle is a lot of my problems here in this situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-16\">Q. But why would he need a suitcase if he\u2019s part of your problem in your view?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-17\">A. At one time earlier, I called George Lytle a court jester.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-18\">Q. But why did you think he was going to need a suitcase packed and why did you tell him that? In your mind, why did you tell him those things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-19\">A. Because he\u2019s going to need it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-20\">Q. Why was he going to need it from your standpoint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-21\">A. For his little trip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-22\">Q. What was his little trip going to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-23\">A. lb hell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-24\">Q. And that\u2019s what you told him, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-25\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-26\">Lytle, Krall and Geyer all felt that Koepplin\u2019s calls to them were threatening and intimidating and all hung up on Koepplin. Koepplin testified he called the managers because he was concerned about his job and that he was not angry nor did he intend to threaten or intimidate anyone. Koepplin had also acted in a threatening and excitable manner during the meeting the previous day, according to testimony by management employees. The investigation conducted by mine management elicited information from other employees that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>they, too, were concerned with their safety and the safety of others because of Koepplin\u2019s threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Zortman\u2019s personnel policy provided for different \u2018levels\u201d of discipline, including termination if warranted by the serious nature of the circumstances involved. Because of Koepplin\u2019s most recent threats to management and his prior behavior as reported by co-employees and as noted in his personnel file, Zortman managers decided to terminate Koepplin\u2019s employment at the prearranged meeting on February 17, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Sheriff Eugene Peigneux was asked to be present at the meeting in order to keep the peace should Koepplin become violent. Sheriff Peigneux testified that he decided to frisk Koepplin when he arrived for the meeting. He further testified that this was his own independent decision based on his professional training and experience and that Zortman had not requested this be done. Koepplin testified that his feelings were not hurt by this conduct and that after he was frisked, he got a cup of coffee and asked the sheriff and the two deputies if they cared for a cup also. Sheriff Peigneux also decided to have one of his deputies patrol the Zortman area during his regular shift for the next few days in order to keep an eye on Koepplin.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">After his termination, Koepplin brought this action for wrongful discharge, invasion of privacy and malice. Further facts are provided throughout this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant on Koepplin\u2019s claims for wrongful discharge, invasion of privacy and malice?</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Our standard of review for an appeal of a district court\u2019s summary judgment decision is the same as that used by the district court under Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. <em>Morton v. M-W-M, Inc. </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 245, 249, 868 P.2d 576, 578. Summary judgment is proper when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden to show the Court that it has met the standards set forth in Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. <em>Morton, </em>868 P.2d at 579. If the moving party has met this burden of proof, the nonmoving party has the burden of showing that a genuine issue of material fact exists or that the moving party is not entitled to judgment as amatter of law. <em>Morton, </em>868 P.2d at 579. When raising the allegations that disputed issues of fact exist, the nonmoving party has an affirmative duty to respond by affidavits or other sworn testimony containing material facts that raise genuine issues; con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>elusory or speculative statements will not suffice. <em>Morton, </em>868 P.2d at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">WRONGFUL TERMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Under the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (the Act), an employee who has completed the employer\u2019s probationary period has a valid ground for maintaining a cause of action against the employer if the employee\u2019s discharge was not for \u201cgood cause.\u201d Section 39-2-904(2), MCA. The Act defines \u201cgood cause\u201d as \u201creasonable job-related grounds for dismissal based on a failure to satisfactorily perform job duties, disruption of the employer\u2019s operation, or other legitimate business reason.\u201d Section 39-2-903(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The issue in this case is whether Koepplin was properly terminated for disruption of the employer\u2019s operation or other legitimate business reason. A\u2018legitimate business reason\u201d is defined as \u201ca reason that is neither false, whimsical, arbitrary or capricious, and it must have some logical relationship to the needs of the business.\u201d <em>Kestell v. Heritage Health Care Corp. </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 518, 525, 858 P.2d 3, 7. The District Court emphasized disruption in the work place, noting that Zortman had the right to serve its own business interest as well, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">Koepplin\u2019s threat that he was going to send a supervisor on a trip to hell was shocking and outrageous, and no employer under Montana law has to tolerate threats and abuse of that nature. This threat by Koepplin was disruptive to the Zortman work place and gave Defendant good cause to discharge him from employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">In his Reply Brief, Koepplin\u2019s attorney argues that Koepplin did not intend this statement to be a threat. Koepplin\u2019s attorney cites no Deposition or Affidavit for this assertion. Without any basis in the factual record, the attorney for Koepplin has put his own interpretation on the statement arguing he can tell the jury that it was not a threat. Since Defendant has the right to serve its own legitimate business interest in discharging the Plaintiff, the proper focus of the inquiry should not be on whether Plaintiff\u2019s attorney characterizes this statement as a threat, but whether the statement was heard as a threat by George Lytle. George Lytle specifically testified he found the statement threatening.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">Koepplin testified in his deposition that he called the managers because he was concerned about his job. He further stated he was not angry at the time, had consumed beer that evening and denied that his conversation with Lytle constituted a threat. He claims that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>was making use of Zortman\u2019s \u201copen door\u201d policy and that his discharge from employment did not comply with the terms of Zortman\u2019s written personnel policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The undisputed facts which the District Court relied on center around Koepplin\u2019s telephone calls to Zortman managers on the night of February 15, 1993, particularly the call to Lytle. Both Krall and Geyer hung up on Koepplin and testified they interpreted the calls as threatening. Geyer called the Phillips County Sheriff after he hung up on Koepplin. The third call Koepplin made was to Lytle and the substance of that call is quoted above as testified to by Koepplin in his deposition. Earlier that day, Koepplin was specifically told not to threaten or intimidate any person involved with the investigation of the sexual harassment complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Despite being warned not to threaten anyone involved in the investigation, Koepplin called Krall, Geyer, Lytle and Green after 10:00 p.m. that same evening. These four men were in attendance at the meeting when Koepplin was suspended. Koepplin\u2019s disingenuous contention that he was making use of the Zortman\u2019s \u201copen door\u201d policy is unconvincing. Koepplin knew that management was investigating the incidents. He had been suspended during the investigation and told to come back for another meeting two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">If there were matters of importance concerning the investigation, Koepplin would have had an opportunity to respond to them at a later time. Koepplin testified to no such concerns, he did not discuss them at the meeting when he was terminated and he did not raise them after his termination. An employer\u2019s \u201copen door\u201d policy does not exist for the purpose of allowing employees to threaten or otherwise intimidate management; it is used for the purpose of encouraging meaningful communication between employer and employee relating to the employer\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Koepplin testified that his statements to Lytle \u2014 that he had best get his suitcase packed for his \u201clittle trip to hell\u201d \u2014 were not threats. He did not testify what he intended by them. He merely testified that he was concerned about his job. Lytle testified he felt threatened by the conversation. We agree with the District Court that the proper emphasis here is whether the statements were heard as a threat by Lytle and not whether Koepplin\u2019s attorney characterizes them as a threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The District Court termed Koepplin\u2019s threats to Lytle as \u201cshocking and outrageous\u201d and stated that under Montana law, no employer has to tolerate threats and abuse of that nature. Geyer\u2019s call to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>sheriff after hanging up on Koepplin and his subsequent request for the sheriff\u2019s presence at Koepplin\u2019s termination reinforce Zortman\u2019s contention that Koepplin\u2019s statements were taken seriously. Zortman\u2019s personnel policy has three \u201clevels\u201d of disciplinary treatment which may apply according to the severity of the particular circumstances. It provides for immediate termination under certain enumerated circumstances depending on the seriousness of the situation. We conclude that, in the overall context of this case, Koepplin\u2019s threat to send Lytle on a \u201clittle trip to hell\u201d was at least insubordination which justified immediate termination under Zortman\u2019s personnel policy. We further conclude that the District Court properly characterized this conduct as disruptive to the work place and that Zortman had the right to serve its own legitimate business interest by discharging Koepplin under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Moreover, Krall and Geyer both testified by deposition that Koepplin told them he would have his \u201cmouthpiece\u201d with him at the meeting and that it was the sort you would say \u201csir\u201d to. Although Koepplin did not admit to these statements, he did admit that both Geyer and Krall hung up on him. It is further undisputed that Geyer called Sheriff Peigneux after hanging up on Koepplin. Koepplin has not presented any evidence that there is an issue of material fact relating to his wrongful discharge claim. This Court has previously held that a party cannot create a disputed issue of material fact by putting his own interpretations and conclusions on an otherwise clear set of facts. <em>See, e.g., Sprunk v. First Bank Sys. </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 463, 466-67, 830 P.2d 103, 105. We conclude Koepplin\u2019s conclusory and interpretive statements of material fact do not rise to the level of genuine issues of material fact required to defeat Zortman\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Koepplin\u2019s claim for wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">INVASION OF PRIVACY</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Koepplin contends that Zortman requested the Phillips County Sheriff\u2019s presence at the termination meeting and that the ensuing frisk was a violation of his right of privacy. He maintains that the sheriff\u2019s actions cannot be separated from Zortman\u2019s because Zortman had asked Sheriff Peigneux to be there.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Sheriff Peigneux and two deputies were present and frisked and searched Koepplin upon his arrival. They did not frisk Koepplin\u2019s wife who accompanied him to the meeting. The frisk and search lasted for less than two minutes, according to Koepplin\u2019s testimony. After the termination, one of the deputies was assigned to patrol the Zortman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>area exclusively for a few days because of the circumstances surrounding Koepplin\u2019s termination. Jim Geyer requested that Sheriff Peigneux be present at Koepplin\u2019s termination \u201cto keep the peace.\u201d Sheriff Peigneux asked that the request and the reasons for asking for assistance be made in writing. Geyer provided a written request, giving details of the call he received as well as the calls received by Krall and Lytle. This was the only request made of the sheriff by any Zortman employee. The decisions to frisk Koepplin and to have a deputy patrol the Zortman area for a few days were made independently by Sheriff Peigneux based on his professional judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The District Court found that the officers\u2019 search was not a substantial invasion of a legally protected interest, that Koepplin had provided no authority to support an invasion of privacy tort theory, and that the search of Koepplin was part of his being fired and could not be separated from the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Koepplin cites <em>Johnson v. Supersave Markets, Inc. </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 465, 686 P.2d 209, for the premise that a person\u2019s right to liberty is legally protected from invasion and his emotional distress proximately caused thereby are recoverable damages for invasion of privacy. He maintains that <em>Johnson </em>held that the invasion of privacy itself could cause substantial emotional distress in and of itself. Koepplin\u2019s argument relates to a constitutional protection found in Article II, \u00a7 10 of the Montana Constitution and involves Sheriff Peigneux\u2019s independent decision to frisk and search him. We conclude there is no evidence that Zortman participated in the decision to frisk and search Koepplin nor has any agency relationship been established. Thus, there is no invasion of privacy proximately caused by Zortman\u2019s request for the sheriff \u201cto keep the peace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">MALICE</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">As conceded in his brief, Koepplin has no independent claim for malice. Pursuant to our ruling on his claims for wrongful discharge and invasion of privacy, Koepplin has no cause of action for which damages for malice may be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">We hold the District Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant on Koepplin\u2019s claims for wrongful discharge, invasion of privacy and malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b84-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, NELSON and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
