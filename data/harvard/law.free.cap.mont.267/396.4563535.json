That court entered summary judgment that the estate of Arnold Caster is entitled to accidental death benefits under a policy of insurance issued by Jefferson National. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The dispositive issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">1. Did the District Court err as a matter of law by ruling that the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment constituted an agreement that there was no dispute as to material fact?</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">2. Did the court err in ruling as a matter of law that Arnold Caster\u2019s death was caused by pulmonary aspiration when he choked to death on his own vomit and that this was an accidental death covered by the Jefferson National insurance policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">3. Did the court err in ruling as a matter of law that the exclusion in the Jefferson National policy if death is \u201ccaused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly\u201d from \u201cthe influence of any intoxicant\u201d did not exclude coverage for Caster\u2019s death?</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Arnold Caster died unexpectedly on the morning of Sunday December 1,1991, at the age of 41. His wife found him lying on the floor in the living room with his clothes on but his shoes and socks off and covered by a blanket. He was not breathing and there was a pool of vomit on the floor next to his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Efforts to revive Caster did not succeed, and he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. On the death certificate, the attending physician, Dr. Irwin, recorded the manner of death as \u201cnatural\u201d and listed the cause of death as \u201cpulmonary aspiration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Caster\u2019s estate submitted a claim for benefits under a policy of accidental death insurance Caster had purchased from Jefferson National, his home mortgage company, six months before he died. Jefferson National denied the claim on the basis that Caster\u2019s death was not an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Caster\u2019s estate filed this action in April 1993. In September of that year, Caster\u2019s estate moved for summary judgment, and two months later Jefferson National filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The record includes depositions of Dr. Irwin, the personal representative of Caster\u2019s estate, and three acquaintances of Caster. Jefferson National also filed an affidavit by Dr. Muskett, a Missoula, Montana, emergency room physician who had reviewed the deposition of Dr. Irwin and Caster\u2019s medical records. Dr. Muskett opined that an acute cardiac event was a more likely cause of Caster\u2019s death than pulmonary aspiration. Jefferson National further contended that alcohol was arguably a cause of Caster\u2019s death, because he had been drinking the night before he died. The insurance policy contained an exclusionary clause concerning intoxicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">The District Court entered summary judgment for Caster\u2019s estate. It relied on Dr. Irwin\u2019s medical opinion, in his deposition testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>that the cause of death was accidental. The court discounted the opinion of Dr. Muskett because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-3\">[t]here simply are no facts in the record upon which Dr. Muskett could rely in concluding that some physical ailment, such as a previously undetected cardiac problem, caused the vomiting or that intoxication caused the vomiting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The court concluded as a matter of law that pulmonary aspiration of vomit which results in death is an accidental death covered by the insurance policy. It ruled Jefferson National had not produced credible evidence that Caster was under the influence of intoxicants or that intoxicants caused his death. It further ruled that the intoxicant exclusion provision in the insurance policy differs from the language allowed under \u00a7 33-22-231, MCA, and is therefore void. Finally, the court stated the reasonable expectations of consumers would be that Caster\u2019s death was covered by this insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Did the District Court err as a matter of law by ruling that the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment constituted an agreement that there was no dispute as to material fact?</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Jefferson National claims certain language in the summary judgment order demonstrates that the District Court erroneously concluded the cross-motions for summary judgment constituted an agreement by the parties that there are no issues of material fact. As Jefferson National points out, the parties did not agree as to which material facts were established and were controlling. While Jefferson National argued that the facts support summary judgment in its favor, it also maintained there were disputed issues of fact precluding entry of summary judgment for Caster\u2019s estate. Specifically, Jefferson National claimed that Dr. Muskett\u2019s opinion and the unrebutted evidence that Caster drank three or four beers the night before he died create material issues of fact barring summary judgment in favor of Caster\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Jefferson National correctly states that the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, like the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, do not bar either party from claiming the existence of issues of fact sufficient to prevent entry of summary judgment against it, in spite of simultaneous motions for summary judgment by opposing parties. See <em>Heublein, Inc. v. United States </em>(2nd Cir. 1993), 996 F.2d 1455. Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">[w]hen faced with cross-motions for summary judgment, a district corut is not required to grant judgment as a matter of law for one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>side or the other. ... \u201cRather, the court must evaluate each party\u2019s motion on its own merits, taking care in each instance to draw all reasonable inferences against the party whose motion is under consideration.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><em>Heublein, </em>996 F.2d at 1461 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The District Court\u2019s comments during the hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment clearly demonstrate the court\u2019s understanding of its right to deny both parties\u2019 summary judgment motions, absent sufficient proof of either party\u2019s case. The District Court\u2019s written order supports the position of Caster\u2019s estate that the court determined that, while the estate had met its burden of proof, Jefferson National had failed to produce sufficient evidence to establish any factual issues. In its order, the District Court engaged in specific and independent reasoning on each motion for summary judgment. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">The Court finds that the facts established by the Plaintiff in support of her summary judgment motion, that Arnold Caster died as a result of pulmonary aspiration of vomit, when applied to the ... definition of \u201caccident\u201d entitles Plaintiff to the conclusion that death was accidental within the terms and conditions of the Defendant\u2019s insurance policy and that Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">The burden of proof then shifts to the Defendant in opposing Plaintiff\u2019s summary judgment motion and in support of its counter motion for summary judgment of showing that there are genuine issues of material facts and that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment. The Defendant has presented no evidence of any fact issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">The Defendant\u2019s medical expert, Dr. Muskett, concludes that death was not accidental and that the vomiting was precipitated either by intoxication or some physical ailment. However, his opinion is, of necessity, based upon the same facts as was Dr. Irwin\u2019s opinion. There simply are no facts in the record upon which Dr. Muskett could rely in concluding that some physical ailment, such as a previously undetected cardiac problem, caused the vomiting or that intoxication caused the vomiting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">The uncontroverted facts established by Plaintiff are that Arnold Caster\u2019s death was caused by pulmonary aspiration of vomit. Defendant has produced no conflicting fact issues. Defendant has, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>therefore, failed its burden in opposing Plaintiff\u2019s summary judgment motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">After reviewing the District Court\u2019s order in its entirety, we conclude the court did not hold the erroneous view that the cross-motions for summary judgment constituted agreement that there was-no dispute as to material fact. We therefore hold there is no error as alleged by Jefferson National under this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Did the court err in ruling as a matter of law that Caster\u2019s death was caused by pulmonary aspiration when he choked to death on his own vomit and that this was an accidental death covered by the Jefferson National insurance policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Our standard of review of a ruling on a motion for summary judgment is the same as a district court\u2019s \u2014 whether no genuine issues of material fact exist and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.; <em>Minnie v. City of Roundup </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 429, 849 P.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Dr. Irwin was the treating physician in the emergency room when Caster died. Dr. Irwin testified by deposition that he believed Caster had aspirated stomach contents up into the esophagus and then down into the trachea and the pulmonary tree, causing respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. He declined to speculate on whether the beer Caster consumed the evening before he died precipitated the aspiration, but noted that he usually documented a smell of alcohol if he noticed it in a patient and that he had not documented it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Dr. Irwin testified he began to write \u201ccardiac arrest\u201d on the emergency room record as the cause of Caster\u2019s death, but then, in an effort to be more precise, crossed that out and wrote \u201cpulmonary aspiration.\u201d He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">Certainly he did have a cardiac arrest. Everybody who dies has a cardiac arrest. But I think the event that led to the cardiac arrest was pulmonary aspiration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Dr. Irwin gave his opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the pulmonary aspiration occurred first and then cardiac arrest occurred second. He testified that his opinion was based on the absence of any history of cardiac problems in Caster and on his findings on physical examination of Caster. He stated he felt comfortable testifying that this was an accidental choking. He testified that he categorized the death on the death certificate as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>\u201cnatural\u201d rather than as \u201caccidental\u201d in order to spare the family from a coroner\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">In his affidavit, Dr. Muskett stated his opinion that Caster\u2019s death was not a result of pulmonary aspiration and that \u201can acute cardiac event is a far more likely cause of [Caster\u2019s] death than aspiration.\u201d However, Dr. Muskett did not give an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to what <em>was </em>the cause of Caster\u2019s death. He merely speculated on possibilities. Speculative statements are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Smith v. State Farm Ins. Companies </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 129, 131, 870 P.2d 74, 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Dr. Muskett\u2019s failure to state a positive opinion as to the cause of Caster\u2019s death is understandable, given the lack of foundation for his opinion. He never examined Caster, either before or after Caster\u2019s death. His opinion was based only on his reading of the medical records associated with Caster\u2019s death and on the deposition of Dr. Irwin.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Neither the medical records nor Dr. Irwin\u2019s deposition provides a foundation for the opinion Dr. Muskett expressed. Had the same opinion been offered at trial, it would have been within the District Court\u2019s discretion to exclude the opinion for lack of foundation. Based on our review of the medical records and Dr. Irwin\u2019s deposition, we conclude there was no abuse of discretion in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The insurance policy at issue is entitled \u201cBenefits for death caused by an accident.\u201d The policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\"><em>ACCIDENTAL DEATH BENEFIT. </em>We will pay a benefit for loss of life due to an injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The policy defines \u201cinjury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury caused solely by an accident which occurs while the insurance coverage is in force.\u201d \u201cAccident\u201d is not defined in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Where the term \u201caccident\u201d is not defined in an insurance policy, the word does not have</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\">a technical, legal meaning, but must be considered in the light of the common and accepted meaning, and construed according to common speech and usage \u2014 that the common understanding contemplates something unanticipated, unforeseen, and unusual, without design, intention, or premeditation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-12\"><em>Dalbey v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. </em>(1937), 105 Mont. 587, 599, 74 P.2d 432, 436, adopting the definition from <em>Corpus Juris Secundum. A </em>death may be an accident even if the cause is unknown. 46 C.J.S. Insurance \u00a7 863 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Jefferson National maintains Caster\u2019s estate has not met its burden of proving Caster\u2019s death was caused <em>solely </em>by accident as required under the above definition of \u201cinjury.\u201d However, Jefferson National has not produced any evidence showing, or even hinting, that Caster\u2019s death was anything but unanticipated, unforeseen and unusual, without design, intention or premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Jefferson National also argues Caster\u2019s death was due to natural physical processes, which it distinguishes from an \u201caccident.\u201d While vomiting may be a natural and normal physical process, choking to death on one\u2019s own vomit is neither natural nor normal. To the extent the term \u201caccident\u201d is ambiguous in the insurance policy, it should be interpreted against the drafter. See e.g., <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Taylor </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 215, 218, 725 P.2d 821, 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Finally, Jefferson National cites <em>Brothers v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 477, 658 P.2d 1108, as authority that Caster\u2019s estate must, eliminate alternative causes of his death. <em>Brothers </em>does not stand for that proposition. In that case, this Court held that \u201c[t]he flexible standard of circumstantial evidence,\u201d such as proof of the circumstances of an accident, similar occurrences under similar circumstances, and elimination of alternative causes, may be used to establish a product defect as the cause of damages. <em>Brothers, </em>658 P.2d at 1110. Here, Caster\u2019s estate has produced direct evidence, in the form of Dr. Irwin\u2019s opinion, as to the cause of Caster\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">We conclude, as did the District Court, that Dr. Muskett\u2019s affidavit does not raise a genuine issue of fact as to the cause of Caster\u2019s death. We hold the court did not err in ruling as a matter of law that Caster\u2019s estate met its burden of proving that Caster\u2019s death was caused by pulmonary aspiration when he choked to death on his own vomit, and that this was an accidental death covered by the Jefferson National insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Did the court err in ruling as a matter of law that the exclusion in the Jefferson National policy if death is \u201ccaused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly\u201d from \u201cthe influence of any intoxicant\u201d did not exclude coverage for Caster\u2019s death?</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Jefferson National cites the undisputed evidence that Caster drank three or four beers the evening before he died. The circumstances under which his body was found, Jefferson National argues, support its contention that Caster\u2019s estate failed to prove Caster\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>death was not caused, in the words of the insurance policy, \u201cin whole or in part, directly or indirectly\u201d from the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">As the party asserting that the exclusionary clause applied, Jefferson National, not Caster\u2019s estate, bore the burden of producing evidence sufficient to create a factual issue regarding intoxication. Jefferson National has not carried that burden. Almost two years after Caster\u2019s death, and seven months after this action was filed, all Jefferson National produced was evidence that Caster consumed three or four beers the night before he died. As stated above, the treating physician, Dr. Irwin, was unwilling to speculate on any connection between alcohol and Caster\u2019s death. No connection has been established between Caster\u2019s death and Dr. Muskett\u2019s statement that \u201calcohol intoxication or intoxication by certain medications can ... result in aspiration.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In sum, Jefferson National has not produced substantial credible evidence that the influence of alcohol had any relationship with Caster\u2019s death. We hold that the District Court did not err in its ruling concerning the intoxication exclusion in the Jefferson National insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Under these circumstances, we deem it unnecessary to farther address the issue of whether there was abuse of discretion and prejudice to Jefferson National as a result of the District Court\u2019s failure to allow an extension of time so that Jefferson National could further investigate the intoxication issue. Because we affirm the decision of the District Court for the reasons discussed above, we need not address the challenges made by Jefferson National to the alternate bases for the District Court\u2019s decision \u2014 violation by the insurance policy of \u00a7 33-22-231, MCA, and the reasonable expectations of consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b426-8\">JUSTICES HARRISON, GRAY, HUNT, TRIEWEILER, NELSON and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
