L. c. 63, \u00a7 52A, for the years 1977, 1978, and 1979. Tenneco claims that various conclusions of the board were erroneous as a matter of law, and that its decision violates Tenneco\u2019s State and Federal constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. We affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Tenneco Inc. is a Delaware corporation which has been certified to do business in Massachusetts since 1954. Since that time, Tenneco has filed Massachusetts public service corporation franchise tax returns under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 52A. Following a review of Tenneco\u2019s tax returns, the Commissioner assessed additional franchise taxes against the corporation for the years 1977-1979 totalling $1,998,624. The additional taxes stemmed from the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Tenneco should have included as taxable income dividends totalling more than one billion dollars received from its nonutility subsidiary companies over the three years in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Tenneco filed written applications to the Commissioner for abatement of the additional tax assessments. A hearing on the applications was held before the Commissioner\u2019s appeal and review bureau. Tenneco argued at the hearing that, in view of its diverse business operations, only its pipeline division should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>be taxed under the utility franchise provisions of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 52A, and its four other nonpipeline divisions should be taxed as a business corporation under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 30-42B. Tenneco urged the Commissioner to reclassify it as either a business corporation or a \u201chybrid\u201d corporation for the purposes of determining its tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The Commissioner denied Tenneco\u2019s applications and refused to abate the taxes assessing, in addition, interest, late payment penalties, and demand charges. The corporation remitted a total of $2,793,881.69, representing full payment of the taxes plus penalties and charges, and then filed timely petitions appealing the Commissioner\u2019s decision to the board. The board found that Tenneco was a utility corporation notwithstanding the diverse activities of its other divisions and held that Tenneco was subject to tax on its net income as a utility and not as a business corporation. Tenneco filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The company, now known as Tenneco Inc., was incorporated in 1943 as Tennessee Gas and Transmission Company (Tennessee Gas) for the purpose of constructing an interstate natural gas pipeline. In the decade that followed, the company expanded considerably by acquiring two additional pipeline companies and by enlarging its original system. By 1954, Tennessee Gas obtained a certificate of foreign corporation registration to do business in the Commonwealth. Since that time, the corporation has grown into a diversified, international conglomerate with interests and products in a variety of industries including: integrated oil and gas operations; natural gas pipelines; construction and farm equipment; chemicals; automotive parts; shipbuilding; agriculture and land management; packaging; and insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Throughout the period that Tenneco conducted business in the Commonwealth, including the years 1977-1979, the company filed its tax returns as a utility corporation and not as a business corporation, using a Massachusetts public service corporation franchise tax return under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 52A, rather than a foreign business or manufacturing corporation excise tax return. See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 30-39. During the years in question, the statutory scheme for the taxation of business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>corporations differed in four pertinent respects from the scheme for taxing utility corporations: (1) In calculating net income, a business corporation was allowed to deduct dividends received from any corporation in which it owned at least 15% of the voting stock, whereas utility corporations could only deduct dividends received from certain other utility corporations; (2) business corporations were taxed at a rate of 8.33%; utilities were taxed at the lesser rate of 6.5%; (3) business corporations allocated their net income by apportionment based on three factors: income, property, and employment; a utility\u2019s net income was based solely on property holdings; (4) a business corporation had the right to apply for an alternative apportionment of its income allocable to Massachusetts; a utility did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">From the date of the filing of its first return in the Commonwealth, through and including 1979, Tenneco computed its taxes as a utility corporation doing business in Massachusetts. Accordingly, the company allocated its net income pursuant to the single factor utility formula, taking advantage of the lower 6.5% franchise tax rate. However, acting as if it were a business corporation, Tenneco claimed deductions for dividends received from all its subsidiaries including nonutility divisions. After reviewing these returns, the Commissioner assessed a deficiency in the corporation\u2019s tax liability based on the disallowance of Tenneco\u2019s deductions for nonutility dividends in the following amounts: $606,912 for 1977, $658,494 for 1978, and $730,218 for 1979. The ruling was affirmed by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">A decision of .the board will only be disturbed if it was not supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d or was tainted by an error of law. See <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>397 Mass. 599, 601-602 (1986); <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981). See also G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13 (1986 ed.). General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6) (1986 ed.), defines substantial evidence as \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d See <em>New Boston Garden Corp., supra, </em>quoting <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Concord, </em>355 Mass. 79, 92 (1968). In deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>mining whether the board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, we consider the entire record. However, a finding of the board will not be set aside unless \u201cthe evidence points to no felt or appreciable probability of the conclusion or points to an overwhelming probability of the contrary.\u201d <em>New Boston Garden Corp., supra, </em>quoting L.L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 598 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Tenneco argues that its corporate activities have become so diverse that only a portion of those activities may properly be classified as utility related. Therefore, the company asserts, it should be taxed as a business corporation, or, at a minimum, its nonutility operations should be taxed under c. 63. Relying on <em>Assessors of Holyoke </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>351 Mass. 394 (1966), Tenneco claims that the board erred in failing to exercise its authority to reclassify the corporation for tax purposes. The company insists that, had the board considered the evidence, it could not have properly concluded that Tenneco should be taxed as a utility under \u00a7 52A. The board, however, properly distinguished Tenneco\u2019s claim from the facts of Assessors <em>of Holyoke </em>by pointing out that the Holyoke Water Power Company had been classified as a manufacturing corporation by the Commissioner under G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 2, and that this court followed the plain language of c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth, in ruling its machinery exempt from local taxation. Tenneco has not been so classified.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Tenneco attempts to include itself in the same class as the water power company on the basis that each corporation is involved in \u201ccross strains of business and utility\u201d activities. As evident from the board\u2019s ruling noted above, however, the status of the Holyoke Water Power Company was, by legislative decree, readily distinguishable from Tenneco\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The board rested its determination that Tenneco is properly classified as a utility on the plain language expressed in the applicable sections of c. 63.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These statutory provisions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>neither vague nor ambiguous and provide no basis to conclude that a foreign utility doing business in the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>through both utility and nonutility divisions must be taxed as a business or \u201chybrid\u201d business corporation. Rather, consistent with the definition of the term utility corporation as including any \u201cforeign pipe line corporation engaged in the transportation or sale of natural gas,\u201d the correct conclusion is that Tenneco was a utility corporation within the meaning of \u00a7 52A, irrespective of its business activities conducted outside the Commonwealth. This determination is supported by the undisputed facts that, for the tax years at issue, Tenneco conducted substantial natural gas transmission in Massachusetts through its pipeline division and filed public service corporation franchise tax returns, applied the lower utility tax rate, and utilized the single-factor apportionment formula provided under \u00a7 52A.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Tenneco also raises State and Federal constitutional claims that the inclusion in its net income of dividends paid to it by its nonpipeline subsidiaries operating outside the Commonwealth violated its equal protection and due process rights. Specifically, Tenneco claims that no reasonable connection exists between the value of its interstate business interests and the company\u2019s activities within the Commonwealth. The requisite nexus between the interstate activities of the corporate taxpayer and the taxing State is established once \u201cthe corporation avails itself of the \u2018substantial privilege of carrying on business\u2019 within the State.\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., </em>445 U.S. 425, 437 (1980). Indeed, Tenneco concedes that it carries on a substantial volume of income-producing business in the Commonwealth selling natural gas, petroleum products, and automotive parts. Nor does it deny that revenues are produced in this State by the operation of its separate divisions and subsidiaries. Tenneco does not dispute that these activities are subject to taxation. It attempts to distinguish its out-of-State dividends, however, by characterizing them as a separate taxable event immune from State tax. The argument cannot succeed unless Tenneco establishes that those dividends were not rationally related to the value of the corporation\u2019s activities in the Commonwealth <em>Container Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. 159,165-166 (1983). The mere labelling of the source of dividend income as foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>does not preclude a State from including that income in the preapportionment tax base. <em>Mobil Oil Corp., supra </em>at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Tenneco failed to demonstrate, before the board, the absence of a rational relationship between the dividend income from its nonpipeline subsidiaries and values connected with its Massachusetts operations. By contrast, a review of Tenneco\u2019s enterprise reveals the interrelatedness of its major industries. Tenneco\u2019s oil and gas operations are integrated, and its activities involve the exploration and production of natural gas which is transported to Massachusetts and sold. In addition, Tenneco has conceded that, for the years at issue, it generated revenues within the Commonwealth through the nonpipeline business operations of two of its divisions. These divisions supervised the operations of Tenneco\u2019s subsidiaries engaged in the production of automotive parts and petroleum products. These subsidiaries contributed significantly to the dividends paid to Tenneco. Also, three subsidiaries of Tenneco Corporation, a holding company, generated significant revenues within Massachusetts for the three years at issue. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Because ample evidence of a rational relationship exists between the dividend income of Tenneco\u2019s nonpipeline subsidiaries and the value of the corporation within Massachusetts, inclusion of the dividend income in the preapportionment tax base did not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Tenneco also raises the constitutional claims that taxation under the utility franchise statute violates the Federal due process clause and Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4, of the Massachusetts Constitution. Tenneco alleges that \u00a7 52A\u2019s one-factor income apportionment formula creates an apportionment not justly attributable to its operations in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In the tax years 1977-1979, \u00a7 52A (3) provided that a pipeline corporation doing business both within and without the State must allocate to the Commonwealth a portion of its net income equal to the \u201cpercentage of [the corporation\u2019s] total net income as the cost of its plant, property and equipment within the commonwealth as shown by its books of account bears to the cost of its total plant, property and equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The United States Supreme Court will not invalidate as unconstitutional an apportionment formula because it may result \u201cin taxation of some income that did not have its source in the taxing State.\u201d <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Bair, 267 </em>U.S. 267, 272 (1978). Rather, the Constitution will only bar a formula-produced assessment when \u201cthe taxpayer has proved by \u2018clear and cogent evidence\u2019 that the income attributed to the State is in fact \u2018out of all appropriate proportions to the business transacted in that State,\u2019 ... or has \u2018led to a grossly distorted result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, quoting <em>Hans Rees\u2019 Sons </em>v. <em>North Carolina ex rel. Maxwell, </em>283 U.S. 123, 135 (1931) and <em>Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. </em>v. <em>Missouri State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>390 U.S. 317, 326 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The Court has held that a single-factor formula for apportionment of a corporation\u2019s net income to a taxing State is \u201cpresumptively valid.\u201d <em>Moorman Mfg. Co., supra </em>at 273. Such a formula \u201cdoes not purport to identify the precise geographical source of a corporation\u2019s profits; rather, it is employed as a rough approximation of a corporation\u2019s income that is reasonably related to the activities conducted within the taxing State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The fact that the single-factor formula results in taxation of income which does not have its source within the Commonwealth does not invalidate the statutory taxing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Tenneco\u2019s inability to seek an alternative apportionment of its net income under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 42, for the years at issue did not violate the equal protection clause. The challenged taxing scheme did not discriminate against utility corporations, including Tenneco, since such corporations were able to utilize the abatement procedure in G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37, to seek relief from disproportionate allocation of their net income under \u00a7 52A.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Finally, Tenneco argues that the disallowance of the deduction for dividends from its nonpipeline subsidiaries violates the policy of avoiding double taxation of corporate income. Tenneco claims that double taxation occurred when the dividends received from its three subsidiaries that paid corporate excise taxes in Massachusetts were included in the corporation\u2019s net income under \u00a7 52A for the tax years 1977-1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Tenneco contends that \u00a7 52A should apply only to \u201cpure\u201d utility companies and not to corporations with diversified utility and nonutility activities in order to avoid double taxation of corporate income. This assertion, however, contravenes the plain language of \u00a7 52A. Included in the definition of a \u201cutility corporation\u201d under \u00a7 52A are not only pure utilities, but also any foreign pipeline corporation that transports or sells natural gas within the Commonwealth. The definition of \u201cnet income\u201d in \u00a7 52A, includes gross income from all sources, \u201cwithout exclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Although the excise tax base calculated under \u00a7 52A reflects dividend earnings of subsidiaries which have been taxed separately under a different statute, double taxation does not occur because the excise tax is imposed solely to tax Tenneco for the \u201cprivilege of the carrying on or doing business ... [in the Commonwealth] and not upon the individual items used to calculate that figure.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. </em>Co., 384 Mass. 607, 618 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The board properly classified Tenneco as a utility corporation subject to taxation under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 52A. There was no error in the board\u2019s decision affirming the Commissioner\u2019s assessment of additional franchise taxes plus interest, penalties, and demand charges; nor is there merit in Tenneco\u2019s claims of constitutional error. The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\"> As applicable to the issues, \u00a7 52A reads: \u201cEvery utility corporation doing business within the commonwealth shall pay annually a tax upon its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>corporate franchise in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u201c(1) When used in this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u201c(a) \u2018Utility corporation\u2019 means . . .
