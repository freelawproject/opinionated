The primary issue involved is what constitutes \u201cgood cause\u201d termination by the supplier of a wholesale liquor distributorship agreement under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties also allege other errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>of law and question the sufficiency of and support in the evidence for findings of the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (commission). The distillers also attack the constitutionality of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E. We took the cases on our own motion and affirm the decisions of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">We summarize the facts. Seagram Distillers Company (Distillers) is a division of Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc. (Seagram), a large liquor distiller. In 1973, Distillers entered into a distributorship agreement for a number of brands of liquor with a wholesaler, Country Club Wine &amp; Spirits, Inc.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Country Club). The agreement was renewed in 1974 and 1975, and continued thereafter on a month-to-month basis. The agreement contained a cancellation clause, permitting either party to cancel upon the \u201c [s]ale or transfer of control or management of the other party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In October, 1984, Paul Rubin, then the sole shareholder of Country Club, sold all of the capital stock in the corporation to Charles Gilman &amp; Sons, Inc. (Gilman).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Distillers thereupon notified Country Club that it was cancelling the distributorship agreement under the terms of the cancellation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Country Club also had distributorship agreements with other Seagram divisions and with \u201c21\u201d Brands, Inc., but none of these was covered by written contract. The other Seagram divisions notified Country Club that these agreements were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>terminated as well, citing the cancellation clause in the written agreement between Country Club and Distillers. \u201c21\u201d Brands also sought to cancel its agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Upon receipt of the notices of cancellation, Country Club applied to the commission for relief under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E. The commission determined that the distributorship agreement could properly be terminated under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E, where the distributorship agreement contained a clause providing for termination upon a transfer of management or control, but where the agreement did not contain such a clause, a sale of stock by the wholesaler did not constitute the requisite \u201cgood cause\u201d under \u00a7 25E to justify termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">1. <em>Termination under contract. </em>Subparagraph <em>(e) </em>of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E, defines \u201cgood cause\u201d for termination of a distributorship agreement as \u201cfailure to comply with the terms of sale agreed upon between supplier and wholesaler.\u201d Country Club argues that the portion of commission\u2019s decision permitting termination where there is a written cancellation clause violates the spirit of \u00a7 25E, and that the phrase \u201cterms of sale\u201d cannot be interpreted as including a cancellation clause such as the one at issue here. Seagram responds that the commission\u2019s decision strikes the proper balance between suppliers\u2019 and wholesalers\u2019 interests, and that \u201cterms of sale\u201d may properly include a clause providing for termination upon a change in management or control.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 25E is sparse. However, the Justices have expressed their opinion that the purpose of a related section of chapter 138 is to counteract the tendency toward vertical integration in the liquor industry \u2014 the so-called \u201ctied house\u201d evil. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>368 Mass. 857, 861-862 (1975) (construing G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 18). Further, \u00a7 25E appears to be one of \u201ca number of statutes enacted in this Commonwealth in recent years to redress the economic imbalance in particular relationships . . . .\u201d <em>Amoco Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Dickson, </em>378 Mass. 44, 49 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCotis, </em>366 Mass. 234, 238 (1974). In sum, the statute serves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>as a vehicle by which the commission may reconcile the competing equities between suppliers and wholesalers of liquor in the Commonwealth. See <em>Eastern of Me., Inc. </em>v. <em>Vintners Group Ltd., </em>455 A.2d 936, 941 (Me. 1983) (construing Maine liquor statute similar to \u00a7 25E). Cf. <em>Amoco Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Dickson, supra </em>at 50 (construing former G. L. c. 93E, \u00a7 5A, as appearing in St. 1976, c. 64, \u00a7 5). Bearing these purposes in mind, we discern no error in the commission\u2019s interpretation and application of \u00a7 25E.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">\u201cPersons in a highly sensitive, closely scrutinized business (such as the liquor business) have need to know about and appraise the persons behind corporations with whom they are doing business.\u201d <em>Union Liquors Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 936, 938 (1981). A cancellation clause represents a reasonable method by which suppliers and wholesalers alike may protect their freedom to choose with whom they will deal. <em>Id. </em>We comprehend nothing in the language or intent of \u00a7 25E which acts to countermand that contractual freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Country Club argues, however, that allowing suppliers to use cancellation clauses may unconscionably exploit the inequality of bargaining power between suppliers and wholesalers, effectively permitting suppliers to write their own definitions of \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">While it may be true that suppliers enjoy superior bargaining power over wholesalers, this fact alone does not warrant the conclusion that agreements between the parties are unconscionable. See <em>Zapatha </em>v. <em>Dairy Mart, Inc., </em>381 Mass. 284, 291-295 (1980). Indeed, the degree of bargaining advantage enjoyed by suppliers is itself open to question. There is testimony in the record indicating that the Massachusetts wholesale liquor industry may soon be comprised of only four or five large Statewide distributors. Thus, the wholesalers enjoy some measure of concentrated market power.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Furthermore, liquor wholesalers are not in the position of single-product franchisees, dependent on the supplier for their very livelihood. A wholesaler may handle a number of distinct, competing product lines. While a wholesaler may suffer in terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>of prestige and market share by losing a particular supplier\u2019s product line, he will not thereby ineluctably lose his entire business. Wholesalers also retain the right to appeal to the commission if they believe a termination has been made other than for \u201cgood cause.\u201d See G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E. The commission has already imposed a requirement that any breach of terms of sale be \u201cmaterial.\u201d <em>Whitehall Co. </em>v. <em>Guild Wineries &amp; Distillery, Inc., </em>ABCC decision, February 27, 1986. Therefore, wholesalers are not helpless victims but rather enjoy some degree of economic bargaining power and the \u201cgood cause\u201d termination provision of \u00a7 25E.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Country Club argues that the provision of the statute permitting cancellation for good cause because of failure to comply with \u201cterms of sale agreed upon\u201d cannot be read to permit a cancellation clause as broad as the one at issue here. In support of its argument, Country Club cites cases from other jurisdictions holding that \u201cterms of sale\u201d means only such terms as price, quantity and kind of goods or the time for payment. See <em>Southern New England Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utils. Comm\u2019n, </em>144 Conn. 516 (1957); <em>Stancroffv. Brown, </em>76 Mich. App. 589 (1977); <em>Federal Land Bank </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>199 Miss. 615 (1946); <em>Clovis </em>v. <em>Southwestern Pub. Serv. Co., </em>49 N.M. 270 (1945). Seagram cites cases from still other jurisdictions for the proposition that \u201cterms of sale\u201d is not restricted to the above categories. <em>Platter </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Elkhart County, </em>103 Ind. 360 (1885). <em>Matter of Masters, </em>49 N.C. App. 322, 326 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">We need not choose sides in this battle of citations. The phrase \u201cterms of sale\u201d is to be interpreted in the context of the whole statute. <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>324 Mass. 309, 312 (1949). The commission \u2014 the agency charged with interpreting and enforcing the \u201cgood cause\u201d provision of \u00a7 25E \u2014 has construed the statutory language as permitting the kind of cancellation clauses at issue here. That interpretation is entitled to this court\u2019s deference. <em>AmherstPelham Regional School Comm. </em>v. <em>Department of Educ., </em>376 Mass. 480, 491-492 (1978). The Appeals Court, as well, has upheld determinations that \u201cterms of sale\u201d denotes more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>price, quantity, kind, and payment terms. <em>New England Liquor Sales Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 921 (1983). <em>Union Liquors Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 936 (1981). Since those cases were decided, the Legislature has amended \u00a7 25E without altering the \u201cterms of sale\u201d language. See St. 1982, c. 627, \u00a7 10. From this we may infer the Legislature\u2019s approval of the commission\u2019s construction of the statute. See <em>Luacaw </em>v. <em>Fire Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>350 Mass. 326, 328-329 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Country Club claims that this interpretation of \u00a7 25E leaves wholesalers with less protection than they would have without the statute. In making this argument, the wholesaler relies on <em>Larese </em>v. <em>Creamland Dairies, </em>767 F.2d 716, 717 (10th Cir. 1985), which held that a franchisor could not unreasonably withhold consent to an assignment of the franchise where the franchise agreement conditioned assignment upon the franchisor\u2019s consent. However, even if we assume that the rule of the <em>Larese </em>case has application here, it does not stand for the proposition that the parties to the franchise agreement could not <em>contract </em>for an absolute right of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The wholesaler argues at some length that this court should impose a duty of reasonableness on the supplier in exercising its right to terminate under the contract. This argument was not raised either before the commission or in the Superior Court. Hence, it may not be raised for the first time here. <em>M.H. Gordon &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>386 Mass. 64, 67-68 (1982), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">2. <em>Terminations in absence of written contract. </em>The commission also applied the provisions of \u00a7 25E to the relationship between Country Club and the other Seagram divisions and \u201c21\u201d Brands where no written agreement existed. Seagram argues that the statute has no application because the sale of stock created a new entity with which it had not previously done business.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Seagram\u2019s argument assumes that a sale of stock in a corporate liquor wholesaler constitutes a transfer of that corporation\u2019s license to sell liquor. The short answer to this assumption is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>that a sale of stock does not effect such a transfer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The transaction between Rubin and Gilman had no legal effect on the license held by Country Club. Cf. <em>Griffin\u2019s Brant Rock Package Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 768, 772 (1981) (entrusting management duties to another not a license transfer).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">It is a basic tenet that a corporation is a legal entity distinct from its shareholders. <em>Marsch </em>v. <em>Southern New England R.R., </em>230 Mass. 483, 497-498 (1918). \u201cOnce the corporate existence has begun, even though the stockholders, directors and corporate name may change, the corporation retains the same rights, liabilities and responsibilities until dissolved.\u201d 6 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporations \u00a7 2456 (perm. ed. 1979 &amp; Supp. 1986), citing <em>Continental Bankers Life Ins. Co. of the South, Inc. </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>561 S.W. 2d 460, 464 n.2 (Tenn. App. 1977).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See generally Peairs, Business Corporations \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, .10 (1971 &amp; 1985 Supp.), and cases cited.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We discern no reason of policy or legislative intent in this case which would justify disregarding the corporate form.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, we reject Seagram\u2019s claim, and we agree with the commission that Country Club is entitled to the protection of \u00a7 25E.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">3. <em>The parties\u2019 other statutory claims. </em>In addition, both Seagram and Country Club claim that certain of the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>sion\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial evidence. Country Club alone asserts that the commission made various errors of law and failed adequately to explain its decision. We reject these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">We sustain the decision of the commission if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>385 Mass. 651, 657 (1982). <em>Olde Towne Liquor Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>372 Mass. 152, 153 (1977). <em>Almeida Bus Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>348 Mass. 331, 342 (1965). Judicial inquiry under the substantial evidence test is limited to determination of whether, within the record developed before the administrative agency, there is such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the agency\u2019s conclusion. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>University Hosp., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 516, 520-521 (1971). G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6). If there is such evidence, we affirm the agency\u2019s action even though we might have reached a different result if placed in the position of the agency. <em>School Comm. of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>376 Mass. 112, 120 (1978). <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>University Hosp. Inc., supra </em>at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">\u201cIt is for the agency, not the courts, to weigh the credibility of witnesses and resolve factual disputes.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 120. <em>Saxon Coffee Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd., </em>380 Mass. 919, 930 (1980). <em>Number Three Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 301, 309 (1979). We accord \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). <em>Dohoney </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 333, 337 n.3 (1979). We \u201cgive due weight to [the commission\u2019s] specialized knowledge affecting the regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages.\u201d <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>334 Mass. 613, 618 (1956), quoted in <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. </em>v. <em>License Comm\u2019rs of Springfield, </em>387 Mass. 833, 836 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Seagram argues that there was no substantial evidence for the commission\u2019s findings that (1) Country Club was the same entity that entered into the original distributorship agreement with Distillers, and (2) the sale of stock from Rubin to Gilman was not a sale of assets. Both findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">There was evidence that the 1973 distributorship agreement designated \u201cCountry Club Soda Co., Inc.\u201d as distributor. The agreement was signed \u201cCountry Club Soda Co., Inc., Distributor by: Maurice Elion, President.\u201d The record contains the articles of amendment by which Country Club Soda Co., Inc., changed its name to Country Club Wine &amp; Spirits, Inc. Furthermore, the stipulated facts show that Seagram \u201csold brand name alcoholic beverages to Country Club Soda Co., Inc.\u201d Finally, testimony disclosed that Country Club Wine &amp; Spirits, Inc., was the same corporate entity that Rubin had owned. On this evidence, the commission could fairly decide that Country Club Wine &amp; Spirits, Inc., was the same corporate entity as Country Club Soda Co., Inc., the party to the 1973 distributorship agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">As to the finding that the sale of stock was not an asset sale, Seagram concedes that the transaction was a sale of shares, that Country Club was liable for the accounts payable allocable to the liquor business, that Country Club\u2019s balance sheet indicated that the corporate entity was still intact, and that the transaction did not appear to be a sale of assets. On these facts the commission could conclude that the transaction between Rubin and Gilman was a sale of stock, not an asset sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">For its part, Country Club claims that the commission erroneously concluded that Distillers did not waive its right to terminate Country Club under the 1973 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The commission found that the 1973 contract \u201ccontained an \u2018evergreen\u2019 clause providing for its continued effect.\u201d That clause required 30 days advance notice of an intent not to renew the contract. Since Country Club does not contend that such notice was given, the contract remained in force on its face. Cf. <em>Milona Corp. </em>v. <em>Piece O\u2019Pizza of Am. Corp., </em>1 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>App. Ct. 839, 840 (1973). There was also evidence in the record that the parties continued to abide by the terms of the contract. Hence, the commission\u2019s finding that the 1973 distributorship agreement remained in force contained no error of law and was supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">There was also no error in the commission\u2019s finding that Distillers had not waived its right to terminate Country Club\u2019s written distributorship agreement. The evidence as to waiver was conflicting. The question of waiver was a question of credibility of witnesses and weighing of the evidence, tasks which are for the commission, not this court, to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Furthermore, the commission put a different construction on the evidence from that advanced by Country Club; the commission found that \u201cto the extent these conversations [between Rubin and Nussman, and various Seagram employees] occurred the Commission does not find they constituted a waiver. The principals, both buyer and seller, of Country Club were aware that the employees did not have the authority to bind Seagram on the question of termination.\u201d When a person knows of an agent\u2019s lack of authority or knows of a limit on that authority, he cannot reasonably rely on the agent to bind the principal. <em>Costonis </em>v. <em>Medford Hous. Auth., </em>343 Mass. 108, 113 (1961). <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Cities Serv. Ref. Co., </em>282 Mass. 487, 490 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The evidence was sufficient to enable the commission to conclude that Seagram had not waived its rights to terminate the distributorship agreement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>4. <em>Seagram\u2019s constitutional claims. </em>Seagram contends that \u00a7 25E, on its face and as applied, violates various provisions of the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. These claims were not raised before the commission and we therefore decline to consider them here for the first time. <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Board of Pub. Accountancy, </em>394 Mass. 118, 126 (1985). <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of Boston, </em>388 Mass. 491, 493 (1983). <em>Shamrock Liquors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>7 Mass.

L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 18 and 23 (1986 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\"> For these same reasons, we reject Seagram\u2019s argument that the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that Country Club Wine &amp; Spirits, Inc., was the same legal entity as Country Club Soda Co., Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\"> The Legislature itself has recognized this elementary distinction in the context of retail licenses. See G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15A (1986 ed.) (commission must approve sale of retailer\u2019s stock).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b736-10\"> In <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 346-350 (1964), we disregarded the corporate form in holding that Cardullo\u2019s was in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15, which proscribed the ownership of more than three package store licenses by any one person, combination of persons or corporation, whether \u201cdirectly or indirectly, or through any agent, employee, stockholder, officer, or other person or any subsidiary whatsoever. . . .\u201d As the quoted language indicates, the statute clearly mandated that we look through the corporate form. No such mandate is apparent in \u00a7 25E.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\"> Country Club complains that the commission failed to make adequate findings to support its conclusion. Elaborate findings on this simple factual issue were not required. The commission found that the contract contained an \u201cevergreen clause,\u201d that two renewals were signed and thereafter the parties continued to abide by the terms of the agreement without complaint. This is sufficient explanation for this court to perform its reviewing function. See <em>School Comm. of Chicopee </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>361 Mass. 352, 354-355 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\"> We note that the agreement itself contained a clause providing that no \u201cwaiver ... of any of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon either party, unless in writing and signed by an officer thereunto authorized.\u201d There is no evidence in the record of a written waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
