We transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. We discern no error in the commission\u2019s order, but, for reasons set forth below, we remand the case to the commission for further consideration. At issue is whether the school committee violated G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 (a)(1), (2), &amp; (5), by failing to discharge O\u2019Brien for refusing to pay the agency service fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">O\u2019Brien is a nonmember of the association, but he is required as a condition of employment to pay a service fee to the association for its representation of him in its collective bargaining activities. G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 12. He is not required, however, to support the social, political, or special activities of the association. <em>Abood </em>v. <em>Detroit Bd. of Educ., </em>431 U.S. 209 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">We learn from the commission\u2019s findings of fact that O\u2019Brien was employed by the school committee as a teacher for the 1982-1983 school year, during which the agency service fee was set by the association at $217 per year. Of this amount, $17 was allocated to the local association, $145 to the State association (MTA), and $55 to the national association (NEA). Membership in the MTA and NEA was a precondition to membership in the local association according to the association by-laws. The association gave notice on October 22, 1982, that the agency service fee was due and payable by December 1, 1982, and a second reminder was posted on November 23, 1982. O\u2019Brien did not pay the fee by December 1, 1982. After receiving a demand letter sent on February 2, 1983, O\u2019Brien tendered to the association a check in the amount of $17 in lieu of the full amount demanded. He tendered this amount sometime prior to April 16, 1983. This check was returned to O\u2019Brien by the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The association wrote to the superintendent-director of the Whittier Regional Vocational Technical School District on February 17, 1983, demanding the initiation of dismissal proceedings against O\u2019Brien for failure to pay the full fee. The school committee responded on February 22, 1983, by advising the association that it would not take any action \u201cuntil such time as the factual and legal issues regarding the Association\u2019]s refusal to accept the payment of the service fee and the determination of the amount of the service fee have been resolved by either the American Arbitration Association, Essex County Superior Court or Labor Relations Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In 1982, there was pending an arbitration proceeding seeking an interpretation of the agency service fee provision in the collective bargaining agreement at issue in this case. Sometime later, the parties mutually agreed to withdraw this arbitration proceeding and to allow the matter to be decided by the commission. The association sent another letter on March 3, 1983, to the superintendent, demanding compliance with the collective bargaining agreement by the school committee. Again, the superintendent declined because the case was then pending before the commission. A final demand for O\u2019Brien\u2019s dismissal was made on April 15, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">O\u2019Brien has not filed a charge of prohibited practice against the bargaining agent in protest of the amount of the service fee. See 456 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 17.06 (l)-(3) (1986), and, <em>infra </em>note 3. The school committee argued before the commission for him that he had fulfilled his obligation under the collective bargaining agreement by tendering $17. Article 3-04 of the agreement provides: \u201cAs a condition of his continued employment, every teacher, if and when not a member in good standing of the Association, shall pay or, by payroll deduction, have paid to the Association an agency fee of an amount to be determined by the Association, but in no event in excess of <em>its dues </em>...\u201d (emphasis supplied). The term \u201cits dues\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ambiguous, the committee argues, and may refer only to the dues of the local association and not to those of the MTA or the NEA. The commission has decided this issue adversely to the school committee in recognizing $217 as the amount due. There is no error on the record before us, though we hasten to add that O\u2019Brien is not a party in the case before the commission, and he may have certain statutory rights under G. L. c. 71 when confronted with dismissal. He may have acquired tenure at some time prior to the issuance of the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">1. <em>Jurisdiction of the commission. </em>There is no merit to the school committee\u2019s argument that the commission was without authority or jurisdiction to order dismissal of a teacher because such action is within the area of the school committee\u2019s nondelegable duties. The nondelegability doctrine has never been stretched this far. In <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational School Dist. Comm. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>386 Mass. 414,423-424 (1982), we upheld an order of the commission requiring reinstatement of a teacher who had been discharged for union activity even though reinstatement resulted in tenure for the teacher. The order in the instant case is well within the commission\u2019s broad powers under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">2. <em>Prohibited practice violation. </em>The school committee argues that its failure to discharge O\u2019Brien was not a violation of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10(a)(5) &amp; (1). This argument cannot stand. It is true that the seminal case, <em>School Comm, of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>385 Mass. 70 (1982), which required revamping the procedure governing payment of contested agency fees, was not decided until January 14, 1982. The school committee seems to argue that <em>Greenfield </em>caused such procedural confusion that it should be excused from answering the demands of the association to comply with the collective bargaining agreement by discharging O\u2019Brien for failure to pay the agency fee. However, between January, 1982 and December, 1986, when the commission issued its order in this case, there elapsed an abundance of time within which to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>3. <em>Failure of association to notify O\u2019Brien of demand. </em>Assuming, without deciding, that the school committee has standing to advance an argument in the name of O\u2019Brien, the argument that O\u2019Brien was not given appropriate notice cannot stand. When he tendered $17, the association rejected the tender and steadfastly demanded the entire amount, $217.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The equities seem to favor giving O\u2019Brien the opportunity to be heard before the commission. We remand the case to the commission to give O\u2019Brien an opportunity within ninety days from the date of this decision to pay the service fee demanded with interest or to file late a charge<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> regarding the amount to be paid as service fee. Giving O\u2019Brien the opportunity of bringing a prohibited practice charge to challenge the fee amount is a recognition of the conclusion reached in <em>Greenfield, supra </em>in which this court stated that \u201c[t]he commission may require the employee to pay the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>puted fee into an escrow account, but may not require it to be paid to the organization until the commission has determined the permissible fee. Once the employee has brought a complaint, the burden of justifying the fee as permissible must rest on the organization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\"> This letter mentioned only Joseph Lyons, a teacher whose position as to the service fee was the same as O\u2019Brien\u2019s.
