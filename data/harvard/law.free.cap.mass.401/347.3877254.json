The commission concluded that the licensee \u201cmade distinctions and discriminated on account of race, relative to the admission of persons to [its] licensed premises\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 98, and rule 14<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the board\u2019s rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The licensee commenced an action in the Superior Court for judicial review of the commission\u2019s action pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. A Superior Court judge denied the licensee\u2019s application for a preliminary injunction staying the enforcement of the commission\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The licensee moved for summary judgment. The licensee\u2019s motion for summary judgment was denied and summary judgment was entered for the commission pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The Superior Court judge entered a memorandum of decision in which he concluded that the commission\u2019s findings and decision were \u201csupported by substantial evidence, and that the evidence before the Commission supported its adoption of the Board\u2019s findings\u201d He also determined \u201cthat the findings support the legal conclusion that the [licensee] engaged in discriminatory practices and that ... the Commission was within its discretion in affirming the sanction imposed.\u201d The licensee appealed, arguing that (1) the commission\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence; (2) the commission failed to make a required finding of intent to discriminate; (3) the notice of the charges brought was deficient; (4) the commission improperly adopted the findings and determinations of the board without deciding all issues of law and fact de novo; and (5) the sanction imposed \u2014 revocation of the liquor license \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>is grossly disproportionate to sanctions imposed in similar cases. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">We summarize the evidence. In 1983, the licensee operated a nightclub located at 1192-1198 Commonwealth Avenue in Alisten. As a result of complaints of \u201cselective discrimination\u201d against blacks in its admissions policies, fifteen members of the \u201cCommunity Disorders Unit\u201d of the Boston police department conducted a series of investigations at the licensee\u2019s place of business at various times over the period between April 17 and May 2, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">On several occasions during this investigation, plainclothes officers and detectives approached, entered, or attempted to enter the licensee\u2019s premises. On one of the nights of the investigation, three officers, two black males and one white female, were denied entry when they failed to produce a second form of photographic identification in addition to their valid Massachusetts driver\u2019s licenses. While they were detained at the door, the officers observed several white patrons enter without having to produce any identification. On another occasion, three plainclothes officers, all white, entered the licensee\u2019s premises without being detained or asked for any form of identification. One of those officers said that \u201cthe only people who were turned away on that evening were black people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">On each of the nights of the investigation, the police observed between 100 and 250 patrons enter the licensee\u2019s establishment. On four of these nights the police interviewed black individuals who were denied admission as to the reasons given to them for their exclusion. The reasons reported included improper attire, failure to produce two forms of identification, and lack of a \u201cVIP\u201d card issued by the licensee. However, the officers witnessed white patrons enter the premises on the same evenings who were dressed more casually than the blacks turned away, and who were not required to present any form of identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">On Sunday night, April 17, 1983, one Charles Griffin, a forty-three year old black man from Cambridge, attempted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>enter the licensee\u2019s premises. The licensee\u2019s doorman informed him that \u201che would not be allowed to get in because he did not have a VIP card.\u201d Griffin asked how he might obtain such a card. The doorman responded that the club was closing in six months, and that a card therefore would serve no useful purpose to Griffin. An employee of the licensee conceded at the board hearing that Griffin did not look underage. Two weeks later, Lester Hayes, another black man, was denied admission to the licensee\u2019s premises for lack of a \u201cVIP\u201d card. The doorman referred Hayes to Sarkis Kavlakian, the owner, who told Hayes, \u201cCome back Wednesday to get your V.I.P. card.\u201d Kavlakian admitted at the board hearing that he tells patrons to come back on Wednesday to get a VIP card if he wants to get rid of them. There is no one at the club during the day on Wednesdays to issue VIP cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Shortly after the police investigation, the Boston Licensing Board conducted hearings to determine whether the licensee did, in fact, discriminate against black persons in its admissions policy. After reviewing the testimony of twenty-two witnesses, six police reports, and other documentary evidence, the board rendered a \u201cDecision and Statement of Reasons,\u201d including eighteen detailed subsidiary findings, wherein it voted to revoke the licensee\u2019s liquor license. The board expressly found \u201ca deliberate pattern\u201d of discrimination. The licensee appealed the board\u2019s decision to the commission pursuant to G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 67. After a hearing, the commission affirmed the action of the board. In its decision, the commission upheld the board\u2019s revocation of the plaintiff\u2019s license and incorporated by reference the board\u2019s statement of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">1. <em>Substantial evidence. </em>The licensee argues that the decision of the commission must be reversed under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (1986 ed.), because there is no evidence that the black individuals who were excluded were denied admission due to their race. The licensee argues that the record shows that all the alleged incidents of discrimination occurred on Sunday, the club\u2019s busiest night, that overcrowding was a problem at the club, and that the alleged incidents of discrimination constituted nothing more than the licensee\u2019s legitimate, race-neu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>tral efforts to restrict entry to \u201cpreferred customers\u201d who held \u201cVIP\u201d cards. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The evidence warrants the finding that the licensee on more than one occasion detained blacks at the door and forced them to produce more forms of identification than whites entering at the same time. The evidence also warrants the finding that the licensee excluded blacks allegedly because of their attire, even though they were dressed as well as, or better than, whites admitted at the same time. The commission considered evidence that the licensee at times admitted blacks to the licensee\u2019s premises and excluded whites. The commission concluded that the licensee limited the number of blacks it admitted, and excluded other blacks on the basis of race.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on the evidence, the commission could conclude that the licensee\u2019s proffered excuses were merely pretexts and that the licensee was discriminating against some persons because of race.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The licensee asserts that the -evidence does not meet the substantial evidence standard. Substantial evidence is \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6) (1986 ed.). <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981). Although we must consider the entire record and take into account whatever detracts from the weight of the evidence, <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 253 (1966), we do not make a de novo determination of the facts or draw different inferences from the facts found by the agency. <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational School Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>386 Mass. 414, 419-420 (1982). \u201cA court may not displace an administrative board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court might justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>School Comm, of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>376 Mass. 112, 120 (1978); <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>University Hosp., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 516, 521 (1971). See also <em>Smith College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>376 Mass. 221, 224-225 (1978). Credibility of witnesses is for the agencies, see <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational School Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 420-421, and the agency has the benefit of observing the witnesses in judging credibility. See <em>id.; Olde Towne Liquor Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>372 Mass. 152, 154 (1977). Further, the agency need not view each piece of evidence in isolation, but may consider all the evidence bearing on the licensee\u2019s conduct. The agency also is entitled to draw inferences from the evidence it finds credible. There was no error in concluding that there was substantial evidence of racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The licensee next suggests that because the anti-discrimination statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 98, is a criminal statute, it is unclear what standard the commission was required to employ and that the commission did not clearly state what standard it did employ. Contrary to the licensee\u2019s argument, it is abundantly clear that substantial evidence is the appropriate standard regardless of whether the alleged violation is of a criminal statute or a regulation. See, e.g., <em>Saxon Coffee Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd., </em>380 Mass. 919, 930 (1980); <em>United Food Corp. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>375 Mass. 238, 244 (1978); <em>Aristocratic Restaurant of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n (No. I), </em>374 Mass. 547, 552, appeal dismissed, 439 U.S. 803 (1978); <em>Olde Towne Liquor Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 153; <em>New Palm Gardens, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 785, 789-790 (1981). The commission can determine whether a licensee has violated G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 98, for purposes of license revocation under the standard of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 23 and 64, regardless of the existence or outcome of a criminal court proceeding. See <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>383 Mass. 299, 317 (1981). See also <em>New Palm Gardens, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 789-790.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>The licensee also argues that the commission\u2019s decision is not based on substantial evidence because four of the seven persons found to have been discriminated against did not testify before the commission (although they did testify before the board), and thus the commission\u2019s findings regarding those four persons are based on hearsay. The licensee expressly stated before the commission that it did not object to introduction of the transcript of the board\u2019s proceedings. Thus, the licensee cannot now argue that the admission of the evidence was error. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Second Dist. Court ofE. Middlesex, </em>389 Mass. 508, 515 (1983). The evidence was more than sufficient for the commission to determine that the licensee discriminated against blacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">2. <em>Required findings of intent to discriminate. </em>We reject the licensee\u2019s argument that the agencies failed to make a required finding of intent to discriminate. The board expressly found \u201ca deliberate pattern\u201d of discrimination pursuant to which the licensee \u201cpermitted a limited number of black patrons to be admitted to the licensed premises and . . . established and instituted a system of discrimination in the further admission of black persons by arbitrarily and capriciously applying the requirements of: (a) \u2018proper dress\u2019; (b) V.I.P. cards; [and]'(c) Multiple picture identification cards.\u201d Those findings were adopted by the commission after a de novo hearing. Discriminatory intent could be inferred from the licensee\u2019s pattern of conduct directed against black persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">3. <em>Inadequate notice. </em>The licensee\u2019s challenge to the adequacy of the notice it received from the board is not supported by the appellate record. Notice of violations is sufficient when it \u201caffords the parties reasonable opportunity to prepare and present evidence.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (1). Here the notice to the licensee stated: \u201cThat on April 17th, 24th, May 1st, 2d, 1983 you did make a distinction, discrimination or restriction on account of race or color relative to the admission of persons in a place of public accommodations, in violation of G. L. c. 272, section 98.\u201d This notice provided the licensee with ample opportunity to prepare for the hearing, and the licensee in fact presented eight witnesses at that hearing/ Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>by the time of the de novo hearing before the commission, any defect which might have existed in the notice was cured, because the licensee had detailed notice of all the facts supporting the charges brought against it. See <em>United Food Corp. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 243. Agency action will be reversed only where \u201cthe substantial rights of any party may have been prejudiced.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7)(d) (1986 ed.). <em>Aristocratic Restaurant of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n (No. I), supra </em>at 551. No showing of prejudice, let alone substantial prejudice, has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">4. <em>De novo hearing. </em>The licensee admits that the commission could receive in evidence a transcript of the board hearing, <em>United Food Corp. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 243, and that the commission could adopt the board\u2019s findings without making further findings. <em>Olde Towne Liquor Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 155. The licensee\u2019s basic complaint seems to be that the commission should have made different findings based on the evidence presented in the de novo hearing. As already noted, however, the commission\u2019s findings are fully supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>supra </em>at 351-352.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">5. <em>Disproportionate penalty. </em>The licensee argues that revocation of its license is a disproportionate penalty. It is unclear whether the licensee properly preserved its objection to the penalty. At oral argument, the licensee claimed that it placed the issue of disproportionate penalty in its notice of appeal to the commission. That notice is not in the record before us. The licensee did raise the issue of disproportionate penalty in the Superior Court. However, an issue not raised before the commission is deemed waived.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>of Registration of Chiropractors, 396 </em>Mass. 374, 382 (1985); <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Board of Pub. Accountancy, </em>394 Mass. 118, 126 (1985); <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of Boston, </em>388 Mass. 491, 493 (1983). Clearly, the licensee here had ample opportunity to raise the issue of the severity of the board\u2019s sanction in its hearing before the commission. See, e.g., <em>Olde Towne Liquor Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>372 Mass. 152, 154-155 (1977); <em>Board of Selectmen of Clinton </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 905 (1983). See also G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 67, third par.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Assuming the issue is properly presented, there is no error. It is \u201cwell settled that in reviewing the penalty imposed by an administrative body which is duly constituted to announce and enforce such penalties, neither a trial court nor an appellate court is free to substitute its own discretion as to the matter; nor can the reviewing court interfere with the imposition of a penalty by an administrative tribunal because in the court\u2019s own evaluation of the circumstances the penalty appears to be too harsh.\u201d <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. 519, 529 (1979), and cases cited. A court will interfere with the agency\u2019s discretion in this area \u201conly . . . in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528-529.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Revocation of a license is one of the sanctions provided by G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 64, and the licensee\u2019s own affidavits indicate that it is imposed regularly by the board and the commission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Racial discrimination relative to admission to a place of public accommodation is a very serious offense. In support of its position, the licensee points to one other action in which the commission imposed a sanction of suspension based on a finding of a violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 98. The licensee stresses that in that case the penalty was only a one-year suspension. A showing of a single lengthy suspension \u2014 itself a severe penalty \u2014 for a similar offense does not require a conclusion that the penalty imposed in this case is disproportionate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There was no abuse of discretion in revoking the plaintiff\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-5\"> Rule 14 provides in relevant part: \u201cNo licensee shall make any distinction, discrimination or restriction on account of race, color, religious creed, national origin, sex or ancestry relative to the admission or treatment of any person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\"> The docket reflects that the licensee sought preliminary relief staying the commission\u2019s order from three different Superior Court judges. Every judge denied the stay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b367-6\"> The licensee asserts that the commission\u2019s findings are inadequate because it did not find that the licensee was a place of public accommodation. The argument is specious. In the first paragraph of its complaint, the licensee stated that it held an \u201call alcoholic common victualer\u2019s license\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 12. In its answer, the commission admitted that fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\"> The licensee\u2019s claim that the commission abdicated its responsibility to grant a de novo hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 67, and c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 10-13, is frivolous. The licensee received a fresh adjudicatory hearing before the commission; it cross-examined all of the board\u2019s witnesses and presented eleven witnesses of its own, including four who did not testify before the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b370-11\"> The licensee\u2019s reliance on <em>Olde Towne Liquor Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>for the proposition that a penalty imposed by the board may be attacked for the first time before the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Court, is misplaced. In <em>Olde Towne Liquor Store, </em>the appellant properly preserved its argument of disproportionate penalty by raising it before the commission. <em>Id. </em>at 154-155.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b371-9\"> The licensee then had another opportunity to complain about the commission\u2019s upholding of that penalty through a request for administrative reconsideration pursuant to 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01 (10) (p). See <em>Norway Cafe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, 7 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 37, 40 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b371-10\"> In the Superior Court the licensee filed an affidavit which indicates that serious offenses such as drug sales on occasion resulted in penalties less severe than revocation. The licensee suggests that invidious discrimination may not be punished more severely than these other offenses. We disagree. Generally the range of penalties is for the agency. The commission was well within its authority in determining that racial discrimination is a most serious infraction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\"> In the case the licensee points to, <em>In re Dartmouth Restaurant Corp., </em>ABCC decision, June 11, 1985, the commission, citing the decision of the Appeals Court in <em>Board of Selectmen of Clinton </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019 n, supra, </em>assumed that the board imposed a long suspension instead of a revocation because of its view that a revocation could be appealed a second time to the commission pursuant to G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 67, sixth par., whereas a suspension carried no similar statutory right of reappeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
