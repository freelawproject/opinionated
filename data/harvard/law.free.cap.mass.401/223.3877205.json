L., c. 268A, \u00a7 7, of Robert J. Quinn\u2019s dual activities as a bail commissioner appointed by the Superior Court and as an employee of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. We granted the parties\u2019 applications for direct appellate review. We have today decided Quinn\u2019s appeal adversely to him. See <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n, ante </em>210 (1987). In the <em>Quinn </em>case we answered the substantive issue presented in this case and raised in a judge\u2019s report of the case to the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">The Bail Committee has indicated that the <em>Quinn </em>case makes unnecessary any decision by us on whether the Bail Committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>has standing to appeal the commission\u2019s decision. We see no practical need to answer that question. It is true that, technically, that question should be answered in order to determine whether the Bail Committee\u2019s appeal of the Commission\u2019s decision should be dismissed or the commission\u2019s decision should be affirmed on the authority of the <em>Quinn </em>case. We believe that a practical solution is to enter an order in the Superior Court that, in light of this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>the Bail Committee\u2019s appeal is dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b240-14\">Liacos, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afv\">(dissenting, with whom Nolan and Lynch, JJ., join). I dissent for the reasons stated in my separate opinion in <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n, ante </em>at 218 (1987).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
