The conviction was affirmed upon review by the Appeals Court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherick, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 338 (1987). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review, and we also affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">The relevant facts are set out in detail in the opinion of the Appeals Court. In sum the evidence warranted a finding that the victim was forcibly raped by the defendant in his automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>after he had offered to give the victim a ride from her home, where the defendant had been a guest, to a friend\u2019s house where the victim intended to babysit. The defense at trial was consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">1. After the Appeals Court decision in the case was published, this court decided <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, </em>400 Mass. 136 (1987). The defendant claims that certain remarks of the prosecutor during closing argument violated the principle of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, supra. </em>In <em>Person </em>we held that \u201ca prosecutor may not argue that the jury should draw a negative inference from the fact that the defendant remained silent until he testified,\u201d because such an argument impermissibly burdens a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>at 140. See <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Teixera, </em>396 Mass. 746, 752 (1986). In <em>Person, </em>the prosecutor had argued, \u201c[Ijsn\u2019t it just a little bit odd that after sitting here for six days and listening to all the testimony [the defendant] comes in and gives a completely tailored cover story covering every single aspect . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, supra </em>at 139. Here, the prosecutor said of the defendant, \u201c[A]fter all the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was in, he heard all the witnesses, he sat there. . . . But remember when you think about what he said from that witness stand that he listened to all of the testimony sitting right here before he took that stand. 99</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The remarks at issue must be judged within the context of the entire argument, the facts of the case and the rationale underlying the <em>Person </em>principle. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>400 Mass. 676, 682 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, supra. </em>When so considered, it becomes apparent that this case is distinguishable from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person </em>on a number of grounds and that no new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Since there was no objection to the argument, we review only to determine whether there has been a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. 402, 416 (1978). Although some aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s argument sailed close to the line established in <em>Person, </em>we conclude that the line was not crossed and therefore no error exists to be tested against the miscarriage of justice standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>In <em>Person, </em>the prosecutor baldly stated that, because the defendant had been able to sit in court and listen to all the State\u2019s witnesses, he had fabricated his trial testimony. Yet there was no <em>evidence </em>to support the prosecutor\u2019s assertion. Here, the prosecutor attacked the defendant\u2019s credibility by making specific references to instances where the defendant changed his account of the event to conform with the strong evidence of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">For example, the prosecutor said, \u201cI would suggest to you that his [the defendant\u2019s] testimony has been made up as he goes along.\u201d But this statement was not made in a vacuum. It was tied specifically to the prosecutor\u2019s assertion, based on the evidence, that the defendant had changed his pretrial position regarding whether there had been oral sex in order to conform that position with trial testimony revealing positive acid phosphatase tests from the victim\u2019s mouth. As another specific example of fabrication the prosecutor noted the fact that the defendant\u2019s testimony regarding whether or not there had been tires in the back seat of his vehicle wavered considerably upon cross-examination. Finally, the prosecutor tempered his remarks by saying, \u201cIs what [the defendant] told the police he was doing the night that he was arrested consistent with his trial testimony?\u201d This is in stark contrast to <em>Person, </em>where there was no independent evidentiary support for the prosecutor\u2019s assertion of fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Viewed in their proper context, therefore, the effect of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks here was not such \u201cthat a jury would naturally and necessarily construe them to be directed to the failure of the defendant to testify.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 891 (1980), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Armedo-Sarmiento, </em>545 F.2d 785, 793 (2d Cir. 1976), cert, denied, 430 U.S. 917 (1977). In the circumstances, we agree with the Appeals Court that the remarks were a \u201cpermissible reflection upon elements of the defendant\u2019s [trial] testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherick, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Such a holding is in accord with the rationale underlying the <em>Person </em>decision. In <em>Person, </em>the prosecutor had impermissibly seized upon the defendant\u2019s constitutionally-protected si<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>lence before trial as evidence of guilt. Here, however, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was not his pretrial silence but his pretrial statements contrasted with his trial testimony. The prosecutor was not trampling on the constitutional right to remain silent; he was performing his proper function of alerting the jury to possible flaws in the defendant\u2019s testimony. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, supra </em>at 140-141, with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>399 Mass. 527, 530-531 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Other factors militate in favor of affirming the conviction. Because the defendant failed to object, there was no opportunity for the judge to correct any possible error through curative instructions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cifizzari, </em>397 Mass. 560, 579 (1986). Furthermore, the remarks did not receive any judicial \u201cendorsement\u201d such as a jury may infer when a judge overrules an objection. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 518 n.8 (1987), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, supra </em>at 531, with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 683. Therefore, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument did not so burden the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent as to warrant a reversal of his conviction and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">2. The defendant also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks violated G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 23, and that the judge erred in instructing the jury on consciousness of guilt. We reject these arguments for the reasons stated in the opinion of the Appeals Court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherick, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 338, 342-347 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\n<em>Judgment of the Superior Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
