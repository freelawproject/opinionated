In a prior opinion, we reversed the decision of the board and remanded for further proceedings in light of our opinion in <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Shafner, </em>392 Mass. 256 (1984). <em>Northeast Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>395 Mass. 207 (1985) <em>(Northeast Petroleum I). </em>The board reconsidered the matter and ordered the abatement. The Commissioner appealed, we allowed the parties\u2019 applications for direct appellate review, and we now affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>A more complete statement of the facts relevant to this appeal appears in <em>Northeast Petroleum I, supra </em>at 208-211. Northeast, a Massachusetts corporation, entered into a joint venture with Ingram Corporation to build a petroleum refinery in Louisiana. The taxpayer and Ingram formed a corporation, Energy, each receiving fifty per cent of the shares. Energy organized a wholly-owned subsidiary, ECOL, Ltd. (ECOL), a Louisiana corporation which was to purchase the refinery site and then construct the refinery. In 1976, prior to completion of construction of the refinery, Energy accepted an offer from a corporation unrelated to the taxpayer and Ingram to purchase its only asset, the stock of ECOL. On September 20, 1976, Energy sold all the ECOL stock. Energy was then liquidated, and Northeast realized a capital gain of $44,658,048, on the redemption of its shares in Energy. Energy, by adopting a plan of complete liquidation under \u00a7 337 of the Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.), was not taxed by the United States on the gain realized in its liquidation. Instead the gain was recognized by the liquidating corporation\u2019s shareholders Northeast and Ingram.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Northeast filed a corporate excise return for the year ending June 30, 1977, and reported a loss of $518,478, before apportionment and after deducting the $44,658,048, in net capital gain. After an audit the Commissioner issued to the taxpayer a notice of assessment and, after an application for abatement was denied, the taxpayer paid the entire amount of the assessed tax. Northeast appealed to the board, and the board issued a decision in favor of the Commissioner. We reversed the decision and remanded the case to the board to be reconsidered in light of <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Shafner, supra. </em>On remand the board adopted the reasoning of <em>Shafner, </em>and concluded that the liquidation distribution that Northeast received from Energy was a dividend deductible from Northeast\u2019s net income in arriving at its taxable income. The board ordered an abatement of $3,311,246.55, plus interest, and the Commissioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The Commissioner argues that the board erred in applying the principles of <em>Shafner </em>to the facts of this case and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>gain on the distribution in liquidation of Energy is not a dividend deductible under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(\u00e1) </em>(1) (1986 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The board correctly stated the applicable Massachusetts law to be as follows: \u201cAs a domestic business corporation, Northeast is taxable in Massachusetts, if at all, pursuant to G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a730 through 52. In computing its Massachusetts net income, a business corporation, both foreign and domestic, subtracts the deductions, but not credits, allowable under the Internal Revenue Code from its Massachusetts gross income. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(b). </em>Massachusetts gross income is essentially equal to Federal gross income with certain modifications not here relevant. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) (a). Dividends are specifically included in the Massachusetts net income of a business corporation. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(b) </em>(z).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In order to determine that part of net income which is derived from business carried on within Massachusetts, the dividends included in net income under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30, are, with certain exceptions not here relevant, deducted to arrive at Massachusetts taxable income. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (a) (1). Therefore, if the liquidating distribution which Northeast received by virtue of its ownership of fifty per cent of the stock of Energy was a \u201cdividend,\u201d it would not be includible in Northeast\u2019s Massachusetts taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Citing our opinion in <em>Shafner, </em>the board concluded that the liquidating distribution was a dividend and thus deductible from net income under \u00a7 38. Although a dividend is not defined within G. L. c. 63, the board applied the definition of dividend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>as that term is defined under \u00a7 316 of the I.R.C. (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 316 [1976]), reasoning that the Legislature\u2019s adoption of the I.R.C. \u2019s definition of gross income for purposes of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) (a), implied a similar adoption of the definition for dividends. Furthermore, the board cited \u00a7 38 (a) (1) and its similar treatment of dividends \u201cfrom or on account of the ownership of: (z) shares in a corporate trust\u201d and those \u201cfrom or on account of the ownership of . . . (z'z'z) any class of stock . . . .\u201d Given our conclusion in <em>Shafner </em>that a distribution in liquidation of a corporate trust constituted a dividend for purposes of G. L. c. 62, \u00a7\u00a7 2 (a) (2) (D) and 8 <em>(c), </em>the board saw no reason to conclude otherwise for purposes of \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(1). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">A review of the facts in <em>Shafner </em>and the instant case reveals the almost identical nature of the two transactions. In <em>Shafner </em>the taxpayers were shareholders of a corporate trust. Here, the taxpayer is a shareholder of a corporation. However, there is no intrinsic difference between a corporate business trust and a corporation. Additionally, both entities adopted a plan of complete liquidation under \u00a7 337 of the I.R.C. In both cases the liquidating entities sold the assets and distributed all the proceeds to shareholders who were afforded capital gain treatment under the Federal code. No Federal income tax was paid by either. Both entities paid State taxes, although in this case the State receiving the tax was Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 1 (e) (1986 ed.), a dividend is defined as \u201cany item of federal gross income which is a dividend under [\u00a7 316] of the Code or which is treated as a dividend under any other provision of the Code.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> General Laws c. 63, does not define dividends, although G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (a), adopts the Federal definition of gross income which, as the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>correctly notes, includes dividends. I.R.C. \u00a7 61 <em>(a) (7). </em>Under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(a), </em>dividends are included in net Massachusetts corporate income, although they may be deducted in certain instances to arrive at Massachusetts taxable income. See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Not only are the two transactions practically identical, but nowhere in G. L. c. 63 has the Legislature indicated an intention to treat liquidation proceeds in one case, but not the other, as dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The Commissioner asks us to depart from <em>Shafner </em>and the traditional meaning of the term dividend and to look at the over-all purpose and intent behind c. 63. The dissent concludes that, because the Federal code subdivides gross income into categories (including dividends, I.R.C. \u00a7 61 [a][7], and gains derived from dealing in property, I.R.C. \u00a7 61 [a][3]), the meaning of the term dividend changes. We do not agree. Nowhere does the Legislature demonstrate an intent to change the commonly accepted definition of dividend. There is no dispute that the distribution to Northeast is income under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(a). </em>However, G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) (a), operates to define only <em>income, </em>not dividends; dividends are defined elsewhere in the I.R.C. See I.R.C. \u00a7 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Moreover, the distribution received by Northeast is commonly referred to as a dividend, albeit a \u201cliquidating dividend.\u201d General Laws c. 156B, \u00a7 103, refers to distributions by a corporation terminating its existence as \u201cliquidating dividends.\u201d Several Massachusetts decisions also refer to proceeds from the termination of a corporation or trust as \u201cliquidating dividends.\u201d See, e.g., <em>New England Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Old Colony Trust Co., </em>385 Mass. 24 (1982). <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Fitts, </em>340 Mass. 575 (1960). See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 839 (rev. 5th ed. 1979) (defining proceeds from similar transactions as a \u201cliquidation dividend\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Lastly, this case should be considered in the context of <em>Northeast Petroleum I, </em>where the court said, \u201cAlthough <em>Shafner </em>involved the taxation of a trust under analogous provisions of G. L. c. 62, the board could apply the principles of that case to the distribution by Energy and rule that it was a \u2018dividend\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>exempt from tax under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(1), which provides that only those \u2018dividends\u2019 distributed to a \u2018corporation own[ing] less than fifteen per cent of the voting stock of the corporation paying such dividend\u2019 may be taxed to the corporate shareholder as net income under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30. Such a result would be consistent with the policy against duplicative taxation expressed in <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Shafner, supra, </em>and <em>Dow Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>[378 Mass. 254 (1979)]. See also <em>Rohrbough, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>385 Mass. 830, 831 (1982). On the other hand, the board may decide that the principles of <em>Shafner </em>do not control. In either case, we would review the decision of the board in the light of its expertise and the traditional deference due its decisions.\u201d 395 Mass. at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The board ruled that the Internal Revenue Code definition of dividend applies as that term is used in G. L. c. 63, because the Legislature chose to adopt the I.R.C. definition of gross income, which included dividends for the purpose of defining gross income of a Massachusetts corporation. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(a). </em>Moreover, the board relies on the fact that G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a), </em>uses the term \u201cdividends\u201d to refer to sums received from corporate trusts, as well as business corporations as evidence that the Legislature did not intend to use the term differently in the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Finally, the board relied on the fact that under the I.R.C., which has become the fundamental source of tax law in the Commonwealth, the term dividend has acquired the particular meaning adopted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Following the mandate of this court in <em>Northeast Petroleum I, </em>the board then ruled that \u201cas a matter of law, a dividend for purposes of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(1) is any distribution of property made by a corporation out of its earnings and profits and that, under <em>Shafner, </em>a liquidating distribution is, as a matter of law, out of earnings and profits to the extent that it exceeds the original paid-in capital.\u201d There was no error. There is no distinction between the term \u201cdividend\u201d as applied in <em>Shafner, </em>under G. L. c. 62, and as used here under c. 63. It was, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>course, open to the Legislature to provide a different meaning in G. L. c. 63. It did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\"> General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 38, in relevant part, states: \u201cThe commissioner shall determine the part of the net income of a domestic business corporation or of a foreign corporation derived from business carried on within the commonwealth as follows: (a) Net income as defined in section thirty of this chapter adjusted as follows shall constitute taxable net income: (1) Dividends included therein shall be deducted other than dividends from or on account of the ownership of: (i) shares in a corporate trust, as defined in section one of chapter sixty-two, engaged in business in the commonwealth, or (ii) deemed distributions and actual distributions, except actual distributions out of previously taxed income, from a DISC which is not a wholly owned DISC, or (iii) any class of stock, if the corporation owns less than fifteen per cent of the voting stock of the corporation paying such dividend.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-6\"> Section 316 of the I.R.C. defines dividend as \u201cany distribution of property made by a corporation to its shareholders \u2014 (1) out of its earnings and profits accumulated after February 28, 1913, or (2) out of its earnings and profits of the taxable year (computed as of the close of the taxable year without diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year), without regard to the amount of the earnings and profits at the time the distribution was made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b66-7\">Hennessey, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"APS\">(dissenting, joined by O\u2019Connor, L). I dissent. The court has concluded that the Appellate Tax Board (board) has appropriately followed the decision in <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Shafner, </em>392 Mass. 256 (1984), in its treatment of a liquidation distribution as a dividend. Although both this case and <em>Shafner </em>involve liquidation distributions, the cases are distinguishable in a meaningful way, thus justifying a differing result. First, and most importantly, different taxpayers and business entities are involved \u25a0\u2014 individual shareholders and a liquidating corporate trust in <em>Shafner </em>and a corporate shareholder and a liquidating corporation here \u2014 requiring the application of different chapters of the General Laws in each instance. Second, the statutory provisions at issue differ. Chapter 62, which was considered in <em>Shafner, </em>specifically included a definition of the term dividend; c. 63 includes no such definition. Third, the liquidating corporate trust in <em>Shafner </em>was taxed by the State. Consequently, taxation of the individual shareholder receiving the liquidating distribution would result in double taxation. Under c. 63, a liquidating corporation is not taxed by the State, and, thus, if the shareholder receiving the corporate liquidation is not taxed, the transaction occurs tax free. Because this does not occur for Federal tax purposes, it is unlikely that the Legislature intended that it occur for State tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The board adopted the definition of dividend as provided in I.R.C. \u00a7 316 (and as referenced by G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 1 [e]) for three reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">(1) \u201cSince the Internal Revenue Code provides the source for the definition of Massachusetts gross income, it seems appropriate to use the same source for defining the various components of gross income . . . .\u201d This point does not support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the board\u2019s determination, however, because gains on liquidation distributions are not included in gross income as a dividend but as dealings in property. Thus, if the Internal Revenue Code is to be looked to for guidance, it should be for the manner in which similar transactions are <em>treated </em>and not for the bald definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">(2) \u201c[I]n G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (a), \u2018dividends\u2019 is used in the same sentence to refer to dividends received on shares in a corporate trust and to those received on any class of stock owned by a corporation, further undercutting the argument that a \u2018dividend\u2019 for corporate excise purposes is something different than a personal income tax \u2018dividend\u2019.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This point also fails to support the board\u2019s conclusion. Northeast contends that, because G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(1) <em>(Hi), </em>does not apply in this instance, the liquidation distribution will be deductible if it is determined to be a dividend. Because <em>Shafner </em>has already determined that a liquidation distribution from a corporate trust is a dividend, it will not be deductible under \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(1) <em>(i). </em>Given our decision in <em>Shafner </em>and our desire to avoid double taxation, the liquidating distribution from a corporate trust is a distribution that should be deductible. The contrary result required by the statute indicates that the principles in <em>Shafner </em>should not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">(3) Finally, the board determined that the term \u201c \u2018[dividend\u2019 ha[d] acquired a peculiar meaning in law by virtue of its definition in the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d While I agree with this statement, and thus we cannot decide this case on the basis of the common understanding of the word dividend, we must look to the treatment of a liquidation distribution and not to the definition of the term dividend under the Internal Revenue Code. When we examine the treatment of this transaction for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Federal tax purposes, no dividend is involved. Thus, it distorts the analysis to look to the Internal Revenue Code in this instance but return with a result that is inconsistent with the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The court expresses the thought that we remanded this case to the board in order that it should consider the effect of <em>Shafner, </em>and now, after the board accepted the analysis of <em>Shafner, </em>the court should affirm the board\u2019s decision. However, the earlier opinion provided no instructions to the board to apply the principles of <em>Shafner. </em>Thus, a reversal of the board\u2019s decision is not inconsistent with that opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, the board found \u201ctroublesome distinction[s]\u201d between <em>Shafner </em>and the instant case and the result produced by the application of <em>Shafner </em>\u201cunpalatable.\u201d Nevertheless, the board found its decision compelled \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d This is a case of statutory construction, and even if we conclude that the views of the board are relevant, we should not be influenced by the reluctant conclusions (as judged by the tone of the decision) reached by the board. I submit that the statutes, properly construed, mandate that the board\u2019s decision be reversed and the liquidation distribution be taxed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-6\"> General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a), </em>states in relevant part: \u201c(1) Dividends included [in Net Income] shall be deducted other than dividends from or on account of the ownership of: (z) shares in a corporate trust, as defined in section one of chapter sixty-two, engaged in business in the commonwealth, or . . .

On the other hand, the board may decide that the principles of <em>Shafner </em>do not control.\u201d <em>Northeast Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>395 Mass. 207, 213-214 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
