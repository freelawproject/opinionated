Glorioso, under the Veterans\u2019 Retirement Act, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 56-60A (1986 ed.). The plaintiff claims eligibility to participate in a noncontributory retirement system under \u00a7 58. This would entitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>him to recover his contributions to the Wellesley retirement system made during his employment as a firefighter from October 1, 1949, until his retirement on November 7, 1979. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 25 (3) (1986 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The retirement board of Wellesley (board), on October 19, 1979, denied Glorioso\u2019s application for retirement under \u00a7 58 and for a refund pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 25 (3). Glorioso then brought an action for declaratory judgment in the Superior Court in Norfolk County. After that action was dismissed, without prejudice, for failure of the plaintiff to exhaust his administrative remedies, the board reconvened on February 11, 1981, and affirmed its previous decision. Glorioso pursued a timely appeal to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB). On April 29, 1983, CRAB affirmed the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">On June 24, 1983, Glorioso filed this action in the Superior Court in Norfolk County seeking a judgment declaring his rights under c. 32, \u00a7 58, and, alternatively, seeking judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1986 ed.). The judge concluded that CRAB lacked jurisdiction over cases brought pursuant to c. 32, \u00a7 58, and set aside GRAB\u2019S mling. After a full evidentiary hearing, the judge found that Glorioso had been in the town\u2019s employ prior to June 30, 1939.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number><em>Cardellicchio </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement of Natick, </em>391 Mass. 760 (1984), he entered judgment for Glorioso. The board filed a timely appeal, claiming that the judge erred in ruling that CRAB had no jurisdiction. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm the Superior Court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">1. <em>CRAB\u2019s jurisdiction. </em>Our examination of the veterans\u2019 retirement provisions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> contained in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 56-60, affirms the conclusion of the judge that CRAB has no jurisdiction to entertain claims arising under c. 32, \u00a7 58. Sections 56 and 57, to which the board refers, both cover retirement due to incapacity. Under c. 32, \u00a7 57A,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a right of appeal to CRAB is granted to those claiming retirement under either of these provisions. Significantly, as to \u00a7 58, which grants certain retirement benefits to those veterans retiring after thirty years\u2019 service, there is no similar provision providing a right of appeal to CRAB. \u201c[A] statutory expression of one thing is an implied exclusion of other things omitted from the statute. \u201d <em>Harborview Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Quincy Hous. Auth., </em>368 Mass. 425, 432 (1975). <em>County of Middlesex </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 542 (1982). We concluded that the Legislature did not intend that CRAB have jurisdiction over \u00a7 58 cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Our conclusion comports with previous treatment of \u00a7 58 claims. In <em>Bianchi </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Somerville, </em>359 Mass. 642, 647 (1971), we concluded that the veterans\u2019 retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>provisions stood apart from the rest of the chapter, and that, \u201c[generally speaking, sections of c. 32 other than \u00a7\u00a7 56-60 apply to the retirement of veterans only if they are expressly made applicable thereto by such other sections or by \u00a7\u00a7 56-60.\u201d This court has recognized, as well, that the Legislature intended to afford different rights to \u00a7 58 beneficiaries than to other claimants. See <em>Hoban </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>355 Mass. 681, 683-684 (1969) (the language of \u00a7 58, unlike that of \u00a7 57, vests only a ministerial, nondiscretionaiy function in the board).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Finally, we recognize that many \u00a7 58 claims have been brought in the Superior Court seeking a declaration of rights. See, e.g., <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>359 Mass. 228 (1971); <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Lowell Hous. Auth., </em>356 Mass. 18(1969); <em>Hoban </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra; LaCouture </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Quincy, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 738 (1981); <em>Santucci </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Palmer, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 785 (1976). Claims under \u00a7 58 have also been brought properly as contract actions. See, e.g., <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>342 Mass. 67, 68 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">We note that CRAB itself has decided that it does not possess jurisdiction over \u00a7 58 claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While CRAB\u2019s determination is not dispositive, see <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>397 Mass. 255, 256-258 (1986), in this instance we agree with CRAB\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">2. <em>Qualification under \u00a7 58. </em>We turn now to the merits of Glorioso\u2019s claim under \u00a7 58. The parties agree that Glorioso meets all but one of the requirements for retirement under that provision. He is a veteran within the meaning of the statute; he served the Commonwealth, or a subdivision thereof, for a total period of thirty years in the aggregate; and he was in active service at the time of retirement. <em>Cardellicchio, supra </em>at 763. <em>LaCouture, supra </em>at 741. The sole issue is whether he was employed by the town prior to June 30, 1939, as c. 32, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>\u00a7 60, requires. The board concedes that, if CRAB had no jurisdiction over this claim, the judge\u2019s findings are supported \u25a0by the evidence before him. The board further concedes that, pursuant to <em>Cardellicchio, supra </em>at 764, if Glorioso performed any work for the town prior to June 30, 1939, and was compensated for such labor, Glorioso is entitled to the benefits of \u00a7 58. See <em>LaCouture, supra </em>at 738, 744 (payment for seven months\u2019 part-time service to otherwise qualified veteran satisfied statute); <em>Santucci </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Palmer, supra </em>(payment to otherwise qualified veteran for approximately 255 hours of previous service).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The judge found that the town of Wellesley employed Glorioso on at least two occasions prior to June 30, 1939. In addition, the judge found that 1939 town records showed payment of $1.88 to the same \u201cJohn Glorioso,\u201d and payment to persons unknown for snow removal. The judge further found that Glorioso had done clean-up work after a 1938 hurricane.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, the judge was correct in concluding that <em>Cardellicchio, supra, </em>is controlling, and that this work constituted employment under the statute. The judgment for the plaintiff is to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">3. <em>Damages for delay. </em>Glorioso seeks double costs and appellate attorneys\u2019 fees, pursuant to Mass. R. A. P. 25, as amended, 378 Mass. 925 (1979), and G. L. c. 211 A, \u00a7 15 (1986 ed.). Damages for delay are authorized against parties pursuing frivolous appellate claims. Such an award is within the sound discretion of the appellate court. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 987, 989 (1986); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 453, 458-460 (1984). As noted above, much of the board\u2019s arguments are without merit. It is also true, however, that CRAB had a mixed history of entertaining \u00a7 58 claims, and that the matter of its jurisdiction had not been determined definitively. Additionally, when the first complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>was brought, another judge in the Superior Court apparently agreed with the board as to CRAB\u2019s jurisdiction and dismissed that complaint for failure of the plaintiff to exhaust his administrative remedies. In these circumstances, we conclude that it would be inappropriate to deem the board\u2019s position frivolous. We decline to award additional damages and costs in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-6\"> The text of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 25 (3), reads, in pertinent part: \u201cRights of Veterans at Retirement. \u2014 <em>(a) </em>Any member in service classified as a veteran referred to in sections fifty-six to sixty A inclusive, who entered employ of any governmental unit prior to July first, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, shall have full and complete rights either under the system of which he is a member or under the provisions of sections fifty-six to sixty A inclusive, whether or not he may have signed a waiver of his rights under such sections upon becoming a member of such system, anything to the contrary in the provisions of this chapter or in similar provisions of earlier laws notwithstanding. Such rights shall be in the alternative and shall be exercised only at the time of his retirement. If a member is retired under the provisions of sections fifty-six to sixty A inclusive, he shall, upon his written application on a prescribed form filed with the board in which he waives all his rights under sections one to twenty-eight inclusive, be paid the amount of the accumulated total deductions credited to his account in the annuity savings fund of the system on the date of his retirement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\"> The parties stipulated that Glorioso met all of the criteria for retirement under c. 32, \u00a7 52, except for employment by the town prior to June 30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>1939. The requisite criteria are discussed in this opinion, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The board concedes in its brief that, if CRAB had no jurisdiction and if the judge properly held an evidentiary hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the judge\u2019s findings as to the plaintiff\u2019s employment are supported by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\"> The Veterans\u2019 Retirement Act applies, by its terms, only to veterans of the Spanish Civil War and of the World Wars. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 56-58. Further, it is limited to those veterans whose employment began on or prior to June 30, 1939. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 60.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b666-9\"> Specifically, reference is made in \u00a7 57A to the right of appeal to CRAB provided in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (4) (1986 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b666-10\"> The board argues that, if this court concludes that CRAB had no jurisdiction, the effect of this holding should apply prospectively only. The board\u2019s contention is unsupported by any authority and is unpersuasive. This is a jurisdictional matter and applies to the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\"> In <em>Bianchi </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Somerville, supra </em>at 646, we noted that CRAB \u201cvoted that it had no jurisdiction of the matter [\u00a7 58 cases].\u201d Although it has considered such claims since then, two months after its decision in the case at bar, CRAB ruled that neither c. 32, \u00a7 57A, nor \u00a7 16 (4), provided for jurisdiction of \u00a7 58 claims. Evangelous v. Marlborough Retirement Bd., Contributory Retirement Appeal Decision CR-6729 (June 27, 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\"> The judge found that the Federal government had paid for Glorioso\u2019s clean-up efforts under a work program. Apparently, a Federal employee supervised the work initially, but the clean-up effort soon came under the town\u2019s auspices. Therefore, the judge found that this work constituted \u201cemployment\u201d under c. 32, \u00a7 60. See <em>LaCouture, supra </em>at 743-744.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
