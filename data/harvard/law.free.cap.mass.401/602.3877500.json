A jury found the defendant guilty of violating G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A (1986 ed.), which, among other things, makes a crime of knowingly permitting a child under eighteen years of age \u201cto pose or be exhibited in a state of nudity ... for purpose of visual representation or reproduction in any book, magazine, pamphlet, motion picture film, photograph, or picture<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The only evidence that arguably warranted a guilty finding showed that the defendant permitted his fifteen year old stepdaughter to pose with her breasts exposed for photographs he took of her in their home. His stepdaughter was \u201cin a state of nudity\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31 (1986 ed.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant argues, relying solely on the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, that his conduct was protected speech. He finds support for his position in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 764-766 (1982). We need not decide whether the Supreme Court would sustain a statute that was carefully directed against the defendant\u2019s conduct because we conclude that, in any event, \u00a7 29A is unconstitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">We start with a proposition that we would have thought not seriously debatable. Photography is a form of expression which is entitled to First Amendment protection just as the written or spoken word is protected. Photography as a means of communication and expression can be strikingly informative, as in the works of Mathew Brady and Margaret Bourke-White. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>can be inspirationally expressive, as Ansel Adams demonstrated. Although not every picture may be worth a thousand words, in a First Amendment sense a picture is worth at least one.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The defendant\u2019s conduct in permitting his stepdaughter to pose naked above the waist cannot fairly be isolated, therefore, for First Amendment purposes, from the expressive process of taking her picture. The circumstances involved at all times both conduct and speech in the First Amendment sense. First Amendment analysis does not sever conduct from speech. To do so would undercut the foundation of First Amendment protections. \u201cA constitutional distinction between speech and conduct is specious. Speech <em>is </em>conduct, and actions speak\u201d (emphasis in original). Henkin, The Supreme Court, 1967 Term \u2014 Foreword: On Drawing Lines, 82 Harv. L. Rev. 63, 79 (1968). See <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>State, </em>396 So. 2d 152, 158 (Fla. 1981) (Sundberg, C.J., dissenting in part); L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 12-7, at 827 (2d ed. 1988); Ely, Flag Desecration: A Case Study in the Roles of Categorization and Balancing in First Amendment Analysis, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 1482, 1494-1496 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In cases involving both \u201cspeech\u201d and \u201cnonspeech\u201d elements, \u201ca sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify incidental limitation on First Amendment freedoms.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 376 (1968) (conviction of draft card burner upheld). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Albertini, </em>472 U.S. 675, 687-689 (1985). There is at least a substantial question whether an important governmental interest would warrant overriding First Amendment freedoms in this case. In their own home, the defendant took nonpomographic, nonobscene photographs of his fifteen year old, consenting stepdaughter who was nude above the waist, in circumstances where no commercial or even noncommercial distribution was intended or occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Even if we assume that an important governmental interest would justify punishment for the defendant\u2019s behavior in this case, the defendant is correct in arguing that \u00a7 29A is overbroad in its reach and that the overbreadth is substantial enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>warrant striking down \u00a7 29A. See <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 615 (1973) (\u201cwhere conduct and not merely speech is involved, we believe that the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep\u201d). Cf. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 773-774 (1982) (overbreadthinsubstantial). The overbreadth of \u00a7 29A is substantial. It criminalizes conduct that virtually every person would regard as lawful. Section 29A, for example, makes a criminal of a parent who takes a frontal view picture of his or her naked one-year-old running on a beach or romping in a wading pool.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Surely the First Amendment protects that kind of activity, even if what the defendant did in this case could properly be criminalized (a matter we need not decide).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The judgment is reversed and the verdict set aside.

The court\u2019s analysis \u201cstart[s] with a proposition that [the court] would have thought not seriously debatable,\u201d namely, that photography is a form of constitutionally protected expression. I intend to address that proposition, but first I feel compelled to focus on a different proposition, a proposition that I would have thought not seriously debatable. That proposition, apparently questioned by the court, is that the State\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting children from exploitation extends to the type of exploitation that statutes such as G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A, are designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In order that the State\u2019s interest may be better appreciated, the court\u2019s summary statement of the facts of this case needs fleshing out. The photographs, for which the defendant solicited, caused, encouraged, or permitted the minor victim to pose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>are sexually provocative photographs of the type frequently found in magazines displayed by storekeepers in sealed cellophane wrappers. It is immaterial that they are not \u201cobscene\u201d within the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of that word. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 756 (1982). It is also immaterial whether they are characterized as pornographic or nonpomographic. Nothing turns on labels. It is only important that these sexually provocative, close-up, color photographs portray a physically mature minor female in various positions atop a bar, clad only in a red scarf around her neck and bikini type white panties, and with her breasts exposed \u2014 if not highlighted.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">It matters not that the child \u201cconsented.\u201d I would have thought that proposition not seriously debatable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor does it matter that no commercial or even noncommercial distribution was intended, or that the defendant\u2019s motive in causing or \u201cpermitting\u201d the child to pose for him bare-breasted may have been gratification unrelated to money. In any event, the defendant\u2019s conduct, criminalized by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A, constituted the abuse, exploitation, and degradation of a child. \u201cThe prevention.of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance. . . . The legislative judgment, as well as the judgment found in the relevant literature, is that the use of children as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the psychological, emotional, and mental health of the child.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra </em>at 757-758 &amp; n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The only real question in this case is whether soliciting, causing, encouraging, or permitting a child to pose nude (within the definition of nudity in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31) is a form of speech calling for First Amendment analysis. More specifically, the question is whether the possible overbreadth of the statute is a relevant consideration in the decision of this case. The question of overbreadth is irrelevant if soliciting, causing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>encouraging, or permitting a child to pose for photographs is not \u201cspeech\u201d within the context of the First Amendment. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra </em>at 767-768. <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 610-612 (1973). Of course, the resolution of the question whether the prohibited conduct is also speech cannot properly be influenced by one\u2019s enthusiasm or lack of enthusiasm about the public interest involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Indeed, pictures, when displayed or disseminated, talk. It does not follow, however, that soliciting, causing, encouraging, or permitting someone to pose for a photograph is itself speech or is so inextricably bound up with the display or dissemination of a photograph that, for constitutional purposes, it must be treated as speech. As the court emphasizes, \u201cno commercial or even noncommercial distribution was intended or occurred\u201d in this case. The photographs were not designed to communicate, and the statute, focusing entirely on the adverse effect on the child of posing for nude photographs, irrespective of whether the photographs are ever shown to anybody, is entirely neutral with respect to communication.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The conduct proscribed by \u00a7 29A, then, is only conduct, and not speech, and the overbreadth analysis engaged in by the court is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">There appears to be no State or Federal decision directly or analogously supporting the court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s conduct is also speech for constitutional purposes. Instead, the court relies on a dissenting opinion of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Florida, on two law review articles, and on a treatise. The reliance on the law review articles and the treatise is misplaced. Professor Henkin, in his article, discusses <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367 (1968), a case in which the defendant burned his draft card to urge others to do the same thing. Henkin criticized the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Court\u2019s pronouncement that \u201csome kinds of conduct <em>used to express an idea </em>... are \u2018speech\u2019 protected by the first amendment, while others are not\u201d (emphasis added). Henkin, The Supreme Court, 1967 Term \u2014 Foreword: On Drawing Lines, 82 Harv. L. Rev. 63, 77 (1968). Henkin expressed his view that <em>all </em>kinds of conduct used to express an idea are speech. He directed his attention to picketing as well as draft card burning, observing that \u201c [i]n picketing ... it is not solely or primarily the words that communicate; the presence of the pickets is itself a communication, and indeed picketing is often effective regardless of what the placards say, because even persons who never read the placards are reluctant to cross a picket line. And what would the Court make of silent pickets who carry no signs but whose presence effectively communicates a message?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">It was in the context of discussing conduct that directly, immediately, and standing alone conveys a message, and is intended to do so, that Henkin wrote the sentences that the court quotes, <em>ante </em>at 604: \u201cA constitutional distinction between speech and conduct is specious. Speech <em>is </em>conduct, and actions speak\u201d (emphasis in original). In context, it is clear that Hen-kin\u2019s point was that there is no valid constitutional distinction between the articulation of words and other conduct <em>used to express an idea. </em>As Henkin wrote, \u201c [T]he meaningful constitutional distinction is not between speech and conduct, but between conduct that speaks, communicates, and other kinds of conduct. If it is intended as expression, if in fact it communicates, especially if it becomes a common comprehensible form of expression, it is \u2018speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79-80. Burning a draft card to express displeasure with government conduct or policy and picketing constitute conduct that speaks. However, soliciting, causing, encouraging, or permitting a child to pose nude is not intended as expression; it does not communicate; it is not \u201ca common comprehensible form of expression.\u201d Nothing in Henkin\u2019s article even remotely suggests that all conduct should be viewed as speech or that the type of conduct involved in this case is speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Similarly, the other law review article cited by the court, Ely, Flag Desecration: A Case Study in the Roles of Categorization and Balancing in First Amendment Analysis, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 1482, 1494-1496 (1975), provides no support for the court\u2019s position. As is apparent from the title of the article, the author\u2019s focus was on desecration of the American flag as a symbolic means of political protest. The article is about conduct used to express an idea. At least by implication, Professor Ely \u2019 s article states the proposition that the type of conduct involved in this case, which by itself expresses no idea, should be considered pure conduct for purposes of constitutional analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Professor Tribe\u2019s treatise, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 12-7, at 825-832 (2d ed. 1988), should give the court no more comfort than do the law review articles. He, too, focuses on cases involving picketing and civil rights demonstrations and other forms of \u201cnonverbal symbolic expression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 826. He observes that \u201c [expression and conduct, message and medium, are thus inextricably tied together in all <em>communicative </em>behavior; <em>expressive </em>behavior is \u2018100% action and 100% expression\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 827. Nothing in Tribe\u2019s treatise suggests that the defendant\u2019s conduct was communicative or expressive so as to permit an overbreadth argument, and treating it as such results in an unprecedented and inappropriate expansion of the overbreadth doctrine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Although there are no decisions supporting the court\u2019s view, there are decisions supporting my view. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Helgoth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>691 S.W.2d 281 (en banc) (Mo. 1985), the defendant took posed photographs of a girl under seventeen, focused on her uncovered breasts and vagina. The pertinent statute made it unlawful to photograph a child under seventeen engaging in nudity, \u201cif such nudity is to be depicted for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification of any individual who may view such depiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283. The court concluded that \u201cthe activity engaged in by the defendant and prohibited by the statute is distinctly conduct, as contrasted with speech. The offensive act is grounded in child abuse, and that is the epicenter of the case. The specific distinction to be made is between the use of children in the actual production of pornographic material and the ultimate dissemination of materials so produced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>State, </em>396 So. 2d 152, 155-156 (Fla. 1981), the defendant was charged with producing or directing production of obscene photographs involving a minor and with procuring a minor for obscene photographs, in violation of statute. The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss attacking the constitutionality of the statute was denied, and the defendant appealed. The court affirmed (with Sundberg, C.J., dissenting), reasoning that \u201cthe statute in question does not proscribe constitutionally protected speech or activities, but prohibits specific conduct relating to minors. \u2018[SJtates have greater power to regulate nonverbal, physical conduct than to suppress depictions or descriptions of the same behavior. \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155, quoting <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 26 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 29A, regulates conduct that is not speech. Soliciting, causing, encouraging, or permitting a minor to pose for photographs is no more speech than is setting a house afire in order to photograph a burning house. Therefore, even if it were necessary to construe \u00a7 29A as making \u201ca criminal of a parent who takes a frontal view picture of his or her naked one-year-old running on a beach or romping in a wading pool,\u201d a doubtful proposition asserted by the court, the overbreadth of the statute is irrelevant. As applied to the defendant, the statute bears a reasonable relation to a permis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>sible legislative objective, and it is constitutional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I would affirm the conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\"> The trial judge, at the time of sentencing, put it this way: \u201cTo suggest that a 15 year old girl can logically and intellectually submit herself for that kind of photography by her stepfather, is to me \u2014 is to me an insult to anybody\u2019s intelligence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-6\"> It would make no difference if the defendant had taken the photographs for the purpose of disseminating them. A distinction must be made between the dissemination of a photograph, which ordinarily is speech, and the preliminary conduct involved in setting up the photograph. Causing someone to pose is no more speech than other required preliminaries such as manufacturing the film or the camera.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\"> \u201cThe traditional rule is that a person to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied may not challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others in situations not before the Court. . . . What has come to be known as the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine is one of the few exceptions to this principle and must be justified by \u2018weighty countervailing policies.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Raines, </em>[362 U.S. 17, 22-23 (I960)]. The doctrine is predicated on the sensitive nature of protected expression: \u2018persons whose expression is constitutionally protected may well refrain from exercising their rights for fear of criminal sanctions by a statute susceptible of application to protected expression. \u2019 <em>Schaumburg </em>v. <em>Citizens for a Better Environment, </em>444 U.S. 620, 634 (1980); <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>[405 U.S. 518, 521 (1972)].\u201d (Citations omitted). <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra </em>at 767-769.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-5\"> General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 29A (1986 ed.), provides that \u201c[w]hoever . . . hires, coerces, solicits or entices, employs, procures, uses, causes, encourages, or knowingly permits [a] child to pose or be exhibited in a state of nudity <em>or to participate or engage in any act that depicts, describes or represents sexual conduct </em>for purpose of visual representation or reproduction in any book, magazine, pamphlet, motion picture film, photograph, or picture shall be punished ...\u201d (emphasis added). Even if overbreadth were an appropriate consideration and the statute were overbroad, the over-breadth relates only to that portion of the statute focusing on the causing or permitting of a child to pose in a state of nudity. The emphasized portion of the statute is certainly not overbroad, and the statute is clearly severable. Thus, in no event should the whole statute be ruled unconstitutional. The court\u2019s opinion fails to address this issue</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
