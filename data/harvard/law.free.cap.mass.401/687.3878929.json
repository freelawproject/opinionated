L. c. 277, \u00a7 73,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>because the charges against him were dismissed pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 36, 378 Mass. 909 (1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge determined that the defendant was not entitled to such compensation. The defendant appealed. We transferred the case on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">We summarize the facts. In September, 1981, a Suffolk County grand jury returned indictments against the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 8, 1981, the defendant was defaulted. On May 27, 1982, the defendant filed a motion for a speedy trial, and on June 1, 1982, he was arraigned. At the arraignment, a pretrial conference report was ordered to be filed for June 21, 1982. The report was filed on June 25, 1982, and, for the next eleven months, the case was continued either at the defendant\u2019s request or by agreement between the defendant and the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">On May 17, 1983, both parties answered ready for trial, and the case was sent to a trial session. No trial was held, and on June 29, 1983, the case was returned to the First Criminal Session for reassignment. The defendant lodged no objection to this delay, and neither the defendant nor the Commonwealth took any further action to secure a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Nearly a year later, on May 4, 1984, the case appeared on the Superior Court First Criminal Session list for \u201cstatus,\u201d and was continued again for trial, this time over the defendant\u2019s objection. On May 29,1984, the defendant moved for dismissal of the indictments under Mass. R. Crim. P. 36 (b) (1) for failure to be brought to trial within twelve months after his \u201creturn day\u201d in court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On June 22, 1984, after hearing, a Superior Court judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictments. The judge ruled that the period from June 1, 1982, to June 21, 1982, \u201ctacked on to the period from May 17, 1983 to May 4, 1984 exceeded] the twelve-month period requirement for trial under Mass. R. Crim. P. 36 (b) (1) (C).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge described as \u201cnot without merit\u201d the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the defendant\u2019s failure to object or move for trial from June, 1983, to May, 1984, constituted consent to delay during this period. He granted the defendant\u2019s motion, however, \u201cbecause of the belated May 4, 1984 placing of the cases on the assignment list for \u2018status\u2019 rather than for trial and further because the District Attorney\u2019s office [had] notice of the June 29, 1983 return of the cases to the First Criminal Session.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In his memorandum and order, the judge also referred to \u201cnear chaotic conditions\u201d in the processing of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In March, 1986, the defendant moved for compensation pursuant to G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 73. After hearing, the Superior Court judge denied the application. The judge, who was not the same judge who granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>denied compensation under the statute because the defendant impliedly consented to delay of his trial by failing to object to the delay or to press for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the doctrine of implied consent does not apply to \u00a7 73. In the alternative, he argues that the doctrine of issue preclusion bars the Commonwealth from relitigating the consent issue on an application for compensation under \u00a7 73. We reject both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">1. <em>Implied consent. </em>General Laws c. 277, \u00a7 73, expressly provides that a defendant who consents to delay is not entitled to compensation. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>A defendant\u2019s failure to object to delay and failure to press for trial constitutes implied consent to delay and bars recovery under \u00a7 73. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graziano, </em>385 Mass. 1011 (1982). <em>Commonwealths. Davis, </em>367 Mass. 422, 423-424 (1975). It is undisputed that the defendant raised no objections and filed no motion for trial between June, 1983, and May, 1984. The defendant filed his only motion for speedy trial in May, 1982. He then agreed to a year of continuances, followed by a year of inaction on his part. The judge determined: \u201c[The defendant] knew full well that the clock was ticking toward midnight under Rule 36, and tactically decided to permit the Commonwealth to slumber. It was open to the defendant to rudely awake [n] the Commonwealth by filing a motion for speedy trial ... or to otherwise demand his day in court. Defendant\u2019s tactics resulted in victory when his motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 36 was allowed. This victory however does not require compensation pursuant to G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 73 because he impliedly consented to the delay\u201d (citations omitted). We agree. The judge properly ruled that recovery under \u00a7 73 was barred because of the defendant\u2019s implied consent to the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Relying on <em>Barry v. Commonwealth, </em>390 Mass. 285 (1983), the defendant asserts that rule 36 abrogates the doctrine of implied consent. This contention is totally unfounded. <em>In Barry, </em>we said, \u201capplication of \u2018traditional indicia of waiver of rights\u2019 is appropriate\u201d under rule 36, and \u201c[w]hen a defendant has agreed to a continuance or has not entered an objection to delay, he will be held to have acquiesced in the delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>296, 298. We added: \u201cIf the rule is read to relieve defendants of the obligation to press their case through the criminal justice system, the public interest often will be thwarted by those defense counsel who decide that delay is the best defense tactic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296-297. The doctrine of implied consent applies under both Mass. R. Crim. P. 36 and G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">2. <em>Issue preclusion. </em>We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the doctrine of issue preclusion requires reversal in this case. To benefit from issue preclusion, the defendant must establish that the issue of fact the Commonwealth seeks to relitigate actually was litigated and determined in the defendant\u2019s favor in the prior proceeding, and that the determination of that issue was essential to the earlier decision. See, e.g., <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>384 Mass. 687, 694-696 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>383 Mass. 497, 499 (1981); <em>Rudow </em>v. <em>Fogel, </em>376 Mass. 587, 591-592 (1978); <em>McSorley </em>v. <em>Hancock, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 567-568 (1981); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1982). See also <em>Home Owners Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Northwestern Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>354 Mass. 448, 455 (1968) (issues \u201ctreated as essential\u201d may be given preclusive effect). As the party invoking the doctrine, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the principles of issue preclusion apply to his case. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Evans, supra </em>at 695. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra </em>at 499. The defendant has failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Even if we read the record as establishing that the defendant <em>necessarily </em>prevailed on the issue of lack of consent to delay under rule 36,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Commonwealth cannot be barred fromreliti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>gating this issue in a later proceeding under \u00a7 73 because of the difference in the allocation of the burden of proof. Under rule 36, the Commonwealth bears the burden of justifying delays beyond the period prescribed for trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farris, </em>390 Mass. 300, 304-305 (1983). <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 291-292. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Look, </em>379 Mass. 893, 898-899 n.2, cert, denied, 449 U.S. 827 (1980). See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 36, <em>supra </em>at 526. In contrast, under G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 73, a defendant seeking compensation must establish all the statutory elements necessary for relief, including lack of consent. Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>367 Mass. 422, 423 (1975). \u201cFailure of one party to carry the burden of persuasion on an issue [does] not establish the issue in favor of an adversary who otherwise would have the burden of persuasion on that issue in later litigation.\u201d 18 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4422, at 212 (1981). See, e.g., <em>Steelmet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Caribe Towing Corp., </em>747 F.2d 689, 692-694 (11th Cir. 1984); <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>370 F.2d 713, 716-717 (1st Cir. 1966); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 28 (4) &amp; comment f.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-16\"> The statute provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person in the commonwealth kept in confinement awaiting trial for more than six months after having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>indicted, and finally acquitted or discharged without trial, <em>if the delay in trial was not at his request or with his consent, or at the request or with the consent of his attorney of record, </em>may receive compensation for the period of his confinement after the lapse of said six months and until his acquittal or discharge...\u201d (emphasis added).

At the time of the indictments, the defendant already was incarcerated at the Deer Island house of correction for conviction in another case. He was held at Deer Island until the completion of his sentence in March, 1983. From that time, until his discharge in June, 1984, he was held at the Charles Street jail on the present indictments in lieu of bail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\"> The \u201creturn day\u201d is \u201cthe day upon which a defendant is ordered by summons to first appear or, if under arrest, does first appear before a court to answer to the charges against him, whichever is earlier.\u201d Mass. R. Crim. P. 2 (b) (15), 378 Mass. 844 (1979). In this case, the return day was June 1, 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\"> The judge excluded from his calculation the period from June, 1982, to May, 1983, because the case was continued during that time either at the request of the defendant or by agreement between the defendant and the Commonwealth. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 36 (b) (2), Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure at 527 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> The Commonwealth did not appeal from the dismissal. Thus, the correctness of the dismissal is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> We note that the record does not establish clearly that the dismissal under rule 36 was based on a finding of lack of consent to delay. In his memorandum and order of dismissal, the judge criticized the Commonwealth for placing the case on the assignment list for \u201cstatus\u201d rather than for trial in May, 1984. In addition, he commented on the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cnear chaotic\u201d handling of the prosecution. The judge also noted that the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the defendant\u2019s inaction from June, 1983, to May, 1984, constituted consent was \u201cnot without merit.\u201d Because it is unclear whether the judge based his decision to dismiss on the defendant\u2019s lack of consent to delay, or instead on the Commonwealth\u2019s lax handling of the prosecution, see Mass. R. Crim. P. 36 (c), 378 Mass. 909 (1979), preclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>as to the issue of consent is inappropriate in this litigation.
