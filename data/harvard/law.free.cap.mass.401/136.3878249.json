L. c. 265, \u00a7 1 (1986 ed.), and of breaking and entering a dwelling house in the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony and committing an assault on a person lawfully therein, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 14 (1986 ed.). On appeal, the defendant contends that the judge erred in admitting testimony of witnesses to the victim\u2019s hearsay statements accusing the defendant of having committed prior crimes and. of violently attacking the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">We summarize the facts as they may have appeared to the jury. In 1984, the defendant and his girlfriend, the victim, moved from Brooklyn, New York, to the Dorchester area of Boston. In early February, 1985, the victim\u2019s cousin Joyce, and Joyce\u2019s four year old son came to visit the victim. During the next week, the defendant and the victim were \u201cconstantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>arguing.\u201d On February 13, 1985, the victim went with Joyce and Joyce\u2019s son to the Malden apartment of Cynthia, a friend of the victim. There, the victim told Cynthia that the defendant had done \u201csomething to somebody in New York\u201d; that he had beaten up the victim; and that she feared for her life and wanted to go to the police and have the defendant arrested. Cynthia directed the victim to the police station, where the victim told a police officer, Sergeant Richard Cox, that the defendant had stabbed and killed a woman in Brooklyn, New York. She also told Cox that the defendant had beaten her, and that she wanted him removed from the apartment they shared. Sergeant Cox told the victim to stay at a friend\u2019s house for the night, and that he would check out her story with the Brooklyn police and get back to her in the morning. The victim then returned to Cynthia\u2019s apartment to spend the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">That night, the victim, Joyce, and Joyce\u2019s son stayed in the front room of Cynthia\u2019s apartment. All three slept in the same bed to keep warm. Cynthia and her boyfriend, Quint\u00edn, were in the back bedroom. At some point, Joyce awakened to see a man lying flat on the floor near the bed. There was evidence introduced from which the jury could have found that this intruder broke and entered through the back door of the apartment. Joyce roused the victim, and the two of them sat up in the bed. The man on the floor got up, began hitting the victim, and pulled her off the bed onto the floor. When Joyce got off the bed to try to help the victim, she recognized the man as the defendant and saw that he had a knife. The defendant raised the knife and repeatedly stabbed the victim as she lay on the floor. He told Joyce to lie down and shut up or he would do the same to her. The defendant then took the victim\u2019s coat and covered her body, kissed her forehead, and said, \u201cI killed Nivea for you and now I\u2019m killing you for Nivea.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cynthia and Quint\u00edn entered the room, and the defendant said, \u201cThe bitch called the police on me. She\u2019s no good. She called the police.\u201d The defendant then put the knife into the waistband of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>his pants, and went into the bathroom to wash the bloodstains off his clothes. To get the defendant out of the apartment, Quint\u00edn gave him some money for a taxi. At this point, it was about 4 a.m. The defendant asked Quint\u00edn to give him until 6 a.m. \u201cto get away.\u201d When the defendant left the apartment, Quint\u00edn and Cynthia went to the Malden police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The defendant was apprehended at the apartment of a coworker. Daniel Stamos, the defendant\u2019s employer, identified the defendant for the police, and asked the defendant what had happened. The defendant started crying and responded, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Danny, I killed my wife. I killed my baby.\u201d The police found near the defendant items of clothing which he admitted he had been wearing on the night the victim was killed; on these were found traces of blood of the same type as the victim\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">At trial the defendant denied having killed the victim, and testified that he had arrived at the scene of the crime to find the victim lying on the floor in a pool of blood. On appeal, the defendant contends that he was prejudiced substantially by the judge\u2019s erroneous admission of testimony as to certain statements by the victim. Joyce, Cynthia, and Sergeant Cox testified to statements by the victim accusing the defendant of having stabbed and killed a woman in New York. Joyce and Cynthia also testified that the victim had stated that the defendant had beaten her. This testimony ostensibly was admitted for the nonhearsay purposes of showing a hostile relationship between the defendant and the victim, and the defendant\u2019s motive for killing the victim. The defendant argues that the statements were hearsay, that their probative value was substantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect, and that the limiting instructions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> given were ineffective to prevent the jury from improperly considering the statements for the truth of the matters asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Assuming arguendo, without deciding, that the judge erred in admitting in evidence the victim\u2019s statements accusing the defendant of having beaten her and of having murdered another woman, we decline to reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions because we conclude that the evidence properly admitted against the defendant was so overwhelming that no prejudice to the defendant actually resulted from the admission of the victim\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The evidence against the defendant was cumulative and compelling. Joyce testified that she saw the defendant beat and stab the victim, and then kneel over the victim\u2019s body and say, \u201cI killed Nivea for you and now I\u2019m killing you for Nivea.\u201d Cynthia also heard this statement. During the assault, the defendant told Joyce to lie down and shut up, or he would do the same to her. Quint\u00edn saw the defendant standing over the victim\u2019s body holding a hunting knife, and both Quint\u00edn and Cynthia heard the defendant say, \u201cThe bitch called the police on me. She\u2019s no good. She called the police.\u201d On leaving Cynthia\u2019s apartment, the defendant asked Quint\u00edn to give him some time \u201cto get away.\u201d Moreover, three disinterested witnesses testified regarding damaging admissions by the defendant. Two police officers testified that on his arrest the defendant said, \u201cYou have got the right guy. I killed her.\u201d One of the officers asked the defendant where the murder weapon was, and the defendant told him it was still in Cynthia\u2019s apartment. When the defendant\u2019s employer, Daniel Stamos, who was present at the defendant\u2019s arrest, asked him what had happened, the defendant replied, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Danny. I killed my wife. I killed my baby.\u201d Even if the jury had had doubts as to the credibility of Joyce, Cynthia, and Quint\u00edn, it reasonably could have relied on the testimony of Stamos and the police officers. Although not inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s version of the facts, the traces of blood of the victim\u2019s type that were found on the defendant\u2019s clothing provide additional circumstantial evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">This, then, is that rare case in which the evidence properly admitted against the defendant is so overwhelming that there is no reasonable possibility that the exclusion of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>complained of would have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. Even if the victim\u2019s statements had been excluded, \u201cwe can say with fair assurance that a reasonable jury would not have returned a different verdict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 223 (1986). We also have reviewed the entire record as required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1986 ed.), and decline to order a new trial or to direct the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-5\"> The defendant testified that he knew a woman named \u201cNivea\u201d in Brooklyn, New York, and that Nivea was the mother of his child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-6\"> The judge instructed the jury that the statements were hearsay; that they were not admitted to prove the truth of the matters asserted or to show that the defendant committed or had a propensity to commit the crimes charged; and that the jury should consider them only for the limited purposes of proving the victim\u2019s state of mind and the defendant\u2019s knowledge, intent, motive, or method.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
