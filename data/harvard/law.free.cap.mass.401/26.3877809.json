The defendant appeals. We conclude that the judge did not err either as to the Federal or State civil rights claim in denying immunity to the defendant. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The facts are these. By trade, the defendant is a funeral director. In 1978, the mayor of the city of Springfield (city) appointed him to serve, without compensation, as a member of the board of fire commissioners of Springfield (board), a body charged inter alia with hiring and firing fire fighters in conformance with the civil service laws. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 1 (definition of \u201c[appointing authority\u201d), 48 and 51 (1986 ed.). From July, 1978, through November, 1984, the defendant served as chairman. The plaintiff was employed as a fire fighter by the city. At times relevant to this case, he held a tenured position which was subject to the provisions of G. L. c. 31. In August, 1977, he was indicted on several criminal charges, including statutory rape. The plaintiff was advised by the chief of the fire department that he was at risk of permanent termination from employment if found guilty of conduct unbecoming a fire fighter, but that he could request an unpaid leave of absence pending resolution of the charges against him. The plaintiff then made written request for a leave of absence \u201cfor thirty days or until my personal problem has been resolved.\u201d His request was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In April, 1981, the plaintiff was tried and acquitted of the criminal charges against him. In June, he applied to the board for reinstatement as a fire fighter. Told to appear at a monthly meeting of the board on August 4,1981, he did so. The minutes of that meeting disclose that \u201c[t]he Chairman asked [the plaintiff] if he had any claims against the Fire Department or the City,\u201d and whether \u201che had considered writing to the Commission that does not [szc] hold the City harmless.\u201d The chairman expressed his \u201cfeel[ing] that any claim against the City or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the Fire Department should be resolved before [the plaintiff] is considered for reinstatement.\u201d Although another commissioner suggested that the commission \u201cdoes not want to make it sound like reinstatement ... is contingent upon whether or not any action is taken by him against the City . . . Breault was asked if he would sign a statement that he would not bring any claims against the City or the Fire Department.\u201d When the plaintiff said \u201che was not sure, he would have to check with his lawyer . . . [t]he Chairman said it was difficult to make a decision and they would wait to see what the Law Department comes up with.\u201d Because \u201c[t]he Commission want[ed] an answer to their question about any claims against the City or the Fire Department,\u201d the matter was postponed until the next meeting. After more than two months had elapsed, plaintiff\u2019s counsel wrote to the board on October 21, 1981, indicating that the plaintiff was represented by counsel and inquiring about the status of Breault\u2019s request for reinstatement. On November 10, 1981, the board met and decided to reinstate the plaintiff, his reinstatement to take effect on November 23, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The plaintiff filed suit against the city and the chairman in December, 1982. In its first three counts, the complaint sought compensation for wrongs alleged to have resulted from his unpaid leave of absence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Count IV alleged denial of the plaintiff\u2019s rights and privileges under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and demanded compensation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982). Concerning rights similarly grounded, count V alleged deprivation of those rights \u201cby force, threats, coercion, and intimidation\u201d and demanded compensation pursuant to G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 111. In response to a series of motions in 1985, the judge allowed summary judgment for the defendant city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>on all counts of the complaint and for the defendant on count I. The defendant was denied summary judgment on the remaining counts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On March 11, 1986, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motions for reconsideration of summary judgment; and, in answer to the defendant\u2019s motion for a pretrial determination of qualified immunity from suit on counts IV and V, the judge ruled that the defendant is not immune from liability. The defendant filed a notice of appeal from the order denying immunity from liability on counts IV and V.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">1. <em>Qualified immunity pursuant to \u00a7 1983. </em>The defendant argues that qualified immunity was denied erroneously, and that this interlocutory appeal is properly before us. The plaintiff maintains the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">a. <em>Appropriateness of review. </em>The judge\u2019s order did not conclude the plaintiff\u2019s action at the trial level, and in that sense it was not the sort of final judgment that is entitled to appellate review. See <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>371 Mass. 324, 329-330 (1976), and cases cited. Nonetheless, even where part of an action remains undetermined, we treat an order as final if it is to be executed presently with the result that any later appeal would be futile. <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 779-780 (1979), relying on <em>Vincent v. Plecker, </em>319 Mass. 560, 564 n.2 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The defendant would not benefit from our rule of \u201cpresent execution,\u201d as stated in <em>Borman, </em>if the asserted right to immunity is but a right to freedom from <em>liability </em>under \u00a7 1983, for in that case his right could be vindicated fully on appeal after trial. If, however, the asserted right is one of freedom from <em>suit, </em>the defendant\u2019s right will be lost forever unless that right is determined now, and his appeal is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The controlling Federal authority clearly indicated that the immunity in question is an immunity from \u201cthe risks of trial.\u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 816 (1982). The immunity created by the Supreme Court for application to suits brought under this Federal statute is an immunity from suit, not just from liability. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 525-526 (1985) (plurality opinion, <em>id. </em>at 518, 530, stating that, by force of \u201ccollateral order doctrine,\u201d decision by Federal District Court denying qualified immunity to suit under \u00a7 1983 is appealable \u201cfinal decision\u201d within meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982), notwithstanding absence of final judgment).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, in the sense contemplated by our rule of present execution, <em>Borman, supra, </em>the judge\u2019s order denying qualified immunity is final, and the question of the validity of the judge\u2019s order is ripe for consideration by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">b. <em>The denial of immunity. </em>\u201cGovernment officials performing discretionary functions may be shielded from liability for civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>damages in a \u00a7 1983 action by the doctrine of qualified immunity. <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818 . . . (1982); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Scherer, </em>468 U.S. 183 [, 194 n. 12] (1984) (immunity standard of <em>Harlow </em>applies in \u00a7 1983 actions). An official is entitled to immunity if, at the time of the challenged action, the statutory or constitutional right allegedly violated was not \u2018clearly established.\u2019 <em>Harlow, </em>457 U.S. at 818 . . . .\u201d <em>Bonitz </em>v. <em>Fair, </em>804 F.2d 164-, 166 (1st Cir. 1986). Discussing the role of appellate courts pursuant to <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in <em>Bonitz </em>v. <em>Fair, supra, </em>has emphasized that the scope of review is limited to questions of law, <em>id., </em>quoting <em>Mitchell, supra </em>at 530, that is, whether (a) the acts complained of were \u201cdiscretionary functions,\u201d not ministerial in nature, and (b) the statutory or constitutional rights allegedly violated were \u201cclearly established.\u201d See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 641 (1987) (principle of qualified immunity allows defendant to seek summary judgment on ground that, on \u201cclearly established principles [of law],\u201d he could have reasonably believed his acts to be lawful).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">In this case, the judge withheld immunity under the <em>Harlow </em>standard because he concluded both that (a) when responding to the plaintiff\u2019s request for reinstatement, the defendant was performing a nondiscretionary, ministerial act, clearly mandated in the instant circumstance by G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 37 (governing reinstatement after voluntary leave of absence from a civil service position); and (b) even though \u201c[t]he average layman may not be able to point immediately to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article XI of the Declaration of Rights as the source\u201d of the right allegedly violated, \u201cthe right of free access to the courts is ... so clearly established that a reasonable person in [the defendant\u2019s] position would have known about it.\u201d The defendant argues, however, that rights are not \u201cclearly established\u201d for <em>Harlow </em>purposes unless, at the time of the acts at issue, the rights were enshrined in factually indistinguishable case law, either controlling in the jurisdiction or substantially uncontroverted, about which a layman like himself reasonably should have known.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>We need not reach these latter arguments because immunity is available, as a threshold matter under <em>Harlow, </em>only where the defendant official was \u201cperforming discretionary functions,\u201d <em>Harlow, supra </em>at 818. We agree with the judge that the facts alleged by the plaintiff described circumstances in which the defendant was called upon to act only in a ministerial, not a discretionary, capacity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the leave of absence granted to the plaintiff in 1977 was governed by G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 37 (1986 ed.). According to \u00a7 37, \u201c[a]ny person who has been granted a leave of absence . . . pursuant to this section <em>shall </em>be reinstated at the end of the period for which the leave was granted ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). Having in mind both \u201cthe ordinary and approved usage\u201d of this language, as well as the \u201cobject to be accomplished,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983), namely the protection of civil servants\u2019 rights to their public employment, see generally <em>Horrigan </em>v. <em>Mayor of Pittsfield, </em>298 Mass. 492, 495 (1937), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>we read the statute to require reinstatement when the term of the leave expires. Admittedly, the terminus of the leave granted to the plaintiff was not fixed by date; nonetheless, because the leave was sought by the plaintiff to cover that period of time \u201cuntil my personal problem [i.e., his indictment] has been resolved,\u201d reinstatement was the plaintiff\u2019s mandatory right after his acquittal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the defendant enjoyed no statutory discretionary authority to withhold reinstatement, he acted in a ministerial capacity. Immunity was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">2. <em>Immunity under State law. </em>In response to the defendant\u2019s claim of immunity from liability or suit under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (Act), G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I, the judge reasoned from our decision in <em>Chicopee Lions Club </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Hampden Dist., </em>396 Mass. 244 (1985), that \u201csome form of immunity is applicable to claims against [non-juridical] officers ... in appropriate cases.\u201d He then applied to the plaintiff\u2019s statutory action our common law standard for extending immunity to nonjuridical officers sued in tort. According to this test, immunity is warranted where an official has acted within the scope of a discretionary public duty and not in bad faith, with malice, or corruptly. See <em>Gildea </em>v. <em>Ellershaw, </em>363 Mass. 800, 820 (1973). For purposes of argument, the judge ruled that, even if the defendant had performed in a discretionary capacity, immunity was unwarranted because, if the plaintiff\u2019s allegations were true, the defendant could be viewed as having tried to coerce him into surrendering the right to pursue his legal claims, and therefore the defendant could be found to have acted in bad faith or with malice. We concur in the result reached by the judge, but on different grounds.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>In <em>Chicopee Lions Club, supra </em>at 252, we noted that \u201cthe Massachusetts Civil Rights Act by its terms admits of no immunities.\u201d Even though the Act itself is silent on the question of immunity, it is reasonable to conclude that the Legislature did not intend to immunize nonjuridical officers for all ministerial acts performed by them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the year immediately prior to adoption of the Civil Rights Act, St. 1979, c. 801, the Legislature responded to the proddings of this court by adopting a Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258. See St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 15. The Tort Claims Act abrogated the common law rule of sovereign immunity which had theretofore immunized public entities from suit in tort claims arising from the acts or omissions of public employees. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2. See also <em>Morash &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 612 (1973). The Tort Claims Act also absolved public employees from liability for their negligent acts performed within the scope of official duties. G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2. Significantly, however, the Tort Claims Act withheld immunity from public employees (and retained immunity for public entities) where the acts complained of were \u201cintentional,\u201d as opposed to negligent, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (c); and the Tort Claims Act authorized public employers to \u201cindemnify public employees ... in an amount not to exceed one million dollars\u201d where harm is alleged \u201cby reason of an intentional tort, or by reason of any act or omission which constitutes a violation of the civil rights of any person under any federal or state law.\u201d G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 9 (1986 ed.).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Thus, when the Legislature adopted the Civil Rights Act one year later in 1979, it wrote on a common law slate recently wiped clean and newly limned with statutory markings. Clearly, these markings indicated a legislative willingness to see public officers sued for violations of civil rights, else no treatment of the question of indemnification from civil rights suits would have been necessary. Furthermore, while we do not intimate that compensatory civil rights claims are indistinguishable from actions alleging intentionally tortious acts, the Legislature\u2019s provision for indemnity from both in the same statutory sections, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 9A, and the exclusion of indemnity in \u00a7 13, suggests an awareness by the Legislature of the possibility of suits such as this. Additionally, the statutory exemption only for discretionary acts, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>buttresses our view that the Legislature did not intend to preclude suits based on intentional ministerial acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Because the Civil Rights Act proscribes only those interferences with civil rights which are accomplished \u201cby threats, intimidation or coercion,\u201d G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H, incorporated by reference in G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111, the Act operates almost entirely within the realm of \u201cintentional\u201d behavior.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Given that adoption of the Act followed closely on the heels of enactment of the Tort Claims Act, we think it both logical and likely that the Legislature viewed the later legislation in light of the earlier enactment, and intended to withhold immunity from officials who intentionally violated the Act, just as the Tort Claims Act withholds immunity from intentional tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Turning now to the question whether, at the time the Act was passed, there existed any \u201ctradition\u201d of immunity for non-juridical officers so firmly \u201crooted in history\u201d that we should not presume the Legislature to have abandoned it without comment, <em>Chicopee Lions Club, supra, </em>our review of the court\u2019s common law decisions reveals nothing of the sort. Compare <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>304 Mass. 396, 398-399 (1939) (directly citing a line of decisions back to 1854 in support of the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity, and back to 1926 in support of absolute prosecutorial immunity), with <em>Gildea </em>v. <em>Eller show, </em>363 Mass. 800, 820 (1973). In <em>Gildea, </em>the court sought to reconcile what can best be described as a confusing welter of previous decisions. Some of these decisions withheld immunity entirely, stating, for example, that, even where nonjuridical officers had performed their duties in good faith, \u201c[t]he cloak of office is no protection to them,\u201d <em>Stiles </em>v. <em>Municipal Council of Lowell, </em>233 Mass. 174, 182 (1919), discussed in <em>Gildea, supra </em>at 805-810, 821-825; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>152 Mass. 540 (1891) (Holmes, J.); other decisions, however, upheld immunity even when the official acts complained of were ministerial in nature, so long as nonfeasance was alleged rather than misfeasance, see, e.g., <em>Desmarais </em>v. <em>Wachusett Regional School Dist., </em>360 Mass. 591, 593 (1971), mentioned in <em>Gildea, supra </em>at 812 n.ll; and see <em>Fulgoni </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>302 Mass. 421, 423 (1939);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and still others \u201cattempt[ed] to give nonjudicial public officers the benefit of . . . [absolute] immunity . . . enjoyed by judges, but only if . . . the function of the officer which gave rise to the claim for damages was either judicial or quasi judicial in nature.\u201d <em>Gildea, supra </em>at 812, referring to <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>191 Mass. 78, 88 (1906), and <em>Jaffarian </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>280 Mass. 402, 406-407 (1932). It was decided in <em>Gildea </em>that henceforward the nonjuridical officer was entitled to tort immunity for discretionary acts performed within the scope of official duty, in good faith and without malice or corruption. <em>Id. </em>at 820. It is significant to note that both <em>Gildea </em>and <em>Chicopee </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>Lions Club </em>dealt with discretionary acts of public officials. The same is true of <em>Pina </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>400 Mass. 408, 412 (1987). See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 <em>(b). </em>None of these cases, or \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>has application to acts, such as those in the case at bar, which are ministerial in nature. In these circumstances, we think that the silence of the Legislature concerning immunity under the Act cannot be interpreted as incorporating a tradition of immunity for intentional ministerial acts. In this context where history is no guide, we rely heavily on the principle that the Act, \u201clike other civil rights statutes, is remedial [and] is entitled to liberal construction of its terms.\u201d <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., </em>393 Mass. 819, 822 (1985). We conclude, therefore, that, where intentional ministerial acts of public officials are involved, there is no basis to conclude, under the relevant statutes and case law, that immunity from suit should be granted. Accordingly, the judge was correct in ruling that the defendant was not immune from the remedial ambit of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The considerations cited in <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800 (1982), do not outweigh the public interest in affording remedies to persons injured as described in the Act. We need not discuss the defendant\u2019s argument in favor of adopting the particular form of immunity propounded in <em>Harlow </em>because that case deals with discretionary, not ministerial, acts. While we appreciate the meticulousness with which the judge applied the <em>Gildea </em>test for immunity in this case, we decline to adopt that approach. The <em>Gildea </em>standard is basically a test which serves to protect officials who perform discretionary duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Since no immunity was warranted, the order denying the defendant immunity under counts IV and V was correct, and summary judgment for the defendant was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\n<em>Orders affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b43-10\"> In relevant part, the statutes centrally pertinent to this appeal read as follows: \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">\u201cWhenever any person or persons, whether or not acting under color of law, interfere by threats, intimidation or coercion, or attempt to interfere by threats, intimidation or coercion, with the exercise or enjoyment by any other person or persons of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the United States, or of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the commonwealth, the attorney general may bring a civil action for injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief in order to protect the peaceable exercise or enjoyment of the right or rights secured.\u201d G.

A single justice of the Appeals Court concluded that this appeal should be heard by a panel of the Appeals Court. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b47-7\"> The plaintiff argues <em>that Mitchell, supra, </em>is binding authority only where action under \u00a7 1983 is brought in the Federal courts, which alone are subject to the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982); and that, pursuant to longstanding rules governing choice of law, matters pertaining to form and conduct of an action, including remedies, are procedural questions properly governed by the law of the forum (Massachusetts), which he views as barring the defendant\u2019s interlocutory appeal. While the first of the plaintiff\u2019s propositions may be strictly correct, we note that the <em>Mitchell </em>Court, <em>supra </em>at 518, arrived at its result by applying the \u201ccollateral order doctrine\u201d of <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949), and we have described the <em>Cohen </em>rule as \u201ca doctrine closely analogous to our rule of present execution.\u201d <em>Borman, supra </em>at 780. Thus, even if we were concerned merely with comity and consistency, we would hold as we do. More importantly, were we to withhold the right of appeal in courts of this Commonwealth, the practical effect would be to ensure that a large number of suits under \u00a7 1983 would be removed to Federal courts. We decline to adopt such a rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b49-5\"> The dissent proceeds on the premise that the defendant\u2019s acts were discretionary, not ministerial. Thus, the dissent relies on <em>Harlow </em>for its conclusion that the defendant, at least under Federal law, was entitled to immunity. A number of points need be made. First, <em>Harlow </em>itself recognizes that the doctrine of qualified immunity is limited to discretionary acts. \u201cImmunity generally is available only to officials performing discretionary functions.\" <em>Harlow, supra </em>at 816. Second, the motion judge ruled that the defendant \u201cwas not . . . performing a discretionary function in acting on the plaintiff\u2019s request for reinstatement.\u201d Third, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and answers to interrogatories assert throughout a violation of G. L. c. 31 and of the collective bargaining agreement between the city and the plaintiff\u2019s union. Fourth, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 37, on its face (see text above), is clear that reinstatement was mandatory. Fifth, it is clear that the leave expired when the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cpersonal problem\u201d was resolved, or that the \u201cpersonal problem\u201d had been resolved (by the jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal) by the time the plaintiff sought reinstatement. Last, and perhaps most important, the dissent\u2019s position confuses the merits of the claim with the interlocutory matter before us \u2014 whether there is immunity from suit \u2014 with the substantive question of liability, a point we decline to reach (see note 4, <em>supra). </em>If the dissent were to prevail, summary judgment would enter for the defendant, and the plaintiff would be barred from having his claim decided on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">As to the dissent\u2019s views on the State Civil Rights Act, that opinion also is based on the same faulty premises. The dissent\u2019s reliance on <em>Gildea </em>v. <em>Ellershaw, </em>363 Mass. 800 (1973), is misplaced, since the acts here involved were not discretionary, but ministerial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b50-5\"><em> Davis </em>v. <em>Scherer, </em>468 U.S. 183 (1984), is not to the contrary. It states that a law creates discretionary authority for purposes of <em>Harlow </em>whenever it \u201cfails to specify the precise action that the official must take in each instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196 n.14. We read \u00a7 37 as mandating reinstatement in <em>every </em>instance where, as here, the terminus of the leave is clearly determinable from the terms of its grant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b50-6\"> Again, the plaintiff argues that the judge\u2019s order denying immunity is interlocutory and not appealable. However, if immunity is even arguably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>in the public interest, it must operate as an immunity from suit, not just from liability. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 525-526 (1985). Consequently, the judge\u2019s order was appealable because it was \u201cfinal\u201d within the meaning of our rule of \u201cpresent execution.\u201d See <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 779-780 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b51-5\"><em> Tyree </em>v. <em>Keane, </em>400 Mass. 1, 5-6 (1987), is not to the contrary. In that case, we assumed qualified immunity to be a defense to a \u00a7 1983 action in determining the relevance of certain excluded evidence. In <em>Tyree </em>we did not discuss the question of qualified immunity under the State act because the parties did not raise the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b51-6\"> Indemnification is also provided for certain public officers. G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 9A (1986 ed.). In contrast, intentional violations of civil rights are not subject to indemnification. G.

Accord <em>Redgrave </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., </em>399 Mass. 93, 99 (1987) (although \u201cspecific intent\u201d is not essential to violation of Act, that degree of intent which makes persons responsible for natural consequences of their action must be shown). Also, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 9A, 10 (c), and 13, recognize the potential distinction between intentional torts and intentional violations of civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">We need not decide the question whether a negligent violation of civil rights may give rise to a valid claim of a violation of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b53-4\"> For a recent discussion of the vitality of this approach where negligence is alleged at common law, see <em>Narine </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>400 Mass. 343 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b54-7\">Wilkins, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APC\">(concurring). The court is correct in concluding that the defendant was performing a ministerial act. The court\u2019s opinion, however, unduly complicates this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The basic issue is whether the defendant is entitled to immunity under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2. He is so entitled if \u00a7 2 applies to his conduct. Section 2 does not apply to \u201cany claim arising out of an intentional tort.\u201d G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (c) (1986 ed.). Some violations of the Civil Rights Act (G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 111) should be treated as intentional torts for the purposes of \u00a7 10 (c) and others should not be. The intentional conduct which justifies a claim under the Civil Rights Act is not the same as the intentional conduct that is an element of an intentional tort. <em>See. Redgrave </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., </em>399 Mass. 93,, 99 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The question whether this claim falls within the scope of G. L. c. 258 remains open in this case. If the claim is based on an intentional tort, such as an intentional violation of civil rights, I agree that the defendant is not immune from liability. If the claim is based on ministerial conduct which was not undertaken with the intention of depriving the plaintiff of his civil rights, the wrong would not be intentional and \u00a7 2 immunity would be available.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b55-6\">Lynch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACx\">(dissenting, with whom Nolan, J., joins). I dissent because I conclude that the defendant was immune from suit for the acts complained of under both Federal and State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">1. <em>Liability under \u00a7 1983. </em>The court concludes that the defendant was properly denied qualified immunity under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) because the plaintiff\u2019s reinstatement was required by G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 37, and, therefore, the defendant\u2019s conduct was ministerial and not discretionary. Although reinstatement to a classified position after a leave of absence may be ministerial in some circumstances, the record here establishes that reinstatement was discretionary. General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 37, provides, in part, that an appointing authority may grant a leave of absence for more than fourteen days only upon the written request of the employee (or other person authorized) which shall include a detailed statement of the reason for the request. Furthermore, no leave of absence for a period of more than three months shall be granted without the prior approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>of the administrator. The section further provides that any person who has been granted a leave of absence or an extension thereof, \u201cpursuant to this section,\u201d shall be reinstated \u201cat the end of the period for which the leave was granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The leave in this case was granted in 1977, and the plaintiff\u2019s request for reinstatement at issue was filed in June, 1981. The motion judge found that there was nothing in the record to indicate that the leave was granted with the prior approval of the administrator as required by \u00a7 37. The court informs us that the plaintiff\u2019s leave was requested \u201cfor thirty days or until [his] personal problem has been resolved.\u201d The plaintiff appeared before the board on August 4, 1981, and he was reinstated three and one-half months later on November 23, 1981. Neither in his complaint nor by affidavit did the plaintiff claim that his request for a leave of absence complied with the requirements of \u00a7 37. There was no evidence that the prior approval of the administrator, an essential element of \u00a7 37, was obtained, and nowhere does it state that the termination of the leave would be at any definite time, only that the leave was for the vague period, \u201cuntil my personal problem has been resolved.\u201d Neither is it clear that the request for a leave \u201cuntil my personal problem has been resolved\u201d complies with the requirement that the request contain a detailed statement of the reason for the request. I do not mean to imply that either the plaintiff or the defendant is to be criticized for agreeing to a voluntary leave of absence in the circumstances of this case. The point is that the defendant cannot be charged with responsibility for failure to perform a ministerial act until such time as it is shown that the conditions making reinstatement mandatory have been clearly established. Therefore, because the findings and allegations establish that the factual predicates for the applicability of \u00a7 37 were missing, the official could not know the precise action that was required of him, and thus reinstatement was discretionary. I would agree that \u00a7 37 mandates reinstatement when those factual predicates are clearly before the official in question; however, such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Neither do I believe that the defendant could be found to have acted with knowledge that his conduct violated any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>\u201cclearly established\u201d statutory or constitutional right of the defendant. The defendant could not reasonably be expected to know that the plaintiff\u2019s reinstatement on the condition of a waiver of his civil claim was unlawful. <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). Until recently, judges and other officials with expert knowledge frequently sought waivers of civil claims as a precondition to favorable action toward a criminal defendant. <em>See Foley </em>v. <em>Lowell Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>398 Mass. 800, 804-805 (1986). Recently, the Supreme Court reversed a decision of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, invalidating such a waiver. <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Rumery, </em>480 U.S. 386 (1987). Thus the law was by no means settled and, in fact, the Supreme Court in <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Rumery, supra, </em>ruled that even in a criminal case, such a waiver is not necessarily invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">I conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts either in his complaint or by affidavit to establish the defendant\u2019s liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982). Summary judgment in favor of the defendant should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">2. <em>Liability under State law. </em>The court concludes that no immunity protects public officials from liability for intentional torts while performing ministerial acts. Since I believe that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is grounded on discretionary conduct of the defendant, I would not reach the question of liability for ministerial acts and would apply our traditional rule of immunity for public officials. Although the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act is silent on the question of immunity, the court recently concluded that juridical officers are absolutely immune from suit under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, because that statute contained no abrogation of the common law immunity of such officers. <em>Chicopee Lions Club </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Hampden Dist., </em>396 Mass. 244, 252 (1985). I would adhere to the logic of the <em>Chicopee Lions Club </em>decision and would apply the rule of immunity in effect prior to the enactment of G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, I cannot agree that the adoption of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Massachusetts Tort Claims Act in a previous legislative session is any evidence of a legislative intent to create by implication in a subsequent statute a new rule of immunity for previously protected public officials. Furthermore, the fact that the Legislature abolished sovereign immunity in order to permit citizens to seek recourse against governmental agencies evinces no intent to change the law of immunity for public officials who had previously been liable for their negligent, as well as intentional, torts. The Massachusetts Tort Claims Act is not about <em>granting </em>immunity to individuals. It created a cause of action against governmental agencies where previously sovereign immunity had barred such suits. It eliminated claims against public employees for negligence within the scope of their employment where liability of governmental agencies was created, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, and left undisturbed employee liability where the law of governmental liability was left undisturbed, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10. Clearly the statute deals primarily with governmental liability and deals only incidentally, in a limited circumstance, with immunity of individuals. In enacting the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, therefore, the Legislature was adding new principles to a system already affected by common law axioms (as it usually does), not adopting a law to be applied in a vacuum or writing \u201con a common law slate recently wiped clean.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The common law, as discerned by this court in <em>Gildea </em>v. <em>Ellershaw, </em>363 Mass. 800, 820 (1973), is that nonjuridical officers are afforded immunity for their discretionary acts performed within the scope of official duty in good faith without malice or corruption. I would apply to these officers the same immunity that existed for them at the adoption of the Massa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>chusetts Civil Rights Act as the court has done for juridical officers. I have previously stated that on the facts of this case the defendant\u2019s acts were discretionary. I view the allegations as insufficient to warrant the conclusion that he acted in bad faith with malice or corruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">I reach this conclusion in full view of the policy considerations extant. In the words of the United States Supreme Court, \u201cgovernment officials are entitled to some form of immunity from suits for damages. As recognized at common law, public officers require this protection to shield them from undue interference with their duties and from potentially disabling threats of liability. \u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra </em>at 806. \u201cThe privilege [of immunity] is not a badge or emolument of exalted office, but an expression of policy designed to aid in the effective functioning of government.\u201d <em>Gildea </em>v. <em>Ellershaw, </em>363 Mass. 800, 817 (1973), quoting <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Matteo, </em>360 U.S. 564, 574 (1959). \u201c[T]he immunity applies equally to decisions which the public officer is required to make and to those he is permitted to make.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In an era where litigiousness among our citizens has reached a fever peak, and where public officials are subjected to scrutiny of their public and private affairs unparalleled in history, I see no justification to depart from a clearly established rule of immunity.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\"> Similar immunity is afforded to such officials under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982), the Federal counterpart of G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111. See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Mazza, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>394 Mass. 176, 181 (1985), <em>citing Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., </em>393 Mass. 819 (1985). The Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Scherer, </em>468 U.S. 183, 194 &amp; n.12 (1984), applied the qualified immunity described <em>in Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra, </em>to actions brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., supra </em>at 822-823, this court concluded \u201cthat the Legislature intended to provide a remedy under G.
