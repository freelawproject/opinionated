After a trial, the judge ordered the entry of judgment for the defendant tenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>for possession. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appeals Court and that court reversed the judgment. 23 Mass. App. Ct. 577 (1987). We granted the tenant\u2019s application for further appellate review, and we now affirm the judgment of the Housing Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Greenhill Towers is owned by the plaintiffs and financed by the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency. The tenancy is subject to a lease. The plaintiff owners argue that \u00a7\u00a7 G.9.C, F.2, and F.14 of the lease confer on them the right to evict the defendant.. Section G.9.C provides as follows: <em>\u201cManagement </em>Agrees: ... 9. To terminate Agreement or evict Resident for no other reason than the following: ...(c) material noncompliance with this Agreement, which term shall include . . . one or more substantial, or repeated, or intentional failures to abide by any obligations under this Agreement.\u201d Section F.2 provides that the tenant, who is referred to throughout the lease as \u201cResident,\u201d agrees \u201c[t]o live in a peaceful way respecting the right of other residents to privacy, security, and peaceful enjoyment.\u201d The tenant (Resident) agrees in \u00a7 F.14 \u201c[n]ot to create or allow to be created by Resident, members of Resident\u2019s household, relatives, guests, invitees or agents, any unlawful, noisy or otherwise offensive use of the leased premises; not to commit any disturbance of nuisance, private or public; not to obstruct free use or access of common areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The judge found that on August 19, 1985, in the daytime while the tenant was at work, the tenant\u2019s two sons, who lived with her, broke into another unit in the development and stole a video cassette recorder and other personal property, which was then secreted in the tenant\u2019s apartment. In his memorandum of decision, the judge stated that there had been no evidence before him that the tenant\u2019s sons had engaged in previous wrongful acts affecting other residents of the development. He concluded that, although the breaking-in incident was \u201cgrave,\u201d it had to be viewed as an \u201cisolated\u201d incident and \u201cnot foreseeable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">We agree with the owners that \u00a7 G.9.c provides that the owners have the right to evict a tenant for a single substantial failure to abide by the tenant\u2019s obligations under the lease. The critical question in this case, therefore, is whether such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>a failure has been established. The judge appears to have concluded that the breaking-in incident constituted a substantial noncompliance with the lease, thus triggering the lease provision authorizing eviction, but that, under principles articulated by this court in <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. 258 (1982)., the tenant was nevertheless entitled to retain possession of her unit. For reasons we set forth below, we are satisfied that, as a matter of law, the plaintiff owners did not sustain their burden of proving that the defendant failed to fulfil her lease obligations. Therefore, the plaintiffs have not established that the terms of the lease authorized them to evict the tenant. Although our reasoning differs from that of the judge, we conclude that the judge\u2019s order of judgment was correct. As a result, we do not reach the further constitutional, statutory, and policy questions possibly suggested by <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, supra, </em>and argued extensively by the parties, concerning whether the tenant would be entitled to possession even if, as in <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>eviction were authorized by the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, supra, </em>the leases identified two relevant permissible grounds for terminating the tenancies involved in that case, neither of which referred expressly to the tenant. Each lease provided: \u201cThis lease may be terminated by the [BHA] ... for no reason other than ... 2. Reasonable likelihood of serious repeated interference with the rights of other tenants. ... 5. Creation or maintenance of a serious threat to the health or safety of other tenants. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261-262. Clearly, the firebombings and assault against a BHA employee involved in the <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley </em>case were \u201cwithin the scope of conduct for which eviction [was] authorized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262. We recognized that the \u201cmore important question [was] whether the termination provisions coverfed] conduct by household members other than the named tenant who [had] signed the lease,\u201d and we concluded that they did. We stated that \u201c[t]he language of the termination provisions speaks only of the facts that justify eviction \u2014\u2022 a threat to health and safety or a likelihood of interference with rights. This wording suggests that if these problems arise from the tenancy, eviction is warranted, whether the wrongdoer is the tenant or a member <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>of her household. Moreover, an interpretation of the lease to cover the conduct of all household members is consistent with the manifest purpose of the termination provisions, to promote safety and order in the housing projects.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Because the language of the termination provisions in <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley </em>spoke only to the facts, that is, the conduct, justifying eviction, without any identification of the person or persons whose conduct was contemplated, we resorted to the apparent purpose of the provisions to aid us in determining whether the conduct referred to was limited to the tenant\u2019s conduct or included conduct of household members. Such resort is inappropriate in this case, however, because the language of the termination provision here does not speak only to the conduct justifying eviction, as in <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>but it also speaks to the person whose conduct is referred to. The instant lease, in relevant part, authorizes eviction only in the event of material noncompliance with the lease including a substantial failure \u201cto abide by any obligations\u201d thereunder. Only the owners and the tenant, signatories to the lease, undertook obligations under the lease. Household members, other than the tenant, have no such obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The owners\u2019 notice of eviction and their argument on appeal point only to \u00a7\u00a7 F.2 and F.14 as the source of obligations claimed to have been violated by the tenant. But, there is no evidence warranting a finding that the tenant failed to fulfil her obligations under those sections. Her agreement in \u00a7 F.2 to live in a peaceful way, respecting the rights of other tenants, cannot fairly be construed as a promise that every member of her household will live peacefully and in a manner consistent with the rights of other tenants. At most, it may be arguable that the tenant agrees that she will not permit household members to engage in nonpeaceful conduct, violative of other tenants\u2019 rights, to the extent that she can reasonably foresee and prevent such conduct. There is no evidence that the defendant reasonably could have foreseen and prevented her sons\u2019 conduct. Furthermore, the tenant\u2019s agreement in \u00a7 F.14 \u201c[n]ot to . . . allow to be created by Resident, members of Resident\u2019s household, relatives, guests, invitees or agents, any unlawful, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>noisy or otherwise offensive use of the leased premises,\u201d requires, at the very least, some acquiescence by the tenant in her sons\u2019 conduct. Even if the sons\u2019 storage of the stolen articles in the tenant\u2019s premises be considered an unlawful or offensive use of the premises, in the circumstances the tenant did not \u201callow\u201d that use without knowing about it or at least foreseeing and being able to prevent it.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The owners receive no support from our statement in <em>Spence v. Gormley, supra </em>at 265, that, \u201c[w]hen the wrongdoer is a household member, a fair inference exists that the tenant is aware of potential problems, and able to exercise some influence or otherwise prevent violent and destructive conduct on the premises.\u201d We made that statement in the context of a discussion about who should have the burden of proof on the issue of \u201ccause\u201d under G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 32 (1986 ed.). We did not suggest that, as an evidentiary matter, mere evidence of a tenant-household member relationship is enough to warrant a finding that the tenant could reasonably have foreseen and prevented a break-in and theft by a household member. The plaintiffs\u2019 burden in this case required proof of that fact, and the judge would not have been warranted in finding that the burden was sustained. The plaintiffs have not established their right to evict the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Housing Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
