The defendants, Marilyn Diamant, Bruce Diamant, and Andrea Diamant (Diamants), were insured by an Allstate \u201cdeluxe\u201d homeowners insurance policy. They had sought to have Allstate provide coverage and to defend them in a suit brought against them by Mary White. Allstate filed a motion for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>mary judgment on the ground that the policy did not cover the allegations asserted against the Diamants in the White complaint. After a hearing, the judge granted summary judgment for Allstate. The Diamants appeal. We transferred this case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">The relevant facts are these. The Diamants were the defendants in a lawsuit brought against them by Mary White. White alleged in her complaint that she was a tenured teacher with the Swampscott public high school and that Andrea Diamant had been her student. Andrea Diamant received a failing grade in algebra, a subject that White taught. The Diamants sent a letter to the principal of the Swampscott public high school complaining that White was a \u201cpsychologically damaged teacher\u201d who treated Andrea Diamant unfairly. The complaint also alleged that other defamatory letters and forms of communication were published by the Diamants.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The White complaint alleged three separate claims for defamation and one claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The injuries alleged by White did not consist of any physical harm or manifestation of physical injury. Rather, White alleged that she \u201chas been held up to contempt and reproach, has suffered metal pain and anguish, and has been irreparably injured, prejudiced and harmed in her profession and professional standing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The Allstate \u201cdeluxe\u201d homeowners policy insures the Diamants\u2019 home. In the \u201cFamily Liability\u201d portion, the policy sets out the covered losses: \u201cWe will pay all sums arising from the same loss which an <em>insured person </em>becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of <em>bodily injury </em>or <em>property damage </em>covered by this part of the policy\u201d (emphasis in original). \u201cBodily Injury\u201d is defined in the policy as \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease, including resulting death, care and loss of services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The Diamants sought to have Allstate defend them in the suit filed by White and to indemnify them for any damages which the Diamants would be obligated to pay White as a result of her suit. Allstate denied coverage on the basis that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>injuries alleged by White were not bodily injuries. Allstate then sought an adjudication of its rights and duties under the policy by bringing the present action. The only issue before us is whether the coverage for \u201cbodily injury,\u201d as defined in the policy, encompasses damages for emotional distress, mental pain and anguish, and injury to White\u2019s reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The Diamants argue that the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d includes emotional distress, injury to reputation, and mental pain and anguish. They rely on three Massachusetts cases, <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>284 Mass. 231 (1933), <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>261 Mass. 183 (1927), and <em>Canning </em>v. <em>Williamstown, </em>1 Cush. 451 (1848), for the proposition that \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cinjury to the person\u201d are used synonymously in the jurisprudence of the Commonwealth. Because the injuries alleged by White are \u201cpersonal injuries,\u201d assert the Diamants, the Allstate policy covers them.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">It is well settled in insurance law that \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cpersonal injury\u201d are not synonymous and that these phrases have two distinct definitions. See 7A J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4501.14 (rev. ed. 1979). The term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d is broader and includes not only physical injury but also any affront or insult to the reputation or sensibilities of a person. \u201cBodily injury,\u201d by comparison, is a narrow term and encompasses only physical injuries to the body and the consequences thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Many jurisdictions recognize the distinctions between these terms. See, e.g., <em>Artcraft of N.H., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mut. Casualty Co., </em>126 N.H. 844, 846 (1985); <em>McCroskey </em>v. <em>Cass County, </em>303 N.W.2d 330, 336 (N.D. 1981); <em>Grant </em>v. <em>North River Ins. Co., </em>453 F. Supp. 1361, 1367 (N.D. Ind. 1978). \u201cThe use of the term \u2018 bodily injury\u2019 in the policy limits the harm covered by the policy to <em>physical </em>injury, sickness, or disease and does not include nonphysical harm to the person\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Rolette County </em>v. <em>Western Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>452 F. Supp. 125, 130 (D.N.D. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The cases cited by the Diamants in support of their proposition that the terms are used interchangeably are inapposite. In <em>Lewis, supra, </em>and <em>Canning, supra, </em>the plaintiffs sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>physical injuries in addition to the mental suffering for which the plaintiffs received damage awards.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In both instances, it was important to the plaintiffs\u2019 cases that the mental sufferings were connected with, and grew out of, physical injuries. <em>Lewis, supra </em>at 188. <em>Canning, supra </em>at 452. <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra, </em>also does not support the Diamants\u2019 position. In <em>Cormier, </em>the parents of children injured in an automobile accident in New Hampshire sued the driver of the vehicle for medical expenses and loss of services. The driver had an extraterritorial insurance coverage in his policy. The court held that the parents, while not suffering physical injuries themselves, could recover under the extraterritorial clause for consequential damages. The terms of the extraterritorial insurance policy covered \u201cliability ... for damages <em>on account of bodily injuries . . . </em>suffered by any person\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Cormier, supra </em>at 233. The court distinguished the language in the extraterritorial clause from the compulsory insurance coverage which provided \u201cliability to pay damages to others for bodily injuries <em>Cormier, supra </em>at 234. The court found the language in the extraterritorial clause to be broader and to cover the consequential damages claimed by the parents \u2014 the damages that the parents incurred as a result of, or \u201con account\u201d of, the bodily injuries suffered by their children. See <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., </em>392 Mass. 537, 541 (1984) (coverage \u201cfor bodily injury\u201d conceded to include loss of consortium claim which flowed from bodily injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>There are no cases in the Commonwealth which hold that \u201cbodily injury\u201d means \u201cpersonal injury\u201d and does not require physical injury. In fact, <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>228 Mass. 191, 196 (1917), holds just the opposite: \u201cBodily injury imports harm arising from corporeal contact. In this connection \u2018bodily\u2019 refers to an organism of flesh and blood. It is not satisfied by anything short of physical, and is confined to that kind of injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The Diamants argue, however, that the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d is ambiguous and, as such, should be construed in favor of the insured, citing <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142 (1982). We do not find the term ambiguous. \u201cAs a general rule, other jurisdictions have found the term \u2018bodily injury\u2019 to be unambiguous and understood to mean hurt or harm to the human body, contemplating actual physical harm or damage to a human body.\u201d <em>Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hoag, </em>136 Mich. App. 326, 334 (1984) (bodily injury does not include humiliation and mental anguish and suffering). See <em>Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>244 Ga. 456, 459 (1979). It is well established in other jurisdictions that the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d in insurance policies requires some type of physical harm. See, e.g., <em>Bituminous Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Izzy Rosen\u2019s, Inc., </em>493 F.2d 257, 261 (6th Cir. 1974); <em>American &amp; Foreign Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Church Schools, </em>645 F. Supp. 628, 632 (E.D. Va. 1986); <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Campbell County School Dist. No. 1, </em>612 F. Supp. 285, 287 (D. Wyo. 1985); <em>Grant </em>v. <em>North River Ins. Co., supra; Rolette County </em>v. <em>Western Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., supra; Artcraft of N.H., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mut. Casualty Co., supra; McCroskey </em>v. <em>Cass County, supra </em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The claims made by White for emotional distress and injury to reputation are not \u201cbodily injuries\u201d under the Allstate policy. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b673-4\"> The language the Diamants point to in <em>Canning </em>as supportive of their position actually undermines it: \u201cThe argument for the defendants assumes that the plaintiff sustained no injury in his person, within the meaning of the statute, but merely incurred risk and peril, which caused fright and mental suffering. If such were the fact, the verdict would be contrary to law. But we must suppose that the jury, under the instructions given to them, found that the plaintiff received an injury in his person \u2014 a bodily injury \u2014 and that they did not return their verdict for damages sustained by mere mental suffering caused by the risk and peril which he incurred. And though that bodily injury may have been very small, yet if it was a ground of action, within the statute, and caused mental suffering to the plaintiff, that suffering was a part of the injury for which he was entitled to damages.\u201d <em>Canning, supra </em>at 452. While the court interchanges the terms \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cinjury in his person,\u201d both are used to connote physical injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b674-6\"> We note also that, to the extent the Allstate policy provides that bodily injury includes \u201csickness and disease,\u201d this phrase also requires a showing of a physical affliction. See <em>Palumbo </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>296 Mass. 358 (1937).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
