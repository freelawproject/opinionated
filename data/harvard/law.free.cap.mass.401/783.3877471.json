L. c. 201, \u00a7 6 (1986 ed.), seeking a guardianship of \u201cLinda\u201d (the ward), with authority in the guardian to permit the administration of antipsychotic drugs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time this action was commenced, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>the ward voluntarily was accepting such drugs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Probate Court judge ruled that, by reason of mental illness, the ward was unable to make an informed judgment as to treatment. He appointed a guardian, with authority to permit the administration of antipsychotic drugs for only so long as the ward voluntarily accepted them. He expressly ruled that the department could not at that time obtain an order to compel treatment of the ward with antipsychotic drugs if she later refused to take them. The judge contemplated that, if at some future time the ward refused to accept antipsychotic drugs, an order compelling their forcible administration would issue only after a hearing based on current facts as to the ward\u2019s competence, capacity to make an informed treatment decision, and substituted judgment. The department appeals from that part of the order which conditions the guardian\u2019s authority to administer antipsychotic drugs on the ward\u2019s voluntary acceptance thereof, contending that the judge abused his discretion in imposing this condition. We reject this contention and affirm the order of the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">At the outset, we note that the order has expired. We understand, however, that the department has obtained an interim extension of the order and is seeking a permanent extension. In any event, the issue presented is one that is capable of repetition, yet evading review, so we address its merits. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yameen, ante </em>331, 333 (1987), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The parties do not challenge the probate judge\u2019s findings of fact. The ward suffers from schizophrenia. In the past, she has experienced delusions, hallucinations, and mild paranoia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>and she has been hospitalized repeatedly. Presently, she voluntarily is accepting treatment with antipsychotic drugs, which allows her to live outside an institutional setting. She does not understand the nature of these drugs; she accepts them because she believes they help her to sleep and calm her nerves. Anticipating that at some future time the ward might change her mind and refuse to accept treatment, the department requested that, \u201c [w]hile the ward is now accepting anti-psychotic medication, an order issue now, but not to be effective until sometime in the future, compelling forcible medication in case of her later refusal.\u201d In effect, the department sought a \u201cpocket\u201d order, directed not to the present circumstances but to a future contingency, with which it could override the ward\u2019s expressed desire should she at some point refuse to accept antipsychotic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Much of the department\u2019s argument is directed to demonstrating that the condition imposed by the judge disserves the ward\u2019s \u201cbest interests,\u201d and implies that the medical profession is institutionally superior to the courts in making such determinations. We will not join this debate, as it is irrelevant to the issue of the ward\u2019s substituted judgment. \u201cA substituted-judgment decision is distinct from a decision by doctors as to what is medically in the \u2018best interests\u2019 of the patient. . . . \u2018 [T]he goal is to determine with as much accuracy as possible the wants and needs of the individual involved.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>390 Mass. 489, 500 (1983). The inquiry, then, is directed to discovering \u201cwhat the incompetent individual would do if competent . . .\u201d, and is a \u201csubjective rather than an objective determination.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Roe, </em>383 Mass. 415, 435, 444 (1981). Of course, the ward\u2019s best interests are not irrelevant to this determination, but they are relevant only to the extent that the individual, if competent, would weigh them in deciding whether to accept treatment. We reemphasize that the substituted judgment inquiry is not a medical, but a judicial, function. <em>Rogers, supra </em>at 497-500. <em>Roe, supra </em>at 433-435.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">This court has identified a number of considerations which are relevant to the substituted judgment inquiry, while \u201ccaution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>ing that they are not exclusive, recognizing that certain of them may not exist in all cases and declining to establish their relative weights in any individual case. They are: (1) <em>the ward\u2019s expressed preferences regarding </em>treatment; (2) his religious beliefs; (3) the impact upon the ward\u2019s family; (4) the probability of adverse side effects; (5) the consequences if treatment is refused; and (6) the prognosis with treatment\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Roe, supra </em>at 444. \u201cEven if the ward lacks capacity to make treatment decisions, his stated preference is entitled to serious consideration as a factor in the substituted judgment determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The judge made his substituted judgment decision on the basis of the facts and circumstances existing at that time, among them that the ward had, in effect, \u201cexpressed a preference\u201d for treatment by voluntarily accepting antipsychotic drugs. The department would have the judge consider not only the existing circumstances, but also a future contingency, i.e., the possibility of the ward\u2019s subsequent refusal to continue taking anti-psychotic drugs, and issue an order that would take effect upon the occurrence of that contingency. In effect, the department asked the judge to hypothesize a change in circumstances, and to rule categorically that such a change of circumstances would not alter his conclusion as to the ward\u2019s substituted judgment. We think that, in the circumstances of this case, the judge appropriately acted within his discretion in denying this request for a \u201cprospective\u201d order. See <em>Roe, supra </em>at 432 &amp; n.8 (where the \u201cguardian did <em>not </em>propose to authorize forcible administration of antipsychotic drugs immediately but rather sought contingent authority to administer such drugs if certain anticipated events took place\u201d [emphasis in original; footnote omitted], a judge\u2019s decision granting such authority was \u201cpremature\u201d and erroneous). In so far as his decision was predicated in part on the ward\u2019s expressed preference as to treatment, the judge was warranted in limiting the guardian\u2019s authority forcibly to override the ward\u2019s wishes. Should the ward change her mind and refuse to accept continued treatment with antipsychotic drugs, there might well be reason to believe that other circumstances relevant to the substituted judgment decision also had changed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>\u201cA premature decision will needlessly burden all involved and will make any substituted judgment determination less accurate. The determination will become more precise as it approaches the time at which it will be implemented because, for example, the ward\u2019s choice might change as [her] medical condition (and other circumstances) change.'\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">\u201cWe can identify few legitimate medical procedures which are more intrusive than the forcible injection of antipsychotic medication,\u201d <em>Roe, supra </em>at 436, and we do not think that the inconvenience of obtaining prior judicial approval before forcibly administering such drugs to an incompetent ward is too high a price to pay for the protection of the ward\u2019s right to privacy and bodily integrity. In this regard, we note that the requirement of prior judicial approval applies only to nonemergency circumstances. In situations where the patient \u201cposes an imminent threat of harm to himself or others,\u201d and there is no less intrusive alternative to antipsychotic drugs, or when necessary to prevent the \u201cimmediate, substantial, and irreversible deterioration of a serious mental illness,\u201d <em>Rogers, supra </em>at 510-511, the State may invoke its police or parens patriae powers, respectively, to treat the patient by forcible injection of antipsychotic drugs, over the patient\u2019s objections, and without prior judicial approval. <em>Id. </em>But \u201ccourt approval is mandatory before forcible medication of an incompetent patient with [antipsychotic] drugs in a nonemergency situation can take place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501-502. The judge below was within his discretion in declining to approve prospectively the forcible injection of the ward with antipsychotic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We emphasize that the conclusions we reach do not extend beyond the facts of this case. It is possible that in another case the evidence could be such that the judge might appropriately determine prospectively that antipsychotic drugs might be administered even if the ward refused the treatment. In the case before us, there was no error in the order that, if the ward refuses such drugs, none should be administered, absent emergency, prior to judicial review and determination of her substituted judgment in the changed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-15\"> Prolixin Decanoate and Mellaril. \u201c \u2018Antipsychotic\u2019 drags are \u2018medications such as Thorazine, Mellaril, Prolixin, and Haldol that are used in treating psychoses, particularly schizophrenia.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number><em>of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>390 Mass. 489, 490 n.3 (1983), quoting <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Okin, </em>634 F.2d 650, 653 n.l (1st Cir. 1980), vacated and remanded sub nom. <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>457 U.S. 291 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\"> The department was correct to seek an adjudication of incompetence and substituted judgment although the ward voluntarily was accepting treatment with antipsychotic drugs. \u201c [Bjecause incompetent persons cannot meaningfully consent to medical treatment, a substituted judgment by a judge should be undertaken for the incompetent patient even if the patient accepts the medical treatment.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, supra </em>at 500 n.14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
