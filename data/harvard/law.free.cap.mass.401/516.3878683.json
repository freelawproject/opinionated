This action was brought to recover for harm done to Nancy and for harm sustained by her mother and her brother, whom we shall call Owen. The plaintiffs were awarded judgment on liability pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 33 (a), as amended, 368 Mass. 905 (1976). A judge then decided the issues of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The judge found that on at least two occasions D\u2019Amato touched Nancy\u2019s breasts and vagina. At a family birthday party in 1980, D\u2019Amato arranged to be alone with Nancy, exposed himself, \u201ctouched her vaginal area,\u201d and made Nancy promise not to tell anyone what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">In 1980, Nancy told her twelve-year-old brother Owen that D\u2019Amato had done something wrong. Owen thought she was talking about hugging and kissing. He promised not to tell their mother, a divorced parent. Both children, fearing reprisal or feeling guilt, did not disclose D\u2019Amato\u2019s conduct for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">After Nancy finally did tell of D\u2019Amato\u2019s conduct and D\u2019Amato was confronted with her accusations, a series of events followed that had emotionally traumatic effects- on Nancy. Because the defendant does not challenge the amount of damages ($100,000) awarded to Nancy on her claims for assault and battery and for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, we need not recite the effect of D\u2019Amato\u2019s conduct on Nancy. It is enough to note that she became alienated from her mother and went to live with a relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">It is, however, important to the issues before us to recite the judge\u2019s findings as to the effect of D\u2019Amato\u2019s misconduct on Nancy\u2019s mother and on Owen. He found that the mother was understandably angry and felt guilty because she did not protect her daughter. Owen felt guilty because he was unable to disclose the sexual abuse to any adult. Although the judge found each was obviously traumatized emotionally, he also found that neither suffered physically from the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The judge denied recovery to the mother and to Owen on counts alleging extreme and outrageous conduct causing physical harm and emotional distress. He found no physical injuries and denied recovery for emotional distress because the mother and Owen were not present at the time of D\u2019Amato\u2019s extreme and outrageous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The mother and Owen appeal from a judgment denying them recovery for the effects of D\u2019Amato\u2019s misconduct on them. The mother also challenges the judge\u2019s denial of her postjudg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>ment attempt to assert claims for loss of consortium and for medical expenses. The defendant in turn appeals from the judgment for Nancy, challenging various evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Appeals by Mother and Owen</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">We consider first the claims of the mother and Owen for the infliction of emotional distress. The mother claims both intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. On appeal, Owen claims solely an intentional infliction of emotional distress. When, as here, a defendant is defaulted, well-pleaded facts are deemed to be admitted, but a plaintiff may recover only to the extent the complaint states a claim for relief. See <em>Productora e Importadora de Papel, S.A. de C.V. </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>376 Mass. 826, 834-835 (1978). Thus the plaintiffs had the burden at trial of proving damages incurred as a result of wrongs within the scope of the claims alleged for which the law provides a remedy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We first dispose of the mother\u2019s claim asserting negligent infliction of emotional distress. We have indicated that a plaintiff may not recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress unless she has suffered physical harm. <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs, </em>386 Mass. 540, 555 (1982). The judge found that the mother suffered no physical consequences from the events, and he was not clearly erroneous in so finding. Certain members of this court have been willing to acknowledge that objective corroboration of a plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress may sometimes be shown in the absence of physical injury. See <em>DiGiovanni </em>v. <em>Latimer, </em>390 Mass. 265, 273-274 (1983) (Liacos, J., concurring); <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs, supra </em>at 579 (Wilkins, J., dissenting in part, with whom Liacos and Abrams, JJ. joined). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>We have all agreed, however, that a parent claiming emotional distress caused by negligently inflicted injuries to her child must witness the injury or come upon the injured child promptly after the injury. See <em>Stockdale </em>v. <em>Bird &amp; Son, </em>399 Mass. 249, 251-252 (1987); <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>389 Mass. 327, 341-343 (1983); <em>Dziokonski </em>v. <em>Babineau, </em>375 Mass. 555, 568 (1978). Cf. <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019 Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 507, 518 (1980) (wife and children who see injured employee at hospital immediately after the accident state a claim). Here the mother did not learn of the harm inflicted on her daughter until many months after the last incident of sexual abuse. The judge, therefore, properly denied the mother recovery on the theory of negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The question of the intentional infliction of emotional distress raises somewhat different considerations. We have placed reckless and intentional infliction of emotional distress in the same category. See <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs, supra </em>at 547; <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 95 (1982). We have not made physical harm an essential element of such a claim. See <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, supra; Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140, 144 (1976). If a defendant intended to inflict emotional distress or knew or should have known that emotional distress was a likely consequence of his conduct, if his conduct was extreme and outrageous (as our cases have defined it, <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>400 Mass. 82,99-100 [1987]), and if his conduct caused the plaintiff severe emotional distress, we would impose liability. See <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, supra; Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., supra </em>at 144-145. The focus of our cases,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and of cases elsewhere, dealing with intentional infliction of emotional distress has been on the emotional distress of a person against whom the extreme and outrageous conduct was directed. Here D\u2019Amato did not intend to cause emotional distress to the mother and Owen. It was his hope that they would never learn of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>his misconduct. Yet it would be a question for the trier of fact whether D\u2019Amato acted recklessly, indifferent to the likely effect of his conduct on family members who would be apt in time to learn of his outrageous conduct. Surely a trier of fact would have been warranted in concluding that D\u2019Amato\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous and that he acted with reckless indifference to the likely effect of his conduct on the mother and on Owen.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The judge did not reach these questions because he concluded that the mother and Owen could not recover because they were not present at the time of D\u2019Amato\u2019s misconduct. The prevailing view among courts which have considered the question is that an absent family member may not recover for severe emotional distress caused by extreme and outrageous conduct directed at another fariiily member. See, e.g., <em>H.L.O. </em>v. <em>Hassle, </em>381 N.W.2d 641,644-645 (Iowa 1986) (parents not present at the time of the defendant\u2019s tortious acts may not recover for emotional distress caused by neighbor\u2019s sexual abuse of their children); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>87 Mich. App. 6, 11 (1978) (plaintiff not present when child was beaten may not recover); <em>Calliariy. Sugar, </em>180N.J. Super. 423,429 (1980) (purchasers of real property may not recover for emotional distress resulting from discovery of body of seller\u2019s wife buried in back yard); <em>Lund </em>v. <em>Caple, </em>100 Wash. 2d 739, 741 (1984) (husband not present when defendant had sexual relations with wife may not recover); W.L. Prosser &amp; W.P. Keeton, Torts \u00a7 12, at 65 (5th ed. 1984).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46(2) (1965), set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> recognizes liability for intentionally or reck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>lessly caused severe emotional distress of a family member who is present when extreme and outrageous conduct is directed at another family member. By a caveat,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Restatement leaves entirely open the possibility in other instances of liability for the intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">As noted above, this court has recognized the possibility of liability for harm caused to a parent who was not present at the time of negligent conduct causing injury to a child. Where the wrongful conduct is intentional or reckless, we might be even less inclined to make a parent\u2019s physical presence an essential element of liability. A custodial parent of a young child sexually abused by a trusted adult neighbor might present a particularly appealing case for not imposing a presence requirement. We do not, however, decide the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Even if the family member\u2019s presence were not a condition of liability, we would normally require both (a) substantially contemporaneous knowledge of the outrageous conduct and (b) a severe emotional response. Neither is present here. Because D\u2019Amato told Nancy not to tell anyone about the incidents and it may be inferred that she was, therefore, afraid to tell her mother about these events for many months, we lay little stress on the absence of substantially contemporaneous knowledge in deciding this issue. It is true, however, that Owen\u2019s knowledge was not shown to be substantially contemporaneous. In any event, his emotional response was not severe. The mother did not learn of D\u2019Amato\u2019s misconduct for approximately one year and, more importantly, although the mother was affected emotionally, there is no finding of severe emotional distress attributable to D\u2019Amato\u2019s conduct, and the evidence would not warrant such a finding. The evidence did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>support recovery for intentionally or recklessly inflicted emotional distress.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Approximately two months after entry of judgment the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the judgment. In that motion, among other things, the mother sought to recover for loss of consortium and for medical expenses incurred in the treatment of her daughter. The motion to amend the judgment was untimely. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 59 (e), 365 Mass. 827 (1974) (\u201cshall be served not later than ten days after entry of the judgment\u201d). A motion for relief from judgment, filed about one month after judgment, made no mention of loss of consortium or medical expenses. In any event, Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), does not list an omission to plead a claim as a reason for relief from judgment. We doubt that a matter that should have been raised by a timely motion to amend the complaint is a \u201creason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment\u201d under rule 60 (b) (6). In any event, even if we were to treat the matter of the two new claims as being properly before the judge on the rule 60 (b) motion, he did not abuse his discretion in declining to grant relief to the mother on these claims. See <em>Schulz </em>v. <em>Black, </em>369 Mass. 958 (1975). The default entered against the defendant on liability did not relate to such claims, and very likely the defendant would have been entitled to a trial as to liability on these claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Defendant\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The defendant challenges the judgment in favor of the victim, arguing that the judge committed reversible error in various evidentiary rulings. There was no such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">a. The judge did not improperly restrict the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of a psychiatrist who testified in part concerning the effect of D\u2019Amato\u2019s conduct on Nancy. The excluded questions sought general information and were not directed to the victim or to the specific facts on this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The judge\u2019s rulings were well within his discretion to limit general or indefinite cross-examination, particularly in a non-jury trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, 367 </em>Mass. 419, 420 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greenberg, 339 </em>Mass. 557, 580 (1959); <em>McGuerty </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>161 Mass. 51, 52(1894) (direct examination). No prejudice resulted, even if exclusion of these questions was error. The witness answered specific questions concerning (a) factors affecting the results of sexual molestation on a child; (b) the impact on children of divorce and of changing schools; and (c) whether the mother\u2019s admitted lesbianism had an effect on her relationship with her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">b. The opinions of the plaintiffs\u2019 psychiatrist were admitted without objection and were never subject to a motion to strike. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s challenge to the admission of those opinions and to the judge\u2019s reliance on them, on the ground that they were in part based on facts not proven on the record, may not properly be presented here. See <em>Freyermuth </em>v. <em>Lutfy, 376 </em>Mass. 612, 616-617 (1978). The witness was permitted to state the information he had received on which he relied in giving his opinions. Those facts were not admitted to prove their truth, and the judge could not properly rely on them in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>making findings. He could, however, as he did, make findings based on the expert\u2019s opinons, which were admitted for their full probative value. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>398 Mass. 535, 543 (1986). We note that the defendant\u2019s appellate counsel was not trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">c. Presumably for tactical reasons, and perhaps because of the default which established the defendant\u2019s liability on any properly pleaded claim, the mother and Nancy did not testify during the plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief. The judge declined to permit the defendant to call them (and two other persons) to testify. At first impression the propriety of that ruling appears to be doubtful, because surely a defendant should be entitled to call the plaintiffs in a case such as this. Here, however, the defendant sought to call these witnesses only to impeach the plaintiffs\u2019 psychiatrist and then only in one respect. In fact the psychiatrist had not made the statement as to which the defendant sought to impeach him. There was nothing, therefore, to impeach through the witnesses the defendant wished to call.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">d. The judge was entitled on his own motion to ask a psychiatric counselor for her opinions concerning the effect of D\u2019Amato\u2019s misconduct on Nancy. The defendant had called her as a witness but had not attempted to qualify her as an expert. The witness\u2019s background warranted the judge\u2019s implied finding of her qualification to give the opinions sought. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>367 Mass. 169, 183 (1975). Her association with Nancy made her a reasonable source for the evidence the judge elicited from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\"> There is a distinction between the negligent infliction of emotional distress, which we discuss here, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress, which we discuss later in the opinion. Many principles applicable to negligent infliction claims are not applicable to intentional infliction claims. See <em>Delia S. </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>134 Cal. App. 3d 471, 483 (1982). Also, there are differences between (a) motor vehicle cases and other typical personal injury cases and (b) sexual abuse cases. See <em>Schurk </em>v. <em>Christensen, </em>80 Wash. 2d 652, 665 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b536-5\"> See <em>Beecy </em>v. <em>Pucciarelli, </em>387 Mass. 589 (1982); <em>Richey </em>v. <em>American Auto.

Language in the court\u2019s opinion treats the husband as a direct victim of the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 482-484. Cf. <em>Molien </em>v. <em>Kaiser Found.
