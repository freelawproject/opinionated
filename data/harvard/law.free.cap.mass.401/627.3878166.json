Callahan, appeals, alleging error in the denial of his motion to suppress statements he made to the police, error in the instructions to the jurors,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1986 ed.), he alleges that there is a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice because (a) the juror selection process is prejudicial; (b) his sentence violates the equal protection principles of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and (c) the practices and procedures of the Commonwealth violate the establishment of religion clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Finally, the defendant asserts that the cumulative effect of all the errors he argues creates a substantial likelihood of a miscar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>riage of justice and that we should either order the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt or grant a new trial. We affirm the conviction. We conclude that there is no reason to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">1. <em>Denial of the motion to suppress. </em>The defendant alleges error in the denial of his motion to suppress a statement made to the police officers at the scene. He claims he was subjected to \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d prior to being given the warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). He also alleges that the judge\u2019s conclusion that the statement was voluntary is erroneous. We conclude there is no merit to either contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">After hearing, the judge made the following findings of fact. As a result of a radio call, two police officers went to a residential structure at 64 Danny Road, Hyde Park. The defendant was standing in the doorway at that address. When he saw the officers, the defendant said, \u201cFollow me.\u201d As the three men were proceeding to an upper floor in the building, the defendant said, \u201cShe\u2019s shot. You\u2019d better get an ambulance.\u201d The three men then entered a bedroom. The victim was on the bed, and \u201cfrom her appearance, [one of the officers] thought she might well be dead.\u201d After checking the victim\u2019s vital signs, the officer asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cShe was going to throw me out, and so I shot her.\u201d The defendant then was arrested and the warnings required by the <em>Miranda </em>case were recited. The defendant acknowledged his apparent understanding of each of the warnings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The judge found that the defendant\u2019s conduct was appropriate, and that he was responsive to questions and to the circumstances in which he found himself. He appeared calm and rational. He did not appear \u201cdeeply depressed in a lay sense of that phrase.\u201d The judge found that the defendant appeared sober with reference to the use of alcohol or chemical agents. The judge determined that the defendant\u2019s conduct had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>appearance of rationality. He concluded that the interrogation was noncustodial and that the statement was freely and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Miranda warnings are only necessary for \u201ccustodial interrogations.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>390 Mass. 729, 736 (1984). The judge could conclude that the defendant was not in custody when the police asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d This simple question, posed to the defendant by the police on discovery of a dead body, \u201cwas a proper preliminary inquiry not requiring Miranda warnings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podlaski, </em>377 Mass. 339, 343 (1979). It was directed to discovering generally what the defendant knew about the circumstances of the victim\u2019s death. See <em>id.; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borodine, </em>371 Mass. 1, 4-5 (1976), cert, denied, 429 U.S. 1049 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 786, 793-794 (1981). Suspicion had not focused on the defendant, and the questioning was neither aggressive nor overbearing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podlaski, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, supra </em>at 738-739. The fact that the police probably would not have allowed the defendant to leave until he talked to them does not by itself make the situation custodial. See <em>id.; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podlaski, supra. </em>Thus, there was no error in the judge\u2019s determination that the defendant was not in custody when the police asked him, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The evidence found credible by the judge also supports his conclusion that the defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary and the product of a rational mind. Testimony was given that the defendant appeared calm and rational, responsive to his surroundings and to the officers, and did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or chemical agents. \u201cWe will not lightly disturb a judge\u2019s determination which is supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>evidence in the record and which is also based on an assessment of the witnesses before him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilborne, </em>382 Mass. 241, 252 (1981). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>389 Mass. 464, 466 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 226 (1980). There is nothing in this record which would require us to disturb the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings and his ultimate conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The defendant contends that the judge was required to reconsider psychiatric testimony, offered later in the trial, in determining whether the admission was the product of a rational mind. We disagree. At the hearing, the judge\u2019s attention was drawn to transcripts of testimony given by psychiatrists at the defendant\u2019s prior two trials. At least two of these psychiatrists were the same experts who later testified in this trial. Based on all the evidence presented at the hearing, the judge could determine that the defendant\u2019s admission was freely and voluntarily made and was the product of a rational intellect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">2. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant assigns four errors in the jury instructions: (a) failure to give a requested instruction on voluntary manslaughter; (b) failure to give an instruction on involuntary manslaughter; (c) shift of the burden of proof on the issues of premeditation and malice; and (d) use of the words \u201cinsanity\u201d and \u201cresponsibility\u201d with regard to the <em>McHoul </em>test of lack of substantial capacity. In assessing the charge, we are mindful that \u201cthe adequacy of instructions must be determined in light of their over-all impact on the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 231-232 (1980). Moreover, because the requested instruction on voluntary manslaughter was the only claim raised at trial, we review the other three pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, solely to determine whether there was a likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. E.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prendergast, </em>385 Mass. 625, 634 (1982). After reviewing the charge as a whole, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>that no instruction on voluntary manslaughter was required, and that the other instructions do not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">a. <em>Voluntary manslaughter. </em>The defendant requested an instruction that \u201c[a] person is guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he commits the act of killing another by reason of a sudden transport of passion or heat of blood which is provoked by a mental disease or mental defect; alcohol or drugs; or any combination of mental disease, mental defect, alcohol and/or [\u00bf7c] drugs.\u201d The instruction does not accurately reflect the law in Massachusetts. \u201cVoluntary manslaughter is \u2018a killing from a sudden transport of passion or heat of blood, upon a reasonable provocation and without malice, or upon sudden combat.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zukoski, </em>370 Mass. 23, 28 (1976), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soaris, </em>275 Mass. 291,299 (1931). \u201cInsults and quarreling alone cannot provide a reasonable provocation.\u201d <em>Zukoski, supra </em>at 28. The evidence reveals that the defendant and the victim argued over money the previous afternoon. The defendant admitted to the police, \u201cShe was going to throw me out, and so I shot her.\u201d This evidence does not support a claim that there was reasonable provocation for killing the victim. No charge to the jury on voluntary manslaughter was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">b. <em>Involuntary manslaughter. </em>No instruction on involuntary manslaughter was warranted because no jury rationally could have found that the shooting was unintentional, wanton, or reckless. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>380 Mass. 724, 730 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santo, </em>375 Mass. 299, 306 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, </em>367 Mass. 743, 747 (1975). The victim was shot three times in the head with a gun found in the bedroom. The gun barrel was bloodied, and a hair was caught between the barrel and the slide. The gun was wrapped in a towel, apparently to muffle the noise of the discharge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Powder bums, gunshot holes, and human hairs were found in the towel. On no view of the evidence could a jury find that the three bullets were discharged into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>the victim\u2019s head unintentionally.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>373 Mass. 478, 491 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">c. <em>Burden of proof. </em>The judge repeatedly instructed the jury that the Commonwealth bore the burden of proving every element of the crime of murder in the first degree beyond a reasonable doubt. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, the judge\u2019s instruction that premeditation \u201cmay occur within a few seconds\u201d was not improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garabedian, </em>399 Mass. 304, 312 (1987), and cases cited. The judge properly qualified this statement with instructions that deliberate premeditation \u201cexcludes action which is taken so spontaneously that there is no time to think,\u201d and that the jury could consider evidence of alcohol usage, as well as mental illness, in determining whether the Commonwealth proved the defendant was capable of deliberate premeditation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>380 Mass. 672, 680-683 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The judge\u2019s instruction on malice also was correct. The judge told the jurors that \u201cmalice may be inferred from the intentional use of a deadly weapon, such as a pistol, but you do not have to, of course, make such an inference. Whether you feel that such an inference [in the] particular circumstances is reasonable and that you wish to draw it, is your conclusion and your prerogative, and nobody else\u2019s.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>391 Mass. 853, 859-861 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stillwell, </em>387 Mass. 730, 733 (1982). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>375 Mass. 308, 312 (1978), and cases cited. The burden of proof was not shifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">d. <em>McHoul defense. </em>There is no dispute that the judge specifically and repeatedly instructed the jurors that \u201c[a] person is not responsible for criminal conduct if, at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality or wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>fulness of his conduct, or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1967). Such instructions clearly were correct. <em>Id. </em>The defendant concedes that these instructions were correct, but objects to the judge\u2019s use of the words \u201cresponsibility\u201d and \u201cinsanity\u201d in other portions of the charge; he suggests that the occasional use of these words confused the jury as to the test for criminal responsibility under <em>McHoul.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>After reviewing the instructions in their entirety, we conclude that reasonable jurors only could have understood the judge\u2019s charge as a whole to require the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed substantial capacity as defined in <em>McHoul. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moreira, </em>385 Mass. 792, 796 (1982). Thus, there was no likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">3. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant challenges two essential portions of trial counsel\u2019s closing argument, alleging that counsel failed to argue adequately the <em>McHoul </em>defense and conceded premeditation and malice. \u201cIn assessing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we must appraise \u2018the specific circumstances of the given case to see whether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer \u2014 and, if that is found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>398 Mass. 561, 568 (1986). \u201cWhen the arguably reasoned tactical or strategic judgments of a lawyer are called into question, we do not \u2018second guess competent lawyers working hard for defendants who turn on them when the jury happen to find their clients guilty.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>366 Mass. 506, 517 (1974). Instead, we require that such judgments be \u2018manifestly unreasonable\u2019 <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>[374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978)]), and this typically means loss of \u2018an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass. 408, 413 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>394 Mass. 251, 256 (1985).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Trial counsel in this case forcefully presented the theory that the defendant was unable to control his conduct on the night of the killing and thus was not responsible for his actions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, supra. </em>Counsel recounted the evidence of the defendant\u2019s long history of manic-depressive mental illness, his medication, his consumption of alcohol which exacerbates his condition, the stress he was under, his history of suicide attempts, and the fact that he neither fled nor tried to conceal the killing. Counsel marshaled the facts in favor of the defense of lack of substantial capacity and conveyed clearly to the jury the essential factors to be considered under McHoul.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Counsel is not required, as the defendant suggests, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>to use the specific language of the <em>McHoul </em>test. The decision to argue the facts supporting the <em>McHoul </em>defense was not \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, supra. </em>This clearly is not a case in which counsel \u201cwithdr[ew] from the jury . . . consideration of the issue of criminal responsibility,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Westmoreland, </em>388 Mass. 269, 273 (1983), or \u201cleft his client denuded of [that] defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Street, </em>388 Mass. 281, 287 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The record also provides no support for the defendant\u2019s contention that trial counsel conceded premeditation and malice. Counsel argued to the jury that to find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree they had to find deliberate premeditation and malice aforethought. He contended that there was insufficient evidence of first degree murder, and urged the jury to return a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. The thrust of the defendant\u2019s complaint is that counsel did not argue sufficiently the difference between murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. Counsel\u2019s decision to marshal the evidence supporting the <em>McHoul </em>defense and leave the discussion of the law to the judge was not \u201cmanifestly unreasonable,\u201d and did not \u201cdenude\u201d the defendant of a defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Street, supra </em>at 284; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Westmoreland, supra </em>at 272-274.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>4. <em>Claims Pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">a. <em>Jury selection. </em>The defendant alleges that the notice of juror qualification requirements, mailed to prospective jurors pursuant to G. L. c. 234A (1986 ed.), prejudiced the sitting jurors because the notification form (i) defines mental disability from jury duty differently from the <em>McHoul </em>test; (ii) disqualifies from jury duty defendants in criminal cases, persons in custody, and persons suffering from \u201cmental disability\u201d; and (iii) allows accredited Christian Science practitioners to verify a person\u2019s physical or mental disability from jury duty. From these facts, the defendant concludes that the jurors who heard the case may have been unable to follow the judge\u2019s concededly correct instructions on the <em>McHoul </em>defense. \u201c[T]he notion that such a notice to potential jurors would so prejudice them against [a defense of lack of criminal responsibility] ... is unfounded.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acen, </em>396 Mass. 472, 482, appeal dismissed, 476 U.S. 1155 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">After filing this appeal, the defendant, who is indigent, requested funds to conduct a study to prove that the notification form prejudices jurors against the <em>McHoul </em>defense. The single justice denied the request as untimely, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>392 Mass. 493,498 (1984). We agree that the defendant\u2019s request comes too late. Even a timely request would not have entitled the defendant to these funds, because the proposed study is not \u201creasonably necessary to assure the applicant as effective a . . . defense or appeal as he would have if he were financially able to pay.\u201d G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27C (4) (1986 ed.). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockley, </em>381 Mass. 156, 160 (1980). The defendant\u2019s request is totally lacking in merit. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">b. <em>Equal protection. </em>There is no record support for the defendant\u2019s assertion that men convicted of murder in the first degree receive longer sentences than women convicted of murder in the first degree. The sentence for this crime is life imprisonment without parole. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2 (1986 ed.). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>This sentence is mandatory. The statute is gender neutral. There is no violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, or art. 1 or art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">c. <em>Establishment of religion. </em>The defendant contends that the words \u201cin the year of our Lord\u201d in the indictment form and the words \u201cso help me God\u201d in the oaths administered to the jurors and witnesses established the Christian religion at his trial in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Massachusetts Constitution, and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Nothing in the record remotely suggests any prejudice, much less a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. Even if the defendant has standing,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> his claim lacks merit. The words \u201cin the year of our Lord\u201d in the indictment form and \u201cso help me God\u201d in the oaths do not constitute an establishment of religion. They are simply two examples of many permissible, secular \u201creferences to the Almighty that run through our laws, our public rituals, [and] our ceremonies.\u201d <em>Colo </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>378 Mass. 550, 561 (1979), quoting <em>Zorach </em>v. <em>Clauson, </em>343 U.S. 306, 312-313 (1952). <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>465 U.S. 668, 675-677 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">5. <em>Cumulative effect. </em>The defendant asserts that the cumulative effect of his claims of error requires a conclusion that a miscarriage of justice occurred. We do not agree. We have reviewed the record and conclude that there is no reason for us to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-10\"> The defendant has been convicted of murder in the first degree three times for the same offense. The first two convictions were reversed by this court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>380 Mass. 821 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>386 Mass. 784 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-11\"> The defendant challenges several instructions for the first time on appeal. The standard of review of these instructions is whether they created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>infra </em>at 631.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\"> Thereafter a general conversation took place in which the defendant discussed his education, which was extensive. The admission of this conversation is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\"> The defendant suggests that the judge\u2019s findings are unreliable because of his comment that, prior to the defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cthe police officers had no reason to believe that in fact a crime had been committed.\u201d While we agree that this comment may overstate the situation, the judge also found \u201cit was not apparent [prior to the statement] that the defendant had engaged in any criminal activity.\u201d The latter finding clearly is warranted and supports the conclusion that the question \u201cWhat happened?\u201d was asked in a noncustodial setting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\"> Under the humane practice, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>338 Mass. 460, 461-462 (1959), the judge properly submitted to the jury the question of the effect of the defendant\u2019s mental state on the voluntariness of his admission. The jury, therefore, could consider what weight to give to the psychiatric testimony offered at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\"> The victim\u2019s daughter was asleep in the house and was not awakened by gunshots.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\"> The defendant argues that the presence of a fourth cartridge in the bedroom is evidence that the defendant engaged in a wanton shooting spree. We disagree. The fourth casing indicates only that the police failed to find the fourth bullet; it does not detract at all from the clear evidence that the defendant shot the victim in the head at extremely close range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b650-5\"> The defendant also objects to occasional use by the prosecutor and trial counsel of the same terms. There is no merit in this objection. The correct <em>McHoul </em>standard was stated several times during the trial. Any possible misunderstanding was corrected adequately by the judge\u2019s concededly correct instructions on the law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Szczuka, </em>391 Mass. 666, 673-674 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>386 Mass. 593, 605-606 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\"> The defendant objects on appeal that the judge altered the <em>McHoul </em>test by asking prospective jurors before trial whether they could make an impartial decision \u201c[i]f criminal responsibility, or the lack of it, becomes an issue in this trial,\u201d and whether they could consider impartially the testimony of psychiatrists. Having requested these questions, the defendant cannot complain on appeal that he was prejudiced by them. See <em>Lannon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 786, 792-793 (1980). Nevertheless, we conclude that the questions were proper; they were \u201cdirected at discovering bias against the defense of lack of criminal responsibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prendergast, </em>385 Mass. 625, 628 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\"> The defendant bases his claim of ineffective assistance on Federal, as well as State, constitutional grounds. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). We have noted that, \u201cif the <em>Saferian </em>test is met, the Federal test is necessarily met as well.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>394 Mass. 251, 256 n.3 (1985). While \u201cleaving] open the question of what differences, if any, exist between the two standards,\u201d <em>id., </em>we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim fails irrespective of the standard employed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b651-11\"> We disagree with the defendant\u2019s assertion that counsel was ineffective for failing to discuss the \u201cbreakthrough phenomenon\u201d in manic-depressive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>illness. Counsel clearly conveyed a theory that the defendant was out of control at the time of the killing. The facts regarding the defendant\u2019s mental illness were fully before the jury. \u201cThus, it is not clear that \u2018better work might have acomplished something material for the defense. \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>390 Mass. 729,752 (1984). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977). Nor, as the defendant asserts, was counsel ineffective for failing to introduce evidence that the defendant allegedly did not know of his own divorce. There is no evidence that the defendant did not know he was divorced, that such lack of knowledge indicated delusion or that trial counsel was aware of any such lack of knowledge. Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 44, 55-56 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b652-6\"> The defendant contends that counsel\u2019s comment that the defendant \u201cbrooded\u201d on the evening of the killing was prejudicial because it implied rational contemplation of the crime. We disagree. Read in context, counsel\u2019s comment used that fact to emphasize how upset, confused, and perhaps suicidal the defendant was.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\"> We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that counsel was ineffective for failing to comment in closing argument on the defendant\u2019s admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>to the police. Counsel presented a theory that the defendant was out of control on the night of the killing, and it was a reasonable tactical decision not to highlight the defendant\u2019s damaging statement in reconstructing the scene. A decision not to \u201cfight the facts\u201d is a reasonable tactical decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\"> Without deciding the issue, we question seriously whether the defendant has standing. He does not allege that he is non-Christian. He also fails to allege any \u201cinjury in fact\u201d which is \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to the alleged constitutional violation. <em>Valley Forge Christian College </em>v. <em>Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc., </em>454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982). \u201cThe injury alleged must be . . . \u2018distinct and palpable\u2019 . . . and not \u2018abstract\u2019 or \u2018conjectural\u2019 or \u2018hypothetical\u2019 . . .\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737,751 (1984). The defendant suggests only that certain passages in the Christian Bible might be construed as inconsistent with the law as expressed in <em>McHoul, </em>and asserts that the jurors therefore may have been prejudiced against the <em>McHoul </em>defense. This theory of prejudice is entirely conjectural. It finds no support in the record or in logic.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
