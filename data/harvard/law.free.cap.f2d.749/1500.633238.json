Allgood, U.S. District Judge, Northern District of Alabama, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1576-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1576-23\">The claimant, Betty J. McAulay, appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the Secretary\u2019s termination of disability benefits. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-24\">McAulay was awarded disability insurance benefits in 1972 due to status post laminectomy. McAulay\u2019s condition was reevaluated in 1981 by the Social Security Administration which determined that she was no longer disabled and terminated her benefits. The claimant requested and received a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (AU) who found that she was no longer disabled. The Appeals Council denied review. The district court affirmed the Secretary\u2019s termination of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-25\">This court has held that there can be no termination of benefits unless there is substantial evidence of improvement to the point of no disability. <em>Simpson v. Schweiker, </em>691 F.2d 966, 969 (11th Cir.1982). Additionally, this court has held that a comparison of the original medical evidence and the new medical evidence is necessary to make a finding of improvement. <em>Vaughn v. Heckler, </em>727 F.2d 1040, 1043 (11th Cir.1984). While the original medical records are referred to by the AU, no comparison was made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-26\">The ALJ based his opinion primarily upon reports by Dr. Rosomoff, the claimant\u2019s treating physician, which indicate that the claimant had improved. While it is true that these reports demonstrate that the claimant\u2019s condition has improved over time (and over the course of six major spinal operations), they do not reflect improvement to the point of no disability. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>the contrary, the claimant continues to suffer pain and to require \u201ctrigger injections\u201d to alleviate pain. Moreover, the ALJ totally discounted the medical report of Dr. Robert Martinez, the government\u2019s own consulting physician, which stated that the claimant is totally disabled. In a deposition taken by the claimant\u2019s attorney, Dr. Martinez\u2019s responses show unequivocably that the claimant has a listed impairment pursuant to 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1, \u00a7 1.05(C). The medical evidence supporting Dr. Martinez\u2019s responses is not contradicted in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-4\">Because the AU failed to properly address the issue of improvement and the medical evidence does not indicate improvement to the point of no disability, the resulting determination that McAulay is not disabled is insufficient to satisfy the Secretary\u2019s burden under <em>Simpson, supra. </em>The termination of McAulay\u2019s benefits was therefore improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-5\">The decision of the district court affirming the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s ruling is hereby reversed and the improper termination of McAulay\u2019s benefits vacated. On remand, the district court shall enter a judgment in favor of the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
