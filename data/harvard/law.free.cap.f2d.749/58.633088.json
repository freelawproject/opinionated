The FBI justified the withholding under FOIA Exemption 7(D), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(D). The case raises issues of the meaning in Exemption 7(D) of the phrase \u201cconfidential information furnished only by [a] confidential source\u201d; the showing that must be made to establish that a document is, within the meaning of that exemption, a \u201crecord compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation\u201d; and qualification under that provision of an authorized federal investigation into a state crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">On October 24, 1979, J. Gary Shaw made a formal request to the FBI under FOIA for copies of photographs of participants in an event called the Quebec-Washington-Guantanamo Walk for Peace. The photographs are attached to an FBI memorandum dealing with allegations that Lee Harvey Oswald was in Montreal during the summer of 1963. The Bureau denied Shaw\u2019s request on grounds that the information was classified pursuant to Executive Order No. 12,065 and therefore privileged from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 1, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(1). Shaw took an administrative appeal, and the Department of Justice affirmed the denial on March 31, 1980. In October 1981 the photographs were declassified in connection with the administrative appeal of another requester, but were not disclosed to Shaw. On March 16, 1982, Shaw sued to compel production, under FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B), in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The FBI moved for summary judgment on grounds that although the photographs were no longer classified they were properly withheld under FOIA Exemption 7(D), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-19\">On January 13, 1983, after an in camera inspection of the relevant records, the District Court issued an Order with accompanying Memorandum denying summary judgment and requiring the FBI to disclose the photographs on grounds that it had failed to show they were obtained in the course of a criminal investigation. On November 9, 1983, after examining a supplemental affidavit submitted by the FBI in support of its motion for reconsideration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the court issued an Order denying the motion, on grounds that although the supplemental affidavit might be sufficient to establish that the photographs were obtained in the course of a criminal investigation, they did not constitute confidential information. The FBI has appealed to this court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Exemption 7(D) reads in its totality as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">[This section does not apply to matters that are \u2014 ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">(7) investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would ... (D) disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7). The judicial review provisions of the FOIA provide that \u201cthe burden is on the agency to sustain its action,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B), which of course includes establishing the availability of an exemption from disclosure, <em>see, e.g., Exxon Corp. v. FTC, </em>663 F.2d 120, 127 (D.C.Cir.1980). It is uncontested that burden was met here except in the respects discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">We turn first to the District Court\u2019s holding that the photographs do not constitute \u201cconfidential information\u201d within the meaning of this provision. This appears to rest primarily on grounds that photographs taken outdoors of individuals participating in a public demonstration cannot constitute confidential information but are by their very nature public. <em>Shaw v. FBI, </em>Civil No. 82-0756, Order at 2 (D.D.C. Nov. 9, 1983) (\u201cOrder\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">\u201cNonpublic\u201d or \u201csecret\u201d is certainly one of the meanings that the word \u201cconfidential\u201d may bear. But it may also mean \u201cprovided in <em>confidence\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., provided with the assurance that it will not be disclosed to others. Even if the former meaning were accepted here, we would have some doubt whether the District Court\u2019s decision could be sustained, since the mere fact that an event occurred in public does not make it \u201cpublic\u201d in the relevant sense of \u201cgenerally known\u201d \u2014 as the composition of the Quebec-Washington-Guantanamo Walk for Peace evidently is not. In any case, \u201csecret\u201d is not the relevant meaning here. The purpose of the confidential information exemption is to prevent the FOIA from causing the \u201cdrying up\u201d of sources of information in criminal investigations. <em>See </em>120 Cong.Rec. 17,036-37 (1974) (statement of Sen. Hruska, ranking minority member of Senate Judiciary Committee, criticizing earlier version of 1974 amendment to Exemption 7 which did not contain \u201cconfidential information\u201d exemption on grounds that it would lead to drying up of FBI\u2019s sources). That purpose will not be achieved unless the person providing information under the assurance that it will not be disclosed can rely upon the fact that his disclosure will not result in further publication. He may have many reasons for desiring that result \u2014 the most common of which may be that he does not want to have to rely upon the agency\u2019s or the courts\u2019 judgment that disclosure will not reveal his identity (which is of course the basis for a separate exemption \u2014 the first clause of Exemption 7(D), which excuses the production of information that would \u201cdisclose the identity of a confidential source,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(D)). As we have recently held, therefore, \u201cthe availability of Exemption 7(D) depends not upon the factual contents of the document sought, but upon whether the <em>source </em>was confidential and the information was compiled during a criminal investigation.\u201d <em>Weisberg v. United States Department of Justice, </em>745 F.2d 1476, 1492 (D.C.Cir.1984). <em>Accord, Lesar v. United States Department of Justice, </em>636 F.2d 472, 492 (D.C.Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">The District Court also supported its conclusion on grounds that the source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>of the information could not be deduced by examining the photos. Order at 2. This disregards the structure of Exemption 7(D), which establishes two separate categories of exemption: (1) information that would \u201cdisclose the identity of a confidential source,\u201d and (2) information that would \u201cdisclose ... confidential information furnished only by the confidential source.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(D). Requiring the second category to come within the first as well would render it entirely redundant. It is irrelevant to the second inquiry whether the information would reveal the identity of the source. <em>See Duffin v. Carlson, </em>636 F.2d 709, 712-13 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>Radowich v. United States Attorney, </em>658 F.2d 957, 959, 962-64 (4th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Finally, the District Court appears to have considered that because the information in dispute involves photographs of a public act which might have been taken by any number of people, the information could not be said to have been \u201c \u2018furnished only\u2019 by the [confidential] source,\u201d as the exemption requires. Order at 2. Even if we reject the explicit holding of the Fourth Circuit, <em>see Radowich, </em>and the clear implication of dicta in this circuit, <em>see </em>the passages from <em>Weisberg </em>and <em>Lesar </em>cited <em>supra, </em>that \u201cinformation furnished only by the confidential source\u201d means \u201conly that information which is furnished by the confidential source,\u201d this analysis would still be flawed. Whatever the phrase \u201cfurnished only by the confidential source\u201d may mean, it assuredly cannot mean \u201cobtainable only from the confidential source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Shaw further argues on this appeal that the photographs are not privileged because their source was not a confidential one. He does not dispute that they were furnished to the FBI by a nonfederal law enforcement agency which advised the FBI that it desired to have the information and the fact of its cooperation kept confidential. Nor is it possible to deny that foreign and local law enforcement agencies can qualify as confidential sources for purposes of Exemption 7. <em>See Weisberg, </em>745 F.2d at 1491-92; <em>Lesar, </em>636 F.2d at 489-91. Shaw asserts, however, that the FBI has frequently revealed other information received from the same source at issue here \u2014 which he identifies, on the basis of more or less educated guesses, as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. This, he says, means that the source is not confidential. Even accepting Shaw\u2019s speculations as true, they do not lead to the desired conclusion. Disclosure of one piece of information received from a particular party \u2014 and even the disclosure of that party as its source \u2014 does not prevent that party from being a \u201cconfidential source\u201d for other purposes. If that were so, all those who ever wish to protect their identity as sources would have to deal with federal law enforcement agencies either <em>always </em>on a confidential basis or else not at all. The former recourse would produce a needless restriction of information quite at odds with the main purpose of the FOIA; the latter a needless drying up of sources quite at odds with the purpose of the exemption. Indeed, even if the Bureau\u2019s earlier disclosures of information received from the RCMP were disclosures of information originally received with an assurance of confidence (something Shaw made no attempt to establish) it is impossible to see why either the Bureau\u2019s or the RCMP\u2019s willingness to eliminate the secrecy with regard to other items of information would have any bearing upon the availability of secrecy for this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">To qualify under Exemption 7 of the FOIA at all, documents must meet the threshold test of being \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7). When, however, the confidential information provision of the exemption (the second half of clause D) is invoked, the documents must in addition constitute a \u201crecord compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation.\u201d The Bureau asserted that the photographs were ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>tained in the course of a criminal investigation, but the District Court, since it believed that they did not in any event constitute confidential information, did not decide the issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The point has, however, been briefed and argued by the parties here. Since there are no disputed facts, it would be futile to remand the issue to the District Court and we proceed to its resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The showing an agency must make to establish the applicability of this portion of Exemption 7(D) appears to be a question of first impression. Several courts, however, including this one, have considered the showing necessary to meet the Exemption 7(D) threshold of demonstrating that records are \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes,\u201d and nothing in the text of the statute or its legislative history contradicts the logical assumption that the nature of the two showings (though not, of course, their content) is the same. In <em>Pratt v. Webster, </em>673 F.2d 408, 420 (D.C.Cir.1982), we stated that in order to establish that an investigation is \u201crelated to the enforcement of federal laws or to the maintenance of national security,\u201d the agency must \u201cidentify [1] a particular individual or a particular incident as the object of its investigation and [2] the connection between that individual or incident and a possible security risk or violation of federal law.\u201d We made it clear that the latter, which is the equivalent of what is at issue here, does not require direct evidence of subjective intent, but rather only a showing that \u201cthe nexus between the investigation and one of the agency\u2019s law enforcement duties [is] based on information sufficient to support at least a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of its rationality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421. That showing unquestionably was made here, with respect to the more specific law enforcement duty of investigating violation of a federal criminal law. The Bureau has cited several statutes whose violation could reasonably have been thought evidenced by the assassination, including those punishing rebellion or insurrection, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2383 (1982), seditious conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2384, and advocating the overthrow of the government, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2385.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If there is ever a \u201ccolorable claim of rationality\u201d for looking into a possible violation of the seditious conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2384, surely it arises when the President has been assassinated.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">That, however, is not an end of the matter. Obviously, the mere existence of a plausible criminal investigatory reason to investigate would not protect the files of an inquiry explicitly conducted, for example, for purposes of harassment. An objective \u201cnexus\u201d of the sort just described suffices to establish the exemption only if it is unrefuted by persuasive evidence that in fact another, nonqualifying reason prompted the investigation. In other words, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>shifts the burden of production to the plaintiff. In the present case, the plaintiff produced the following sworn testimony of then FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover before the Warren Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">When President Johnson returned to Washington he communicated with me within the first 24 hours, and asked the Bureau to pick up the investigation of the assassination because as you are aware, there is no Federal jurisdiction for such an investigation. It is not a Federal crime to kill or attack the President</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">However, the President has a right to request the Bureau to make special investigations, and in this instance he asked that this investigation be made. I immediately assigned a special force headed by the special agent in charge at Dallas, Tex., to initiate the investigation, and to get all details and facts concerning it, which he obtained, and then prepared a report which we submitted to the Attorney General for transmission to the President.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\"><em>Hearings Before the President\u2019s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, </em>Vol. V at 98 (1964). This clearly establishes that Director Hoover did not have investigation of a federal crime in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">We do not think, however, that the crime which makes the inquiry a \u201ccriminal investigation\u201d for purposes of the exemption need be a crime under federal law. That limitation is neither explicit in the language of the exemption nor reasonably related to its principal purpose. Where, for a federally authorized purpose, a federal criminal investigatory agency has opened an inquiry into a crime perpetrated under the law of another jurisdiction, there seems to us no reason why confidential information would be considered any less deserving of protection. Whether the purpose of the prophylactic exemption is to preclude inadvertent disclosure of the identity of informants where lives may be at risk&gt; or merely to encourage their provision of information they do not wish made public for some other reason, it is impossible to imagine why Congress would think the purpose less necessary when state crimes (which include the vast majority of violent crimes such as murder) are at issue. The only argument for the limiting interpretation, then, is that Congress\u2019s exclusive objective in the exemption was to facilitate federal agency investigation of <em>federal </em>crimes\u2014 and not of state crimes, even when the latter were being investigated for an authorized and needful federal purpose. This seems to us such an unlikely intent that we are unwilling to posit it in absence of clear indication in the legislative history. That does not exist here \u2014 in fact, as far as we can ascertain the legislative history nowhere distinguishes between investigation of federal crimes and investigation of other crimes. Since the statutory language literally covers such state-crime investigations; and since, as the present case eminently demonstrates, there is little reason why the purpose of the provision would not extend to them; we hold that an authorized federal investigation into the commission of state crime qualifies for the second half of Exemption 7(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Our conclusion is reinforced by the fact that there is no more reason to interpret the phrase \u201ccriminal investigation\u201d in the last half of Exemption 7(D) as limited to investigation of federal crimes, than there is to interpret the phrase \u201claw enforcement purposes\u201d in the prologue of Exemption 7 as limited to federal law enforcement. While many of the cases dealing with this provision assume without analysis that it refers to \u201cthe enforcement of federal laws,\u201d <em>Pratt v. Webster, </em>673 F.2d at 420; <em>see also, e.g., Church of Scientology v. Department of Defense, </em>611 F.2d 738, 748 (9th Cir.1979), in the one case in which the issue was squarely presented this court held, <em>en banc, </em>to the contrary. In <em>Weisberg v. Department of Justice, </em>489 F.2d 1195, 1198 (D.C.Cir.1973) <em>(en banc), </em>we held that the Exemption 7 phrase \u201claw enforcement purposes\u201d covers the Oswald investigation here at issue, which \u201ccontemplated collaboration with Texas authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>by agents of the Secret Service and of the Federal Bureau of Investigation looking to the early apprehension and ultimately the conviction of whoever murdered President Kennedy.\u201d After considering the statement by Director Hoover set forth above, and without reference to any applicable federal law that could have been the subject of the \u201cenforcement,\u201d we rejected the argument that the exemption was inapplicable because \u201cthe State of Texas but not the United States \u2018had jurisdiction over the crime,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 1197, and we \u201cdeem[ed] it demonstrated beyond peradventure that the Department\u2019s files ... were compiled for law enforcement purposes,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1198. That holding not only governs here on the precise issue of the applicability of the prologue of Exemption 7,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but also establishes the broader principle which we have applied to the second half of Exemption 7(D), that the exemption treats authorized federal investigations into violations of federal law and of state law on a par. That being so, even if we assume that Director Hoover\u2019s testimony destroyed the effect of the requisite objective \u201cnexus\u201d with federal criminal statutes that the Bureau here established, it only replaced that nexus with other evidence that the inquiry qualified for the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">We note that our holding today does not give carte blanche to federal agencies to investigate state crimes, or extend the protection of Exemption 7(D) to the product of <em>ultra vires </em>investigations. Accepting Director Hoover\u2019s statement as establishing the absence of any purpose to investigate a federal crime, what is at issue here was nonetheless \u2014 on the basis of the objective criteria we discussed above \u2014 an authorized federal investigation: directed toward the murder of a President, ordered by that President\u2019s successor, and placed within the charge of an agency with statutory authority to conduct investigations that \u201cassist in the protection of the person of the President,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 533 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">For the reasons stated, the order of the District Court directing the FBI to disclose the photos is</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\">. As indicated in our statement of the facts, in the Memorandum Opinion accompanying its Order of January 13, 1983 the court found that the existence of a criminal investigation had not been established. <em>Id. </em>at 2. Its final Order of November 9, 1983, however, stated that \"[a] supplemental affidavit executed by Special Agent John Phillips and filed with the government\u2019s motion for reconsideration may suffice to establish that the photographs were obtained in the course of a criminal investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. We reject appellee\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s earlier holding on the point subsisted as a basis for its judgment. Even if it did, we would not apply the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard appellee urges upon us, since \u2014 as our subsequent discussion of the applicable test will show \u2014 if the facts that would justify a criminal investigation are uncontested (in this case, Oswald's suspected assassination of President Kennedy) and if no concrete evidence of pretext is introduced, the issue becomes one of law rather than fact and thus reviewable <em>de novo </em>on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-12\">. In addition to citing the statutes, the Bureau produced an affidavit affirming that \"[t]he investigations were conducted to determine if activities of the subject of the file were in violation of one or more of [those] statutes,\u201d Affidavit of John N. Phillips at 6; <em>see also </em>Declaration of John N. Phillips at 1. In addition to being superfluous \u2014 since as we have described, subjective intent need not initially be established\u2014 this affidavit was ineffective for the desired purpose. Since the affiant was only a supervisor of the Records Management Division of the Bureau\u2019s Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts Section, and did not claim any personal participation in the investigation, his assertion cannot be assumed to have been made upon personal knowledge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-17\">. <em>Weisberg </em>was decided before the 1974 amendments to the FOIA which limited the scope of Exemption 7 to the categories now set forth in subparagraphs (A)-(F). The prologue, however, remained unchanged in text and in meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
