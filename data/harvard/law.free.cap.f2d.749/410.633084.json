MHA owns and operates the Concourse Hotel in Madison, Wisconsin. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>On December 11, 1972, MHA entered into a loan agreement with the Citizens Mortgage Investment Trust (\u201cCMIT\u201d) to finance the construction and operation of the Concourse Hotel. Pursuant to the terms of that agreement, CMIT advanced funds to MHA for construction of the hotel. In return, CMIT received a promissory note obligating MHA to repay the principal amount of the loan and interest accrued thereon. CMIT secured its loan with a first mortgage and a first security interest in MHA\u2019s realty, and, in the event of default, an \u201cassignment of rentals\u201d accruing from such property. The parties agreed that CMIT would finance only the construction costs and upon completion of the hotel, the promissory note, along with all of CMIT\u2019s security interests, would be assigned to Prudential who would, in turn, pay the outstanding balance of the CMIT loan and provide MHA with permanent financing for hotel operations. On September 9, 1974, CMIT assigned to Prudential the promissory note, in the amount of $7,000,000, the first mortgage and the first security interest in MHA\u2019s realty, and the \u201cassignment of rentals.\u201d Thereafter, under the terms of the Prudential financing agreement, MHA was obligated to pay Prudential monthly installments of principal and interest in the amount of $59,360.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Shortly after opening in the summer of 1974, the Concourse Hotel began to experience operating problems and to generate a negative cash flow. As a result, early in 1976 MHA began defaulting on the payment of its monthly loan installments to Prudential. On October 16, 1978, Prudential issued a notice of default and acceleration of the amount due. Both the promissory note and the first mortgage provided that in the event of default, the mortgagee (Prudential) could immediately accelerate the entire balance due and payable, including principal, accrued and unpaid interest, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Some three-and-one-half months later, on February 1, 1979, Prudential commenced a foreclosure action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, seeking collection, under Wisconsin law, of the entire accelerated amount due from MHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">In the meantime, the record reveals that in May 1976, the general partners of MHA, Darrell Wild and Wild, Inc., had filed a lawsuit in Wisconsin state court alleging that the interest rates charged by Prudential (9\u215b per annum) were usurious in violation of Wis.Stat. \u00a7 138.05.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On July 20, 1978, the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, granted summary judgment for Prudential ruling that there existed no issues of material fact and that, as a matter of law, the interest rates did not violate Wis.Stat. \u00a7 138.05. On February 26, 1980, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment, reasoning that the corporate exception to the usury laws applied to the MHA limited partnership. <em>Wild, Inc. v. Citizens Mortgage Inv. Trust, </em>95 Wis.2d 430, 431-32, 290 N.W.2d 567, 568-69 (Wis.Ct.App.1980). The Federal district court reserved final disposition of Prudential\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>foreclosure action until the Wisconsin state courts had resolved the usury issue. However, the record reveals that on February 11, 1980, some two weeks before the Wisconsin Court of Appeals issued its decision, the district court approved a stipulation between MHA and Prudential. Pursuant to the terms of that stipulation, the parties established an escrow account into which MHA paid the amount of principal and interest due Prudential under the promissory note and first mortgage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is undisputed that MHA has continued to make regular monthly payments into this escrow account, and as of August 1, 1983, MHA had paid some $4,888,581.17 into the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">On August 17, 1981, Judge Crabb of the Federal district court considered the parties\u2019 legal and equitable arguments on the foreclosure issue, reviewed the applicable Wisconsin state law of foreclosure, <em>see </em>Wis.Stat. \u00a7 846.01 <em>et seq. </em>(1981-82), and granted Prudential\u2019s summary judgment motion to foreclose on the MHA mortgage. According to the court, \u201c[o]n the present record the equities are with [Prudential] who [has] been subjected to years of protracted litigation pursued by [MHA] ... in an obvious effort to extend [its] low cost use of the loan funds ....\u201d The court ruled that \u201cbecause of the continuous and current default in the First Note, First Mortgage, and Security Agreement, [Prudential] may foreclose the First Mortgage by judicial proceeding under the terms of the mortgage and sell the collateral of the Security Agreement.\u201d Moreover, the court ordered that Prudential \u201cmay have until August 24, 1981, in which to submit a form of judgment of foreclosure and sale of the realty described in the First Mortgage and the collateral described in the Security Agreement, to be entered by the court.\u201d On August 24, 1981, before Prudential filed its judgment of foreclosure with the district court, MHA filed a Chapter 11 petition for reorganization in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. The effect of MHA\u2019s Chapter 11 petition was to stay the foreclosure proceeding, <em>see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a) (1982), transfer it to the bankruptcy court, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1478 (1982), and thereby preclude Prudential from obtaining a final judgment of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">Some four months later, on December 22, 1981, MHA filed its proposed plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy court. On that same day, the bankruptcy court conducted a hearing to address claims by CMIT and Prudential that the court should abstain from considering MHA\u2019s Chapter 11 petition for reorganization, <em>see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 305(a)(1) (1982),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or, in the alternative, dismiss the entire case, <em>see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b) (1982).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following the evidentia-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ry hearing, the court ruled that \u201c[t]his case is not appropriate for abstention. There are claims which exist which are not and nor can be better protected in another court. I\u2019m satisfied with the debtor as a person which may have relief under Chapter 11.\u201d The bankruptcy court added that under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b), \u201cthere are various categories suggested as a basis for dismissal. None of those specific suggested categories fits the case nor has it been contended that it does.\u201d Nonetheless, CMIT and Prudential argued that \u201cthere is available an additional category which would be an absence of good faith.\u201d The bankruptcy court judge responded, \u201cI\u2019m satisfied that <em>there has been sufficient efforts to reorganize undertaken by the debtor to rebut any contention that there would be a lack of good faith in the initial filing of the Chapter 11. </em>As I indicated before, the debtor is an appropriate entity for relief under Chapter 11.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Throughout the pendency of the Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding, the stay remained in effect upon Prudential\u2019s foreclosure action in the district court. Prudential continued to seek relief from the stay in order that it could obtain a judgment of foreclosure on MHA\u2019s realty. Prudential claimed that it \u201cwould be delayed in the event the chapter 11 case were dismissed if it was not permitted during the chapter 11 proceeding to enter its foreclosure judgment against Madison Hotel Associates and commence the period for equity of redemption allowed by Wisconsin law.\u201d <em>In re Madison Hotel Associates, </em>18 B.R. 218, 219 (Bankr.W.D.Wis.1982). On March 5, 1982, the bankruptcy court ruled that Prudential lacked the \u201ccause\u201d required under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d)(1) to obtain relief from the stay. According to the court, \u201cthe occurrence of delay is speculative upon the failure of the debtor\u2019s effort to reorganize under chapter 11. If those efforts are successful, Prudential will incur neither delay nor economic loss. Even if those efforts are unsuccessful, there is no contention that Prudential will incur unprotected or uncompensated economic injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219. <em>See also In re Madison Hotel Associates, </em>31 B.R. 400, 401-02 (Bankr.W.D.Wis. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The bankruptcy court conducted additional hearings on MHA\u2019s proposed plan of reorganization on June 23, July 9, and July 12, 1982. At the July 9 hearing, Prudential presented an offer of proof that MHA had not acted in good faith when proposing its Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization. The bankruptcy court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">\u201cTaking all of the offers of proof as proved they must be applied against the legal standard for good faith in a Chapter 11. Also considered are matters which the Court has observed or has received evidence on either in this or in prior hearings which would be counter to the matters that are proved. Among those that I am prepared to consider are the terms of the plan that is now being considered for confirmation, the history of the amendments to that plan and the conduct of the debtor and debtor\u2019s counsel throughout these Bankruptcy proceedings; the fact that the plan calls for full payment to all creditors and specifically the treatment of MHA, Inc. in the plan is considered. Also considered is the presence of an escrow fund that was created in prior proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">The bankruptcy court added that \u201cessentially a reorganization plan is proposed in good faith when there is a reasonable likelihood that the plan will achieve a result consistent with the objectives and purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d Based upon these considerations, the court ruled that sufficient evidence existed to find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization was proposed in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The record reveals that all of MHA\u2019s creditors, except Prudential, affirmatively accepted the plan of reorganization. Following the July 12 hearing, the bankruptcy court ruled, from the bench, that MHA\u2019s plan satisfied the statutory requirements of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a) and thus the court confirmed the plan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, the bankruptcy court found that, in compliance with 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(3), MHA proposed the plan in good faith. According to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avb-dedup-1\">\u201cThis issue was disposed of in the prior ruling on Prudential\u2019s offer of proof to the contrary. That ruling concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>on the basis of the whole record in this case the good faith of the debtor in proposing this plan to the standards required under this subsection and articulated in the case of <em>In re Nile Lite Inns, </em>[17 B.R. 367, 370 (Bankr.S.D.Cal.1982), ... that standard was sufficiently evidenced ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The bankruptcy court further found that in accord with 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(8), all classes of creditors either affirmatively accepted MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization or their claims were \u201cnot impaired\u201d by the plan. In particular, the court found that Prudential was not impaired as that term is defined in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124 because MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization cures the default of Prudential\u2019s accelerated loan, reinstates the maturity of such loan as it existed before the default, compensates Prudential for damages incurred as a result of reasonable reliance, and does not otherwise alter legal, equitable, or contractual rights between MHA and Prudential. On July 14, 1982, the bankruptcy court entered a written order confirming MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Prudential appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order to the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. The case was assigned to Judge Crabb, the same judge who some two years previous granted Prudential\u2019s motion for summary judgment to foreclose, under Wisconsin state law, on MHA\u2019s mortgage. MHA filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), asking Judge Crabb to disqualify herself due to her apparent lack of impartiality on the issue of foreclosure and her statement that the case involved \u201cmany years of delay and legal skirmishing\u201d on the part of MHA. Judge Crabb denied the motion, summarily responding that \u201c[i]t is inevitable that judges will come to some evaluation of the merits of portions of the case. It does not follow from this, however, that the judge will be unable to remain neutral about other aspects of the case.\u201d Following this terse and unsupported treatment of the impartiality question, Judge Crabb overruled the bankruptcy court\u2019s holding that Prudential was not impaired under MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization. According to the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMDO\">\u201cMHA\u2019s plan impairs Prudential\u2019s claim because it does not restore Prudential\u2019s judicially-recognized right to proceed with foreclosure of the real and personal property of the Concourse Hotel. And, because Prudential\u2019s right to foreclosure does not arise merely from a contractual provision or applicable law but is created by court order and is not simply a right to accelerated payments which can be cured, Prudential\u2019s claim does not fall within the exception created by \u00a7 1124(2). Therefore, Prudential cannot be <em>deemed </em>to have accepted MHA\u2019s plan under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1126(f) and this matter must be remanded to the bankruptcy court for a determination of the plan\u2019s validity under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-8\"><em>In re Madison Hotel Associates, </em>29 B.R. 1003, 1009 (W.D.Wis.1983) (emphasis original) (footnote omitted). The district court further stated that \u201cthere are indications that MHA\u2019s filing for reorganization may have been motivated by the sole purpose of hindering and delaying its creditors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1010. The court thus reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcX\">\u201cThe indications of misuse of the bankruptcy court are sufficient to require an evidentiary hearing by the bankruptcy court to determine whether MHA\u2019s pre-filing conduct demonstrates by a preponderance of the credible evidence that its sole purpose in filing for Chapter 11 reorganization was to hinder or delay its secured creditors, Prudential and CMIT. The determination should not be limited to deciding only whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the plan will achieve a result consistent with the objectives and purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-9\"><em>Id. </em>On appeal, MHA claims that the district court erred in ruling that Prudential\u2019s claim is impaired for purposes of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(8). MHA further contends that the district court improperly construed the good faith requirement of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">We initially address the legal issue of whether Prudential\u2019s claim against MHA is impaired for purposes of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(8), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">\u201cThe court shall confirm a plan only if <em>all </em>of the following requirements are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">\u2756 :!\u00ab * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">(8) with respect to each class\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">(A) such class has accepted the plan; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">(B) such class is not impaired under the plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The parties agree that Prudential, as holder of the first mortgage on MHA\u2019s realty, is the sole member of its class. Furthermore, it is clear that Prudential has not affirmatively accepted MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization. Thus, in order for MHA\u2019s Chapter 11 plan to satisfy the requirement of confirmation set forth in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(8), Prudential\u2019s claim must be one that is \u201cnot impaired\u201d under the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">The term \u201cimpaired\u201d is defined in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124 (1982).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-12\">\u201cExcept as provided in section 1123(a)(4) of this title, a class of claims or interests is impaired under a plan unless, with respect to each claim or interest of such class, the plan\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-13\">(1) leaves unaltered the legal, equitable, and contractual rights to which such claim or interest entitles the holder of such claim or interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-14\">(2) notwithstanding any contractual provision or applicable law that entitles the holder of such claim or interest to demand or receive accelerated payment of such claim or interest after the occurrence of a default\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-15\">(A) cures any such default, other than a default of a kind specified in section 365(b)(2) of this title, that occurred before or after the commencement of the case under this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-18\">(B) reinstates the maturity of such claim or interest as such maturity existed before such default;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-19\">(C) compensates the holder of such claim or interest for any damages incurred as a result of any reasonable reliance by such holder on such contractual provision or such applicable law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-20\">(D) does not otherwise alter the legal, equitable, or contractual rights to which such claim or interest entitles the holder of such claim or interest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-21\">(3) provides that, on the effective date of the plan, the holder of such claim or interest receives, on account of such claim or interest, cash equal to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-22\">(A) with respect to a claim, the allowed amount of such claim; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-23\">(B) with respect to an interest, if applicable, the greater of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-24\">(i) any fixed liquidation preference to which the terms of any security representing such interest entitle the holder of such interest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-25\">(ii) any fixed price at which the debt- or, under the terms of such security, may redeem such security from such holder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-26\">Congress \u201cdefine[s] impairment in the broadest possible terms\u201d and then carves out three narrow exceptions to that expansive definition. <em>In re Taddeo, </em>685 F.2d 24, 28 (2d Cir.1982). <em>See also In re Forest Hills Associates, </em>40 B.R. 410, 414 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1984). These three exceptions, though narrow in scope, are of vital importance in a Chapter 11 reorganization because, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1126(f) (1982), \u201ca class that is not impaired under a plan is <em>deemed </em>to have accepted the plan ....\u201d (Emphasis added). In the present case, MHA began to default on its loan payments in early 1976, Prudential accelerated the maturity of the loan in October of 1978, and Prudential obtained a judicial or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>der of foreclosure in August of 1981. Before Prudential reduced that order to a judgment of foreclosure, MHA filed a Chapter 11 petition for reorganization. MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization seeks to cure the default of Prudential\u2019s accelerated loan and reinstate the maturity of that loan as it existed before the default.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the issue before this court is whether MHA\u2019s plan to cure the accelerated Prudential loan satisfies the four-prong test set forth in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124(2); if so, Prudential\u2019s claim is not impaired for purposes of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(8) and Prudential is deemed to have accepted the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">According to the bankruptcy court, MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization did, in fact, satisfy the four-prong test of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124(2). The bankruptcy court initially found that MHA\u2019s plan cures the default, providing \u201cfor full payment to Prudential of the claim it has filed based on default ....\u201d The court next found that even though the district court had entered an order of foreclosure, MHA\u2019s plan reinstates the maturity of Prudential\u2019s accelerated loan as such maturity existed before the default. In support of this position the bankruptcy court relied upon language in <em>In re Hewitt, </em>16 B.R. 973 (Bankr.D.Alaska 1982), that a secured creditor is not \u201charmed by the reversal of acceleration, ... where a ... court has simply applied the contractual provision or applicable law requiring acceleration and has embodied this application in a judgment of foreclosure.\u201d 16 B.R. at 977. The court next found that the plan properly \u201cprovides for payment of allowed costs and fees incurred [by Prudential] in enforcing the default.\u201d Finally, the bankruptcy court found that none of Prudential\u2019s alleged alterations in rights, neither \u201cindividually, nor all of them taken as a group, are sufficient to demonstrate that Prudential would be impaired by the confirmation of the plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The district court disagreed with the bankruptcy court\u2019s analysis of section 1124(2). According to the district court, \u201cMHA\u2019s plan impairs Prudential\u2019s claim because it does not restore Prudential\u2019s judicially-recognized right to proceed with foreclosure of the real and personal property of the Concourse Hotel.\u201d <em>In re Madison Hotel Associates, </em>29 B.R. at 1009. Contrary to the language of <em>In re Hewitt, </em>the district court reasoned that \u201c[a] judicially-recognized right to foreclosure is something different from a right to accelerated payments that arises by operation of a contractual provision or of applicable law.\u201d <em>In re Madison Hotel Associates, </em>29 B.R. at 1008. Thus, the district court concluded that \u201cbecause Prudential\u2019s right to foreclosure does not arise merely from a contractual provision or applicable law but is created by court order and is not simply a right to accelerated payments which can be cured, Prudential\u2019s claim does not fall within the exception created, by \u00a7 1124(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">The question that arises is what effect the district court\u2019s order of foreclosure, entered pursuant to Wisconsin state law, has upon MHA\u2019s attempt to cure the' default of its accelerated loan and thereby render Prudential\u2019s claim \u201cnot impaired\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124(2). To resolve this question, we initially review the relevant statutory language and Congress\u2019 intent in enacting the \u201cimpairment\u201d exception set forth in section 1124(2). The general rule is that a claim is impaired unless it falls within one of the three exceptions set forth in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124. In the present case, the applicable exception is found in section 1124(2) which provides that \u201ccuring a default, even though it inevitably changes a contractual acceleration clause, does not thereby \u2018impair\u2019 a creditor\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>In re Taddeo, </em>685 F.2d at 28-29. Indeed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-15\">\u201cSection 1124(2) permits the plan to reverse a contractual or legal acceleration. In order for a class of claims or interests] to be unimpaired for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>of section 1124(2), the plan must cure any default, other than an <em>ipso facto </em>default of a kind specified in section 365(b)(2), irrespective of whether such default occurred prior to or after commencement of the ease. In addition, the plan must provide for the payment of compensation to the holder of the claim or interest for any damages incurred as a result of any reasonable reliance by such holder on the contractual provisions or applicable law which permitted acceleration. Provided that the plan does not otherwise alter the legal, equitable, or contractual rights to which the holder of the claim or interest is entitled, <em>section 1124(2) permits the plan to reinstate the original maturity of the claim or interest as it existed before the default without impairing such claim or interest.</em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">5 L.

The rationale underlying Congress\u2019 enactment of Chapter 11, including the \u201cimpairment\u201d exception of section 1124(2), is the simple fact that reorganization is economically more efficient than liquidation.

It is more economically efficient to reorganize than to liquidate, because it preserves jobs and assets.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK3\">H.R.Rep.No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 220, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5963, 6179. Frequently, the interest rates on long-term loans are substantially less than the current market rate. Section 1124(2) promotes the economic efficiency of reorganization by allowing the Chapter 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>debtor to reinstate the original terms of an accelerated long-term loan at this lower interest rate. <em>See </em>5 L. King, Collier on Bankruptcy, <em>supra, </em>at 1124-16. <em>See also In re Jones, </em>32 BR. 951, 955 (Bankr.D.Utah 1983) (\u201cSection 1124(2) ... enables ... retention of advantageous contract terms.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The legislative history of section 1124(2) reveals that a creditor who is prevented from exercising a contractual and/or legal right of acceleration, but who receives the complete benefit of its original bargain with the debtor, is \u201cnot impaired\u201d for purposes of Chapter 11 analysis. Relying upon this policy consideration, various courts have reasoned that if a debtor cures the default of an accelerated loan in compliance with section 1124(2), the creditor who holds a judgment of foreclosure is not impaired, provided that the judgment does not merge into the mortgage under state law and no sale of foreclosure has occurred. In the leading case, <em>In re Hewitt, </em>the Alaska bankruptcy court was presented with the question of \u201cwhether \u00a7 1124(2) is applicable where a claim based on a contractual acceleration clause has been reduced to a judgment of foreclosure ... before the filing of the debtor\u2019s Chapter 11 petition, but where foreclosure has not yet occurred.\u201d 16 B.R. at 977. The court noted that under Alaska law, the mortgagor can terminate the judgment of foreclosure by paying the amount of the judgment before the actual foreclosure sale. In addition, Alaska law provides that following the foreclosure sale, the mortgagor has a one year period to redeem the property, and thus the property is not conveyed to the buyer until the one year redemption period expires. In light of this state law and Congress\u2019 intent to relieve Chapter 11 debtors of the burdens of accelerated loans, the bankruptcy court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201cThe secured creditor is no more harmed by the reversal of acceleration, and thus has as little cause to complain, where a ... court has simply applied the contractual provision or applicable law requiring acceleration and has embodied this application in a judgment of foreclosure. The Congressional policy to relieve Chapter 11 debtors of the burdens of acceleration clauses should not be thwarted by the formal obtaining of a judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 977. Accordingly, the court held that, \u201c[s]ince application of the Congressional policy of \u00a7 1124(2) will not further add to the uncertainties of the state system, particularly where, as here, no foreclosure sale has been held, the policy should be given effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Similarly, in <em>In re Orlando Tennis World Development Co., </em>34 B.R. 558 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1983), the debtor defaulted on a loan, the creditor accelerated payments, and the creditor then obtained a judgment of foreclosure, which was subsequently stayed upon the debtor\u2019s filing of a Chapter 11 petition for reorganization. The debtor\u2019s Chapter 11 plan of reorganization sought to cure the default of the accelerated loan. The Florida bankruptcy court confirmed the plan, reasoning that the debtor was not impaired for purposes of section 1124(2) because under Florida law, \u201cthe finality of the judgment of foreclosure is always subject to the exercise of the equity of redemption, and it is the foreclosure sale rather than the entry of judgment which cuts off the mortgagor\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560. The court relied upon the language of <em>In re Hewitt, </em>and held that \u201c[s]ince application of the Congressional policy of \u00a7 1124(2) will not further add to the uncertainties of the state system, particularly where, as here, no foreclosure sale has been held, the policy should be given effect.\u201d <em>In re Orlando Tennis World Development Co., </em>34 B.R. at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">In <em>In re Valente, </em>34 B.R. 804 (Bankr.D.Conn.1982), the debtor defaulted on monthly payments, the creditor accelerated those payments and obtained a judgment of foreclosure. The debtor filed a Chapter 11 petition for reorganization, thereby staying the foreclosure proceedings. Soon thereafter the debtor filed a plan of reorganization, claiming that under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124(2) the creditor was not impaired because the plan sought to cure the default. The bankruptcy court refused to confirm the plan, ruling that \u201conce a foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>action has gone to judgment, the mortgage is merged into the judgment leaving the mortgagor with only the right to redeem by payment of the entire debt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807. The Connecticut district court reversed, reasoning that \u201ca Connecticut judgment of foreclosure by sale is not sufficiently final so as to merge a mortgage irrevocably into itself.\u201d <em>Valente v. Savings Bank of Rockville, </em>34 B.R. 362, 364 (D.Conn.1983). The district court remanded the case and directed that \u201cif the Bankruptcy Court on remand finds that the debtors\u2019 plan cures the default at issue, the bank\u2019s claim may be deemed \u2018not impaired\u2019 under \u00a7 1124(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368. The district court in <em>Valente </em>declined to follow Judge Crabb\u2019s holding in <em>In re Madison Hotel Associates, </em>stating that, because the debtor\u2019s authority to cure is \u201cbroad enough to reach claims reduced to state court judgment, this Court adheres to the <em>Taddeo </em>precedent and holds that, if a Bankruptcy Judge finds that a debtor\u2019s plan cures a default, that cure renders a creditor\u2019s claim \u2018not impaired\u2019 under \u00a7 1124(2).\u201d <em>Valente v. Savings Bank of Rockville, </em>34 B.R. at 368. <em>See also In re Sapphire Investments, </em>27 B.R. 56, 59 (Bankr.D.Ariz.1983) (\u201ca promissory note and mortgage can be reinstated in a chapter 11 proceeding after the granting of the ... [foreclosure] judgment but prior to the sheriff\u2019s sale and the running of the redemption period.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The point to be gleaned from the relevant case law is that a creditor, holding a final judgment of foreclosure, is not impaired under section 1124(2) if the debtor\u2019s plan of reorganization cures the default of the accelerated loan before the foreclosure sale actually occurs or before the judgment merges into the mortgage under state law, thereby transferring title to the mortgagee. In <em>In re Clark, </em>738 F.2d 869 (7th Cir.1984), this court held in an analogous Chapter 13 situation, where the bank had obtained a judgment of foreclosure on the debtor\u2019s farm, that \u201cthe power to \u2018cure\u2019 a default provided by [11 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1322(b)(5) permits a debtor to de-accelerate the payments under a note secured by a residential property mortgage.\u201d 738 F.2d at 874. <em>See also Grubbs v. Houston First American Sav. Ass\u2019n., </em>730 F.2d 236, 246 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc); <em>In re Taddeo, </em>685 F.2d at 29. We reasoned that the existence of a foreclosure judgment did not alter the result because \u201cin Wisconsin a judgment of foreclosure does nothing but judicially confirm the acceleration.\u201d <em>In re Clark, </em>738 F.2d at 874. In the present case, Prudential has simply obtained an <em>order </em>of foreclosure under Wisconsin law that has not been reduced to final judgment. It thus follows that as long as MHA complies with section 1124(2), curing the default of Prudential\u2019s accelerated loan and reinstating the original terms of that loan, Prudential\u2019s claim is not impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We add that even if Prudential had obtained a judgment of foreclosure, that would not alter our analysis because \u201c[u]nder Wisconsin law, a mortgagee has only a lien on the mortgaged property <em>even after a judgment of foreclosure is entered. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 871 (emphasis added). Pursuant to Wisconsin state law, \u201c[a] judgment of foreclosure \u2018does little more than determine that the mortgagor is in default, the amount of principal and interest due and unpaid, the amount due to the plaintiff mortgagee for taxes, etc. ... The judgment does not destroy the lien of the mortgage but rather judicially determines the amount thereof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Marshall &amp; Ilsley Bank v. Greene, </em>227 Wis. 155, 164, 278 N.W. 425, 429 (Wis.1938)). <em>See also Glover v. Marine Bank of Beaver Dam, </em>117 Wis.2d 684, 697, 345 N.W.2d 449, 455 (Wis.1984) (mortgagee acquires title to property only after judicial confirmation of the foreclosure sale); <em>Bank of Commerce v. Waukesha County, </em>89 Wis.2d 715, 723, 279 N.W.2d 237, 241 (Wis.1979) (Wisconsin follows lien theory of mortgages); <em>In re Lynch, </em>12 B.R. 533, 534-35 (Bankr.W.D.Wis.1981) (mortgagor loses interest in property only after foreclosure sale); Wis. Stat. \u00a7 846.17 (1981-82). Accordingly, Prudential\u2019s failure to obtain a judgment of foreclosure on its accelerated loan is of no consequence in this ease. Under Wisconsin law, the judgment would simply represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>a judicial determination of the amount due under the accelerated loan and Prudential would continue to hold only a lien upon MHA\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In light of the applicable law of foreclosure in Wisconsin, this ease is easily distinguishable from the cases relied upon by the district court judge, where state law provided that the judgment of foreclosure merged the mortgage and the judgment, effectively transferring title to the mortgagee. For example, in <em>In re Monroe Park, </em>18 B.R. 790 (Bankr.D.Del.1982), the Delaware bankruptcy court reasoned that \u201cthere is a judgment of foreclosure [and] <em>[u]nder Delaware law the mortgage is merged in that judgment.\" </em>18 B.R. at 791 (emphasis added). The court thus concluded that under section 1124(2), \u201ccure of default and reinstatement of maturity date of a mortgage are no longer possible after entry of a foreclosure judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>In re Saint Peter\u2019s School, </em>16 B.R. 404 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1982), the New York bankruptcy court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">\u201cThe debtor cannot now propose to cure previous defaults under the mortgage and reinstate its maturity for continued payments in accordance with its terms because the debtor\u2019s rights under the mortgage were terminated pursuant to state law when the bank obtained a judgment of foreclosure prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">16 B.R. at 409. The court added that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtC\">\u201cHad the bank not obtained a judgment of foreclosure, deceleration would be permitted under Code \u00a7 1124(2). However, <em>the existence of the judgment of foreclosure into which the mortgage was merged, cannot simply be ignored. </em>The foreclosure judgment provides the bank with an additional right to immediate realizaiton of its legal, equitable and contractual interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-10\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In contrast, even if Prudential had obtained a judgment of foreclosure, under Wisconsin law the judgment would not merge with the mortgage and transfer title to Prudential. Instead, under Wisconsin law, Prudential, just as the creditors in <em>In re Hewitt, </em>16 B.R. at 977, <em>In re Orlando Tennis World Development Co., </em>34 B.R. at 560, and <em>Valente v. Savings Bank of Rockville, </em>34 B.R. at 364, would continue to hold only the lien that it presently holds upon MHA\u2019s property.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">The intended purpose of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124(2) is to permit a Chapter 11 debtor to cure the default of an accelerated loan, reinstate the maturity of that loan as it existed before default, and thereby \u201creverse a contractual or legal acceleration.\u201d 5 L. King, Collier on Bankruptcy, <em>supra, </em>at 1124-14. MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization clearly complies with Congressional intent. According to the bankruptcy court, MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization will cure the default of Prudential\u2019s accelerated loan, reinstate the maturity of Prudential\u2019s accelerated loan as it existed previous to the default, compensate Prudential for damages incurred as a result of reasonable reliance on the acceleration, and not alter legal, equita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>ble, or contractual rights between MHA and Prudential. Prudential\u2019s contention that the default is not cured under MHA\u2019s plan because Prudential has an order of foreclosure that will not be reduced to final judgment, directly contravenes the purpose of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124(2) to allow a Chapter 11 debtor to reverse a contractual or legal acceleration. Indeed, Congress provides that, <em>\u201c[t]he holder of a claim or interest who under the plan is restored to his original position, when others receive less or get nothing at all, is fortunate indeed and has no cause to complain.\u201d </em>S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 120, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5787, 5906 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the fact that Prudential holds only a lien upon MHA\u2019s property, and that MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization satisfies the four-prong test of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124(2), we hold that Prudential\u2019s claim is \u201cnot impaired.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, Prudential, as the sole member of its class, is deemed to have accepted the plan for purposes of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">MHA next contends that the district court improperly construed the good faith requirement of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(3) which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">\u201cThe court shall confirm a plan only if <em>all </em>of the following requirements are met: (2) The plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The district court reasoned that section 1129(a)(3) \u201crequires the bankruptcy court to evaluate the debtor\u2019s pre-filing conduct as well as the feasibility of the plan itself.\u201d <em>In re Madison Hotel Associates, </em>29 B.R. at 1009. According to the court, \u201c[i]n the assertions made by Prudential there are indications that MHA\u2019s filing for reorganization may have been motivated by the sole purpose of hindering and delaying its creditors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1010. Thus, the district court concluded that \u201c[t]he indications of misuse of the bankruptcy court are sufficient to require an evidentiary hearing by the bankruptcy court to determine whether MHA\u2019s pre-filing conduct demonstrates by a preponderance of the credible evidence that its sole purpose in filing for Chapter 11 reorganization was to hinder or delay its secured creditors ....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">We initially note that the district court judge erroneously construed the good faith requirement of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(3). Though the term \u201cgood faith,\u201d as used in section 1129(a)(3), is not defined in the Bankruptcy Code, <em>see </em>5 L. King, Collier\u2019s on Bankruptcy \u00b6 1129.02[3][a] at 1129-14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>(15th ed. 1979), the term is generally interpreted to mean that there exists \u201ca reasonable likelihood that the plan will achieve a result consistent with the objectives and purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d <em>In re Nite Lite Inns, </em>17 B.R. 367, 370 (Bankr.S.D.Cal.1982). <em>See also In re Coastal Cable T.V., Inc., </em>709 F.2d 762, 764 (1st Cir.1983); <em>Matter of Nikron, Inc., </em>27 B.R. 773, 778 (Bankr.E.D.Mich.1983). Similarly, in the context of a Chapter 13 reorganization, this court has interpreted the identical \u201cgood faith\u201d language contained in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a)(3) to require the bankruptcy court to review the proposed plan for accuracy and \u201ca fundamental fairness in dealing with one\u2019s creditors.\u201d <em>In re Rimgale, </em>669 F.2d 426, 432-33 (7th Cir.1982) (quoting <em>In re Beaver, </em>2 B.R. 337, 340 (Bankr.S.D.Cal.1980)).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, for purposes of determining good faith under section 1129(a)(3), as well as section 1325(a)(3), the important point of inquiry is the plan itself and whether such plan will fairly achieve a result consistent with the objectives and purposes of the Bankruptcy Code. The district court\u2019s decision failed to make this legal distinction between the good faith that is required to <em>confirm a plan </em>under section 1129(a)(3) and the good faith that has been established as a <em>prerequisite to filing </em>a Chapter 11 petition for reorganization. <em>See, e.g., </em>E. DiDanato, <em>Good Faith Reorganization Petitions: The Back Door Lets the Stranger In, </em>16 Conn.L.Rev. 1, 3 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">According to the good faith requirement of section 1129(a)(3), the court looks to the debtor\u2019s plan and determines, in light of the particular facts and circumstances, whether the plan will fairly achieve a result consistent with the Bankruptcy Code. The plan \u201cmust be \u2018viewed in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding confection\u2019 of the plan [and] ... [t]he bankruptcy judge is in the best position to assess the good faith of the parties\u2019 proposals.\u201d <em>In re Jasik, </em>727 F.2d 1379, 1383 (5th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>Public Finance Corp. v. Freeman, </em>712 F.2d 219, 221 (5th Cir.1983)). In the present case, the bankruptcy judge conducted three separate evidentiary hearings concerning the feasibility of MHA\u2019s plan. At the July 9, 1982 hearing, Prudential presented an offer of proof that MHA had not acted in good faith in proposing the plan of reorganization. The bankruptcy court \u201creviewed with some care the offer of proof ... generally ... directed to the frustrations of a creditor which has pursued a variety of disputes for a long period of time.\u201d The court accepted Prudential\u2019s offer of proof as true and stated that \u201ca reorganization plan is proposed in good faith when there is reasonable likelihood that the plan will achieve a result consistent with the objectives and purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d The court considered the \u201cterms of the plan ..., the history of the amendments to that plan and the conduct of the debtor and debtor\u2019s counsel throughout the Bankruptcy proceedings\u201d and concluded that \u201c[t]here is sufficient evidence that the purposes of the code are being met\u201d through MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization. Furthermore, at the July 12, 1982 hearing, when the bankruptcy judge confirmed MHA\u2019s plan from the bench, he stated that <em>\u2018\u2018on the basis of the whole record in this case the good faith of the debtor in proposing this plan to the standards required under [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(1)(3)] ... was sufficiently evidenced </em>....\u201d (Emphasis added). In reaching this conclusion, the bankruptcy judge properly noted that MHA\u2019s \u201cplan calls for full payment to all creditors ....\u201d Indeed, all creditors have affirmatively accepted MHA\u2019s plan, except Prudential who is reinstated to its original position, and thus <em>deemed </em>to have accepted the plan. In light of the totality of the circumstances, including the fact that MHA\u2019s plan will pay all creditors in full and thereby allow MHA to continue as a viable entity in accord with the purposes of Chapter 11, we agree with the bankruptcy court and hold that MHA's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>plan of reorganization satisfies the \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">We turn our attention briefly to the issue of whether the bankruptcy court need conduct an additional evidentiary hearing to determine if MHA originally filed its Chapter 11 petition for reorganization in good faith. It is generally recognized that \u201cgood faith\u201d is a threshold prerequisite to securing Chapter 11 relief, <em>see, In re BBT, </em>11 B.R. 224, 235 (Bankr.D.Nev. 1981); <em>In re Victory Constr. Co., </em>9 B.R. 549, 558 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.1981), and that the lack of such good faith constitutes \u201ccause,\u201d sufficient for dismissal under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b). <em>In re Mildevco, Inc., </em>40 B.R. 191, 193 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1984); <em>In re Gregory, </em>39 B.R. 405, 407 n. 1 (Bankr.M.D.Tenn. 1984); <em>In re Lotus Investments, Inc., </em>16 B.R. 592, 594-95 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1981). The record reveals that on December 22, 1981, the bankruptcy court considered Prudential\u2019s claim under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b) that the court should dismiss the case for MHA\u2019s lack of good faith in originally filing its Chapter 11 petition. Following a review of the evidence,' including MHA\u2019s usury action against Prudential in Wisconsin state court and MHA\u2019s filing for Chapter 11 reorganization before the district court entered a final judgment of foreclosure, the bankruptcy court found that \u201cthere have been sufficient efforts to reorganize undertaken by the debtor <em>to rebut any contention that there would be a lack of good faith in the initial filing of the Chapter 11.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). In support of this position, the record reveals that since February 1980, MHA has continued to make monthly payments, equivalent to the amount owed under the Prudential financing agreement, into a court-approved escrow account. MHA\u2019s actions are consistent with Congress\u2019 intent that a business organization experiencing cash flow problems be allowed to file a Chapter 11 petition for reorganization, extend the period of its debts, and return to the status of a viable entity while paying creditors in full. Based upon the evidence presented, we agree with the bankruptcy court that MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization was proposed in good faith. Accordingly, we hold that there is no reason to further burden the bankruptcy court with an evidentiary hearing concerning MHA\u2019s pre-filing conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The bankruptcy court found that MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization satisfies all eleven requirements of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a) and thus the court confirmed the plan. The district court reversed, ruling that Prudential was impaired under section 1129(a)(8), and that there was not a proper determination of good faith under section 1129(a)(3). We have determined that the district court erred; Prudential was not impaired for purposes of section 1129(a)(8) and MHA did propose its plan of reorganization in good faith in accord with section 1129(a)(3). We note, however, the district court\u2019s suggestion that MHA\u2019s plan may also violate 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(7). According to the district court\u2019s interpretation of section 1129(a)(7), even if Prudential is not impaired, it is entitled to reject any plan that provides it with less than it would receive upon liquidation. The district court concluded that, \u201c[bjecause ... Prudential\u2019s claim is impaired by MHA\u2019s [sic] I need not resolve this issue.\u201d <em>In re Madison Hotel Associates, </em>29 B.R. at 1010. To prevent further delay of the entry of MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization, we rule that MHA\u2019s plan does satisfy the requirement of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(7). Prudential\u2019s claim is not impaired and thus, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1126(f) Prudential is <em>deemed </em>to have accepted the plan, <em>notwithstanding </em>any provision to the contrary. In light of this fact, Prudential cannot now reject the plan under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(7).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>we agree with the bankruptcy court that MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization satisfies all eleven requirements of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a), and we hold that MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization \u201cshall be confirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">We reverse and remand this case to the district court with instructions to reinstate the July 14, 1982 order of Judge Martin of the Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, confirming MHA\u2019s Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-22\">.

The record reveals that on September 13, 1974, MHA and CMIT entered into a sale-lease back arrangement whereby CMIT purchased the parcel of land underlying the Concourse Hotel, subject to Prudential\u2019s first mortgage, and agreed to lease such realty to MHA for a monthly rental of $10,000 plus a percentage of MHA's annual gross receipts for the first two years of the lease. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, MHA has an option to purchase the leased land from CMIT for $1,000,000, and in the event of MHA\u2019s default on rental payments, MHA is deemed to have exercised that option. To secure performance of MHA\u2019s obligation to repurchase the realty, CMIT holds a mortgage on MHA\u2019s interest in improvements, leasehold interest, and vendee\u2019s interest in the realty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">In 1976, MHA began to default on its monthly rental payments to CMIT. On October 5, 1978, CMIT filed a Chapter 10 petition for reorganization in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Some four months later, on January 31, 1979, CMIT\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy commenced a foreclosure action against MHA in the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin.

The district court also relied upon the decision of the Virgin Islands bankruptcy court in <em>In re Antilles Yachting, Inc., </em>4 B.R. 470 (Bankr. Virgin Islands 1980), to rule that Prudential\u2019s claim was impaired for purposes of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124(2). In that case, the bankruptcy court held that \"a lien holder with a confessed judgment of foreclosure, containing a deficiency judgment ..., is \u2018impaired\u2019 if forced to forego payment of that judgment and instead to make a forced investment in a risky enterprise under a management demonstrated to the lien holder to be unreliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474. In the instant case, it is undisputed that MHA has been making monthly payments into the court-approved escrow account. Unlike the facts in <em>In re Antilles Yachting, Inc., </em>Prudential harbors no reasonable fear that MHA\u2019s plan of reorganization is risky or that MHA will eventually be forced to liquidate. Indeed, the bankruptcy court found that under MHA\u2019s plan, \"the debtor's projections [are] reasonable and reasonably capable of being met under the conditions that can presently be anticipated.\u201d Thus, the bankruptcy court\u2019s reasoning in <em>In re Antilles Yachting, Inc., </em>is inapplicable to the facts present in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b509-13\">.

The court concluded that \u201d[b]ecause ... Prudential is impaired by the loss of its right to proceed to foreclosure, I need not decide whether these additional alterations of its contractual rights would constitute impairment of its claim within the meaning of \u00a7 1124.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The bankruptcy court found, however, that none of Prudential\u2019s alleged alterations of rights, neither \"individually, nor all of them taken as a group, are sufficient to demonstrate that Prudential would be impaired by the confirmation of the plan.\" For purposes of this appeal, neither party has addressed the issue of MHA\u2019s plan altering Prudential\u2019s rights under the MHA mortgage and security agreement, and thus we adopt the bankruptcy court\u2019s well-reasoned and detailed finding; as it is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b510-10\">.
