Rush argues that (1) the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial; (2) there was insufficient evidence upon which to sustain the conviction; and (3) the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that knowledge is an element of the crime of transporting stolen goods. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-7\">On May 8, 1981 Pittsburgh Plate Glass Industries \u2014 Glass Division, Fresno account (\u201cPittsburgh Glass\u201d) issued a check for $51.15 payable to \u201cConstruction Material Suppliers.\u201d This check was mistakenly mailed to the business\u2019s prior address in Fresno, California. Pacific Steel Building Systems (\u201cPacific Steel\u201d), owned by defendant Rush, had also previously been located in Fresno, but had moved to Chow-chilla, California before the check was mailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-8\">On May 13, 1981 Rush\u2019s office mistakenly received the check that Pittsburgh Glass issued on May 8, 1981. Rush directed his secretary to deposit the check. The check had been altered so that the payee read \u201cPacific Steel\u201d and the amount was changed from $51.15 to $187,110. There is no direct evidence regarding who altered, the check, or where and when the alteration occurred. Rush\u2019s secretary, Ms. Altimus, took the check to the Bank of America in Chowchilla. She deposited it for credit to the Pacific Steel account. Oh June 2, 1981 Richard Koenig, the comptroller from Rush\u2019s corporate headquarters in Hearst, Texas, directed Ms. Altimus to transfer $175,000 from Pacific Steel\u2019s account in California to the account of Rush Ltd. Co. (\u201cRush Ltd.\u201d) at the First National Bank of Fort Worth, Texas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rush owned Rush Ltd. which was a parent corporation of four subsidiaries, including Pacific Steel. Rush was the president and sole shareholder of each subsidiary company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-10\">On June 3, 1981, on Koenig\u2019s instruction, Ms. Altimus directed Bank of America in Chowchilla to transfer the funds to the Fort Worth National Bank of Texas. On June 5, 1981 this transaction was completed. When the general office of Pittsburgh Glass recognized their check had been altered, they quickly notified Bank of America. Upon discovering that $175,000 of this money had been transferred by wire to Fort Worth National Bank, Bank of America sent a telegram on July 6, 1981 to that bank requesting that they hold all funds in the Rush Ltd. and Pacific Steel accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-11\">On September 23, 1982 Rush was indicted for (1) wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (\u201cCount I\u201d); (2) false statement to a bank, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 (\u201cCount II\u201d); and (3) transportation of stolen goods, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 (\u201cCount III\u201d). Count II was dismissed on the first day of trial at the government\u2019s request. The jury found Rush guilty of Counts I and III. A motion for new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 was timely filed and denied by the district court in a memorandum decision. Judgment was entered against Rush on August 15, 1983 for wire fraud and transportation of stolen money, violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343 and 2314 respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-13\">Rush argues that the district court abused its discretion when it denied Rush\u2019s motion for a new trial. Such motion should be granted \u201conly in exceptional cases in which the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Pimentel, </em>654 F.2d 538, 545 (9th Cir.1981). The district court\u2019s decision is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>In its memorandum denying Rush\u2019s motion for a new trial, the court erroneously mentioned Count II, false statement to a bank, which had been dismissed earlier. It neglected mentioning Count III, interstate transport of stolen money, for which the jury rendered a guilty verdict. On this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>appeal Rush argued that this error constituted an abuse of or failure to exercise discretion or a misapplication of law. When we originally heard this case, we agreed that the trial court had not exercised its discretion regarding Rush\u2019s conviction under Count III. <em>See United States v. Friedland, </em>660 F.2d 919, 931 (3d Cir.1981) (citing <em>United States v. Iannelli, </em>528 F.2d 1290, 1292 (3d Cir.1976)). We did not agree, however, that this constituted grounds for remanding the entire case. We remanded for the limited purpose of having the district court clarify and correct its decision. We retained jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-4\">On October 1, 1984 the district court filed an amended decision. The amended decision is now before us, and we find there was no abuse of discretion in denying the motion for a new trial. The trial court\u2019s original and amended memorandum decisions fully discuss both grounds upon which Rush based his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-5\">First, Rush claimed that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Specifically, he claims the evidence was insufficient under both counts to establish a willful, knowing scheme that Rush directed or caused either the interstate transportation of stolen money, Count III, or a wire transmission to execute a fraudulent scheme, Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-6\">The trial judge considered the facts and found that a check had been altered, deposited, and transferred interstate from one of Rush\u2019s business accounts to his corporate account. The court found that a jury could not infer directly from the evidence when the check came into Rush\u2019s possession; when the designation of the payee and the amount appearing on the check was altered; or who caused the alterations. There was, however, evidence of Rush\u2019s motive to alter the check and his attempt to withdraw funds from his corporation\u2019s Texas bank account, after being informed that the source of those funds was a fraudulently altered check. Rush attempted to benefit from the presence of the funds in Texas shortly after he became aware that the Bank of America was charging that the check was fraudulently altered. This evidence supplied the necessary link from which Rush\u2019s intent could be logically inferred. The trial court properly defined its role in ruling on a motion for a new trial, carefully weighed the evidence, and reached a reasoned decision that there was sufficient evidence to submit both Counts I and III to the jury. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-8\">Rush also asserts that a new trial should have been granted on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct. There was no abuse of discretion by the district court in the treatment of this claim by Rush. The judge carefully considered each allegation, referred to his trial notes, and correctly concluded that each incident was objected to and that \u201cthe court forcibly dealt with the objections on each occasion and gave appropriate admonitions to the jury.\u201d These admonitions were sufficient to avert prejudice to Rush.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-9\">Rush\u2019s second ground for reversal of the trial court is that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the verdict. There is sufficient evidence to support a conviction if, reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Marabelles, </em>724 F.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (emphasis in original). Conflicting evidence is resolved in favor of the verdict. See <em>United States v. Ramos, </em>558 F.2d 545, 546 (9th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-10\">Rush argues there is insufficient evidence that he either directed or otherwise caused stolen money to be transported interstate in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314, or caused an interstate wire transmission to be made in furtherance of a scheme to defraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. Rush contends the only reasonable explanation presented by the evidence is that Koenig directed the interstate transactions, and that these transactions were not foreseeable consequences of the check being deposited in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>Viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, however, there was evidence that Koenig acted with Rush\u2019s approval in managing the funds of the five companies. Koenig was hired by Rush. They had discussed the standard operating procedure of transferring corporate funds to Rush Ltd. Rush\u2019s signature was on a check authorizing the transfer from one company to another. Rush was the corporate president and sole shareholder of all five corporations. Rush\u2019s testimony as to when he became suspicious, or was notified that the check had been fraudulently altered, was contradicted by other witnesses. Rush attempted to remove funds from his Texas bank account after a bank official told him the source of those funds was a bad check. Although there was no direct evidence that Rush directly ordered the interstate transfer, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably have inferred that Rush was responsible for the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-6\">Rush\u2019s third contention on appeal is that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that knowledge is an element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314, transportation of stolen goods. Jury instructions are reviewed as a whole and in the context of the entire trial. <em>Marabelles, </em>724 F.2d at 1382. \u201cA trial judge is given substantial latitude in tailoring the instructions so long as they fairly and adequately cover the issues presented.\u201d Id. at 1382-83 (citing <em>United States v. James, </em>576 F.2d 223, 226 (9th Cir.1978)). While a criminal defendant is entitled to instructions reflecting his theory of the case, challenges to the particular language or formulation of such instructions are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Marabelles, </em>724 F.2d at 1383.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-7\">Jury instructions are held to adequately cover the element of knowledge under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 if \u201cthe jury are instructed they must find that the defendant transported the goods \u2018knowing [the] same to have been stolen ....\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Gallo, </em>543 F.2d 361, 367 (D.C.Cir.1976) (quoting <em>United States v. DeKunchak, </em>467 F.2d 432, 437 (2d Cir.1972)). We agree with the D.C. Circuit that to impose an \u201cactual knowledge\u201d requirement would overstate the standard, imposed by the statute. <em>Gallo, </em>543 F.2d at 367. At the same time, the instructions should not lead the jury to believe that the evidence of knowledge need only reach the level of negligence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1455-11\">The district judge read the language of the statute to the jury, defined its elements and terms, and stated that the jury must find, \u201cthat the defendant acted knowingly and willfully.\u201d The court then defined a willful act. The court\u2019s instructions were as thorough in explaining the elements of knowledge and intent as the instruction requested by the defendant. The defendant\u2019s theory of the case, that the evidence failed to establish Rush\u2019s knowledge that the funds were \u201cstolen,\u201d was adequately presented, albeit not worded precisely as Rush preferred. The state of mind requirement was defined repeatedly. The explanation that intent may be circumstantially inferred was tempered by reference to the jury\u2019s role in weighing the evidence, and the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. The instructions adequately describe the elements of knowledge required under section 2314. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1453-9\">. This transfer was originally directed to the First National Bank of Fort Worth, Texas. Because Rush\u2019s account was actually with the Fort Worth National Bank, an exchange of telegrams between banks was required before the $175,000 could be successfully deposited there.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
