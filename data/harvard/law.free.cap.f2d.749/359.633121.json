COUCH, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, Defendant-Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b445-13\">No. 83-5540.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b445-14\">United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b445-16\">Argued July 9, 1984.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b445-17\">Decided Dec. 4, 1984.</decisiondate>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b445-18\">Rehearing Denied Jan. 21, 1985.</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-23\">Sue Ellen Prater, argued, Appalachian Research and Defense Fund of Ky., Inc., Jackson, Ky., for plaintiff-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-24\">Louis DeFalaise, U.S. Atty., Miles H.

On appeal this court vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded the case for an award of benefits in an unpublished per curiam opinion filed on July 26, 1984. 740 F.2d 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The plaintiff has now filed in this court an application for attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. The plaintiff filed supporting data with the application. The court concluded that it required a response from the Secretary on this issue and accordingly sought and received such response.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Upon consideration of the motion of the plaintiff and the response thereto, the court determines that an award of fees and expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act would be inappropriate in this case. The only basis of the motion is that this court vacated the judgment of the district court upon finding that the decision of the Secretary was not supported by substantial evidence. This alone is not a proper basis for the allowance of fees and expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act. An award is to be made under that Act unless the court finds \u201cthat the position of the United States was substantially justified. ...\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (1982). The fact that this court finds a decision of the Secretary not supported by substantial evidence is not equivalent to a finding that the position of the United States was not substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">The motion for allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation expenses is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
