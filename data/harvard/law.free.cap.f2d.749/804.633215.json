In a memorandum opinion and order issued November 17, 1983, the Commission held that the \u201cpotential for such state regulation to chill the development of SMATV service conflicts with our Congressional mandate, as embodied in the Communications Act, to foster the development of national communications service.\u201d <em>Earth Satellite Communications, Inc., </em>55 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; F) 1427, 1434 (1983), <em>recon. denied, </em>FCC 84-206 (May 14, 1984). Petitioner New York State Commission on Cable Television and numerous intervenors (petitioners) contend that by refusing to give local jurisdictions the same regulatory control over SMATV as they have over traditional franchise cable, the Commission has exceeded its statutory authority and acted arbitrarily and capriciously. We find the Commission\u2019s decision a \u201c \u2018reasonable accommodation of the conflicting policies\u2019 that are within the agency\u2019s domain,\u201d <em>Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2694, 2701, 81 L.Ed.2d 580 (1984) (quoting <em>United States v. Shimer, </em>367 U.S. 374, 383, 81 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>S.Ct. 1554, 1560, 6 L.Ed.2d 908 (1961)), and therefore affirm the order in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">The rapidly expanding cable industry has spawned a variety of methods by which cable viewing can be distributed to the public. \u201cTraditional\u201d or \u201cfranchise\u201d cable systems use large remote antennas to capture television signals. The signals are distributed from the large antennas to viewers through coaxial cable laid under city streets or along telephone lines. Within the past decade, marketing innovations and advances in satellite and microwave technology have eliminated the need for the use of public rights-of-way to distribute \u201ccable\u201d viewing to some subscribers. Large apartment buildings and hotels can install a master antenna television (MATV) system which captures a television broadcast signal off the air and delivers it to tenants through coaxial cables that run through the buildings. In addition to improving normal television reception, MATV enables tenants to take advantage of the cable system involved in this litigation, satellite master antenna television (SMATV). SMATV transmits television signals from satellites directly to satellite receiving stations (\u201creceive-only earth stations\u201d) atop multi-unit dwellings. The signal is converted to a usable frequency and distributed to subscribing tenants through the existing MATV system. A similar system, multipoint distribution service (MDS), beams microwave signals terrestrially to special antennas atop the buildings, and, like SMATV, uses the MATV system to distribute the signals to individual tenants. In the near future, satellite signals will be available to those who do not reside in large apartment dwellings. Direct broadcast satellite (DBS), potentially the most significant of the recent technological innovations, will provide direct satellite communication to individual homes, taking advantage of high-powered satellites and small, efficient earth receiving stations. <em>See National Association of Broadcasters v. FCC, </em>740 F.2d 1190 (D.C.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">The Commission has allowed state and local governments some regulatory control over the franchising of \u201ctraditional cable\u201d \u2014cable systems that use public rights-of-way and telephone lines to distribute programming. State commissions, such as petitioner New York State Commission on Cable Television, have promulgated regulations governing the entry of cable television systems into the marketplace. In recent years, state and local regulators have endeavored to impose entry regulations upon cable systems, such as SMATV and MDS, that do not use the public rights-of-way. In 1977, however, the Commission preempted state entry regulation of MDS in <em>Orth-O-Vision, Inc., </em>69 F.C.C.2d 657 (1978), <em>recon., </em>82 F.C.C.2d 178 (1980), <em>aff'd sub nom. New York State Commission on Cable Television v. FCC, </em>669 F.2d 58 (2d Cir.1982). The Commission refused, however, to extend its preemption ruling to other systems, such as SMATV, which also do not use public rights-of-way. 69 F.C.C.2d at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Earth Satellite Communications, Inc. (ES-COM) builds and operates SMATV systems around the country. The programming ES-COM provides to its subscribers includes signals from television stations in Chicago and Atlanta and additional premium programs, such as the Movie Channel and ESPN. Joint Appendix (J.A.) 1. In 1983, ESCOM began installing a SMATV system in a 250-unit apartment building in East Orange, New Jersey, when Suburban Ca-blevision, a franchise cable television operator, sued in state court to enjoin the installation. Suburban Cablevision alleged that ESCOM violated the New Jersey Cable Television Act by installing its system without first obtaining a license from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. ESCOM contended that the New Jersey regulations did not apply to SMATV, and, even if they did apply, had been preempted by the Commission\u2019s 1977 <em>Orth-O-Vision </em>decision. J.A. 13-34. The court rejected ESCOM\u2019s arguments and entered an injunction prohibiting ESCOM from operating the SMATV system until it received a state certificate of approval. <em>Suburban Cable-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number><em>vision v. Earth Satellite Communications, Inc., </em>No. C-1554-83E (N.J.Super.Ct.Ch.Div. May 20, 1983), J.A. 261-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">ESCOM filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission, urging it to extend the <em>Orth-O-Vision </em>decision to preempt state and local entry regulation of SMATV. J.A. 1. The Commission gave public notice of ESCOM\u2019s petition and received comments from over 25 interested parties. In a decision released November 17, 1983, the Commission declared that state and local regulation of SMATV that has \u201cthe effect of interfering with, delaying, or terminating interstate and federally controlled communications services\u201d is preempted. <em>Earth Satellite Communications, Inc., </em>55 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; F) at 1435.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the Commission denied its request for a hearing, FCC 84-206 (May 14, 1984), the New York State Commission on Cable Television petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AMfY\">A. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Because the Commission has expressed its unambiguous intention to preempt state regulation of SMATV, our review on appeal is limited to determining whether the Commission had the authority to preempt state regulation and whether the preemption was a reasonable exercise of that authority. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2694, 2701, 81 L.Ed.2d 580 (1984), \u201cif the FCC has resolved to pre-empt an area of cable television regulation and if this determination \u2018represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies\u2019 that are within the agency\u2019s domain, ... we must conclude that all conflicting state regulations have been precluded.\u201d (citation omitted). <em>See also Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. De La Cuesta, </em>458 U.S. 141, 153-54, 102 S.Ct. 3014, 3022-23, 73 L.Ed.2d 664 (1982) (\u201cFederal regulations have no less preemptive effect than federal statutes. Where Congress has directed an administrator to exercise his discretion, his judgments are subject to judicial review only to determine whether he has exceeded his statutory authority or acted arbitrarily.\u201d); <em>Computer and Communications Industry Ass\u2019n v. FCC, </em>693 F.2d 198, 214 (D.C.Cir.1982) (\u201cTo determine whether the Commission acted properly in preempting state [regulation], ... we must examine the Commission\u2019s powers under the Act and the asserted justification for preempting state regulation.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 938, 103 S.Ct. 2109, 77 L.Ed.2d 313 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">B. <em>The Commission\u2019s Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6xj\">Congress created the Commission in 1934 to regulate \u201ccommunication by wire and radio so as to make available ... to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nationwide and world-wide wire and radio communication service.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 (1982). Although the Commission\u2019s general regulatory authority over cable television was originally in some doubt,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., </em>392 U.S. 157, 88 S.Ct. 1994, 20 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1968), found that the Communications Act empowered the Commission to regulate cable television to the extent that it is \u201creasonably ancillary to the effective performance of the Commission\u2019s various responsibilities for the regulation of television broadcasting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 88 S.Ct. at 2005. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Supreme Court recently stated in <em>Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2694, 2701, 81 L.Ed.2d 580 (1984), \u201c[w]e have since explained that the Commission\u2019s authority extends to all regulatory actions \u2018necessary to ensure the achievement of the Commission\u2019s statutory responsibilities.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>FCC v. Midwest Video Corp., </em>440 U.S. 689, 706, 99 S.Ct. 1435, 1444, 59 L.Ed.2d 692 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">In its preemption order the Commission based its authority over SMATV upon the federal interest in \u201cthe unfettered development of interstate transmission of satellite signals.\u201d <em>Earth Satellite Communications, Inc., </em>55 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; F) at 1432. This development would be frustrated, the Commission found, if each state could impose their own entry restrictions upon systems that were part of the national satellite network. <em>Id. </em>The Commission chose not to impose entry restrictions of its own, believing that open entry policies in the satellite field would create a more diverse and competitive telecommunications environment. <em>Id. </em>at 1433.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Petitioners do not challenge the general authority of the Commission to preempt state and local regulation of cable television in appropriate circumstances. Rather, they contend that, in this particular instance, because the Commission has failed to show that preemption is necessary \u201cto ensure the achievement of the Commission\u2019s statutory responsibilities,\u201d <em>FCC v. Midwest Video Corp., </em>440 U.S. 689, 706, 99 S.Ct. 1435, 1444, 59 L.Ed.2d 692 (1979), it has acted beyond its authority. To support this contention, petitioners advance two closely related arguments. First, they contend that preemption of state and local regulation of SMATV is a reversal of well-established policy and therefore \u201cpresumptively\u201d contrary to the achievement of the Commission\u2019s statutory responsibilities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, petitioners contend that the policies underlying the Communications Act cannot be advanced by the Commission\u2019s determination to allow SMATV to enter the telecommunications marketplace unregulated. We reject both of these arguments and conclude that the Commission\u2019s action is not only consistent with prior Commission policy, but also a \u201c \u2018reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies\u2019 that are within the agency\u2019s domain.\u201d <em>Crisp, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2701 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">1. The Allocation of Regulatory Responsibilities Between the Commission and State and Local Governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">During the past twelve years, the Commission has given local jurisdictions significant control over the franchising of traditional cable systems. Petitioners contend that the Commission\u2019s refusal to give state and local governments the same amount of authority over SMATV as they have over traditional cable is a reversal of well-established policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Careful review of Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>sion precedent, however, reveals that the petitioners\u2019 argument ignores the critical distinction the Commission has made between cable television systems that use public rights-of-way and systems, like SMATV, that are operated solely on private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The Commission recognized in 1972 that direct federal licensing of the thousands of cable systems operating in large and small communities throughout the country would place \u201can unmanageable burden on the Commission.\u201d <em>Cable Television Report and Order, </em>36 F.C.C.2d 143, 207 (1972). The physical realities of constructing cable systems \u2014 the use of public rights-of-way and the parcelling of large urban districts \u2014 made local governments a logical entity to share the regulatory burden.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commission therefore created a \u201cdeliberately structured dualism\u201d whereby local governments would be responsible for selecting franchises, pursuant to minimum standards established by the Commission, while the Commission retained exclusive authority over all operational aspects of cable communication, including technical standards and signal carriage. <em>Id. </em>at 207-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">As the Commission later explained, the 1972 rules \u201cwere an attempt to create a flexible regulatory framework that took into account the constant and necessary flux inherent in any emerging industry such as cable television.\u201d <em>Clarification of the Cable Television Rules, </em>46 F.C.C.2d 175, 176 (1974). Although the Commission recognized that \u201cthe essentially local service offered by cable television, at least in its formative stages, could best be developed through local participation and enforcement,\u201d it cautioned that \u201cthe developing duplicative and burdensome overregu-lation of cable television\u201d was of increasing concern. <em>Id. </em>at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Following a comprehensive study of the effect of dual regulation upon the cable industry, the Commission in 1975 recognized the need for clarification of local governments\u2019 regulatory responsibilities. The Commission issued a ruling emphasizing cable television\u2019s use of public rights-of-way as the primary rationale for local control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-12\">The ultimate dividing line, as we see it, rests on the distinction between reasonable regulations regarding use of the streets and rights-of-way and the regulation of the operational aspects of cable communication. The former is clearly within the jurisdiction of the states and their political subdivisions. The latter, to the degree exercised, is within the jurisdiction of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-13\"><em>Duplicative and Excessive Over-Regulation of Cable Television, </em>54 F.C.C.2d 855, 861 (1975). The Commission made explicit its intention to preempt local regulation whenever necessary \u201cto assure the orderly development of this new technology into the national communications structure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 863.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>Under this dual regulatory framework, the Commission has consistently retained exclusive authority over those elements of cable television that do not involve the use of public rights-of-way. The Commission has retained exclusive authority over the licensing of the satellites that transmit SMATV signals, <em>see Network Project v. FCC, </em>511 F.2d 786 (D.C.Cir.1975), and the earth stations that receive the satellite signals. <em>Second Report and Order, </em>35 F.C.C.2d 844, 855 (1972). <em>See also Regulation of Domestic Receive-Only Satellite Earth Stations, </em>74 F.C.C.2d 205, 217 (1979) (making licensing of receive-only earth stations voluntary). The Commission has preempted regulation of pay television programming services and rates, <em>Brookhaven Cable TV, Inc. v. Kelly, </em>573 F.2d 765 (2d Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 904, 99 S.Ct. 1991, 60 L.Ed.2d 372 (1979), and the carriage of television broadcast signals. <em>Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2694, 81 L.Ed.2d 580 (1984). As the Supreme Court stated in its unanimous <em>Crisp </em>decision, \u201c[o]ver the past twenty years, pursuant to its delegated authority under the Communications Act, the FCC has unambiguously expressed its intent to preempt any state or local regulation of this entire array of signals carried by cable television systems.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2701.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">A case similar to this appeal, <em>Orth-O-Vision, Inc., </em>69 F.C.C.2d 657 (1978), <em>recon., </em>82 F.C.C.2d 178 (1980), <em>aff'd sub nom. New York Commission on Cable Television v. FCC, </em>669 F.2d 58 (2d Cir.1982), clearly demonstrates the Commission\u2019s willingness to preempt state regulation of systems that do not involve the use of public rights-of-way. <em>Orth-O-Vision </em>involved a cable system similar to SMATV, multipoint distribution service (MDS). Rather than bouncing its signal off of a domestic satellite, MDS delivers programming terrestrially by microwave. Like SMATV, MDS\u2019s primary market is large multi-unit dwellings in which individual units are wired to a rooftop antenna through the MATV network. Orth-O-Vision, a company that markets HBO programming through a MDS-MATV system, was refused an operating permit from the petitioner in this case, New York State Commission on Cable Television (NYSCCT). It then petitioned the FCC to preempt state regulation of MDS. The Commission, after notice and opportunity for comment, issued a declaratory ruling preempting state and local regulations of MDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">In its comments opposing Orth-O-Vision\u2019s petition, the NYSCCT argued, as it does in this case, that state regulation of MDS-augmented MATV would prevent MATV \u201cfrom stifling the development of conventional cable systems in the same area or from securing an unfair competitive advantage over an already franchised system.\u201d. <em>Orth-O-Vision, </em>69 F.C.C.2d at 663. The Commission held that this state objective\u2014 to protect franchised cable from competition by regulating MDS \u2014 was \u201can impermissible interference with interstate communications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">In affirming the Commission\u2019s preemption, the Second Circuit found that by denying franchises, municipalities could curtail the development of MDS. <em>New York Commission on Cable Television v. FCC, </em>669 F.2d 58, 63-64, 66 (2d Cir.1982). Since the Commission\u2019s policy of advancing the development of MDS was within its statutory authority, the Commission properly preempted conflicting state entry regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">Petitioners argue vigorously that the <em>Orth-O-Vision </em>decisions are irrelevant to this appeal. First, petitioners contend that MDS is completely unlike franchised cable or SMATV. Brief for NYSCCT at 17. We agree that MDS is different from franchised cable in one critical respect: it is operated solely on private property and makes no use of public rights-of-way. Yet the only difference between MDS and SMATV is that SMATV bounces its signal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>off domestic satellites. Petitioners advance no theory as to why this relatively minor difference should compel the Commission to treat SMATV differently than MDS. Second, petitioners seize upon language in the <em>Orth-O-Vision </em>order that limits its preemptive impact to MDS systems. The question, however, is not whether the order in <em>Orth-O-Vision </em>preempted SMATV but whether the Commission\u2019s action in <em>Orth-O-Vision, </em>affirmed by the Second Circuit, establishes precedent for the preemption of state regulation of SMATV. The Commission\u2019s preemption of a cable system, which, like the system involved in this appeal, does not use public rights-of-way, plainly refutes petitioners\u2019 contention that the Commission has arbitrarily reversed well-established policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">2. Commission Reliance on Market Forces to Regulate SMATV</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">In a general challenge to the Commission\u2019s decision not to impose entry regulations upon SMATV, petitioners contend that the Commission has failed to show that its open entry policy is necessary for the achievement of its statutory responsibilities. Franchise cable television and SMATV have flourished under local regulation, they claim, and no federal interest would be promoted by allowing SMATV to compete unregulated with traditional cable.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Although the Commission does not have unbridled discretion to use the marketplace to regulate an industry under its control,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cthe public interest touchstone of the Communications Act, beyond question, permits the FCC to allow the marketplace to substitute for direct Commission regulation in appropriate circumstances.\u201d <em>Wold Communications, Inc. v. FCC, </em>735 F.2d 1465, 1475 (D.C.Cir.1984). <em>See also FCC v.

Competition, petitioner NYSCCT argues, will have a grave impact upon the existing cable franchises. The Commission\u2019s determination that SMATV should be allowed to serve residents of multi-unit dwellings cannot be challenged as contrary to the purposes of the Communications Act merely because some harm will be visited upon existing and developed franchises.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Measuring the public interest standard of the Communications Act with sole reference to the impact Commission action would have upon a developed technology ensures a regulatory regime frozen into maintaining the status quo. We cannot read into the Communications Act a congressional intent to so prevent innovative technologies from conferring substantial benefits upon the viewing public. We therefore conclude that the Commission\u2019s present reliance on market forces to regulate the entry of SMATV into the cable television marketplace is consistent with its statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">3. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">We find, therefore, that the preemption of state and local entry regulation of SMATV is well within the Commission\u2019s statutory authority. The Commission\u2019s preemption policy has been \u201cshouted from the rooftops.\u201d <em>Brookhaven Cable TV, Inc. v. Kelly, </em>573 F.2d 765, 768 (2d Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 904, 99 S.Ct. 1991, 60 L.Ed.2d 372 (1979). There has been no reversal of policy that might indicate that the Commission has strayed from any well recognized limits of their jurisdiction over cable television regulation. State and local entry regulation that has either the purpose or the effect of restricting the ability of SMATV operators to provide services to the public clearly conflicts with the policies articulated by the Commission and, therefore, are a proper subject of preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">C. <em>The Reasonableness of the Commission\u2019s Exercise of Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">Having established that preemption of state regulation of SMATV is within the Commission\u2019s statutory authority, we now consider whether in exercising its authority the Commission acted arbitrarily or capriciously. <em>Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. De La Cuesta, </em>458 U.S. 141, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>151-54, 102 S.Ct. 3014, 3021-23, 73 L.Ed.2d 664 (1982) (federal agency\u2019s decision to preempt \u201csubject to judicial review only to determine whether he has exceeded his statutory authority or acted arbitrarily\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As this court recently stated in <em>Wold Communications, Inc. v. FCC, </em>735 F.2d 1465, 1476 (D.C.Cir.1984), the proper inquiry under the arbitrary and capricious standard is \u201cwhether a reasonable person, considering the matter on the agency\u2019s table, could arrive at the judgment the agency made.\u201d <em>See also Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC, </em>567 F.2d 9, 35 (D.C.Cir.) (court must ensure \u201cboth that the Commission has adequately considered all relevant factors ... and that it has demonstrated a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 829, 98 S.Ct. 111, 54 L.Ed.2d 89 (1977). Our discussion of the Commission\u2019s authority forecloses extensive inquiry into the rationality of its decision. A finding that the Commission has the power to preempt state regulation means that preemption is necessary for the full accomplishment of lawful Commission objectives. Establishing this logical relationship between the action taken \u2014 preemption\u2014and Commission policy involves, at least to a certain extent, the determination that the Commission has not acted arbitrarily or capriciously. Furthermore, the nature of this preemption action obviates extensive analysis of the facts upon which the determination was reached: the parties do not so much dispute the factual circumstances surrounding the cable industry as the kind of regulation that should or should not be imposed upon the existing and emerging cable systems. Yet, if the Commission has chosen rationally among competing policies, we cannot reverse because we would have chosen other means of effectuating the congressional mandate. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Steel Corp., </em>406 U.S. 742, 749, 92 S.Ct. 1941, 1946, 32 L.Ed.2d 453 (1972), \u201cwe do not inquire into the wisdom of the regulations that the Commission promulgates, and we inquire into the soundness of the reasoning by which the Commission reaches its conclusions only to ascertain that the latter are rationally supported.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Petitioner NYSCCT claims that there is inadequate evidence in the record to justify the Commission\u2019s conclusion that state and local regulations actually impede the growth of SMATV. The petitioner\u2019s comments to the Commission, however, betray the weakness of its contention. The petitioner argued that \u201c[t]he principal evil of allowing private cable to exist outside the regulatory scheme for cable is the impact upon territorial cable television.\u201d <em>NYSCCT\u2019s Comments in Opposition </em>at 40, J.A. 438. Since the dominant theme of the petitioner\u2019s opposition to the preemption order is the alleged need to stifle SMATV development, the Commission rationally determined that federal preemption was necessary to effectuate its policy of enhancing the diversity of cable programming.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See National Association of Reg</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number><em>ulatory Commissioners v.

Petitioner NYSCCT estimated that the unregulated entry of SMATV into the New York City marketplace would cost franchise cable systems between $348 million and $793 million over the lifetime of the franchises.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To replace the revenue lost from those subscribers who would choose SMATV, the franchise systems would have to increase their rates of their remaining subscribers from $7.00 to $11.00 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The Commission found NYSCCT\u2019s analysis unpersuasive for several reasons. First, the Commission stated that it is \u201cnot an economic guarantor of competing communications technologies which may offer similar services to subscribers.\u201d 55 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; F) at 1433. Second, the Commission noted that NYSCCT\u2019s arguments had been raised and answered in the <em>OrthO-Vision </em>proceedings. Finally, the Commission predicted that, in states such as New York where cable franchises have mandatory access to multi-unit dwellings, franchise cable and SMATV could co-exist or at least compete for the same subscribers. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">The Commission\u2019s response, while terse, was reasonably commensurate with the persuasive force of the petitioner\u2019s argument. Petitioner\u2019s \u201ceconomic analysis\u201d purports to document the degree of SMATV penetration into the cable television marketplace. Instead of doing so, it simply assumes that SMATV will replace franchise cable in every apartment of every multi-unit dwelling. Moreover, the data provided by the petitioner, viewed in the most positive light, merely show what the Commission already recognizes: the unregulated entry of SMATV into the cable television marketplace will have a competitive impact upon franchise cable. Petitioner\u2019s argument does not relate to the Commission\u2019s evaluation of the <em>facts; </em>it merely involves a recharacterization of the petitioner\u2019s basic quarrel with the Commission\u2019s <em>policy </em>of allowing SMATV to compete with franchise cable. We have already determined that the Commission has the statutory authority to adopt the policy of preventing local governments from enforcing entry regulations that have the purpose or the effect of restricting SMATV\u2019s competitive position. Evidence purporting to document the degree of SMATV penetration into the cable television marketplace does nothing to undermine the rationality of this decision. <em>See Computer and Communications Industry Ass\u2019n v. FCC, </em>693 F.2d 198, 217 (D.C.Cir.1982) (refusing to engage in a debate about the wisdom of relying on market forces, given that that choice of policy was within the statutory mandate and not arbitrary or capricious), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>938, 103 S.Ct. 2109, 77 L.Ed.2d 313 (1983).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">D. <em>Procedural Objections</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Petitioners claim that the Commission abused its discretion by failing to engage in a rulemaking procedure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1982).

In a factually identical situation, the court in <em>New York State Commission on Cable Television v.

Similarly, in <em>North Carolina Utilities Commission v. FCC, </em>537 F.2d 787 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1027, 97 S.Ct. 651, 50 L.Ed.2d 631 (1976), manufacturers and distributors of communications equipment petitioned the Commission to rule that state regulatory agencies were precluded from restricting or. regulating the interconnection of customer-provided equipment to telephone facilities. The Commission \u201c[a]fter adequate notice and consideration of written and oral submissions by some 46 interested parties,\u201d issued a declaratory judgment saying that it had primary authority over interconnection, thereby precluding any state intervention. 537 F.2d at 791.

In <em>Crisp, </em>the Supreme Court held that Oklahoma\u2019s ban on television advertising of liquor, grounded in the twenty-first amendment, was preempted by federal regulations that required open access. This case, on the other hand, features a challenge by the cable industry and representatives of state and local governments to the Commission\u2019s action as being contrary to <em>national </em>communications policies. Petitioners contend that the state and local regulatory regimes should be upheld because they further communications policies as articulated by previous decisions by the Commission.

In 1977 the Commission reaffirmed its authority over the setting of maximum franchise fees a local government could charge a cable system.

The <em>Orth-O-Vision </em>case also disposes of petitioner NYSCCT's claim that the elimination of entry regulation of SMATV is a reversal of the Commission\u2019s long-standing policy of \"distributional equity.\u201d This policy, petitioner argues, requires cable operators to extend cable lines throughout the entire franchise district. The elimination of entry regulation thus constitutes a reversal of this policy because it will allow SMATV operators to serve only those who reside in large apartment buildings. As the Commission notes, however, the regulation upon which the petitioners in part base this \"longstanding policy,\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 76.31(a)(2) (1976), was repealed in 1978. <em>Applications for Certificate of Compliance, </em>66 F.C.C.2d 380, 392-93 (1977). Even while in force, the regulation \u201c\u2019was not expected to guarantee full construction of the franchise area, which we recognized in some instances might be physically impossible or financially impracticable.\u2019 \u201d Brief for the FCC at 24, <em>quoting </em>66 F.C.C.2d at 393. Moreover, we fail to see how the \"distribution equity\u201d policy could sensibly be applied to SMATV. A franchise authority, having control over the public rights-of-way, can condition a grant of a franchise upon the agreement by the cable operator to make its service available to the entire community by extending cable lines along every right-of-way. Distribution of SMATV throughout a franchise district, however, is dependent not on the construction of cable lines along every public right-of-way but on the installation of an earth station on private property. A franchise authority can no more require the installation of earth stations on private property than it can require the installation of television sets or telephones. In any event, the Commission\u2019s 1978 <em>Orth-O-Vision </em>proceeding presaged preemption of local imposition of \"distributional equity\" requirements, thereby destroying any claims that the present action is a reversal of well-established policy. The Second Circuit's decision did not discuss the \u201cdistributional equity\u201d argument; the preemption of MDS, however, involves the identical \"distributional equity\u201d concerns as the preemption of SMATV.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b897-12\">.

The argument could be raised that since the Commission has chosen not to promulgate rules, the highly deferential standard of <em>WWHT, Inc. v.

Unlike the decision not to promulgate a rule, federal preemption \u2014 whether resulting in the imposition of elaborate federal regulations or the creation of a regulatory vacuum \u2014 is an affirmative exercise of agency power; it involves the compilation of a record and the articulation of the agency\u2019s determination that the state regulatory scheme conflicts with federal objectives.

This contention seems to be based on the assumption that subscribers in large apartments will be forced to subscribe to SMATV and that SMATV service is inferior to the service offered by franchise cable.

First, as the brief for the petitioner notes, New York law requires that traditional cable be made available to every multi-unit dwelling regardless of the owner\u2019s consent.
