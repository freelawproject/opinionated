Jurisdiction for review is founded on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">Allen suffers from Meniere\u2019s disease, a neurological disorder causing dizzyness. This condition required Allen to leave his job as a warehouseman in 1977. Allen applied for disability benefits. He was found disabled as of January 31, 1977, and the Secretary awarded benefits. The Secretary terminated Allen\u2019s benefits in May 1979. Allen promptly requested reconsideration and a hearing. After the hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded that Allen was no longer disabled as of March 1979, and he denied benefits. The Appeals Council affirmed this decision, and Allen brought suit in district court. After twice remanding the case to the ALJ, the district court affirmed the Secretary\u2019s denial of Allen\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">The Secretary\u2019s assertion that Allen is no longer disabled rests primarily on the testimony of Dr. Clifford Schostal. The Secretary retained Dr. Schostal to perform a consultative examination of Allen. Dr. Schostal examined Allen on March 22, 1979. The session lasted approximately thirty minutes, and in that time, Dr. Schos-tal performed a full neurological examination. Based on that examination and on Allen\u2019s medical history, which Dr. Schostal obtained by interviewing Allen, Dr. Schos-tal concluded that although Allen could not return to his former occupation as a warehouseman there was \u201cno reason why this patient could not perform more sedentary activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">In rebuttal, Allen offered the testimony of his treating physician, Dr. David Wilson. Dr. Wilson had treated Allen since his condition became serious in 1973. In 1973 and again in 1977, Dr. Wilson had performed surgery on Allen\u2019s left ear. Although the first operation apparently enjoyed some success in reducing Allen\u2019s symptoms of vertigo and nausea, the second was unsuccessful. Dr. Wilson documented Allen\u2019s condition in a series of letters that he sent to the Secretary\u2019s Disability Determination Services and to Allen\u2019s attorney. In Dr. Wilson\u2019s view, Allen\u2019s recurrent periods of vertigo and imbalance render him totally disabled; in particular, Dr. Wilson opined that Allen could not maintain employment that required steady daily attendance, because on some days, Allen\u2019s condition would prevent him from leaving home.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">In concluding that Allen was no longer disabled, the AU accepted Dr. Schostal\u2019s opinion and rejected Dr. Wilson\u2019s view. The AU felt that Dr. Wilson, because of his close contact with Allen, had lost his ability to render an objective judgment and had become Allen\u2019s advocate. The AU felt that Dr. Schostal was unbiased. Accepting Dr. Schostal\u2019s position, then, the AU decided that because Allen was capable of performing sedentary work he was no longer disabled and no longer entitled to disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-18\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b664-19\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-20\">A prior determination of disability gives rise to a presumption that a disability benefit claimant is disabled. To terminate benefits, therefore, the Secretary must come forward with some evidence that the claimant\u2019s condition has improved. <em>Murray v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 499, 500-01 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Iida v. Heckler, </em>705 F.2d 363, 365 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Patti v. Schweiker, </em>669 F.2d 582, 586-87 (9th Cir.1982). The burden remains on the claimant to prove that he is disabled. <em>Iida, </em>705 F.2d at 365; <em>Patti, </em>669 F.2d at 587. Once the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>demonstrates that he is unable to return to his prior work, however, the Secretary-must find that the claimant is able to engage in other types of \u201csubstantial gainful work which exists in the national economy\u201d in order to terminate benefits. <em>Hall v. Secretary of Health, Education &amp; Welfare, </em>602 F.2d 1372, 1375 (9th Cir.1979); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The role of a court in reviewing the Secretary\u2019s decision is a limited one. We will not set aside the Secretary\u2019s termination of benefits unless \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s findings are based upon legal error or are not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Kail v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 1496, 1497 (9th Cir.1984). Substantial evidence constitutes \u201c \u2018more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 216, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). The issue presented in the present case, then, is whether the Secretary\u2019s decision to terminate Allen\u2019s benefits was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">B. <em>Application of Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Ordinarily, \u201can expert\u2019s report ... is not binding on the ALJ so long as he provides clear and convincing reasons for rejecting the opinion.\u201d <em>Coats v. Heckler, </em>733 F.2d 1338, 1340 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Montijo v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>729 F.2d 599, 601 (9th Cir.1984). Where medical testimony is conflicting, however, it is the AU\u2019s role to determine credibility and to resolve the conflict. <em>Sample v. Schweiker, </em>694 F.2d 639, 642 (9th Cir.1982). If the evidence admits of more than one rational interpretation, we must uphold the decision of the ALJ. <em>Allen v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>726 F.2d 1470, 1473 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">In the present case, the AU\u2019s decision to terminate Allen\u2019s benefits rested on Dr. Schostal\u2019s opinion that Allen did not have \u201cclearcut symptoms of Meniere\u2019s Disease\u201d and was not precluded from some sort of sedentary employment. Dr. Wilson, of course, felt otherwise. Thus, there was a conflict in the medical reports and testimony. In such a situation, the findings of the AU are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Allen, </em>726 F.2d at 1473; <em>Galli v. Celebrezze, </em>339 F.2d 924, 925 (9th Cir.1964); <em>see also Rhinehart v. Finch, </em>438 F.2d 920, 921 (9th Cir.1971) (\u201cWhere there is conflicting evidence sufficient to support either outcome, we must affirm the decision actually made.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Our decision in <em>Murray v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 499 (9th Cir.1983), does not require a different outcome. In <em>Murray, </em>the ALJ, in deciding to terminate the claimant\u2019s benefits, relied on the opinion of a physician who examined the claimant only once; the AU rejected the contrary opinions of two treating physicians. <em>Id. </em>at 501. The court concluded that the ALJ\u2019s decision did not rest on substantial evidence, noting that \u201c[i]f the ALJ wishes to disregard the opinion of the treating physician, he or she must make findings setting forth specific, legitimate reasons for doing so that are based on substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502. <em>Murray </em>and the present case are distinguishable. There, \u201cthe <em>findings </em>of the non-treating physician were the same as those of the treating physician. It was his <em>conclusions </em>that differed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501. Here, instead of a conclusory \u201cdiagnosis\u201d consisting of \u201ccheck marks in boxes on a form supplied by the Secretary,\u201d <em>id., </em>Dr. Schostal\u2019s findings rested on his own neurological examination of Allen. Both Dr. Schostal's findings \u2014 that Allen no longer exhibited \u201cclear-cut symptoms of Meniere\u2019s Disease\u201d but that \u201che may indeed be significantly impaired due to his previous left vestibular nerve ablation\u201d \u2014 and his ultimate conclusion \u2014 that while Allen was unable to return to his previous occupation, he was capable of performing sedentary work \u2014 differed from those of Dr. Wilson. Moreover, to the extent that Dr. Schostal\u2019s opinion rests on objective clinical tests, it must be viewed as substantial evidence that Allen is no longer disabled. <em>See Perez v. Secretary of Health, Education &amp; Welfare, </em>622 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1980) (report of internist designated by the Secretary constituted substantial evidence, even though contradicted by testimony of the claimant\u2019s treating physicians); <em>see also Mongeur v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 1033, 1039 (2d Cir.1983) (\u201cIt is an accepted principle that the opinion of a treating physician is not binding if it is contradicted by substantial evidence, ... and the report of a consultative physician may constitute such evidence.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>To read <em>Murray </em>more broadly as an absolute requirement that the AU must state \u201cclear and convincing reasons\u201d in all situations in which he favors the testimony of a consultative physician over that of the claimant's treating physicians would be contrary to the spirit of the principles expounded by the Supreme Court in <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). The Court decided that, despite their hearsay character, written reports, including reports submitted by consultative physicians called in by the Secretary, may constitute \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d even when the only live medical testimony is offered by the claimant and supports his contention of disability. In doing so, the Court specifically noted, first, that the fact that the government calls in and remunerates consultative physicians does not undermine the independence of those physicians\u2019 opinions or indicate bias in favor of the Secretary and, second, that the social security administration \u201coperates essentially ... as an adjudicator and not as an advocate or adversary,\u201d thereby ensuring reliable and impartial decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 402-03, 91 S.Ct. at 1427. We should not disturb these principles either by second-guessing the determination of the AU with regard to the credibility of the medical testimony offered or by imposing burdensome procedural requirements that facilitate such second-guessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the Secretary\u2019s decision to terminate Allen\u2019s benefits rests on substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-7\">. 20 C.F.R. subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 2.00 B.2, includes Meniere\u2019s Disease in a general list of impairments. The provision notes that \u201c[R]emissions are unpredictable and irregular, but may be longlasting; hence, the severity of impairment is best determined after prolonged observation and serial reexaminations.\" Allen argues that because Dr. Schostal saw Allen only once, his opinion is not entitled to great weight. Presumably, the ALJ knew of this regulation. We decline to depart from the general principle that \" \u2018questions of credibility and resolution of conflicts in the testimony are functions solely of the Secretary.\u2019\" <em>Sample v. Schweiker, </em>694 F.2d 639, 642 (9th Cir.1982) (quoting <em>Waters v. Gardner, </em>452 F.2d 855, 858 n. 7 (9th Cir.1971)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b666-5\">NORRIS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"axm-dedup-2\">concurring separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">I concur in the judgment of the Court that the Secretary\u2019s decision to terminate Allen\u2019s benefits should be affirmed. I write separately, however, because I believe we should affirm the Secretary\u2019s decision without carving out an ill-defined exception to <em>Murray v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 499 (9th Cir.1983). In my view, the ALJ\u2019s decision disregarding the opinion of the treating physician fully satisfies the requirements of <em>Murray.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\"><em>Murray </em>requires that \u201c[i]f the ALJ wishes to disregard the opinion of the treating physician, he or she must make findings setting forth specific, legitimate reasons for doing so that are based on substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502. The ALJ in this case satisfied those requirements by finding that the reports of Dr. Wilson, the treating physician, were largely conclusory and based on the subjective statements of appellant; that Dr. Wilson had taken on the role of appellant\u2019s advocate; and that Dr. Schostal, the non-treating physician, was an impartial expert whose report detailed the results of a specific test, namely, a neurological examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Because I believe the denial of benefits should be affirmed on the narrow ground that the Secretary\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record and the AU\u2019s findings satisfy the requirements of <em>Murray, </em>I find the part of the majority opinion attempting to distinguish <em>Murray </em>unnecessary to the disposition of the appeal. The majority\u2019s attempt is but a needless quibble with established precedent. <em>Murray </em>is the law of the circuit and has been followed repeatedly. <em>See, e.g., Valencia v. Heckler, </em>751 F.2d 1082, 1088 n.7 (9th Cir.1985).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It enunciates a clear standard that is easy for AU\u2019s to understand and to follow.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-13\">. Because it is clearly settled that the <em>Murray </em>requirements are the law of the circuit, most cases following and citing <em>Murray </em>have been disposed of by unpublished memorandum disposition. <em>See, e.g., Jiminez v. Heckler, </em>No. 82-1517, slip op. at 2 (9th Cir. Sept. 14, 1984); <em>Brown v. Heckler, </em>No. 84-3517 slip op. at 2 (9th Cir. Aug. 9, 1984); <em>Hooker v.
