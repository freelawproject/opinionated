We affirmed, <em>Solomon v. Harris, </em>742 F.2d 1438 (2d Cir.1983), applying the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard of <em>United States v. Wight, </em>176 F.2d 376, 379 (2d Cir.1949), <em>cert. denied, </em>338 U.S. 950, 70 S.Ct. 478, 94 L.Ed. 586 (1950). On May 29, 1984, the Supreme Court, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2651, 81 L.Ed.2d 359, vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We again affirm Judge Brieant.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-31\">Appellant was convicted in Bronx County, New York, of murdering Norman Duncan. The evidence at trial established that Solomon\u2019s co-defendant, Joe Miller, was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>drug dealer and that Solomon was his bodyguard. Various residents of the neighborhood in which the shooting occurred performed services for Miller and were given money or drugs in return. Duncan, the victim, and Donald Isom worked as lookouts, while George McFadden was a seller. At some point, Duncan and Isom became upset over the amount of money that Miller was giving them and discussed robbing Miller, who discovered and confronted them with the plan, which they denied. After this incident, both Isom and Duncan received even smaller amounts of money than before from Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">On June 18, 1974, Duncan argued with McFadden over the amount of money Duncan and Isom were receiving and told another resident of the neighborhood that he was going to rob McFadden. When Isom returned home from work that day, Duncan called and asked to meet him. At about the same time, Solomon arrived at 173rd Street and Hoe Avenue in the Bronx and met Miller. Miller gave a gun to Solomon, who sat down in a beach chair in front of a house on Hoe Avenue. McFadden was seated on the stoop of his home on the same side of the block, but further towards 172nd Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Sometime between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m., Duncan and Isom arrived at 173rd and Hoe and walked past Solomon toward McFadden. When they reached McFadden, Isom continued walking toward 172nd Street, while Duncan grabbed McFadden and began a scuffle. At that point Solomon rose from his chair, dropped to one knee and began firing. Duncan staggered across the street. According to the witnesses, including Isom, Isom returned the fire at some point thereafter. On March 25, 1976, a jury convicted Solomon of acting in concert with Miller to commit second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">On appeal to the Appellate Division, Solomon raised for the first time a claim under <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), based on the trial judge\u2019s admission of Isom\u2019s testimony that Miller told him a week after the shooting that \u201cmy man could have killed you too.\u201d The Appellate Division affirmed without opinion. Appellant then began a state <em>coram nobis </em>proceeding in which he raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, based in part on counsel\u2019s failure to raise the <em>Bruton </em>objection. The petition was denied on May 15, 1979. The present petition followed. The only issue before us on remand is whether Solomon was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel within the meaning of <em>Strickland. </em>We conclude that he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Appellant bases his ineffective assistance claim on three events: (1) the failure of counsel to raise the <em>Bruton </em>objection; (2) the decision to call as a witness a court-appointed private investigator; and (3) an alleged failure to prepare adequately for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), an ineffective assistance claim must be based on a showing that a defendant was deprived of the \u201creasonably effective assistance\u201d and that counsel\u2019s \u201cdeficient performance actually prejudiced the defense.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Having examined the transcript of Solomon\u2019s trial, we conclude that neither prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">We conclude that the failure to raise the <em>Bruton </em>objection did not undermine Solomon\u2019s defense, which was based on a factual dispute over identification and a legal claim of justification. We note first that the state\u2019s evidence was very strong with regard to the identification of Solomon as the gunman who hit Duncan. It was not completely airtight with regard to that issue only because defense counsel alertly raised the possibility that the bullet that killed Duncan might have come from Isom\u2019s gun. He called attention to the seemingly downward path of the bullet in Duncan\u2019s body, which, when viewed in light of the fact that Solomon was kneeling while firing, might support a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Solomon\u2019s shots did not kill Duncan. Although counsel carefully constructed this scenario in his closing argument, the jury chose not to believe it, in all probability because the path of the bullet was downward only if Duncan was upright when hit, a circumstance not necessarily consistent with the evidence of Duncan\u2019s struggle with McFadden.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Counsel\u2019s failure to raise the <em>Bruton </em>objection did not undermine the identification prong of the defense strategy. The evidence was that Solomon was Miller\u2019s bodyguard and that Miller had handed him a gun just before the shooting. Miller\u2019s reference to \u201cmy man\u201d thus added nothing. Nor did Miller\u2019s implicit acknowledgment that Solomon fired the fatal shot undermine the Isom-as-killer theory. Rather, that theory was based largely on the proposition that neither Miller nor the other eyewitnesses could be sure who killed Duncan in the turmoil.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Second, the failure to make the <em>Bruton </em>objection in no way impaired the defense of justification raised by Solomon and his co-defendant Miller. Counsel for each argued that Miller and Solomon reasonably believed that Duncan was robbing McFadden and that the use of deadly force to stop the robbery was justified. Since Miller\u2019s statement to Isom was completely consistent with a justification argument, a failure to raise the <em>Bruton </em>objection was harmless. Indeed, to the extent that statement meant \u201cWhen you tried to rob us, my man could have gotten you too,\u201d it actually bolstered the justification defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Appellant also claims that the defense attorney\u2019s decision to call Vincent Garrett, an investigator, to testify that Isom had once said that he did not see Solomon at all on the day of the shooting gravely impaired the defense\u2019s case. Garrett testified on direct that Isom had stated in a taped interview that he had not seen Solomon on June 18, 1974. On cross-examination, however, the prosecutor noted eleven places in the transcript of that interview where Isom stated that Solomon had done the shooting. We view the argument that this testimony vastly strengthened the prosecution\u2019s case as a considerable exaggeration. Isom <em>did </em>state on the tape that he had not seen Solomon on June 18, 1974, and this demonstrated a major inconsistency in Isom\u2019s statements, notwithstanding the number of contrary assertions also on the tape. We can hardly declare as a matter of law that demonstration of the inconsistency was not a reasonable decision even in light of the many other statements on the tape consistent with his testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Appellant argues finally that counsel failed to prepare for trial. He claims, based on the expense voucher submitted by defense counsel, that counsel spent no time on the case whatsoever before trial. However, the voucher demonstrates that counsel mistakenly listed as \u201cTime Spent in Open Court\u201d some work prior to trial. Solomon also claims that counsel never interviewed him in jail. However, the record indicates that he met with counsel on various pre-trial court dates. Finally, we note that our examination of the record as a whole leaves us unpersuaded that defense counsel was unprepared. The identification and justification defenses were reasonable in concept and effectively presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Having concluded that trial counsel provided reasonably effective assistance to Solomon and that counsel\u2019s conduct did not cause actual prejudice to that defense, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
