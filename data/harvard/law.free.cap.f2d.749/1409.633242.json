WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1486-27\">Maintenance employees aboard a non-self-propelled fish processing barge sued to recover unpaid overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-219 (1982) (FLSA). The district court found the maintenance employees exempt from the overtime provisions of the FLSA. These employees appeal that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-28\">Three issues are presented: (1) are maintenance employees aboard non-self-propelled fish processing barges \u201cseamen\u201d within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(6), and therefore, exempt from the overtime compensation provisions of the FLSA; (2) are such employees exempt from overtime as \u201cemployees employed in first processing at sea in conjunction with fishing operations\u201d under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(5); and (3) did the district court err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion seeking a \u201cprotective order\u201d barring solicitation of additional plaintiffs?</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-29\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-30\">Icicle Seafoods, Inc., (Icicle) is a Washington corporation which owns and operates a non-self-propelled seafood processing barge, the Arctic Star. The barge is towed from place to place in the waters of Alaska, British Columbia, or Washington, depending on the run of the catch delivered by a precommitted fishing fleet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>The Arctic Star is towed to new offshore locations from three to five times per year. Movement between locations takes from three to seven days. The barge is then generally anchored in one location for approximately seven weeks, but sometimes as long as seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-5\">Typically, the Arctic Star is manned by a crew of approximately 160. Of that number, the large majority are processors, with three to eight maintenance employees. The processors receive overtime for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. Their duties are to process raw fish or shellfish to a canned or frozen stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-6\">Appellants were maintenance engineers aboard the Arctic Star for periods between 1980 and 1982. Their duties included every repair, maintenance or fabrication necessary to the vessel\u2019s operation and safety while at anchor or under tow. In addition to their regular duties, appellants sometimes operated the anchor winches and tied and untied tender and fishing vessels alongside the barge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-7\">By contract, they received monthly salaries without provision for overtime in exchange for their commitment to work 12 or more hours a day, seven days a week. The parties have stipulated that at issue here are over 8,000 hours of overtime pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-8\">The district court found that the appellants performed work of a maritime character on navigable waters. The court concluded that the appellants were \u201cseamen\u201d and exempt from the overtime provisions of the FLSA under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-9\">The district court concluded also that the Arctic Star was engaged in first processing at sea in conjunction with fishing operations and, as a result, the appellants were exempt from both the FLSA\u2019s minimum pay and overtime provisions under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-10\">Consistent with its findings, the district court ruled that Icicle was not liable to the appellants for overtime compensation. The court also denied Icicle\u2019s motion for an order prohibiting the appellants from soliciting additional maintenance employees to join the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-12\">Exemptions from the FLSA are narrowly construed to ensure maximum coverage by the remedial legislation. Employers who claim that an exemption applies to their employees must show that the employees fit plainly and unmistakably within its terms. <em>A.H. Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, </em>324 U.S. 490, 493, 65 S.Ct. 807, 808, 89 L.Ed. 1095 (1945); <em>Brennan v. South Davis Community Hospital, </em>538 F.2d 859, 865 (10th Cir.1976). Whether Icicle must pay overtime to maintenance employees aboard the Arctic Star, therefore, depends upon whether the FLSA clearly exempts such employees from the overtime requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-14\">I. \u201cSeamen\u201d Exemption</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-15\">Seamen are exempt from the overtime requirements of the FLSA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(6). Appellants contend that the district court erred in its finding that they were \u201cseamen\u201d under this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-16\">The standard of review of exemptions under the FLSA is not clear. <em>Compare Walling v. General Industries Co., </em>330 U.S. 545, 550, 67 S.Ct. 883, 91 L.Ed. 1088 (1947) <em>with Rutherford Food Corp. v. McComb, </em>331 U.S. 722, 67 S.Ct. 1473, 91 L.Ed. 1772 (1947) (interpreted in <em>Bonnette v. California Health &amp; Welfare Agency, </em>704 F.2d 1465, 1469 (9th Cir.1983), as support for a <em>de novo </em>standard) and <em>Levinson v. Spector Motor Service, </em>330 U.S. 649, 67 S.Ct. 931, 91 L.Ed. 1158 (1947) (applied in <em>Jones v. Giles, </em>741 F.2d 245, 248 (9th Cir.1984)). In <em>Walling, </em>the Supreme Court applied a Rule 52(a) clearly erroneous standard to a section 213(a)(1) exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-17\">The lower courts have been inconsistent in applying <em>Walling, </em>even the questions arising under section 213(a)(1). <em>See, e.g., Paul v. Petroleum Equipment Tools Co., </em>708 F.2d 168, 170 (5th Cir.1983) (Without citing <em>Walling, </em>court noted uncertainty in the standard.); <em>Skipper v. Superior Dairies, Inc., </em>512 F.2d 409, 416 (5th Cir.1975) (Without citing <em>Walling, </em>court reapplied regulation and reversed district court.); <em>but see, Hoyt v. General Ins. Co., </em>249 F.2d 589, 590 (9th Cir.1957) (applying <em>Walling) </em>and <em>Wainscoat v. Reynolds Electrical &amp; Engineering Co., </em>471 F.2d 1157, 1161-62 (9th Cir.1973) (ultimate question of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-18\">In <em>Jones v. Giles, </em>741 F.2d at 248, we applied a <em>de novo </em>standard of review to an exemption arising under section 213(b)(1), relying on <em>Levinson. </em>The <em>Levinson </em>Court expressly recognized the distinction between an exception which is measured by regulations promulgated by the Wage and Hour Administrator and an exemption whose scope is determined by interpretation of another act. <em>Levinson, </em>330 U.S. at 676-77 &amp; n. 19, 67 S.Ct. 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>We have held also, that determination of employer under \u00a7 203(d) is a question of law but the clearly erroneous standard applies to review of the underlying facts. <em>Bonnette, </em>704 F.2d at 1469. The regulations underlying \u00a7 203(d) are merely illustrative, not specific as are those underlying \u00a7 213(a)(1). <em>Compare </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 791.2(a) &amp; (b) <em>with </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-4\"><em>Walling </em>does not necessarily control the outcome of the standard of review question in this case. First, <em>Walling </em>dealt with review under \u00a7 213(a)(1). Second, the Court of Appeals in <em>Walling </em>had reversed the district court based on its reevaluation of conflicting testimony of witnesses. <em>Walling, </em>330 U.S. at 550, 67 S.Ct. 883. These facts are undisputed. <em>See Guthrie v. Lady Jane Collieries, Inc., </em>722 F.2d 1141, 1146-47 (3d Cir.1984) (review of a summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-5\">The regulations interpreting \u00a7 213(b)(6) are illustrative and general, more closely paralleling those underlying \u00a7 203(d). <em>Compare </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 783.31-.37 <em>with </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 791.2(a) &amp; (b). For that reason, we apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review to the application of the exemption to the facts and review the facts under a clearly erroneous standard. <em>See Donovan v. Weber, </em>723 F.2d 1388, 1391-92 (8th Cir.1984) (\u00a7 203(r)); <em>Donovan v. Grim Hotel Co., </em>747 F.2d 966, 969-70 n. 4 (5th Cir.1984) (\u00a7 203(r)); <em>Gilreath v. Daniel Funeral Home, Inc., </em>421 F.2d 504, 508-10 (8th Cir.1970) (establishment under \u00a7 213(a)(2)); <em>Homemakers Home &amp; Health Care Services, Inc. v. Carden, </em>538 F.2d 98, 107 (6th Cir.1976) (McCree, J., concurring) (retail concept under \u00a7 213(a)(2)). <em>See also United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1202 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984) (ultimate facts usually reviewed <em>de novo).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1488-8\">The FLSA does not defined \u201cseamen.\u201d The term has, however, been interpreted both in regulations and by the courts. Whether one is a \u201cseaman\u201d depends not on the job title or the location of the worksite, but on the character of the work performed. <em>Walling v. W.D. Haden Co., </em>153 F.2d 196, 199 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>328 U.S. 866, 66 S.Ct. 1373, 90 L.Ed. 1636 (1946); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 783.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-9\">The Wage and Hour Administrator has promulgated regulations which define a seaman as one who performs service primarily to aid in the operation of a vessel as a means of transportation, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 783.33; <em>accord, Walling v. Sternberg Dredging Co., </em>64 F.Supp. 758, 761 (E.D.Mo.), aff<em>'d, </em>158 F.2d 678 (8th Cir.1946). Reasoned interpretations of an act by the agency charged with administering it are entitled to deference. <em>Markair, Inc. v. C.A.B., </em>744 F.2d 1383, 1385 (9th Cir.1984). This circuit relied on the regulation\u2019s definition in <em>Donovan v. Nekton, Inc., </em>703 F.2d 1148 (9th Cir.1983). There we held that marine and electronic technicians whose primary duties aboard a research vessel did not aid the operation of the vessel as a means of transportation were not \u201cseamen\u201d exempt from the FLSA\u2019s overtime provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-11\">One does not become a \u201cseaman\u201d under the FLSA merely by performing services aboard a vessel on navigable waters. For example, bargehands whose primary duties are loading and discharging cargo and who only rarely perform services which aid the vessel as a means of transportation are not seamen. <em>Knudsen v. Lee &amp; Simmons, Inc., </em>163 F.2d 95, 96 (2d Cir.1947); <em>accord, </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 783.36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-12\">Similarly, employees whose duties on movable dredges are primarily industrial but who occasionally perform maritime duties are not seamen. <em>Sternberg Dredging Co. v. Walling, </em>158 F.2d 678, 681 (8th Cir.1946). The critical factor is whether the employee\u2019s duties primarily aid navigation of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-13\">The record indicates, and Icicle\u2019s counsel conceded at oral argument, that the Arctic Star remained anchored most of the time. During these periods, the appellants primarily monitored, maintained and repaired the processing machinery and electric power generators. Although some of their work may have been of a maritime character, the dominant employment was industrial maintenance. The maritime work was incidental and occasional, taking but a small portion of the work time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-14\">We conclude that these employees, while working on a barge anchored in navigable waters, are principally employed not as exempt seamen but as industrial maintenance employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-15\">II. At-Sea First Processing Exemption</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-16\">The district court found that the appellants were also excluded from the minimum pay and overtime provisions of the FLSA as workers engaged in: (1) first processing of fish, (2) at sea, (3) in conjunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>tion with fishing operations. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(5). Because we find that the last of these elements is not present, we need not address the appellant\u2019s argument as to the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-5\">Again the question arises which standard of review to apply to an exemption under the FLSA. Because the district court incorrectly interpreted the regulation, we can review the question in this instance as one of law. <em>See Helland v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>488 F.2d 496, 497 (9th Cir.1973). <em>See also Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1960, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984) (\u201cRule 52(a) does not inhibit an appellate court\u2019s power to correct errors of law ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-8\">Under the regulations, processing performed \u201cin conjunction with fishing operations\u201d is interpreted to mean processing which takes place on the catcher vessel. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 784.131. This regulation is consistent with the Senate Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1489-9\">The purpose of [the \u00a7 213(a)(5) exemption] is to make certain that the Act will be uniformly applicable to <em>all employees on the fishing vessel </em>including those employees on the vessel who may be engaged in these activities at sea as an incident to the fishing operations <em>conducted by the vessel.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1489-10\">S.Rep. No. 145, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 33, <em>reprinted in </em>1961 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1620, 1652-53 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-11\">Icicle argues that the Senate Report is merely illustrative of one fact pattern to which the exemption applies, and does not impliedly preclude application of the exemption to processing done on nonfishing vessels. They argue that the regulation is unduly restrictive and should be rejected, relying on <em>Mitchell v. Trade Winds Co., </em>289 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-12\">Reading the regulation in light of the general policy that exemptions under the FLSA are narrowly construed, we conclude that the Senate Report was not intended to be merely illustrative. The administrative interpretation embodied in the regulation is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-13\">III. Protective Order Against Future Solicitation</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-14\">In the event of a remand, Icicle seeks consideration of its cross-appeal. Icicle contends that the district court erred in denying its motion for a \u201cprotective order\u201d prohibiting solicitation of other plaintiffs. Because we find insufficient evidence of solicitation on this record, we cannot say that the district court erred in refusing this injunctive-type relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-17\">Reversed and remanded for calculation of damages. If there be a subsequent appeal, it will return to this panel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
