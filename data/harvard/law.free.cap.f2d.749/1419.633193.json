We do not address the additional contentions advanced by the City because we have concluded that the Secretary lacked jurisdiction over the complaint since the grant officer failed to make a final determination within 120 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-18\">The City contends that under section 106 of CETA (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(b)), a final determination must be issued not later than 120 days after receiving a complaint that a recipient of financial assistance has failed to comply with the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-19\">Section 816(b) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1496-20\">Whenever the Secretary receives a complaint from any interested person or organization ... that a recipient of financial assistance ... is failing to comply with the requirements of this chapter, the regulations under this Act, or the terms of the comprehensive employment and training plan, the Secretary shall investigate the matter. The Secretary shall conduct such investigation, and make the final determination ... not later than 120 days after receiving the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1496-21\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-22\">The Secretary initiated these proceedings against the City because he believed the City had violated CETA residency requirements contained in his regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-23\">Persons receiving financial assistance under a public service employment program must \u201creside within the area qualifying for assistance\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 824. The Secretary has implemented the residency requirement of section 824 by promulgating 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 675.5-5(b) CETA regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 675.6(a). Pursuant to these regulations, the City was required to hire persons who were residents of Snohomish County. The City, as a recipient of CETA funds, hired the first applicants on July 2, 1979. The others were hired on February 4, 1980. A report was received by the Secretary\u2019s local grant officer on April 16, 1981, that these four employees had not been residents of Snohomish County at the time of their application. An informal hearing was conducted by the grant officer on January 19, 1982. On March 25, 1982, 343 days after the first report, the grant officer issued his final determination that the complaint was valid. The grant officer ordered the City to repay to the United States Department of Labor (hereinafter Department of Labor) the CETA funds expended for the salaries of the four participants. The City was granted a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (hereinafter ALJ). The ALJ affirmed the grant officer\u2019s final determination. The decision of the ALJ was adopted by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-5\">The Department of Labor, while conceding that the final determination was not made within the 120-day period prescribed by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(b), argues that the limitation period set forth in the statute is not jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-6\">The jurisdictional question presented by the City has not been addressed by this court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Third Circuit, however, has ruled on this precise issue. In <em>Lehigh Valley Manpower Program v. Donovan, </em>718 F.2d 99 (3d Cir.1983), the court held that the failure of the Secretary to make a final determination within 120 days after becoming aware of a potential violation of a regulation prohibiting nepotism in hiring was barred by section 816(b). <em>Id. </em>at 102. The court rejected the conclusion of the ALJ that the time limit set forth in section 816(b) was advisory. <em>Id. </em>In footnote three of its brief, the Department of Labor asks us not to follow <em>Lehigh </em>because that court \u201cignored the applicable legislative history.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-10\">We begin our analysis of section 816(b) by noting that in using the word \u201cshall\u201d Congress appears to require the Secretary to make a final determination concerning the merits of a complaint within 120 days. Nevertheless, the Department of Labor urges us <em>not </em>to give the word \u201cshall\u201d its plain meaning. In addressing a similar contention, we stated as follows: \u201cAlthough a court is not absolutely forbidden from considering the legislative history when construing a statute which is plain on its face, <em>Heppner v. Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., </em>665 F.2d 868, 872 (9th Cir.1981) it is \u2018a step to be taken cautiously.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tulalip Tribes of Washington v. FERC, </em>732 F.2d 1451, 1454 (9th Cir.1984). Statutory language is generally construed according to the plain meaning of the words used by Congress \u201cabsent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary.\u201d <em>Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-11\">We agree with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s observation that \u201c[u]se of the word \u2018shall\u2019 generally indicates a mandatory intent unless a convincing argument to the contrary is made.\u201d <em>Sierra Club v. Train, </em>557 F.2d 485, 489 (5th Cir.1977). The legislative history supports a mandatory interpretation of the 120-day time limitation in section 816(b). The Senate Report noted that: \u201c[i]n some cases grievances have been either ignored, or there have been interminable delays.\u201d S.Rep. No. 95-891, 95th Cong., 2nd Sess. 42, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 4480 at 4522. In summarizing the provisions of the proposed law, the Senate Report states: \u201c[a]fter a complaint is filed the Secretary <em>must </em>make a determination on the complaint on the merits of the case within 120 days.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4523 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>The Department of Labor has ignored this portion of the statute\u2019s legislative history, relying instead on the comments of Congressman Obey during the debate on his amendment on the floor of the House of Representatives. During those proceedings, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1498-4\">Mr. Hawkins. Mr. Chairman, we have seen the amendment, we accept the amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1498-5\">If the gentlemen would further yield, do I understand from the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] that if the determination is not made in a specified time it shall not affect the Secretary\u2019s jurisdiction in the matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1498-6\">Mr. Obey. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1498-7\">Mr. Hawkins. With that understanding we do accept the amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_T\">124 Cong.Rec. 25230-25231 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-8\">Congressman Obey\u2019s remarks were made on August 9, 1978. The Joint Explanatory Statement of the Senate and House Conference Report, issued on October 11, 1978 makes no reference to these House floor debate comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-9\">While it appears that when Congressman Obey says \u201cshall\u201d he sometimes means \u201cmay,\u201d the later Senate and House Conference Report construed the proposed final draft of the statute to require that the Secretary \u201cmust\u201d make a final determination within 120 days. The Supreme Court has wisely cautioned that \u201c[t]he remarks of a single legislator, even the sponsor, are not controlling in analyzing legislative history.\u201d <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 311, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 1722, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979). We are not persuaded by the Department of Labor\u2019s reliance on Congressman Obey\u2019s comments that we should abandon our judicial responsibility to give plain mandatory language its ordinary meaning. We see no principled reason to create an intercircuit conflict on the meagre showing made by the Department of Labor in support of its reading of section 816(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-11\">We conclude therefore, that section 816(b) is jurisdictional and that Congress intended to preclude any action on a complaint if the Secretary failed to make a final determination within 120 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-12\">Our conclusion that the word \u201cshall,\u201d is mandatory is fully supported by the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, </em>447 U.S. 807, 100 S.Ct. 2486, 65 L.Ed.2d 532 (1980). In <em>Mohasco, </em>the Court was called upon to decide whether the following language contained in section 706(e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was mandatory: \u201cA charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful [conduct] occurred ...\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-14\">In holding that this language was mandatory, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1498-15\">[I]n a statutory scheme in which Congress carefully prescribed a series of deadlines measured by numbers of days \u2014 rather than months or years \u2014 we may not simply interject an additional 60 day period into the procedural scheme. We must respect the compromise embodied in the words chosen by Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APC\"><em>Id. </em>at 825-26, 100 S.Ct. at 2496-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-16\">In drafting section 816(b), Congress arrived at 120 days as the appropriate period during which the Secretary should make a final determination of the merits of an alleged violation of CETA. The Department of Labor would have us add 223 days to the time prescribed by the statute. We cannot do so without impermissibly usurping the separate legislative powers of the Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-17\">In its briefs before this court, the Department of Labor points out that in our decision in <em>Marshall v. Local Union 1374, </em>558 F.2d 1354 (9th Cir.1977), we took the position in interpreting the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, that delay by the Secretary of Labor was not fatal to his jurisdiction. In <em>Marshall, </em>we adopted the rule set forth in <em>Fort Worth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number><em>National Corp. v. Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp., </em>469 F.2d 47 (5th Cir.1972) that: \u201c[a] statutory time period is not mandatory unless it both expressly requires an agency or public official to act within a particular time period and specifies a consequence for failure to comply with the provision.\u201d <em>Fort Worth, </em>469 F.2d at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-5\">The later decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Mohasco, </em>discussed above, concluded that mandatory language prescribing a fixed time limit on administrative action was jurisdictional although there was no language in the statute setting forth the consequences which would flow from failure to meet the deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-6\">To the extent that <em>Marshall </em>is in conflict with <em>Mohasco, </em>it has been overruled <em>sub silentio. </em>As we stated in <em>LeVick v. Skaggs Cos., </em>701 F.2d 777 (9th Cir.1983): \u201cwhen existing Ninth Circuit precedent has been undermined by subsequent Supreme Court decisions, this court may reexamine that precedent without the convening of an <em>en banc </em>panel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-7\">We have reexamined <em>Marshall </em>in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Mohasco. </em>We decline to follow the rule expressed in <em>Marshall </em>that the consequences of a failure to meet a mandatory time limit must be expressed before we can find that the requirement is jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-8\">Because we have concluded that the 120-day time limit for making a final determination set forth in section 816(b) is jurisdictional, the Secretary\u2019s order that the CETA funds must be repaid is REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1496-13\">. CETA has been replaced by the Job Training Partnership Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1501, <em>et seq. </em>Pending cases continue to be adjudicated under CETA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1497-7\">.
