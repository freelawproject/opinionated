Because of pretrial publicity the venue for petitioner\u2019s trial was transferred from the state court in the county of indictment to the state court in an adjoining county, and petitioner was tried and convicted in the adjoining county. Some of the incidents of sentencing were, in the physical sense, done in one county, some in the other. The county of indictment is located in the federal Northern District of Alabama, the county of trial and conviction in the federal Southern District of Alabama. These facts raise two substantive questions: where could petitioner file a federal petition for habeas corpus under the provision of Sec. 2241(d) that permits filing in the federal district in which the prisoner was convicted and sentenced, and what could the court of filing do with the petition?</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-6\">Petitioner is in state custody in the federal Southern District of Alabama. He filed his federal habeas petition in the Northern District. The district judge in the Northern District, uncertain whether his court had jurisdiction and venue as the district of conviction and sentence, declined to decide whether his court had jurisdiction to entertain the merits of the petition and instead transferred the case to the Southern District, where unquestionably the case could be entertained based upon place of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-7\">Petitioner filed a notice of appeal, contending that the district court could not transfer the case without first determining whether it had jurisdiction to decide the merits. We hold that where substantial incidents of conviction and sentence are divided between two federal judicial districts, either district court is the court of conviction and sentence within the meaning of Sec. 2241(d) and has power to entertain the petition on its merits or transfer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-13\">In his opinion accompanying the transfer order District Judge Acker of the Northern District described the unusual procedural circumstances of petitioner\u2019s case. The murder for which Dobard was convicted and sentenced to death occurred in Sumter County, located in the Northern District. Dobard was indicted in the Circuit Court of Sumter County, and numerous pretrial motions were filed and heard in that court. Because of pretrial publicity, the state circuit judge, ruling from the bench in Sumter County, transferred the trial of the case to the Circuit Court of Marengo County, located in the Southern District.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1581-14\">All files pertaining to the case were sent to the Circuit Court of Marengo County. Various pretrial motions were heard in Sumter County, but counsel have stipulated that after the transfer of the case all orders were entered by the Circuit Court of Marengo County. After the trial and conviction in Marengo County the sentencing hearing required by Alabama law to be held before the judge was heard in Sumter County and petitioner was there orally sentenced to death. The judge signed the sentencing order while in Marengo. Do-bard\u2019s motion for a new trial was received by the circuit clerk in Sumter and then sent on to be filed in Marengo. The hearing on the new trial motion was conducted in Sumter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-15\">Under these peculiar circumstances the district judge was faced with the question whether the Northern District or the Southern District was the district where Dobard was convicted and sentenced within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1506\">*1506</page-number>the meaning of Sec. 2241, or whether both districts might be treated as the district of conviction and sentence, or whether neither district could be.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-4\">Judge Acker recognized the potential problem presented by these unusual facts and voiced his concerns. He held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1582-5\">While this case presents interesting questions concerning jurisdiction and venue, and tempts the Court to opine on its jurisdiction under this peculiar set of circumstances, no purpose would be served if this cause were allowed to proceed in this Court. Such a decision undoubtedly would be subjected to appellate review and the delay which would accompany that process. What both petitioner and respondent want and deserve is a speedy, federal hearing and decision on the merits. This Court finds that it has jurisdiction over this petition at least for the limited purpose of transfer and that the Southern District certainly has both jurisdiction and venue to hear the merits of the case. This Court will transfer this petition to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1582-6\">The transfer order was entered. The case was assigned to Judge Cox of the Southern District. He entered an order noting his agreement with Judge Acker\u2019s view that the transfer order was not appealable. He stated his intention to proceed with adjudication of the habeas petition, and the petition is now being litigated in due course in the Southern District.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-7\">We hold that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from Judge Acker\u2019s transfer order. Although apparently no court has expressly ruled on whether transfer orders under Sec. 2241 are final, courts have fairly consistently held that transfer orders brought under other statutes are not generally final orders for the purpose of appeal. In <em>Stelly v. Employers National Insurance Co., </em>431 F.2d 1251, 1253-54 (5th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Stelly v. Bauer Dredging Co., </em>401 U.S. 908, 91 S.Ct. 866, 27 L.Ed.2d 806 (1971), we held that a case transferred under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404(a) (1982)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is interlocutory. <em>See also Matter of Macon Uplands Venture, </em>624 F.2d 26, 26-27 (5th Cir.1980). The Third Circuit has recently ruled that these <em>forum non conveniens </em>orders do not fall within the exception articulated in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Coastal Steel Corp. v. Tilghman Wheelabrator Ltd., </em>709 F.2d 190, 195 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 349, 78 L.Ed.2d 315 (1983), the Third Circuit held that transfer orders are not easily separable from the merits of the litigation and do not meet the requirement that the order be effectively unreviewable on appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-14\">Moreover, we recently held that transfer orders under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (1982)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are also not final orders and do not fall within the collateral order doctrine of <em>Cohen. See Middlebrooks v. Smith, </em>735 F.2d 431, 433 (11th Cir.1984). Relying upon our reasoning in <em>Stelly, supra, </em>we held that cases transferred for lack of jurisdiction under Sec. 1631 are as nonappealable and inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1507\">*1507</page-number>locutory as those transferred under Sec. 1404 for lack of venue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1583-5\">If, therefore, in the instant case the district court had decided that jurisdiction under Sec. 2241(d) was not present in the Northern District, the court could have transferred the case to the Southern District under Sec. 1631. That transfer order would not have been appealable. Moreover, even if the district court had determined that jurisdiction and venue were present in the Northern District and had transferred the case pursuant to Sec. 2241(d), the court\u2019s order would still not be a final order reviewable by this court. Such a transfer is one between two courts with concurrent jurisdiction and is essentially a <em>forum non conveniens </em>determination akin to that made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) (1982). <em>See McClure v. Hopper, </em>577 F.2d 938, 940 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied sub nom. McClure v. Balkcom, </em>439 U.S. 1077, 99 S.Ct. 854, 59 L.Ed.2d 45 (1979); <em>Dillworth v. Barker, </em>465 F.2d 1338, 1341 (5th Cir.1972); <em>Reed v. Henderson, </em>463 F.2d 485, 487 (5th Cir.1972). Transfer orders based on <em>forum non conveniens </em>determinations, whether brought pursuant to Sec. 1404 or Sec. 2241, are nonreviewable interlocutory orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-6\">Petitioner seeks, however, to identify finality through another approach. He contends that the refusal of the district court to decide whether it had jurisdiction to determine the merits is within the doctrine of pragmatic or practical finality. <em>See, e.g., Gillespie v. U.S. Steel Corp., </em>379 U.S. 148, 152, 85 S.Ct. 308, 311, 13 L.Ed.2d 199, 203 (1964). This effort will not work. Central to this contention is petitioner\u2019s argument that the refusal to decide the jurisdiction issue deprived him of the forum of his choice. The contention assumes that petitioner was entitled to a ruling on whether the Northern District was a forum that he could choose. In our holding, <em>infra, </em>we agree that the Northern District was one of the available forums of choice. The district court, however, eschewed reaching the unique issue of plenary jurisdiction raised by the facts and instead exercised a more limited power to transfer the case. The court recognized the quicksand into which it would fall if it decided the issue of plenary jurisdiction. No matter how it ruled, the jurisdiction issue would remain alive in any appeal. If it found that it had jurisdiction, retained the case and denied the writ, petitioner could urge on appeal that the district court had no jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Counsel for petitioner stated at oral argument that if jurisdiction were found to exist in the Northern District, they could not and would not urge on appeal that the district court lacked jurisdiction. We have confidence in their statement, but jurisdiction cannot be conferred by waiver or non-assertion by counsel, and neither waiver nor non-assertion would affect the duty of this court to search the record for jurisdiction. Nor could counsel\u2019s non-assertion bind successor counsel, if there were such.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-12\">We hold that while the district court had plenary power over the case (a power it did not decide that it had), it was not required to enter an order defining the outer boundaries of this jurisdiction when it had the power, within those boundaries, to enter a transfer order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1508\">*1508</page-number>Furthermore, an order to transfer pursuant to Sec. 2241(d) made without first deciding whether or not the district court has jurisdiction to hear the merits of the case is a nonreviewable interlocutory order. There is no justification for distinguishing between transfer orders under Sees. 2241(d), 1404, and 1631 where the jurisdictional question has been answered, and transfer orders under Sec. 2241(d) where the issue is not reached. In both situations the transfer orders are pursuant to statute. The question becomes, therefore, not whether the transfer orders are authorized by statute but whether they are justified by the circumstances. And it is that question, the wisdom of the district court\u2019s decision to transfer a case under Secs. 1631, 1404, or 2241(d), that we consistently treat as nonreviewable and interlocutory. \u201cIt is hard to see how any order could be less \u2018final\u2019 than one which merely transfers an action for trial from one district to another in the federal judicial system....\u201d <em>Stelly, supra, </em>at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-6\">We conclude that we have no appellate jurisdiction, and the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-7\">Petitioner\u2019s effort to obtain review of the district court\u2019s refusal to rule on its plenary jurisdiction fits better within the concept of mandamus than of appeal, and we treat the notice of appeal and supporting documents as a petition for mandamus. Dobard complains that the transfer order, itself not appealable, was entered by a court that lacked the power to enter the order unless and until it determined that it had plenary jurisdiction, which it declined to do; thus the court arguably acted without power \u2014 beyond its jurisdiction \u2014 which is a traditional basis for mandamus. But, treating the matter before us as a petition for mandamus, the petition must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-8\">Section 2241(d) does not address the situation in which substantial incidents of conviction and sentence occur in each of two federal districts. Congress hardly envisioned a case like this one when it amended Sec. 2241 in 1966 to add the alternative forum consisting of the district within which the court of conviction and sentence was held. Division of incidents of sentence and conviction between two courts, each lying in a separate federal district, obviously is not the usual situation. Yet changes of venue, or other transfers made pursuant to state law, do occur, particularly in cases involving excessive trial publicity. Inevitably some transfers will be to courts located in other federal judicial districts. Indeed, the concept of undue publicity will often necessitate transfer to a court a considerable distance away and beyond the reach of the publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-10\">We have no hesitation in saying that if Congress had thought about the matter it would have rejected out of hand any notion that where incidents of conviction and sentence are divided between two federal districts, neither district would be an available forum as the place of conviction and sentence. Likewise, we are equally certain that Congress would not have had in mind that a \u201cdivided incident\u201d case would fall into the kind of jurisdictional snarl that has arisen in this case because of uncertainty of the status of the respective districts as the situs (or situses) of conviction \u00e1nd sentence. Nor would Congress have intended that there be preliminary litigation to determine which district has the most contacts with the case. All of these possibilities are antithetical to the concept of habeas as a plain, speedy and efficient remedy, enjoying priority in both trial and appellate courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2243, 2248; App. One, \u00b6 (a)(3), Eleventh Circuit Rules. <em>See also Lehman v. Lycoming County Children\u2019s Services Agency, </em>458 U.S. 502, 102 S.Ct. 3231, 73 L.Ed.2d 928 (1982); <em>Hensley v. Municipal Court, </em>411 U.S. 345, 93 S.Ct. 1571, 36 L.Ed.2d 294 (1973); <em>Carafas v. LaVallee, </em>391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968). In this case it is petitioner who insists on attempting to proceed in the district of his choice (though, as pointed out above, the insistence might be an empty one, because if he succeeded the court would have the power, subject to review for abuse of discretion, to transfer the case to the Southern District. See n. 8, supra). In the next case, when a habeas petitioner has been successful, the state might well contend that the case was filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1509\">*1509</page-number>and decided in the wrong forum. The Great Writ need not be burdened with these uncertainties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-4\">The possibilities we have described and rejected are contrary to the congressional intention to create an additional available forum. Congress intended an additional forum (or forums), not a Gordian Knot over availability of the new type of forum. Congress was addressing solutions, not creating problems. Having rejected other possible constructions, we hold that where substantial incidents of conviction and sentence have occurred in each of two federal judicial districts, the alternative forum provision of Sec. 2241(d), though phrased in the singular, would have been intended by Congress to be treated as in the plural. <em>See </em>1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (1982) (\u201cIn determining the meaning of any Act or resolution of Congress, words importing the singular number may extend and be applied to several persons or things....\u201d); <em>see also U.S. v. Mikelberg, </em>517 F.2d 246 (5th Cir.1975) (applying statute to Truth in Lending Act), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 909, 96 S.Ct. 1104, 47 L.Ed.2d 313 (1976); <em>accord Toy Manufacturers of America, Inc. v. Consumer Product Safety Commission, </em>630 F.2d 70 (2d Cir.1980). Each of the two courts will, therefore, have jurisdiction along with the concurrent jurisdiction of the district of custody. The district court, having such jurisdiction, may entertain the petition on the merits or may enter a transfer order as provided by Sec. 2241. Therefore, although the district court in this case did not address the jurisdiction issue it acted within its power when it entered the transfer order, because it had plenary jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1585-7\">The dissenting opinion does not correctly state what this court has decided when it says that this decision \u201cgives the district court unbounded discretion to transfer 2241 cases in the same manner they transfer Section 1404(a) cases.\u201d Rather what the court decides \u2014 and all it decides \u2014 is that where substantial incidents of conviction and sentence are divided between two federal district courts, both of such courts have jurisdiction of a habeas corpus petition (along with the concurrent jurisdiction of the district of custody).</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-13\">The approach of the dissenting opinion would simply proliferate the Gordian Knot. Judge Clark suggests that we make an appellate finding that Northern District of Alabama is the \u201cplace of conviction and sentence,\u201d an issue not reached by the district court. That finding would cut the Knot for this case. In the next case, however, such a finding would have to be made initially at the district court level, creating in that case the intractable difficulty of having a preliminary trial, followed by possible appeal or mandamus, on the issue of whether the petition has been filed in the correct court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-14\">Petitioner\u2019s effort to appeal the order of the district court is DISMISSED. Treating petitioner\u2019s effort as a petition for mandamus, the petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1580-12\">.

While we do not rest our decision on this alternative ground, we note that at least one court has held that a district court without jurisdiction under Sec. 2241(d) may transfer the petition to the appropriate court pursuant to Sec. 2241(d). <em>See Ayala v.

He was sentenced in that county, all of which occurred in the Northern District of Alabama. The state court transferred trial of the case to adjoining Marengo County where the jury verdict of guilty was returned. Marengo County is in the Southern District of Alabama. Clearly the Northern District of Alabama has jurisdiction of a petition for writ of habeas corpus under these circumstances and under the statute. Just as clearly, Dobard is given the option by the statute of filing his habeas petition in the Northern District of Alabama. The district court erred in not considering whether it had jurisdiction. I would return the case to that court with directions that it consider whether there were any reasons in furtherance of justice why the case should not be retained in the Northern District of Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-13\">I think the majority errs in its treatment of this vital right of a prisoner to have his case heard in the district nearest where the crime occurred and thus where normally the witnesses would be. Habeas corpus, although technically a civil proceeding is for all practical purposes a criminal matter. Therefore, this, although a civil case, is not properly compared to the broader discretion permitted to a district court to transfer a Section 1404(a) case for the convenience of the parties. Here the district court\u2019s discretion is bounded by the requirement that the prisoner has the first election and the court must have sound reasons for transferring the venue of a Section 2254 case. Because, as the majority points out, the district court\u2019s decision is not an immediate appealable order<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and because a reviewing court will be reluctant to overturn an otherwise error free habeas decision solely on the grounds of improper transfer of venue, the district court has a particularly heavy burden to consider these motions with care. <em>See generally </em>2 Wright, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 347, p. 282-83. I am greatly concerned that the majority opinion, the first apparently in the country to consider this problem, gives the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1511\">*1511</page-number>trict court unbounded discretion to transfer 2241 cases in the same manner they transfer Section 1404(a) cases. The majority goes beyond the intent of Congress. For these reasons I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1586-11\">.
