MARTIN, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Counsel for appellant Dennis Wolfel appeals the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his motion for attorney\u2019s fees. This appeal requires us to clarify the procedure by which counsel may seek, and the court may determine, permissible fees for appellate litigation when the motion for attorney\u2019s fees raises disputed factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In the underlying action, Ohio state prison inmate Dennis Wolfel prevailed in a <em>pro se </em>action in the district court on a section 1983 claim alleging denial of his first amendment right to petition for redress of grievances. The trial court awarded Wol-fel nominal damages but denied punitive damages. The State appealed and Wolfel cross-appealed the denial of punitive damages. Wolfel was represented on that appeal by attorney Michael Geltner. In an opinion filed on June 3, 1983, this Court affirmed both aspects of the trial court\u2019s decision. 707 F.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">On June 9, 1983, Geltner moved this Court for an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The Court took that motion under advisement. On June 27, 1983, the clerk of this Court, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(a), issued as mandate this Court\u2019s judgment of June 3, 1983. The mandate provided that each party would bear its own costs of the appeal. On July 19, 1983, this Court issued a second order denying attorney Geltner\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. The Court\u2019s order was without prejudice to Geltner\u2019s right to resubmit the motion and supporting documents to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Geltner renewed his motion in the district court. That court, relying on our decision in <em>Buian v. Baughard, </em>687 F.2d 859 (6th Cir.1982), held that a district court may not award attorney\u2019s fees to counsel for appellate work when we have declined to award costs to the party who seeks attorney\u2019s fees. It is from this decision of the district court that Wolfel now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">In <em>Buian </em>we held that recovery of costs <em>on </em>appeal is \u201ca prerequisite to the award of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 860. Our holding was based on the literal language of section 1988, which provides that in appropriate cases attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded \u201cas part of the costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That literal reading of section 1988 is supported by the policy of allowing the courts at each level of the federal judiciary \u2014 the district courts, the courts of appeals, and the Supreme Court \u2014 to determine the appropriateness of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for the work done in each particular court. <em>Id. </em>at 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">Problems may arise, however, when counsel submits to the appeals court a motion for attorney\u2019s fees that, as here, raises disputed issues of fact. Here, appellee Bates questioned the validity of the rate charged and hours expended by counsel for appellant Wolfel. Faced with this factual issue, this Court, in its order dismissing appellant Wolfel\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, deferred to the superior factfinding powers of the district court. Unfortunately, by the date of the entry of this Court\u2019s order, our Clerk had already issued a mandate denying Wolfel\u2019s request for costs. The district court was thus prevented by our decision in <em>Buian </em>from considering Wolfel\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">To avoid the double obstacles of inadequate factfinding and a collision with our <em>Buian </em>decision, the appeals court may by order pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(a) delay the date of the issuance of the mandate until the court determines whether to grant, deny, or remand to the district court the movant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. In order that counsel Geltner may receive a fair determination of his motion for attorney\u2019s fees, we will recall the mandate in Nos. 82-3059 and 82-3060 and remand the case to the district court for appropriate proceedings to determine the amount of attorney\u2019s fees for these proceedings from the original complaint through the proceedings on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">To forestall any future delays in bringing this case to a close, we note that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>regard as frivolous the State\u2019s contentions, made before this Court, that Wolfel did not substantially prevail in this Court. The State is correct in observing that we upheld the district court\u2019s judgment on the merits on grounds more narrow than those invoked by the district court. The district court arguably held unconstitutional the State\u2019s penal rule Class II, Rule 26. We held unconstitutional the rule only as applied to Wolfel. Under either rationale the result is the same: Wolfel won.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We also note that this is not an appropriate ease for application of the \u201ccarving out\u201d principles of <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). Geltner\u2019s cross-appeal for punitive damages and his defense of the State\u2019s appeal of the award of nominal damages involved a \u201ccommon core of facts\u201d and was, indeed, a \u201csingle claim.\u201d <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1940. Therefore, the <em>Hensley </em>Court\u2019s direction to separate successful from unsuccessful claims is inapplicable. \u201cInstead the district court should focus on the significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We bring these conclusions to the district court\u2019s attention only in order to prevent yet another round of \u201cthe least socially productive type of litigation imaginable: appeals from awards of attorney\u2019s fees....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1944 (Brennan, J., with Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Accordingly, the district court should determine the appropriate amount of attorney\u2019s fees for attorney Geltner\u2019s work on the original petition on appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment on the merits, the earlier motion for attorney\u2019s fees in this court, the motion for attorney\u2019s fees in the district court, the appeal of the denial which is now before us, and the proceedings on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The judgment of the district court is vacated. Wolfel\u2019s prior motion to recall the mandate in Nos. 82-3059 and 82-3060 was denied before oral argument was heard in this case. We will <em>sua sponte </em>recall the mandate in Nos. 82-3059 and 82-3060, direct that costs be entered for Wolfel, and remand that case to the district court for an award of attorney\u2019s fees consistent with this opinion. Appropriate orders shall be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Costs of this appeal are awarded to appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
