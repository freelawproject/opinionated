The district court summarily dismissed the petition, noting that \u201c[adjudication was withheld in his [state] case,\u201d that appellant had \u201creceived ... a three year period of probation,\u201d that he was \u201cnot in custody\u201d and that he \u201ccannot claim he will suffer collateral consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The findings of the district court are insufficient to enable us to reach the merits on this appeal, for there is nothing in the record to support the conclusion that appellant \u201ccannot claim he will suffer collateral consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings, findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether appellant now suffers, or will suffer, any collateral legal consequences under Florida law as a result of the crime for which he was convicted, the sentence he received, the record, if any, of his conviction, and appellant\u2019s present status. We also direct that the district court appoint counsel to represent petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
