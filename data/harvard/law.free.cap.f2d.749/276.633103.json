Relying on <em>Bush v. Lucas,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and for lack of jurisdiction over the defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court dismissed the case on both grounds. Because we agree that <em>Bush v. Lucas </em>is controlling, we affirm the dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and, therefore, do not address the personal jurisdiction issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-18\">Ernest A. Gremillion, an IRS employee, sued his immediate supervisor and other IRS officials for wrongful discharge from federal service in violation of his first and fifth amendment rights. Gremillion\u2019s complaint states that Larry Hollingsworth, Gremillion\u2019s immediate supervisor and Group Manager of the Criminal Investigation Division, and Herbert Hinchman, Chief of the Criminal Investigation Division, conspired to have him removed from federal service because he objected to Hollings-worth\u2019s unfavorable evaluation of him. He further alleged that they conspired with Frank Helgert, a Review Office official, to prepare an \u201cinvalid\u201d evaluation of one of Gremillion\u2019s criminal tax cases as the basis for his removal from federal service, and that Jack Chivatero, the District Director, recommended Gremillion\u2019s removal on the basis of his representative\u2019s recommendation without reviewing the file. All of these actions, according to Gremillion, were undertaken in \u201cbad faith\u201d and \u201cwere designed to punish [him] for exercising his right to free speech by questioning the authority and correctness of his supervisors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-20\">Although it is questionable whether the first amendment protects Gremillion for his intra-office speech criticizing his superiors,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> even if we assume that it does, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Gremillion has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Bush v. Lucas.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In <em>Bush, </em>the Supreme Court declined \u201cto authorize a new nonstatutory damages remedy for federal employees whose first amendment rights are violated by their superiors.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It noted that federal courts must take account of any \u201cspecial factors counseling hesitation\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> before they create a Bivens<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> implied cause of action for the violation of any particular constitutional right: \u201cBecause such [federal employee] claims arise out of an employment relationship that is governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions giving meaningful remedies against the United States, we conclude that it would be inappropriate for us to supplement the regulatory scheme with a new judicial remedy.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">As the Court made clear, its decision was not based upon \u201cwhether or not it would be good policy to permit a federal employee to recover damages from a supervisor who has improperly disciplined him for exercising his First Amendment rights.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather, the Court based its decision upon its conviction that \u201cCongress is in a better position to decide whether or not the public interest would be served by creating [such a remedy].\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\"><em>Bush </em>precludes judicial consideration of Gremillion\u2019s claim that his first amendment rights were violated. In fact, Gremillion\u2019s administrative action for reinstatement and back pay was pending before the Merit Systems Protection Board at the time he filed this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-17\">Gremillion also asserts that he was deprived of his property without just compensation in violation of the fifth amendment and that the defendants acted with malice and in bad faith. He thus seeks to bring his case within what he claims are exceptions to the holding of <em>Bush.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-18\">In <em>Bush, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that the statutory scheme protecting federal employees from arbitrary personnel actions does not cover all personnel decisions and, thus, left open whether federal employees might have an implied cause of action for particular violations of their rights: \u201cNot all personnel actions are covered by this system.... In addition, certain actions by supervisors against federal employees, such as wiretapping, warrant-less searches, or uncompensated takings, would not be defined as \u2018personnel actions\u2019 within the statutory scheme.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-20\">Gremillion first argues that \u201cwhen\u201d (not, if) he \u201cis paid back pay for the time his [sm] has not been allowed to work, all of said back pay will be taxable to him in the year in which he receives it. Thus, his income taxes for that year will be increased by an amount in excess of $30,000.\u201d Second, he claims that his wife will be unable to take advantage of her employer\u2019s tax sheltered annuity plan because Gremillion\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>wrongful discharge has resulted in a \u201csubstantial reduction\u201d in the family\u2019s standard of living. Allegedly, her failure to participate in the annuity will result in \u201cthe loss of approximately $11,000.00 of annual benefits upon her retirement, payable over the remainder of her life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">These assertions do not, even if proved, establish even a colorable claim that there has been an uncompensated taking of property. They state merely the consequences incident to discharge from employment and of Gremillion\u2019s potential success on his claim for back pay. Indeed, in <em>Bush, </em>the petitioner was demoted and suffered a decrease of $9,716 in his annual salary.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, when the Supreme Court left open the possibility that it might imply a cause of action for an uncompensated taking, it could not have intended a reduction in or the loss of salary, or the consequences incident thereto. The claim for back pay and other damages is merely part and parcel of the unlawful discharge claim, and Gremillion\u2019s exclusive remedy is supplied by the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Even if Gremillion\u2019s fifth amendment claim were colorable or meritorious, however, the reasoning of <em>Bush </em>dictates that we should not create an implied cause of action. As the Eleventh Circuit noted when faced with a claim similar to Gremil-lion\u2019s:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">While <em>Bush </em>involved only a first amendment claim, as compared with ... multiple assertions of first, fourth, fifth, and sixth amendment violations, the Supreme Court\u2019s careful analysis applies with equal force to this ease. The nature of Bush\u2019s constitutional injury played little role in the court\u2019s reasoning. Rather, the Court focused on the \u201cspecial factor,\u201d i.e., the federal employment relationship, in determining that there was no need for a new judicially created cause of action. This generally restrictive view of Bivens-type claims is emphasized by the fact that on the same day the court also held that enlisted military personnel may not maintain a suit to recover damages from a superior officer for alleged constitutional violations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Gremillion also claims that his case differs from <em>Bush </em>because the defendants acted in bad faith and with malice by pursuing an earlier adverse action against him when they \u201cknew that they could not prevail upon, the reasons and specifications set out in their Proposed Adverse Action.\u201d Citing <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Gremillion notes that a federal official is subject to suit if he \u201cknew or reasonably should have known that the action he took within his sphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional rights of the [plaintiff], <em>or </em>if he took the action <em>with malicious intention </em>to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights or other injury.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> From these premises, Gremillion would have us conclude that this case is not within the statutory definition of \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and, therefore, is not barred by <em>Bush.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">Gremillion\u2019s argument is erroneous for several reasons. In deciding <em>Harlow, </em>the Supreme Court explicitly noted that it was not addressing whether a private cause of action would be inferred and left consideration of that question for the district court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The passage quoted by Gremillion speaks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>to whether federal officials are to be accorded qualified immunity, not to whether there is a <em>Bivens </em>implied cause of action in the circumstances present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Moreover, even if we assume that the defendants acted in bad faith,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the key question that we must address before we create an implied cause of action in these circumstances is whether \u201cCongress has provided an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a <em>substitute </em>for recovery directly under the Constitution and viewed as equally effective.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Even if the Civil Service remedy were not viewed by Congress as an equally effective alternative, in <em>Bush </em>the court declined to create an implied cause of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aay\">[The question] is whether an elaborate remedial system that has been constructed step by step, with careful attention to conflicting policy considerations, should be augmented by the creation of a new judicial remedy for the constitutional violation at issue. That question cannot be answered simply by noting that existing remedies do not provide complete relief for the plaintiff. The policy judgment should be informed by a thorough understanding of the existing regulatory structure and the respective costs and benefits that would result from the addition of another remedy for violation of employees\u2019 First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-10\"><em>Bush </em>cautions us, therefore, that a plaintiff\u2019s claim for punitive damages,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or, in this case for acts undertaken in bad faith, is to be balanced against the deference due congressional judgment. Like the Court in <em>Bush, </em>\u201cwe do not decide whether or not it would be good policy to permit a federal employee to recover damages from his supervisor\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> when he alleges that his supervisor has acted with malice and in bad faith. Even in light of such an allegation, \u201cwe decline \u2018to create a new substantive legal liability without legislative aid and as at common law\u2019 ... because we are convinced that Congress is in a better position to decide whether or not the public interest would be served by creating it.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-14\">. 462 U.S. 367, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-15\">.
