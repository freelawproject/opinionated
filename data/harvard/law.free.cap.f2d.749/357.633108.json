Harmon, is not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-433 (the \u201cAct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">On March 8, 1982, appellant was informed that his disability benefits, originally awarded on April 2, 1969, were to be terminated. Appellant requested a hearing, which was held before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) on September 7, 1982. On December 29, 1982, the ALJ rendered his decision. It was the opinion of the AU that appellant, though severely impaired, was not disabled for purposes of the Act. The AU specifically concluded that appellant had a severe impairment, but also concluded that under the Secretary\u2019s new regulations, appellant was not \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant was found to be 53 years of age, with a limited eighth grade education. The ALJ found that from the medical evidence presented he could perform \u201clight\u201d work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Applying the regulations established by the Secretary, this resulted in a finding of \u201cnot disabled\u201d for purposes of the Act. The Appeals Council affirmed this decision and it became the decision of the Secretary. On September 20, 1983, the federal district court affirmed this decision as being supported by substantial evidence. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">As stated previously, the ALJ\u2019s decision in this case was to <em>terminate, </em>as opposed to denying a grant of, benefits. On April 2, 1969, appellant had previously been granted benefits by a different hearing officer. That hearing officer concluded that appellant was disabled for purposes of the Act, basing his decision on the reports of several doctors. In December of 1967 appellant was involved in a work-related accident in which he injured his back.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The medical evidence presented at that hearing tended to show that the accident in 1967 left appellant with a \u201csprained back.\u201d A report by Dr. A.B. Carter demonstrated that appellant had a \u201cherniated cervical disc,\u201d and a \u201cherniated lumbar disc.\u201d A letter from Dr. Martin S. Brown related that appellant at that time was \u201ctotally disabled, but how long this may continue, of course is questionable, and depends to a considerable extent on the treatment program.\u201d A similar letter was introduced from Dr. Curwood R. Hunter. There were several other exhibits and depositions introduced into evidence at this hearing. From this evidence the first hearing officer concluded that appellant was disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">To terminate benefits previously granted, the Secretary must establish that the previously established disabling condition has improved. This has been the law in other circuits and is now the law in the Sixth Circuit. <em>See Simpson v. Schweiker, </em>691 F.2d 966 (11th Cir.1982); <em>Patti v. Schweiker, </em>669 F.2d 582 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">In <em>Haynes v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>734 F.2d 284 (6th Cir.1984), this court concluded that in a termination case the Secretary\u2019s decision to terminate must be supported by substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>evidence tending to show that the claimant\u2019s condition has improved since the time of the previous award. There is a presumption in such a case that the claimant is still \u201cdisabled\u201d for purposes of the Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">This presumption of continuing disability requires that the Secretary produce evidence that the claimant\u2019s condition has improved, and in the absence of such evidence the claimant will be deemed to be still disabled. If the Secretary produces evidence, that the claimant\u2019s condition has improved, the claimant, bearing the ultimate burden of showing disability, may, of course, produce evidence to the contrary. The standard of judicial review is whether the Secretary\u2019s finding that there has been medical improvement in the claimant\u2019s condition to the extent that the claimant is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity is supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 288. <em>See also Daring v. Heckler, </em>727 F.2d 64 (3d Cir.1984); <em>Perry v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 461 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Iida v. Heckler, </em>705 F.2d 363 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Dotson v. Schweiker, </em>719 F.2d 80 (4th Cir. 1983) .</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The \u201cmedical improvement standard\u201d adopted in <em>Haynes </em>was codified in the Social Security Disability Reform Act of 1984, H.R. 3755, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., 130 Cong.Rec. H9821 (daily ed. Sept. 19, 1984) . This Act applies to all disability termination cases pending in federal courts as of September 19, 1984, and requires that such cases be remanded to the Secretary for review under the proper standard. The Secretary has moved that we remand, the case to the district court with instructions to remand to the Secretary for further proceedings. Payment of benefits will resume pending a decision on remand. <em>See Franklin v. Secretary, </em>746 F.2d 1476 (6th Cir., 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">We grant the Secretary\u2019s motion in light of this legislation (and in light of <em>Haynes). </em>The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case remanded to the district court with directions to remand to the Secretary for further proceedings accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\">. Regulations now prescribe whether a claimant is \"disabled\u201d or \"not disabled\" in most cases. <em>See Kirk v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>667 F.2d 524 (6th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 957, 103 S.Ct. 2428, 77 L.Ed.2d 1315 (1983); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1501-1599(1982). Generally, \"grids\u201d can be applied to determine the claimant\u2019s status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-14\">. \"Light\" work is defined as being able to lift no more than 20 pounds at a time, with frequent lifting of objects weighing up to 10 pounds. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b444-15\">. Appellant had been involved in a prior accident in 1956 in which he received a fractured skull. He recovered from this accident and returned to work approximately three months later.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
