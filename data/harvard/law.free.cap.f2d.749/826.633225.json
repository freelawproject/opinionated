Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b914-21\">In 1980 American Methyl developed an additive to be used in a methanol/gasoline blend it called Petrocoal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because methanol costs about forty cents per gallon, Petrocoal costs less than conventional gasoline. The relative inexpensiveness of Petrocoal and other alcohol/gasoline blends\u2014 to say nothing of the fact that they may be produced domestically, thereby reducing America\u2019s reliance on foreign sources of petroleum \u2014 makes them attractive substitutes for gasoline.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-22\">To market the Petrocoal additive, American Methyl sought a waiver from the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Under section 211(f)(1) of the Clean Air Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-23\">unlawful for any manufacturer of any fuel or fuel additive to first introduce into commerce, or to increase the concentration in use, of, any fuel or fuel additive for general use in light duty motor vehicles ... which is not substantially similar to any fuel or fuel additive uti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>lized in the certification of any ... [1975 or later model year vehicle or engine].<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The impetus for this section was the fear that new fuel and new fuel additives, particularly an organomanganese compound known as MMT, would impair the performance of emission control devices in cars and light duty trucks.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As Senator Muskie, chief sponsor of the Senate bill, put it: \u201cThis action was absolutely essential ... [given] the alarming degrees to which MMT, and potentially hundreds of other additives, threaten our entire air pollution control program.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Administrator of the EPA may waive the section 211(f)(1) prohibition if the manufacturer establishes that the fuel or additive \u201cwill not cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device or system ... to achieve compliance by the vehicle\u201d with applicable emissions standards.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">American Methyl applied for a waiver on 20 February 1981,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which the Administrator granted on 28 September of that year.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> American Methyl\u2019s expenditures in developing and marketing Petrocoal totalled nearly one million dollars.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">Just over two months later, on 4 December 1981, a trade association of automobile manufacturers known as the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association filed a petition for administrative reconsideration of the Petrocoal waiver with EPA<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and another petition for review of the waiver in this court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Despite questions relating to the high alcohol content and ratio of methanol to cosolvents in Petrocoal, and the possible presence of a corrosive additive, CV-100, in certain test samples,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the EPA did not act on MVMA\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">Over a year later, on 22 February 1983, MVMA filed a supplemental petition for reconsideration accompanied by new data purporting to show that Petrocoal caused automobiles to exceed limits .for evaporative emissions of hydrocarbons.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">Prompted by the recently compiled data in MVMA\u2019s supplemental petition, the Administrator on 2 May 1983 published a notice in the <em>Federal Register </em>that he was \u201cconsidering whether an administrative action is appropriat [sic] to modify or revoke the waiver under section 211(f) or to control or prohibit sale of Petrocoal under section 211(c), or whether the waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>should stand as granted.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Section 211(c), in contrast to section 211(f), imposes a number of substantive and procedural requirements the agency must satisfy before controlling or prohibiting a fuel or fuel additive.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Administrator\u2019s notice elicited no response from American Methyl.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Close to another year passed before the Administrator, on 16 March 1984, proposed to revoke the Petrocoal waiver; the decision was published in the <em>Federal Register </em>on 28 March 1984 \u2014 nearly two-and-a-half years after the Petrocoal waiver was initially approved.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> A principal basis of the Administrator\u2019s decision was the new study reported by MVMA which claimed that Petrocoal caused automobiles to exceed limits on evaporative emissions of hydrocarbons.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The notice stated that \u201c[i]n reconsidering the Petrocoal waiver, the standard for review of the newly submitted and developed information is that prescribed in section 211(f)(4) of the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aqy-dedup-0\">Almost at the same time, on 27 March 1984, the parties to the appeals from approval of the original waiver in 1981 jointly moved to remand the record to EPA, so that the agency could take further administrative action with respect to the waiver.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> On 3 April this court granted the motion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">One month later, however, on 3 May 1984, American Methyl formally requested the Administrator to rescind his proposal to revoke the Petrocoal waiver, on the ground that section 211(f) does not permit him to reconsider or revoke a waiver.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In a letter dated 8 June 1984, the EPA General Counsel denied American Methyl\u2019s request and asserted the agency\u2019s inherent authority to revoke a waiver pursuant to section 211(f).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> He also explained that under section 211(f)(4) American Methyl would have to justify the validity of the Petrocoal waiver ab initio:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-12\">Finally, with regard to your question as to which party has the burden of proof in these proceedings, the March 28, 1984, Federal Register notice clearly states that the standard of review to be used in the reconsideration proceeding will be the same as that used in evaluating waiver applications under section 211(f)(4). 49 Fed.Reg. 11885. Accordingly, the burden of establishing that Petrocoal meets the criteria for a valid waiver specified in section 211(f)(4), taking into account all available information, should be borne by American Methyl.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQI\">The General Counsel confirmed, in a letter dated 22 June 1984, that \u201cin keeping with my responsibilities as General Counsel\u201d the 8 June letter, \u201cexpressed the Agency\u2019s official position on these legal matters.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6x2\">American Methyl filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s notice of proposed revocation on 25 May 1984, and of the 8 June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>letter on 2 July 1984.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> American Methyl claimed that its sales, which had been at a record high level before EPA threatened to revoke the Petrocoal waiver under section 211(f), had virtually ceased in a matter of months.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">On 13 July, American Methyl moved this court to stay a hearing on EPA\u2019s proposal to revoke the Petrocoal waiver, which had been scheduled for 31 July.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> EPA opposed the motion and on 20 July moved to dismiss both petitions for review. A motions panel composed of two other judges of this court, by order dated 27 July, granted American Methyl\u2019s motions to consolidate and to stay EPA\u2019s proposed revocation proceeding and denied the agency\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">This appeal presents the following three issues: first, is judicial review appropriate at this stage in the administrative process; second, should American Methyl be es-topped from challenging EPA\u2019s assertion of revocation authority; and third, does section 211(f) of the Clean Air Act empower EPA to revoke the Petrocoal waiver?</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">We find judicial review appropriate at this time and decline to estop American Methyl from challenging the agency\u2019s interpretation of its statutory powers. We hold that the Administrator may not revoke the Petrocoal waiver pursuant to section 211(f), but may forbid the marketing of Petrocoal only pursuant to his authority to control or prohibit fuel and fuel additives under section 211(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">At stake in this procedural battle is the applicability of certain substantive and procedural safeguards to a proceeding in which the Environmental Protection Agency proposes to revoke American Methyl\u2019s waiver to market Petrocoal. Under American Methyl\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Air Act, EPA is authorized to control or prohibit the marketing of Petrocoal only under section 211(c); that section requires EPA to follow specific substantive and procedural guidelines. In contrast, EPA interprets section 211(f), under which the Petrocoal waiver was originally granted, to authorize revocation of the Petrocoal waiver irrespective of the guidelines specified in section 211(c); section 211(f), which do\u00e9s not admit the existence of a revocation procedure, not surprisingly fails to regulate the conduct of such proceedings. If section 211(f) is construed as EPA would have it, no particular substantive or procedural requirements (apart from whatever procedural minima may be required by the Constitution\u2019s due process clause<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>) need be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">A. <em>Timing of Judicial Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">EPA contends that review of the agency\u2019s purported authority to revoke waivers is premature, on the grounds that the agency\u2019s decision lacks finality and is not ripe for review and that American Me<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>thyl has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. These points formed the basis of a motion to dismiss by EPA, which was considered and rejected by a motions panel of this court last July. There is no theoretical obstacle to our reconsidering the motions panel decision,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> which, as is usual, was rendered without oral argument and (since it was not dispositive of the appeal) with the participation of only two judges. Moreover, not all of the present panel agree with the motions panel\u2019s disposition. However, given the circumstance that this agency proceeding has already been delayed several times by judicial action, and that the motions panel action has extended the present delay still further; and given what seems to us the clarity of the merits of the matter, which will ultimately require the agency\u2019s action to be set aside if the present challenge is dismissed; we are not inclined to revisit the issues of finality, ripeness, and exhaustion, and without further consideration accept the motions panel\u2019s determination as the law of this case.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">B. <em>Equitable Estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-5\">Besides the asserted prematurity of judicial review, EPA also claims that American Methyl should be estopped from challenging its authority to revoke the Petro-coal waiver.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> According to the Administrator, equitable estoppel is warranted for two reasons. First, American Methyl waited over a year to challenge EPA\u2019s revocation authority, which the agency first broached in its 2 May 1983 <em>Federal Register </em>notice<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and to which American Methyl did not object until 20 April 1984.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Second, EPA points out that American Methyl joined with other parties to the 1981 appeals in a motion to remand to the agency the record compiled in the original waiver proceeding.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">In our view, American Methyl had no obligation to object until EPA made clear that it would proceed under section 211(f). Although the agency\u2019s 2 May <em>Federal Register </em>notice mentioned revocation of the Petrocoal waiver under section 211(f) as one of three possibilities,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> we do not think American Methyl was required to object immediately to each item on the agency\u2019s laundry-list of tentative options, even if that list is a short one, or forever hold its peace. The contrary holding would encourage appeals every time an agency announced that it was contemplating some arguably objectionable action.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">EPA did not elect to proceed under section 211(f) until 16 March 1984, in a <em>Federal Register </em>notice published on 28 March.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>This notice led to the 3 April remand in which American Methyl acquiesced. That acquiescence was a mistake, but American Methyl objected to the agency less than a month later.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Any detriment attributable to that brief delay is de minimis considering the lengthy delays associated with this case.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">C. <em>Scope of Judicial Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"A62\">Section 307(d)(9) of the Clean Air Act authorizes this court to \u201creverse any ... action [of the Administrator] found to be ... (C) in excess of statutory ... authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In exercising this power, the Supreme Court has recently admonished us, in <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>46</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to give \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d to the \u201cexecutive department\u2019s construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Although \u201ccourts are the final authorities on issues of statutory construction,\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> \u201c[i]f ... the court determines [that] Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, ... the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">Notwithstanding the great deference accorded an agency\u2019s interpretation, \u201c[i]f a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>given effect.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In this case, the legislative history is inconsistent with the standardless and open-ended authority to revoke waivers \u2014 to be asserted in this case nearly two-and-one-half years after the waiver was granted and based entirely on new evidence \u2014 which is sought by EPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">D. <em>The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Assertion of Inherent Revocation Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Section 211(f) does not state whether waivers granted under subsection (f)(4) may be reconsidered and revoked. According to the legislative history, however, Congress contemplated regulation of fuels and fuel additives so waived into commerce only through proceedings under section 211(c); the legislative understanding thus rejects the implied revocation authority claimed by the EPA. Moreover, the interrelationship of subsections (f) and (c)\u2014 with subsection (f) regulating the \u201cfirst\u201d introduction of fuels and fuel additives into commerce and subsection (c) governing the control or prohibition of fuels and fuel additives already in commerce \u2014 gives effect to the requirements of each subsection and comports with Congress\u2019s understanding of their interdependence. Finally, our recognition of authority under section 211(c) to regulate fuels and fuel additives in commerce, to the exclusion of an implied revocation authority under section 211(f), is consistent with past administrative practice and effectuates the objectives of the Clean Air Act.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">1. <em>The understanding of Congress</em></p>\n<p id=\"AhB\">A revealing paragraph in the committee report on the Senate bill suggests that the EPA administrator, once having waived a new fuel or fuel additive into commerce under section 211(f)(4), may not \u201crevoke\u201d a waiver under that same section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atn-dedup-1\">The committee was mindful that the Administrator could choose not to act on the waiver application within the 180 days provided for such action. If the Administrator does fail to act under subsection (d) [now subsection (f) ] to either grant, conditionally grant, or deny the waiver, it does not diminish the Administrator\u2019s power to act against the fuel or fuel additive <em>through the application of the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.</em><footnotemark>52</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">Congress, according to this passage, understood that waivers granted by default could not be revoked; rather, the Administrator must initiate appropriate proceedings pursuant to section 211(c) if he wants to control or prohibit a fuel or fuel additive waived into commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">EPA agrees with this reading of the quoted paragraph, but believes its logic is limited to waivers granted automatically after 180 days:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-12\">There is absolutely no indication that the committee gave any thought to what remedies EPA might pursue if it appeared that its affirmative decision that the applicant had satisfied section 211(f)(4) had been based on serious factual mistakes. In contrast, waivers granted under the 180-day provision do not involve any affirmative decision that could be called into question or reconsidered later.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>EPA\u2019s reading of the Senate Report, however, would have the perverse and presumably unintended effect of according the greatest deference to the least thought-out waivers. To permit revocation only of waivers granted after due consideration would inexplicably insulate from reconsideration waivers granted by operation of law and without any thought on the agency\u2019s part. Waivers granted after the statutorily-prescribed determination that the fuel or fuel additive \u201cwill not cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device or system ... to achieve compliance ... with emission standards\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> would be open to revocation at any time, based on any evidence, subject to no substantive or procedural safeguards. We cannot believe that Congress would countenance such an ill-conceived revisory power.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">We have held that agencies have an inherent power to correct their mistakes by reconsidering their decisions within the period available for taking an appeal.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> That period has long expired here. We need not consider what further inherent or implicit authority might exist in the abstract, since, in the present case, Congress has provided a mechanism for correcting error by authorizing under section 211(c) control or prohibition of fuels and fuel additives mistakenly waived into commerce under section 211(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">Thus, when Congress has provided a mechanism capable of rectifying mistaken actions, in this case by authorizing under section 211(c) control or prohibition of fuels and fuel additives mistakenly waived into commerce under section 211(f), it is not reasonable to infer authority to reconsider agency action. This \u201c \u2018common sense\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> observation recalls the maxim frequently invoked by the Supreme Court in construing statutes:<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> expressio unius est exclusio alterius, that is, \u201cmention of one thing im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>plies exclusion of another thing.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court stated in <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. National Association of Railroad Passengers (Amtrak),</em><footnotemark><em>59</em></footnotemark><em> \u201c </em>\u2018[w]hen a statute limits a thing to be done in a particular mode, it includes the negative of any other mode.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Thus, while Congress may have wanted the Administrator to correct his mistakes, it provided a mechanism sufficient to this task in section 211(c). It further understood this mechanism as the exclusive means by which he was to correct waivers mistakenly granted by default. We therefore see no need to imply authority under section 211(f) to reconsider waivers granted after due deliberation. What suffices to correct waivers mistakenly granted by default should also suffice to correct the (hopefully) far smaller proportion of waivers mistakenly granted after careful consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">2. <em>Consistency with the statutory design</em></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">The absence of implied revocation authority suggests a straightforward relationship between sections 211(c) and 211(f) which is consistent with the text of the statute and its apparent design:<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> section 211(f) forbids the \u201cfirst\u201d introduction of new fuels and new fuel additives into commerce; section 211(c) provides for regulation of fuels already in commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Section 211(f)(1) on its face governs every \u201cfuel or fuel additive ... first introduce[d] into commerce\u201d or whose concentration in any fuel or fuel additive is increased.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Waivers of this prohibition under section 211(f)(4) are required only of these same fuels and fuel additives.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">By way of comparison, section 211(c) authorizes the Administrator to \u201ccontrol or prohibit the manufacture, introduction into commerce, offering for sale, or sale of any fuel or fuel additive\u201d in order to reduce harmful air pollution and to maintain the performance of emission control equipment.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Construing section 211(f) not to authorize revocation of waivers thus leaves no lacuna in the statute: The Administrator is empowered to take action against an offending fuel or fuel additive under section 211(c) if it impairs the performance of pollution control equipment, which is precisely the evil an implied revocation authority would remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">Furthermore, our unwillingness to imply revocation authority under section 211(f) is consistent with subsection (f)(4)\u2019s requirement that the Administrator act on a waiver application within 180 days or be deemed to have granted the same.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The implication of a standardless revocation authority, exercisable over an indefinite term, would in effect empower the Administrator to deny a waiver after the 180-day period had elapsed, thereby writing the 180-day time limit out of the statute. This revocation power would be exercised, moreover, without regard for the substantive and procedural safeguards afforded by section <em>211(c) </em>\u2014 safeguards <em>which the EPA concedes are applicable to fuels waived into </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number><em>commerce by default by virtue of the paragraph in the Senate Committee Report quoted above.</em><footnotemark><em>65</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The text and design of section 211 thus support our conclusion that Congress did not authorize the EPA Administrator to revoke waivers granted under section 211(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">3. <em>Admissions and Administrative Practice of the EPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"acx-dedup-0\">Our unwillingness to wrest a standard-less and openended revocation authority from a silent statute is strengthened by examination of EPA\u2019s own commitment to revocation authority \u2014 a commitment that has been qualified and tepid at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">a. <em>Admissions before this Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"amd-dedup-0\">In its brief and at oral argument, EPA conceded that a \u201ccorrect\u201d initial waiver could not be revoked and that any subsequent action against the fuel or fuel additive must perforce be taken in a proceeding under section 211(c).<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> By \u201ccorrect,\u201d EPA apparently means that the initial waiver must have been warranted by the record compiled at the time the waiver was granted; only if \u201cthe original waiver decision was fundamentally wrong because the record, upon re-examination, actually did not support the necessary showings\u201d may the waiver be revoked.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Because there is no issue now before us as to the original administrative record justifying the Petrocoal waiver, however, revocation is unwarranted on the agency\u2019s own view of the statute. In its notice of proposed revocation, EPA advanced three reasons for reconsidering the Petrocoal waiver. Two of the reasons appear to be make-weights by EPA\u2019s own admission; the third is based on new evidence and reflects no deficiency in the agency\u2019s original determination. Since this last reason seemingly prompted the Administrator\u2019s second thoughts about Petrocoal, we consider it first.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">The chronology of events,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> EPA\u2019s notice soliciting comments on whether to reconsider the Petrocoal waiver,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> and the agency\u2019s notice of proposed revocation,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> all show that EPA\u2019s principal concern is that cars using Petrocoal will exceed the limits imposed on evaporative emissions of hydrocarbons. Whatever the validity of this concern, it in no way impugns the validity of the original waiver \u2014 the Administrator\u2019s concern is based, as he put it, on \u201cnew data.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> As he stated in his <em>Federal Register </em>notice proposing revocation: \u201cBased on information submitted in response to the May 2, 1983 <em>Federal Register </em>notice, and other information provided to the Agency <em>since the grant of Petrocoal waiver, </em>the Agency is today proposing to revoke that waiver.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The Administrator\u2019s answer to American Methyl\u2019s argument that expiration of the sixty-day period for judicial review precludes reconsideration, leaves no issue before us as to the adequacy of the original waiver. In a footnote, the Administrator pointed out that the sixty-day time limit was inapplicable because the information on evaporative emissions became available after the period had expired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Moreover, regardless of the merits of American Methyl\u2019s argument with respect to MVMA\u2019s original petition for reconsideration, the petition as supplemented and the comments in response to the May 2, 1983 <em>Federal Register </em>notice clearly present <em>new information not available to the Agency during the comment period....</em><footnotemark>73</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">EPA\u2019s primary reason for revoking American Methyl\u2019s waiver does not relate to a defect in the original grant; thus, under EPA\u2019s own interpretation of its powers, a revocation proceeding is not warranted in this case.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">EPA\u2019s remaining two reasons for reconsidering the Petrocoal waiver, although they relate to the original waiver grant, are red herrings. In six trim paragraphs of his eight-page, triple-columned, single-spaced notice of proposed revocation, the Administrator now finds that he had no basis for approving the particular alcohol blend used in Petrocoal when he approved the waiver in 1981.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Intervenors Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association raised precisely this contention in their petition for administrative reconsideration filed on 4 December 1981,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> yet EPA took no action until presented with new data on evaporative emissions a year-and-a-half later. Tellingly, if the Administrator was concerned about the high alcohol content of Petrocoal, one would hardly expect him to dismiss out of hand American Methyl\u2019s offer to reduce the percentage of alcohol.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">In the pages of the <em>Federal Register </em>the Administrator also professes concern over whether some test samples of Petrocoal contained the metallic additive CV-100.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> The presence of the additive in test samples but not in the fuel actually marketed could mean that Petrocoal at the pump fails to perform like the Petrocoal submitted for testing and approved by EPA. Yet in a letter denying American Methyl a hearing on this question, the agency declared that \u201cthe issue itself is not significant enough to warrant imposition of full trial-type hearing procedures\u201d and adopted the analysis in American Methyl\u2019s \u201cmemorandum of April 27,\u201d which recognized that \u201cthe presence of CV-100 is at best an ancillary matter, unlikely to influence EPA\u2019s final decision.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Because the Administrator points to no defects in his original approval of the Pe-trocoal waiver, he may not \u2014 according to his own interpretation of section 211(f) \u2014 reopen that waiver. He may proceed to regulate Petrocoal, if he thinks it necessary, under the powers conferred upon him by section 211(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">b. <em>Prior administrative practice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">Independent of EPA\u2019s admissions before this court, the agency\u2019s prelitigation administrative practice belies its professed belief in an implied revocation authority. In seven years of administering section 211(f), American Methyl is the first manufacturer subjected to a revocation proceeding.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> In a prior case, when assertion of such authority would have been appropriate, the Administrator made no mention of it and instead relied on his power under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>section 211(c), a course of conduct exemplifying the understanding of section 211 we adopt today.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">A brief recitation of a proceeding involving the Sun Petroleum Products Company exposes the novelty of EPA\u2019s construction of section 211. The Administrator conditioned the grant of Sun Petroleum\u2019s waiver on disclosure of a proprietary additive\u2019s chemical composition; he reserved the right to \u201crevoke the waiver if, after receiving a petition for reconsideration, he determines that based on new data and information not available prior to the public disclosure of the proprietary additive\u2019s chemical composition, the applicant is not entitled to the waiver.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">General Motors subsequently filed a petition for reconsideration in the Sun Petroleum proceeding. Because the initial waiver provided for reconsideration, the Administrator applied the same standard of review that he applied to Sun Petroleum\u2019s initial application.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> The Administrator denied General Motor\u2019s petition and thereby removed the revocation contingency in Sun Petroleum\u2019s waiver. Revealingly, in describing his remaining authority under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-6\">This [waiver] does not preclude GM or others from continuing to research this question and developing sufficient date [sic] to support a future rulemaking in this area. <em>I retain the authority under Section 211(c) of the Act to control or prohibit this blend or other alcohol/gasoline blends if new data are presented to warrant such </em>action,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq2\">Taking EPA\u2019s past administrative practice as implementing the proper reading of section 211, the agency is without authority to revoke a noncontingent waiver, based on new evidence, nearly two-and-one-half years after its initial approval.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Combined with Congress\u2019s understanding of section 211 and the consistency of that understanding with the statutory design, the Sun Petroleum precedent constitutes a tacit admission that section 211(f) does not impliedly authorize the reconsideration of waivers in these circumstances.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">4. <em>Objectives of the Clean Air Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"AjD\">Our inquiry ends upon ascertaining that the Administrator\u2019s reading of his authority under section 211(f) is contrary to what Congress intended;<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> we note, however, that our interpretation furthers both procedural certainty as well as the public\u2019s need for protection from harmful air pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">By upholding Congress\u2019s disinclination to grant EPA an unguided and open-ended power to revoke waivers, we ensure that entities subject to regulation under section 211 know what is expected of them. Protecting the legitimate expectations of fuel manufacturers comports with basic fairness; it also encourages investment in technology to create more efficient, less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>costly, and less polluting substitutes for conventional fuels.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Like the sword suspended by a hair above the courtier Damocles, the Administrator\u2019s claimed revocation authority would pose an ever-present threat to the marketing of new fuels, fostering great uncertainty in the business community. Technologically-advanced fuels could be taken off the market at any time, and neither specified hearing procedures nor rules of repose would cabin the Administrator\u2019s discretion. This risk is hardly typical of commercial operations in a regulated economy. Moreover, because the manufacturer\u2019s product is assumed undeserving of waiver, the presumption is against the continued existence of his business even if his waiver is challenged with evidence gathered years after heavy capital investment \u2014 an extraordinary risk for a commercial entity to bear, as agency counsel conceded at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Because a manufacturer could never know ex ante whether his product would be available for sale for a sufficient time to recoup his initial investment, he might well decide not to risk his capital in the first place. As a consequence, the public and this nation would suffer from lack of innovation in fuels and fuel additives, to the ultimate detriment of air quality and our national security.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Besides providing procedural certainty, our opinion should also promote more accurate agency decisionmaking in the first instance. Under EPA\u2019s reading of the waiver provision, the agency may permit a waiver to be granted by default after the passage of 180 days and revoke it later if some problem is brought to its attention. Under our reading of section 211(f)(4), however, the agency is motivated to consider a waiver request promptly and thoroughly because it cannot rely on the expedient of a post-grant revocation. The Administrator must do his job well and fast \u2014 if he makes a mistake, he must act against the fuel or fuel additive under section 211(c), with its admittedly more cumbersome but congressionally-mandated \u201cprocedural safegurads.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Our refusal to imply a power to revoke waivers parallels Congress\u2019s insistence that EPA make a careful, albeit expeditious, decision in the first instance; subsequent proceedings based on new evidence, when substantial investments are at stake, understandably are subject to the more exacting substantive and procedural safeguards contained in section 211(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Finding an implied power to revoke waivers under section 211(f) of the Clean Air Act contrary to the intention of Congress and the design of that statute, we set aside the Administrator\u2019s notice proposing to revoke the Petrocoal waiver and his notice announcing a public hearing thereon, and reverse the EPA General Counsel\u2019s refusal to terminate the waiver proceeding brought pursuant to section 211(f). We remand this case for further proceedings under section 211(c), if the Administrator deems them desirable, in accordance with our judgment and mandate issued 31 October 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">\n<em>So Ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-13\">.
