Kirkland, Esq., an experienced counselor at this bar, to represent appellant on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-19\">We have gone carefully over the record, and we find that the so-called bill of exceptions contains no exceptions taken to any ruling of the court in the trial, and an examination of-the bill satisfies us-the trial was in all respects fair.

The judgment of the court below is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
