Perry, under \u00a7 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-27\">Appellant\u2019s petition alleged that he was primarily bona fide personally engaged in producing products of the soil and derived the principal part of his income from such operations. Thus, in effect, the petition alleged that appellant was a farmer within the meaning of \u00a7 75.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Anna Baumann, Maud E. Lane and Lane Mortgage Company, as trustee for George A. Hendricks and others, creditors of appellant, filed motions to dismiss the proceeding. The motions of Anna Baumann and Lane Mortgage Company were on the ground that appellant was not primarily bona fide personally engaged in producing products of the soil, did not derive the principal part of his income from such operations and was not a farmer within the meaning of \u00a7 75. Maud E. Lane\u2019s motion was on the ground just mentioned and two others, namely, that the proceeding was not instituted in good faith, and that it was impossible for appellant to rehabilitate himself or to offer his creditors a fair, just or equitable composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Thus each of the motions raised issues of fact. The issues were tried by the court without a jury. Evidence was received<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, upon consideration thereof, the following order was entered: \u201cMotion to dismiss proceedings granted.\u201d The order did not state, nor does the record show, which of the several motions to dismiss was granted, nor on what ground or grounds dismissal was ordered. The court made no findings, stated no conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Order 37 of the General Orders in Bankruptcy, 11 U.S.C.A. following section 53, provides: \u201cIn proceedings under the [Bankruptcy] Act the Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts of the United States (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c) shall, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the Act or with these general orders, be followed as nearly as may be.\u201d Rule 52(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure provides: \u201cIn all actions tried upon the facts without a jury, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon and direct the entry of \u2018the appropriate judgment.\u201d Rule 52(a) is not inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Act or with the General Orders in Bankruptcy. It therefore should have been followed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Order reversed and case remanded to the District Court, with directions to find the facts specially, state separately its conclusions of law thereon and direct the entry of the appropriate judgment, all in conformity with Rule 52(a), supra.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-28\"> Section 75, sub. r defines the term \u201cfarmer\u201d as including \u201cnot only an individual who is primarily bona fide personally engaged in producing products of the soil, but also any individual who is primarily bona fide personally engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>in dairy farming, the production of poultry or livestock, or the production of poultry products or livestock products in their unmanufactured state, or the principal part of whose income is derived from any one or more of the foregoing operations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-11\"> The evidence consisted of eight affidavits \u2014 four supporting and four opposing the motions to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
