La Fera Grecco Contracting Co., 3 Cir., 116 F.2d 211, reversing the decision of the District Court, 30 F.Supp. 497, the court below entered a final judgment on April 22, 1941. The plaintiffs appeal from that judgment and make three objections to it. We are of the opinion that all three objections are well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-23\">The appellants point out that the third paragraph of the judgment decrees United States Letters Patent No. 1,684,671 to be invalid. Claim 4 was the only claim of the patent which the appellants contended was infringed by the appellees. As to that part of the case which related to patent infringement we decided nothing more than that claim 4 was invalid for want of invention. We will modify the third paragraph of the judgment by inserting after the word \u201cThat\u201d the words \u201cclaim 4 of,\u201d and changing the word \u201care\u201d to the word \u201cis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-24\">Subparagraph 1 of the sixth paragraph of the judgment restrains the appellants from \u201cjointly or severally maintaining a limited or complete monopoly in asphaltic materials for curing concrete by utilizing the Hayden Patent No. 1,684,671 or any other device for effecting such monopoly; * * *.\u201d The record contains no evidence that the appellants used any other device than the Hayden patent for effecting a monopoly. For this reason we conclude that the word \u201cunpatented\u201d should be inserted in front of the words \u201casphaltic materials\u201d to the end that the injunction of the judgment may not be applied to any other monopoly than that which the appellants attempted to effect through the Hay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>den patent. In order that the appellants may be enjoined from utilization of the Hayden patent to any monopolistic end we conclude that the phrase \u201cin any manner\u201d should be inserted immediately after the number \u201c1,684,671\u201d in the subparagraph. The phrase \u201cor any other device\u201d appearing in the last line should be stricken out. The judgment will be modified in these respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">As to subparagraph 2 of the sixth paragraph the words \u201cunder the Hayden Patent No. 1,684,671\u201d will be inserted after the words \u201casphaltic materials purchased.\u201d We do this so that the injunctive processes of the court below shall be restricted to the issues which were before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The judgment as modified will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
