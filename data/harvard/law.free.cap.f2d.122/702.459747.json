They exhibit a tendency toward a narrow and technical interpretation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of an Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> intended to be construed in accordance with its broad and wise purpose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The case at bar is, we think, a typical instance. The defendant-patentee, a manufacturer, informed the customers of the plaintiff-appellant, an importer and vendor of a certain chemical known as \u201cEstradiol\u201d that it alone had the right to manufacture that chemical. It also had the following advertisement published in a trade journal:</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">\u201cTo Purchasers of Estradiol Notice By Schering Corporation</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">United States Letters Patent No. 2,096,-744 for Hydrogenation Products of Follicle Hormones and Method of Producing Same, has been issued to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Notice is hereby given to manufacturers and importers that our patent covers the product known as</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">Estradiol</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">Estradiol is also known as dihydroxyes-trin, dihydrofolliculin or dihydrotheelin. Our patent also covers the process of making the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">All uses of this material, without our consent, including medicinal, pharmaceutical and cosmetic, are a violation of our giths (grants)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under this patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">We are giving this notice to the trade so that there may be no misunderstanding or doubt as to the exclusiveness of our rights in the United States to the product Estra-diol (also known as dihydroxyestrin, dihy-drofolliculin or dihydrotheelin).</p>\n<p id=\"ABYD\">Schering Corporation Bloomfield New Jersey<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-17\">Plaintiff-appellant thereupon brought suit for a judgment declaring the defendant\u2019s patent invalid and/or not infringed and for an injunction for unfair competition. The learned District Judge dismissed the complaint for the reasons that (1) since the plaintiff alleged that it was not infringing defendant\u2019s patent, no actual controversy existed; (2) the plaintiff did not allege that it had been given notice of the claimed infringement, and (3) the notice in the trade publication was made in good faith and therefore could not give rise to a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-18\">Such a construction of the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act would, in our opinion, destroy its entire usefulness in patent litigation. Before the passage of that Act patentees received greater protection from the law than was warranted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>their patent monopoly.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Competitors desiring to introduce an article somewhat similar to one already patented met with much difficulty. The patentee could, without bringing suit, publicly claim an infringement and threaten to sue the manufacturer or anyone who dealt with the product in issue. Unless the patentee\u2019s actions were of such a character that he might be shackled with the sanctions of the law of unfair competition,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> he had his alleged in-fringer at his mercy. Although the competitor\u2019s business was gravely injured, he was remediless and in order to survive, he might be forced to make a settlement with a patentee whose claim of infringement was absolutely unfounded.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Prior to the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the patentee might even bolster his charges by bringing an action for infringement and publicly advertising the fact to the trade. Then after postponing trial as long as possible, he could move for a dismissal without prejudice<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and repeat the process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">We think that Professor Borchard has answered both points made by the learned District Judge in such convincing fashion that it is hardly necessary for us to do more than quote what he has to say. In speaking of the failure of a plaintiff to assert infringement and in criticizing the case principally relied on by the court below, he has this to say:</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">\u201cThe decisions in several recent cases seem to be erroneous. In the case of New Discoveries v. Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the plaintiffs were the owners of several patent processes for the manufacture of Vitamin D, and were engaged in the business of selling licenses therefor. The defendants were the owners of allegedly conflicting patents and had threatened the plaintiff and its licensees that they would infringe on defendant\u2019s patents and would be liable in damages if they dealt in the article manufactured or about to be manufactured by the plaintiff. But on the ground that the plaintiff had not asserted that he or its licensees were actually using the processes in issue and thus already infringing, District Judge Stone considered the case academic or hypothetical, and dismissed the complaint. This seems altogether too narrow a view of justiciability. Contrary to the Judge\u2019s opinion, the fact that defendant notified the plaintiff and its licensees that the use of plaintiff\u2019s processes, licenses for which were under current sale, would infringe on defendant\u2019s patents, presented an \u2018actual controversy\u2019 concerning the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s processes. The many later cases in the Circuit Court of Appeals fortify this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">\u201cNor is it correct to say that no actual controversy is present unless the defendant acted in bad faith. The requirement of bad faith is demanded in urrfair competition cases as a condition of damages and of injunction against a patentee who maliciously harasses a competitor. It has nothing to do with a petition for a declaratory judgment that the plaintiff is not infringing or that the patent relied on by the defendant is invalid.\u201d Borchard, Declaratory Judgments, 2d Ed. 1941, 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">In the same tenor is an opinion of one of the Circuit Courts of Appeals referred to by the learned professor: \u201cThe defendant asserts that the plaintiff\u2019s structures infringe patents which it owns and which it claims are valid. The plaintiff denies infringement and has invited suit against it upon the patents without response. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>denies the validity of the patents, and has so notified the defendant at least by its bill if not prior thereto. The parties stand in adversary positions in respect to legal rights and obligations. Their differences are concrete and not hypothetical or abstract. It is of no moment in the determination of the character of the relief sought that the suit is brought by the alleged in-fringer instead of by the owner.\u201d Bliss &amp; Co. v. Cold Metal Process Co., 6 Cir., 102 F. 2d 105, 108.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Manifestly, the threat is as unjust if the plaintiff is not infringing a valid patent as it is if he is infringing an invalid one.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">There can be no doubt that an \u201cactual controversy\u201d does not exist until the patentee makes some claim that his patent is being infringed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The claim need not be formally asserted; nor should it be necessary that notice be given directly to the plaintiff. Aside from the cases cited in the opinion of the learned District Judge direct notice has not been stressed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In fact, declaratory actions have been maintained within our own Circuit<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> where the only allegation of notice was that given to the plaintiff\u2019s customers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although defendant\u2019s notice in a trade journal was craftily phrased, it does threaten purchasers with suits for contributory infringement if they purchased plaintiff\u2019s product. Indeed the only purpose of this notice can be to make such a threat and thereby intimidate would-be purchasers into buying its own product rather than the plaintiff\u2019s. It was unnecessary if defendant really intended to enjoin the infringement. Notice to in-fringers that a patent exists is not a condition precedent to a subsequent action to obtain an injunction in an infringement action.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If the courts were to impose a requirement that direct notice by a patentee to an alleged infringer was necessary before a declaratory judgment action might be maintained, the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act would be in effect repealed so far as patent actions were concerned. Once again patentees might threaten a manufacturer\u2019s customers with suit and the manufacturer would be helpless until such time when he was directly notified. That time would of course never arrive if the patentee knew that only upon the happening of this event might he be sued. Professor Borch-ard sums the matter up;</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">\u201cJusticiability, however, is hardly possible before the alleged infringer <em>or </em>his customers <em>or </em>dealers have been notified of the patentee\u2019s claim, <em>hoivever informal the method of notification or charge. </em>The ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>tion has arisen whether such claim or notice or charge should be required, and whether it ought not to be possible, as in certain foreign countries, for a manufacturer, definitely contemplating making and selling a certain article, to bring an action against the owner of a possibly conflicting patent for a declaration that his contemplated article does not infringe. An early adjudication of such an issue might prevent much economic waste and useless expenditure of money. The patentee himself, desiring to enjoin an infringement, need give no advance notice that his patent even exists. And yet, it seems best to limit declaratory relief for the infringer to cases in which an adversary claim has been made against him, though it may, it is believed, apply to an article not yet manufactured but only about to be manufactured. This requirement, present in practically all the adjudicated cases, refutes the fear that patentees might be harassed by prospective infringers and be obliged continually to defend their patents. <em>The fact tlvat a patentee\u2019s claim of infringement is a condition precedent of this type of action places the matter of adjudication of the patent within the control of the patentee, for, if he wishes to avoid adjudication, he can refrain from making charges of infringement. But having made the charge, he then exposes himself to adjudication. </em>In other words, the mere existence of the patent is not a cloud on title, enabling any apprehensive manufacturer to remove it by suit. It requires an assertion of right under the patent to place the alleged infringer in gear to join issue and challenge the title.\u201d Borchard, Declaratory Judgments, 2d Ed.1941, 807 (italics ours).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">In view of what we have just said, what happens to be our agreement with the learned District Court\u2019s attitude toward the unfair competition action is irrelevant. The defendant\u2019s argument that the cause should have been dismissed because plaintiff company instituted appeal subsequent to its dissolution was not seriously pressed. The question is clearly one to be determined by the law of the state of incorporation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> New York where plaintiff was incorporated permits dissolved corporations to do all \u201cacts required tc adjust and wind up its business and affairs\u201d and to \u201csue and be sued in its corporate name.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-19\"> Generally: United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v.
