However, this action is not to be considered as a precedent for other cases in the future. The pleadings before us show the Solvay Company is engaged in important defense work. A strike of any considerable magnitude would seriously interfere with this work and would adversely affect the welfare of the public and the government of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-14\">It also appears from the pleadings that the Chemical Workers\u2019 Union No. 22609, American Federation of Labor, is claiming that the members of that local constitute a majority of the employees of the Solvay Process Co. That union objects to the company entering into an agreement with the Oil Workers\u2019 International Union No. 424 until that question is decided, and had petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to call an election to determine which labor organization should be designated as representing all the employees as the bargaining agent with the Solvay Process Co. That petition was dismissed by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-15\">In interpreting the decree we hold that the Solvay Process Co. is obligated to negotiate with the Oil Workers\u2019 International Union No. 424, affiliated with the Committee for Industrial Organization, without waiting for an election, and that the proviso of section 2(b) does not create a condition precedent to the taking effect of that part of said subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-16\">We consider that patriotism in the emergency should override any factional differences between labor organizations and the Board should act promptly on a petition hereafter filed by a labor union or the Company and fully consider and determine the merits, and call an election within the shortest possible period within which it may be effectively held.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1050-17\">HOLMES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AIn\">(specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-18\">I concur except as to that part of the opinion which says that the proviso to paragraph (b) of part 2 of the decree does not amend or restrict the balance of said paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-19\">The Board\u2019s construction of our decree seems to have been that it was not required to act on any petition for a cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>tification of representatives until the bargaining between Solvay Process Company and Local No. 424 had begun. This interpretation seems to me to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">The above proviso plainly says that the Company may abide the decision of the Board (which means may await said decision) and comply with any supplemental order to enforce certification by the Board, \u201cin lieu of bargaining collectively\u201d with said Local No. 424. The Board has made no supplemental order, and has refused to act on two petitions filed with it under said proviso except to dismiss them summarily without a hearing on the merits of either of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">In view of such action, the proviso permits the Company to continue to await the decision of the Board on the merits of said petitions and to \u201ccomply with any supplemental order by the Board, in lieu of bargaining collectively\u201d with said Local No. 424.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
