Appellee petitioned the court to dismiss this proceeding. The petition was referred to a special master. The master heard it and submitted his report, recommending that the proceeding be dismissed. Appellant excepted to the master\u2019s report. The court overruled the exceptions, approved the report and dismissed the proceeding. From the judgment of dismissal this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-26\">Section 75 applies only to farmers and \u201cto partnerships, common, entirety, joint, community ownerships, or to farming corporations where at least 75 per centum of the stock is owned by actual farmers.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No one else is entitled to commence or maintain a proceeding under \u00a7 75. If commenced by anyone else, such a proceeding will be dismissed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding so commenced has not been vested in any court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Appellant never claimed to be a farmer, a partnership or a common, entirety, joint or community ownership. Its petition alleged that it was a farming corporation, and that 75% of its stock was owned by actual farmers. Appellee\u2019s petition alleged that appellant was not a farming corporation, and that, therefore, the court had no jurisdiction. Thus the court\u2019s jurisdiction, if any, depended on the existence of a fact which appellant alleged and appellee denied \u2014 that appellant was a farming corporation. Hence the burden of proving this alleged fact rested on appellant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The burden was not sustained. Appellant did not prove or attempt to prove that it was a farming corporation. Appellee attempted \u2014 needlessly\u2014to prove that appellant was not a farming corporation. Whether appellee succeeded or not need not be determined, since appellant, not appellee, had the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-15\"> McLaughlin Land &amp; Livestock Co. v.
