The son\u2019s will was admitted to probate on December 7, 1931, in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Santa Barbara. The administrator\u2019s final account and report and petition for final distribution were filed on November 24, 1933. On December 4, 1933, the court entered its decree of settlement of accounts and final distribution; whereupon all remaining assets of the estate were delivered to. and received by the taxpayer. Included among the assets of the estate were 500 shares of stock of the Guarantee Trust Company of Chicago, Illinois, the fair market value of which on November 8, 1931, the date of the son\u2019s death, was $182,250. These 500 shares of stock were sold by the administrator of the estate on November 27, 1933, approximately one week before entry of the decree of final distribution, for $107,680; $74,570 less than their value at the time of the son\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">The administrator filed a fiduciary return of income (Form 1041) in respect of the decedent\u2019s estate for the year 1933, in which he reported an ordinary net income of $76,740.08, computed by including $84,789.69 income and deducting $8,049.61 for interest and taxes paid. In this fiduciary return, under the heading \u201cBeneficiaries\u2019 Share of Income and Credits\u201d, the following three items were reported as distributed or distributable: (a) Dividends $83,840; (b) Ordinary net loss $7,099.92 (Interest and taxes paid $8,049.61 less income from interest $949.69) ; (c) Capital net loss $74,570 (resulting from sale of the Guarantee Trust Company Stock). It will be noted that the balance between the item of dividends and the two items of loss is $2,170.08. The administrator also filed an income tax return (Form 1040) in respect of the decedent\u2019s estate for 1933 in which he listed under income: (a) Interest $949,-69; (b) Loss from sale of capital assets $74,570; (c) Dividends $83,840; and showed a balance of Total<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Income $10,-219.69. Under deductions it listed: (d) Interest paid $2.11; (e) Taxes paid $8,-047.50; (f) Other deductions $2,170.08; totalling $10,219.69, and leaving a balance of Net Income $0.00. Item (f) was explained as follows: \u201cEstate closed and income distributed during year.\u201d It will be noted that this item (f) is the same $2,170.-08 as the balance which results from deducting the listed losses from the listed item of dividends in the fiduciary return.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">In his individual income tax return (Form 1040) for the year 1933, the taxpayer reported a gross income of $94,244.-57, including dividends received by the son\u2019s estate in the amount of $83,840. He also reported a capital net loss of $124,154.-57, including the amount of $74,570, representing the loss on the sale of the 500 shares of Guarantee Trust Company stock. The Commissioner determined that the taxpayer was required to return for taxing purposes all income received by the estate during the taxable year, but that he was not entitled to deduct the loss suffered from the sale of stock or amounts paid for certain estate and inheritance taxes by the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ministrator. The Board of Tax Appeals upheld this determination, relying upon Section 162(c) of the Revenue Act of 1932.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The taxpayer\u2019s representative, petitioner herein, now contends that under the California law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he, rather than the estate, was the owner of the properties comprising the decedent\u2019s estate; that consequently, he, rather than the estate, received the dividends and suffered the loss resulting from the sale of stock. It was upon this theory that he reported as income, the whole amount of dividends received by the estate from properties of the son\u2019s estate; in spite of the fact that both the fiduciary return and the estate\u2019s income tax return reported distribution to him of only $2,170.08. If the petitioner\u2019s contention is correct, then the taxpayer was also correct in reporting the income in his own income tax return and in claiming the loss as a deduction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">But it is not necessary to rest our decision upon this ground. We 'may assume for the purpose of this decision that the contention is incorrect. It still does not follow that the Board\u2019s decision is correct. That decision is based upon Section 162(c) of the Revenue Act of 1932,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which reads as follows: \u201cIn the case of income received by estates of deceased persons during the period of administration or settlement of the estate, and in the case of income which, in the discretion of the fiduciary, may be either distributed to the beneficiary or accumulated, there shall be allowed as an additional deduction in computing the net income of the estate or trust the amount of the income of the estate or trust for its taxable year which is properly paid or credited during such year to any legatee, heir, or beneficiary, but the amount so allowed as a deduction shall be included in computing the net income of the legatee, heir, or beneficiary.\u201d The gist of the Board\u2019s decision is found in the following excerpt therefrom: \u201cThe plain wording of the statute is that the beneficiary is taxable on all of the income of the estate \u2018properly paid or credited\u2019 to him during the taxable year. It is stipulated that the distributions which the father received from the estate during the taxable year 1933 included interest of $949.69 and dividends of $83,840. There is no question but that these amounts were \u2018income\u2019 to the estate and after they were \u2018properly\u2019 paid to the father they are deductible by the estate and taxable to him.\u201d Elsewhere throughout the opinion and in the government\u2019s brief the assumption is made that receipt by the taxpayer, from the estate, of the entire gross income of the estate is conceded. To the contrary it is not conceded. The petitioner\u2019s first contention \u2014 which we have assumed to be incorrect \u2014 was that the dividends were received by him directly, not from the estate. The Commissioner and the Board are apparently attempting to divide up the petitioner\u2019s contention; holding it to an admission that the taxpayer received the income, disregarding its contention that he received it directly or that the administrator was a mere conduit, and imputing to it, what it has neither contended nor admitted, that the income was paid or credited to him by the administrator. Moreover, the petitioner insists \u2014 as an alternative to its contention based upon its interpretation of the California law \u2014 that the only income of the estate which was distributed to the taxpayer within the meaning of Section 162(c) was $2,170.08. Supporting this alternative, the two returns made by the administrator show that no more than $2,170.08 was claimed as a deduction and distributed to him; and, finally, the Board\u2019s statement of the stipulation is incorrect. Being incorrect, it fails to support the conclusion based thereon. The stipulation, which was not only entered into by the parties but adopted by the Board as a finding of fact \u2014 shows that the taxpayer received only the assets of the estate, after its accounts had been settled and its liabilities discharged. The pertinent portion of the stipulation reads as follows: \u201cDuring the year 1933, and prior to the filing of the final account and report and petition for final distribution, * * * <em>income </em>was derived from the properties comprising decedent\u2019s estate, as follows: (a) Interest $949.69, and (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>dividends $83,840, all of which <em>income </em>was paid to and received by the administrator, and <em>is reflected </em>in the item of \u2018Cash on hand * * * $137,651.61\u2019, or elsewhere among the <em>assets </em>described in * * * [the] final account and report and petition for final distribution * * *. All of the <em>assets </em>described in * * * the final account and report and petition for final distribution, were distributed to and received by the taxpayer during the year 1933, except cash in the amount of $24,578.38, allowed and ordered paid to * * * persons * * * designated * * * [in] the decree of settlement of accounts and of final distribution * * (Italics supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">It is true, as the government points out, that it is not necessary, in order for income to be properly distributable under Section 162(c), that it shall be net income of the estate. Thus, if the testator directs in his will, or if the local law requires that certain of the gross income shall be distributed, it may properly be distributed; in which case it will be taxable income, returnable by the legatee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But in the present case no provision was made by the will for paying income \u2014 gross or net \u2014 to the taxpayer during the period of administration or settlement of the estate ; and no contention is made that the local law required its distribution to him. His position was, rather, that of a residuary devisee or legatee, to whom all properties were to go after the payment of claims and the discharge of liabilities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If an executor purports to distribute income where neither the will nor the local law directs, it is necessary to inquire further to determine whether such income was <em>properly </em>paid or credited. For this purpose it is not sufficient that bookkeeping entries in the estate\u2019s accounts show distributions of income. If in fact the distributions were of assets rather than income then the bookkeeping is not controlling. And this may be true even though the bookkeeping shows that income was distributed and liabilities discharged by using assets; if in fact the liabilities thus discharged were sufficient to exhaust the income.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the present case there is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>even bookkeeping evidence of income distribution to the taxpayer in the amount claimed by the Commissioner. To the contrary, as already indicated, the returns filed by the administrator show that only $2,170.08 was distributed to the taxpayer, the amount now conceded by him. Except for the amount thus conceded, the evidence shows that the only distribution ever made to the taxpayer was that which occurred when, after all accounts had been settled, the court, not the administrator, distributed the residue of the estate to him, as sole beneficiary under the will. The only sense, therefore, in which the Commissioner\u2019s claim \u2014 that the entire gross income of the estate was paid or credited to the taxpayer \u2014 has any meaning, is that it was <em>reflected </em>in the corpus of the estate; into which it had been poured; out of which claims and expenses of administration had been paid; against which losses were properly chargeable; and all of which had occurred before the residue of that corpus was delivered to the sole devisee and legatee by the court. It was, indeed, a shadowy image of the gross income of the estate which was thus reflected from the surface of the pool which constituted its corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s disallowance of the taxpayer\u2019s claim for deduction of the amount of the loss which resulted from the sale of the stock was for the stated reason that it was \u201ca transaction affecting corpus of the estate.\u201d But having reasoned thus far correctly, he should have reached the further result that the loss was offset against the corpus of the estate <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 of which the income had then become a part \u2014 before the residue of that corpus was distributed by the court to the taxpayer, hence that, since the taxpayer received no income except the item of $2,-170.08, he was not liable for tax upon the rest of the income.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">On this appeal the government concedes that the loss was the loss of the estate and that it reduced \u201cthe net income of the estate below the amount distributed\u201d, but contends that this fact does not aid the taxpayer, \u201cfor what he received was a distribution of income, properly made.\u201d In its opinion the Board said: \u201cUndoubtedly the resulting loss of $74,570 was a loss of the estate, the benefit of which it might have claimed in its income tax return in accordance with the statute.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It then adopted the premise, urged by the government, that, nevertheless, the taxpayer received a distribution of the whole income, properly made, and concluded that he was taxable thereon. But, as has been shown, the premise is false and the conclusion falls with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">To accept the Board\u2019s conclusion, when applied to the actual facts of the present case, would convert the optional, alternative provision of Section 162(c) into an unqualified, arbitrary requirement that a sole legatee or residuary legatee shall pay taxes upon the gross income received by an estate. But that is not its meaning. The ' statute requires, in order that the beneficiary may be taxable for such income, not merely that the deduction <em>might </em>have been <em>claimed; </em>it is necessary that it be <em>allowed; </em>and that it be allowed because it has been <em>distributed </em>as income to the beneficiary. In the present case the income was neither allowed as a deduction, nor paid or credited to the beneficiary as income, except in the amount of $2,170.08. We conclude, therefore, that he was taxable for that amount, and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-10\"> 47 Stat. 169, 220, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.
