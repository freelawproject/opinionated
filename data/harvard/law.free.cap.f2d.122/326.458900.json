Free of liens, the assets brought $444,500. Claims totalling over $566,000 were filed for unpaid operating expenses and for money borrowed on receiver\u2019s certificates. The court, after a reference to a special master and a review and modification of the master\u2019s recommendations, made an order classifying and allowing these claims as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">First priority \u2014 Judicial costs.....(not determined) Second priority \u2014 Taxes due United States $ 25,976.44</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdM\">Third priority \u2014 Taxes due State of Oklahoma and its political subdivisions ............ 102,873.51</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-13\">Fourth priority \u2014 Receiver\u2019s operating expenses ..................... 409,344.08</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-14\">Including</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-15\">(a) Part of RFO receiver\u2019s certificates ................ $217,776,77</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-17\">(b) MKT claim................ -90,810.73</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-18\">(c) KCS claim ................ 54,173.57</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-19\">(d) Roy Eubanks\u2019 claim...... 11,644.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-20\">Fifth priority \u2014 Balance RFC receiver's certificates ................ 28,213.06</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-22\">Separate appeals have been taken by Reconstruction Finance Corporation, referred to herein as RFC; by Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Company, referred to herein as MKT; by The Kansas City Southern Railway Company, referred to herein as KCS; and by Roy Eubanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-23\">RFC contends that its receiver\u2019s certificates, in their full amount, should have been given priority over all other claims, except judicial costs. MKT and KCS, both of whose claims arise out of joint track and terminal facilities agreements, contend that the trial court erred in placing only $28,213.06 of RFC\u2019s claim in the class of fifth priority,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the tax claims, which were classified as second and third priorities, were not properly entitled to preferential payment over the receiver\u2019s other operating expenses. Eu-banks takes a similar position with respect to RFC\u2019s claim and the tax priorities, but his principal contention is that his own claim, based on a judgment under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 51 et seq., for the loss of his legs, as a brakeman, during receivership operation, is entitled to preferential payment over all other operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-25\">RFC\u2019s certificates antedate all the other obligations of the receiver here involved. Any priority, however, which it was intended at the time that they were to have over subsequent operating expenses should have been clearly indicated in the court orders which authorized their issuance. The orders before us provide that \u201csaid certificate or certificates * * * shall be secured by, and the same are hereby declared to be and constitute a direct lien upon all the property and franchises, wherever located, of the Fort Smith and Western Railway Company, now owned or hereafter acquired by it, and upon the net income thereof, prior and paramount to the * * * mortgages or deeds of trust, executed by said defendant Railway Company and now outstanding, and prior and paramount to all bonds and all other sums, and all interest thereon secured by said mortgages or deeds of trust, and prior and paramount to all other liabilities and obligations of every kind, character and nature of said Fort Smith and Western Railway Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-27\">RFC argues that this language was intended to, and did, constitute the certificates a primary lien upon all property in the hands of the receiver, and that no other claims could properly be paid out of such assets until this charge was satisfied. It will be noted, however, that the orders merely provide that the certificates shall constitute a lien prior to existing mortgages and prior to \u201call other liabilities and obligations * * * <em>of said Fort Smith and Western Railway Company.\u201d </em>(Italics sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>plied). No reference is made to the liabilities and obligations of the receiver for the expenses of continued operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Quite obviously, it was contemplated that the receiver\u2019s operation of the railroad might continue for an indefinite period. The loan application filed with RFC declared that improvement in general business conditions could reasonably be expected so to increase the revenues as to enable payment to be made of all subsequent operating and maintenance expenses, as well as the RFC loan. Neither the orders authorizing the issuance of the receiver\u2019s certificates nor the petitions upon which they are based indicate, however, that the court and the parties foresaw or were undertaking to make provision to cover the situation, in the event that this contingency failed to materialize.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The receiver\u2019s operation of the railroad was not in the interest of creditors and stockholders alone, but equally for the purpose of attempting to preserve the service to the public, to which the railroad of necessity was dedicated. No one could say how long the effort to serve the public interest through receivership operation ought justifiably to. be continued. In this situation, the conclusion ought not to be indulged, unless inexorably compelled by the language of the order and the conditions under which it was made, that the court was intending to fetter and perhaps render wholly impossible the continued operation of the railroad, by an impotence to make acceptable provision for necessary future expenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Certainly such a conclusion is not soundly required here. We think the trial court properly held that the orders authorizing the receiver\u2019s certificates were intended to create a priority only over existing liens and obligations of the railway company, and that the matter of the receiver\u2019s future operating expenses was left entirely open. Indeed, even if an attempt had been made to create an absolute and complete priority in the issuance of the receiver\u2019s certificates, this would not, generally speaking, have precluded the court from subsequently making an equitable readjustment, with respect to the necessary expenses of continuing the operation of the railroad in the public interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">In its classification of the claims, the trial court included in the fourth priority, with subsequent operating expenses, so much of the proceeds of the RFC certificates as had been used by the receiver to pay his then accrued operating expenses and to satisfy certain previous obligations which the court regarded as being on an equitable parity with receivership operating expenses. Thus, $30,000 had apparently been used to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>repayment of funds borrowed or diverted by the receiver to meet the operating payroll of the railroad for the month preceding the receivership. Some of the money used by the receiver to make payments on obligations under joint facilities agreements and on obligations for car repairs, which had accrued prior to the receivership, \u2014 among the beneficiaries of which were appellants MKT and KCS \u2014 was also included in this priority. So, too, the sum of approximately $42,000, used to pay taxes to the State of Oklahoma, which had been levied for the previous year, but which, under the provisions of a special extension statute,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were not required to be paid until after the time the receiver was appointed, was allowed as a preferential part of RFC\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Appellants MKT, KCS, and Eu-banks contend that no part of the three items referred to should have been placed in the fourth priority. It is well settled, however, that pre-existing debts of a railroad, for expenses currently and reasonably necessary to its ordinary operation as a going concern, incurred within a limited period prior to the receivership \u2014 usually not exceeding six months \u2014 may, in the sound discretion of the trial court, be allowed preferential payment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Money loaned to the receiver, with court approval, for the payment of indebtedness entitled to a preference, may properly be granted a corresponding priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The record does not indicate the exact cut-off dates adopted by the trial \u25a0court for preferential purposes, as to the various obligations incurred prior to the receivership. Of the RFC money used to pay previous material and supply bills, \u2022none appears to have been placed in the \u2022fourth priority. On the other hand, all the money used to discharge loans made to the receiver to care for the preceding month\u2019s payroll, or to replace funds diverted for this purpose, was obviously included. Only part of the funds used to satisfy the obligations arising out of joint facilities agreements or for car repair bills for the preceding six months\u2019 period seems to have been accorded preferential recognition. Appellant KCS contends that the trial court did not intend to include any part of the pre-existing joint facilities or car repair claims in the fourth priority, and that it must have done so through some inadvertent error in calculation or transposition. But, on the record before us, and in the face of the positive figures set out in the court\u2019s memorandum opinion, this contention can hardly be regarded as anything more than conjecture and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">What part, if any, of the railroad\u2019s current operating expenses for the six months preceding the receivership should be accorded a preference was a question for the sound discretion of the trial court, on the facts and equities of the particular case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We cannot say, as appellants MJCT, KCS, and Eubanks would have us do, that no part of the indebtedness incurred prior to the receivership, for current operating expenses, ought equitably to be allowed preferential recognition in the present situation. Nor, on the other hand, does the record unequivocally demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion in not broadening its classification of current operating expenses, or in not adopting a more inclusive cut-off date, so as to have increased the amount of RFC\u2019s preferential allowance. We are impressed that the trial court attempted to give careful and conscientious consideration to the equities of priority determinations, and we agree generally with the statement in its memorandum opinion that \u201cthe court which has been charged with the administration of the insolvent\u2019s affairs through a course of years must have, by reason of its intimate relations with such administration, a better knowledge of the equitable adjustments to be made among creditors than any one else\u201d. As to the priority allowed that part of RFC\u2019s funds used to pay taxes to the State of Oklahoma, which had been levied for the year preceding the receivership, but which, by the terms of a special extension statute,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> had been made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>non-delinquent until after the receiver was appointed, we think, in view of the object and effect of the statute, and the limited and proximate period involved, that the court could properly permit these taxes to be accepted and treated as an obligation of the receivership, like any other taxes that might accrue during its course, and that having authorized the receiver to borrow money to make payment of them, it could legitimately classify the receiver\u2019s resulting obligation, on a parity with other operating expenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">All of appellants contend that the trial court abused its discretion in giving priority to the taxes that became due to the United States,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and to the State of Oklahoma and its political subdivisions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> during the receivership, over other operating expenses, but this contention is without merit. Taxes accruing during a railroad receivership may properly be preferred over all other claims except judicial costs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> No statute is necessary to create the priority,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which may be based wholly upon a judicial recognition of governmental need and prerogative.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Appellant MKT argues that the tax claim of the State of Oklahoma and its political subdivisions ought to be denied priority as a matter of laches and estoppel, because, during the period such taxes were accumulating, from 1932 to 1938, no application was made to the court for their payment. Clearly, the mere failure of public officers charged with the duty of collecting taxes, to make application annually to the court for payment of the taxes accruing during a railroad receivership, is not such a circumstance as will defeat the state\u2019s right to ' priority for the accumulated taxes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The only question remaining is as to the right of appellant Eubanks\u2019 judgment for personal injuries, to priority over the other operating expenses of the receiver. Eu-banks, as has already been indicated, was employed by the receiver as a brakeman, and lost both his legs in a train accident in Oklahoma. He recovered a judgment under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, against the receiver, for $18,000, in the state courts of Oklahoma. The receiver had made payments upon the judgment, until its amount was reduced to $11,644, for which his claim was allowed in this proceeding, in the fourth priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Two bases of Eubanks\u2019 claim to a higher priority may be disposed of summarily. The general judgment lien statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>of Oklahoma<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> does not improve his position. A provision in a state statute for a general lien upon the property of a judgment debtor will not operate to create a priority over other operating expenses in a federal court railroad receivership, as to an operating expense claim that is reduced to judgment against the receiver.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The judgment in such a case establishes only the existence and the amount of the receiver\u2019s liability: it does not affect the right of the receivership court to determine the priority relationships of its own operating expense claims, and to adjust the equities among all those having rights in or against the property.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Arkansas statute,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> upon which reliance also is placed, can have no possible application, since, irrespective of any other question that it might present, the Supreme Court of Arkansas has construed it as applying only to causes of action arising within the state.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Here, the cause of action arose in Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">Section 77, subsection n, of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended in 1939, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 205, sub. n,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> is made the final basis of Eubanks\u2019 claim for priority over the rest of the receiver\u2019s operating expenses. We have previously declared as to the portion of this statute that is here involved, that \u201cThe purpose of this Act is to secure relief for injured employees of railroads which have gone into bankruptcy or receivership after the injury and before satisfaction of the claim therefor against the railroad\u201d.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Congress has merely accorded such claims, together with claims of personal representatives of deceased employees, and claims of unsecured sureties, a status as operating expenses of the railroad receivership or trusteeship.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It has directed that all of such claims \u201cshall be preferred and paid out of the assets of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>such railroad corporation as operating expenses\u201d, and it has apparently assumed that such a general priority would ordinarily insure their payment in full. Normally, this could be expected to be the case, but, if such a situation did not result, the statute makes no provision to cover it.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In Eubanks\u2019 case, where the injury occurred during the receivership operation, the statute, as a matter of fact, was not needed to give his claim the status of an operating expense. In any event, we find nothing in the language of the statute that requires a court of equity, as a matter of legislative command, to give claims for the personal injury or death of a railroad employee, whether arising before or during the receivership operation, a priority over other expenses of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">But the absence of a legislative mandate must not be treated as an absolution of our judicial responsibility in the case. The very nature and purpose of chancery jurisdiction requires that we do not close our eyes and conscience to those natural and compelling equities which are sufficiently broad to furnish the basis for a sound governing principle in the situation presented. Thus, we have recognized above our right to give preference to the tax claims of the United States and the State of Oklahoma, over all other operating expenses of the receiver, because of their inherent nature.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> And, in the situation which we are now considering, the unsatisfied claim of appellant Eubanks for personal injuries touches our equitable conscience with a stronger natural and social appeal, than the commercial-risk claims of joint facilities agreements, car repair bills, and kindred items which are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">The force and universality of this natural appeal, we believe, can hardly be denied. That which so instinctively and universally impresses itself as the natural justice of a situation must not go unheeded by a court, in dealing with those inherent and flexible values termed \u201cequities\u201d, unless the circumstances are so individualistic in nature as to transgress the sound general principles by which the field of jurisprudence must fundamentally be marked. We find no \u201ckeep out\u201d signs here. It should perhaps be said also that the path does not appear to bear any \u201cmarkers\u201d from past decisions, but this is not a deterrent to the step of sound conscience. The path of equity is not a dead end.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">The situation here presented is perhaps not one that will frequently arise. Usually the operating expenses of a railroad receivership can be and are paid in full. But where it is found at the close of such a receivership, as the result of unforeseen conditions, that the assets of the railroad, both income and corpus, are insufficient to pay the receiver\u2019s operating expenses in full, we believe there are such superior and compelling equities in an employee\u2019s claim for personal injuries, as to entitle a court of equity to give it priority over the general operating expenses of commercial risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">We therefore hold that the claim of appellant Eubanks should be allowed preferential payment over the other claims which the court placed in fourth priority, and that the judgment should be in all other respects affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">Reversed as to claim of appellant Eu-banks; affirmed as to claims of all other appellants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-28\"> MKT\u2019s brief argues that $105,672.08 of RFC\u2019s certificates should have been classified in fifth priority, while KCS claims that the amount should have been $115,410.06.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\"> Compare the following expressions:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\u201cIt is not presumable that the court would devest itself of the power to pay the expense of operation which it had assumed. That would be an act of felo de se.\u201d Anderson v. Condict, 7 Cir., 93 F. 349, 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">\u201cIt' is said, however, that the court made the certificates a first lien on the property, and that, having contracted for this, it cannot afterwards let in anything to impair its own decree. But the court cannot bargain away its powers, if indeed it can be held to have done so. * * * The court, in so pledging the property of the company, cannot be held to have tied its hands or stripped itself of authority to deal with it to this end. If that was not expressed in the order, it was implied. * * * The priority given [the receiver\u2019s certificates] by the order had relation to their standing with respect to other in-cumbrances, and was not with the idea of preferring them over administration expenses, subsequently incurred, which may therefore properly be first paid out of the proceeds of this sale, as provided in the foreclosure decree.\u201d Pusey &amp; Jones v.
