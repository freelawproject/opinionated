Constitution construed.\u2014Article 1, section 17, of the constitution places \u201d it beyond the legislative power of the state to authorize any individual or corporation to take, damage, destroy or apply the property of the citizen to public use, without adequate compensation being made, unless he consents thereto. By the term \u201cproperty,\u201d as above used, is meant not only the tangible thing owned, but every right and incident which accompanies ownership.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b491-13\">2. Same.\u2014 By the word \u201cdamaged,\u201d above used, as applied to injuries resulting from the construction of public works, is meant some injury peculiar to the particular property, and not suffered by it as a result of the construction of the public work in common with other properties in the same community,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b491-15\">3. Damages \u2014 Railways.\u2014 Legislative permission to construct a railroad through the streets of a city cannot relieve the railway company from the duty of compensating the citizen who by its construction along a street receives special damage in the depreciation of his property.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b491-17\">4. Measure of damages.\u2014 In such a case the jury, in estimating damages, may consider whether the property claimed to have been damaged was enhanced in value by the construction of the road in a sum equal to the special injury claimed to have been sustained; and if it was not, whether, by reason of improvements made by the road owners, the street is in better condition than it was before the railway was built. But the benefits and losses which the plaintiff received and sustained by the building of the road, in common with the community generally, are to be excluded from the estimate in ascertaining the amount of damage.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b491-19\">Appeal from Harris. Tried below before the Hon. James Masterson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-20\">Suit brought October 15, 1883, by Almond Fuller against the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company, to recover the sum of $3,000 for damages, alleged by plaintiff to have been occasioned to land and improvements thereon owned by him, on St. Emanuel street, in the city of Houston, Texas, by the building and operating by defendant of a railroad on that street. The lots were occupied by plaintiff as a homestead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-21\">The defendant demurred generally and specially to plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>petition, and answered by a general denial and special pleas, alleging that defendant had permission and authority, by its charter and ordinances of the city council of Houston, to build and operate its railroad. That the road had been carefully and skilfully built, and that engines and cars thereon were properly and carefully operated, and that St. Emanuel street, in front of plaintiff\u2019s property, had been very greatly improved by the work and labor of defendant; that by reason thereof it was in a better condition to be traveled over, and for all the ordinary purposes of a street, than it was before defendant constructed its railroad over the street, and that by reason of the building and operating of the railroad, and the work done by defendant in connection therewith, the property of plaintiff had been enhanced in value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-4\">The demurrer and special exceptions of defendant were overruled. Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,200.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">It was admitted on the trial of the case that defendant had permission and authority by its charter, and under the ordinances of the city of Houston, to build and operate its railroad on and over St. Emanuel street; and there was no evidence of any unskilfulness in the construction of the road or the operation of trains thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">Several witnesses testified that the property wras worth less on the market by from twenty-five to thirty-three and a third per cent, than it would be if defendant\u2019s railroad was not there; that it was less desirable and valuable for homestead purposes than it would be without the railroad, though some witnesses thought its value for other purposes may not have been impaired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">The lots were worth from $2,000 to $2,500, without the improvements. A narrow gauge railway runs through the center of the street, and defendant\u2019s track was placed between the narrow gauge railroad and plaintiff\u2019s premises, there being scarcely room to drive between.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-8\"><em>Jones &amp; </em>Garnett, for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF\">that the petition disclosed no cause of action, cited: Charter of City of Houston, sec. 23, as amended in</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-9\">1883 (see Special Laws 18th Legislature, p. 15); art. 4173, R.

R. Co. <em>v. </em>Eddins, 60 Tex., 656, in which authorities bearing on them are collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The court gave the following charges: \u201cThat private property cannot be taken, damaged or destroyed for or applied to public use, without adequate compensation being made, unless by the consent of such person. If the proof satisfy you that defendant company, by permission of its charter and of the municipal authorities of the city of Houston, but without consent of plaintiff, has built its track on St. Emanuel street, and runs its trains thereon, if such track and use of such street by defendant in passing its trains over same has damaged plaintiff\u2019s property described in his petition, find for plaintiff, and assess the amount thereof. On the other hand, if from the proof you are not satisfied that real damage or lessening in value of plaintiff\u2019s property has occurred, and was occasioned by defendant\u2019s acts complained of, your verdict should be for defendant. If, under the evidence applied to the law given you in charge, you find that plaintiff\u2019s property has been injured by the acts of defendant company complained of, the measure of damage is for the actual loss thereby sustained in the fair, reasonable salable value of plaintiff\u2019s said propert}r: that is to say, if by reason of defendant\u2019s acts complained of, plaintiff\u2019s property is lessened in value, he is entitled to recover the fair and actual difference between the fair valuation of said property, if any, occasioned by defendant\u2019s acts, and its fair valuation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>but for defendant\u2019s acts complained of; and you will look to all the evidence as to its use when defendant company built and operated its track and run its trains over St. Emanuel street, as it may be affected injuriously thereby, as well as all other evidence touching the fair valuation of plaintiff\u2019s property, and as to how, if at all, the value is injuriously affected by defendant\u2019s acts complained of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">1. The court also charged, at request of plaintiff: \u201cIf you believe from the evidence that St. Emanuel street in front of plaintiff\u2019s property has been improved by defendant since'the construction of defendant\u2019s railroad, and that said street is in a better condition for ordinary street uses than it was before said railroad was built, you may consider this circumstance in mitigation of the damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff; and should you believe that the fact of said street being thus improved counterbalances all injuries, if any, resulting to said property from the use of said street by defendant, and operation thereon of defendant\u2019s railroad, you will find for defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">2. The court also charged, at the request of defendant: \u201cIf the jury believe from the evidence that at the time of constructing its road on St. Emanuel street the defendant, at its own labor and expense, raised and shelled said street in front of plaintiff\u2019s property, and thereby improved said street, and made it more convenient to be traveled over than it was before; and if you further believe from the evidence that by reason of this improvement plaintiff\u2019s property has been enhanced in value, and that this enhancement in value is equal to or greater than any depreciation caused by the construction and operation of said road and the moving of trains thereon, then you will find for defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">3. The following was also given at request of plaintiff: \u201cIn estimating the value of said premises with and without the railroad being on said street, you shall base your estimate <em>on the fair market value of the same, </em>and in this connection you should consider in defendant\u2019s, favor such special benefits, if any, as the plaintiff may have derived from the location of said railroad on said street. . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">4. The court also charged, at request of defendant: \u201cIf the jury believe from the evidence that plaintiff\u2019s property is worth as much now as it would be worth if defendant\u2019s railroad was not built and operated on St. Emanuel street, in the manner that it has been and is being done, you will find for defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">We are of the opinion that these charges fairly submitted to the jury the law for the government of the case, both as to the right of the appellee to recover, and as to the measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>It is urged that the court erred in charging the jury, at plaintiff\u2019s request, that \u201cIn estimating the amount of damage, if any, sustained by the plaintiff, you must not consider those benefits or injuries to plaintiff\u2019s said property which he may receive or sustain in common with the community generally where said property is situated, which results from the construction and operation of the defendant\u2019s railroad, and which are not peculiar to him and connected with his ownership, use and enjoyment of his said property, and all such benefits or losses shall be altogether excluded from your estimate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We are of the opinion that there was no error in this charge; for the same reasons which make it proper to exclude such benefits in estimating damage under the statutory proceeding to condemn the right of way apply in a case in which the owner is compelled to resort to law to obtain redress for an illegal taking or damage done to his property. R. S., 4194-4196.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The charge referred to in the sixth assignment was properly refused, and so much of the charge referred to in the seventh assignment as was material and proper was given in other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The charge referred to in the eighth assignment contained matter which with proper limitations was given in other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">[Opinion delivered March 6, 1885.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
