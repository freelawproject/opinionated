And proof of its value at other times was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">The court did not err in admitting in evidence the contract through which the appellants, through their agent, agreed to sell and deliver to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">The contract was made in duplicate, one of which was taken by the agent of the appellants, and the other was retained by the appellee, and seems to be in a form common to such transactions. That offered in evidence was the duplicate kept by the appellee and was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\"><em>\u201c </em>Original.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-13\">\u201c Salesman,--.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-14\">\u201c Bo. \u2014. 188\u2014.

T. .1. Monarch, 2.50, 1880, laid in Laredo direct from distillery, same as gauger leaves it. De Milly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">It was proved by one of the appellants, and otherwise, that De Milly was the agent of Ullman, Lewis &amp; Co., engaged in selling whiskys for them, and it was clearly shown that the language of the contract in reference to the thing sold and its price, meant fifteen barrels of whisky of the ,T. J. Monarch brand or make, manufactured in the year 1880, for the price of $2.50 per gallon. It was also proved that the contract was made September 20, 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Mor did the court err in instructing the jury that under the contract the appellants were bound to deliver the whisky in Laredo within a reasonable time after the contract was made; for the words \u201c laid in Laredo direct from distillery \u201d are hardly susceptible of any other meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">There was no controversy as to the meaning of such parts of the contract as upon its face were ambiguous. There was no conflict in the testimony in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">The appellee offered in evidence two letters purporting to be signed by the appellants, one of date September 24, 1882, and the other dated 27th of same month, which he testified were received by him at Laredo, by due course of mail, in answer to letters which he had written to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">These letters were objected to on the ground that there was no proof of the genuineness of the signatures of Ullman, Lewis &amp; Co., and the objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">We are of the opinion that the facts furnished <em>prima facie </em>proof of the genuineness of the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">Mr. Greenleaf thus states the rule: \u201cA further exception to the \u25a0rule requiring proof of handwriting has been admitted in the case of letters received in reply to others proved to have been sent to the party. Thus, where the plaintiff\u2019s attorney wrote a letter addressed to the defendant at his residence, and sent by the post, to which he received a reply purporting to be from the defendant, it was held that the letter thus received was admissible in evidence without proof of the defendant\u2019s handwriting, and that letters of an earlier date in the same handwriting might also be read without other proof.\u201d 1 Greenleaf, 573a, citing Orenston <em>v. </em>Wilson, 2 Car. <em>&amp; </em>Kir., 1. To the same effect are the following: Wharton\u2019s Law of Evidence, 1328; State <em>v. </em>Bradish, 14 Mass., 300; Chaffee <em>v. </em>Taylor, 3 Allen, 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>These letters not only showed the agency of De Hilly, but within themselves furnished proof of the execution of the contract by the agent, and of its terms, and the appellants\u2019 knowledge thereof; all of which, most probably, in the ordinary course of business, was derived from the duplicate forwarded or delivered to the appellants by De Hilly.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The court gave to the jury the correct rule on the measure of damages, and the jury could not have been misled by the fact that, in the charge of the court, the word \u201c value \u201d was not qualified by the word \u201cmarket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The evidence introduced to show the value at Laredo at the time at which, under the contract, the whisky should have been delivered was such as, under t\u201e\u201e facts of the case, was admissible for the purpose of showing the market value at Laredo, and none other. We see no reason to doubt that a person who, by executory contract, has contracted to sell and deliver merchandise on a credit, may refuse to deliver in case of the insolvency of the purchaser, as rightfully as a seller may arrest merchandise in transit, when the contract has been so completed as to vest the title in the purchaser if he be insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The court instructed the jury that the appellants had the right to refuse to deliver if the appellee was insolvent, and gave the charge asked by appellants as to what would constitute insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">There was evidence tending to show that the appellee was solvent at the time the whisky- should have been delivered, and the finding of the jury on this issue is conclusive of that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">That the simple neglect to pay a debt, or the levy of an attachment on a debtor\u2019s property, is not proof of insolvency is certainly true.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">The evidence was conflicting as to the market value of the whisky at Laredo at the time at which it should have been delivered, but there was evidence reasonably tending to show that its value there was such as to justify the verdict; and it was for the jury to judge of the credibility of the witnesses, and the weight to be given to their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">They having believed the testimony of the witnesses for the appellee, and there being nothing to induce the belief that the jury did not properly weigh the evidence, that there was evidence from which they might have come to a different conclusion furnishes no reason why a new trial should have been granted, and the court below correctly so ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">There is no error, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">[Opinion delivered January 16, 1885.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
