Robert Grillo from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. 082003, a guardianship proceeding pending on the request of the ward\u2019s father for visitation with the ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">{\u00b6 2} Cottrill, guardian of the ward, opposes the father\u2019s visitation request. Cottrill claims that Judge Grillo is biased and prejudiced against him and the ward because the judge has predetermined the outcome of the father\u2019s request before the hearing. Specifically, Cottrill alleges that Judge Grillo is \u201cnot governed by the law nor the facts\u201d and \u201c[h]is mind is closed to anything other than forcing [the] ward to visit his father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Grillo has responded in writing to Cottrill\u2019s affidavit, offering a detailed account of his handling of the underlying case and denying that he has predetermined the outcome of the pending visitation request.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-15\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Grillo.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-16\">{\u00b6 5} In affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, \u201c[t]he term \u2018bias or prejudice\u2019 \u2018implies a hostile feeling or spirit of ill-will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Neill, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1232, 2002-Ohio-7479, 798 N.E.2d 17, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956). The burden falls on the affiant to submit specific allegations of bias or prejudice, <em>see </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1), and an affiant is generally \u201crequired to submit evidence beyond the affidavit of disqualification supporting the allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>contained therein.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Baronzzi, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1212, 2012-Ohio-6341, 985 N.E.2d 494, \u00b6 6. In addition, a \u201cpresumption of impartiality\u201d is \u201caccorded all judges\u201d in affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings. <em>In re Disqualification of Celebrezze, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1224, 2003-Ohio-7352, 803 N.E.2d 823, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">{\u00b6 6} Here, Cottrill speculates that Judge Grillo \u201cdoes not have an open mind in this matter.\u201d To support his allegation, Cottrill cites the fact that Judge Grillo has issued temporary orders granting the father visitation with the ward. Judges, however, routinely issue temporary orders pending a permanent decision on the ultimate issue, and such temporary orders do not demonstrate the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge. For his part, Judge Grillo avers that he has not made up his mind on the pending visitation request, and although \u201ca judge\u2019s subjective belief as to his or her own impartiality is not the decisive factor in deciding a disqualification request,\u201d the judge\u2019s own assessment is \u201centitled to some weight.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Lewis, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1227, 2004-Ohio-7359, 884 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 11. On this record, Cottrill has not set forth sufficiently compelling evidence to suggest that the presumption of impartiality afforded to all judges has been overcome. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Flanagan, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1236, 2009-Ohio-7199, 937 N.E.2d 1023, \u00b6 4 (\u201cAllegations that are based solely on hearsay, innuendo, and speculation \u2014 such as those alleged here \u2014 are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">{\u00b6 7} In addition, one of Cottrill\u2019s major complaints against Judge Grillo is the judge\u2019s determination that he had jurisdiction to entertain the father\u2019s visitation request. Cottrill argues that \u201c[tjhere is no law that gives [Judge Grillo] the power to order a 64 year old man to visit his 92 year old father.\u201d It is well settled, however, that a party\u2019s disagreement or dissatisfaction with a court\u2019s legal rulings, even if those rulings may be erroneous, does not constitute bias or prejudice and is not grounds for disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 4. The remedy for Cottrill\u2019s legal claims lies on appeal, not through the filing of an affidavit of disqualification. <em>See In re Disqualification of Russo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1208, 2005-Ohio-7146, 850 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">{\u00b6 8} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Grillo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
