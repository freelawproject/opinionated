Baronzzi from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. C2012-0372, AB21230345, a child-custody case in the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Columbiana County.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">{\u00b6 2} The plaintiff filed his complaint in October 2012. About a year later, Trageser filed a motion to disqualify plaintiffs counsel, Tracey Laslo, arguing that Laslo had a conflict of interest because Trageser had consulted with her in 2011 about an unrelated divorce matter. After a hearing, Judge Baronzzi denied Trageser\u2019s motion in a November 1, 2013 judgment entry. In her affidavit of disqualification, Trageser claims that the judge\u2019s ruling on her motion, his conduct at the hearing, and the language in his judgment entry have created an appearance of impropriety requiring his removal from the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Baronzzi has responded in writing to Trageser\u2019s affidavit, averring that he harbors no bias against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-15\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Baronzzi.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-16\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cWhen an affidavit is filed after commencement of a trial and after the presentation of evidence has begun, a judge should be disqualified only when the record \u2018clearly and unquestionably demonstrates a \u201cfixed anticipatory judgment\u201d * * * that undermines the absolute confidence of the public in the fairness and integrity of the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Swift, </em>136 Ohio St.3d 1273, 2013-Ohio-4464, 996 N.E.2d 939, \u00b6 5, quoting <em>In re Disqualification of Kate, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>88 Ohio St.3d 1208, 1209, 723 N.E.2d 1098 (1999), quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956). Here, a merit hearing commenced on July 9, 2013, and after a full day of evidence, Judge Baronzzi continued the matter for a second merit hearing on November 26, 2013. Accordingly, because the presentation of evidence has already begun, Trageser cannot rely on vague allegations of an appearance of impropriety to succeed on her affidavit. Rather, she must demonstrate that Judge Baronzzi has clearly reached a fixed anticipatory judgment in the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">{\u00b6 6} Trageser has failed to submit sufficient proof to carry this heavy burden. First, her disagreement with Judge Baronzzi\u2019s refusal to disqualify attorney Laslo is not grounds for disqualification. Trageser criticizes Judge Baronzzi\u2019s evidentiary rulings at the recent hearing, and she argues that he applied an incorrect legal standard in his judgment entry. But it is well established that a party\u2019s \u201cdissatisfaction or disagreement with a judge\u2019s rulings, even if those rulings may be erroneous, does not constitute bias or prejudice and is not grounds for the judge\u2019s disqualification.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b64. Trageser\u2019s remedy for these legal claims, if any, lies on appeal, not through the filing of an affidavit of disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Russo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1208, 2005-Ohio-7146, 850 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">{\u00b6 7} Second, the judge\u2019s language in his November 1 judgment entry is also not grounds for disqualification. In that entry, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">Ms. Trageser, previously within the custody case, has made allegations against the father of her child that he is an abuser of drugs and alcohol. Upon further investigation of that allegation, it was found that the father tested negative for any evidence of drug abuse. Furthermore, by Ms. Trageser\u2019s testimony, she has very aggressively and defensively presented herself as self-righteous and the victim of virtually all persons with whom she has a personal or professional relationship in recent years. The Court, quite frankly, does not find that there is credible evidence that Ms. Trageser has divulged to Attorney Tracy Laslo, by a prior meeting, any information regarding any personal or other details relevant to the issues before the Court for determination and the Court, therefore, concludes that the allegations are untrue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Trageser claims that the judge\u2019s comments regarding the father\u2019s alleged drug abuse show that he has reached an opinion on an ultimate issue of fact in the case. In response, Judge Baronzzi explains that in December 2012, Trageser accused the plaintiff of abusing drugs, and the judge therefore ordered drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>testing. In January 2013, the results of the plaintiffs tests came back negative. Thus, the judge\u2019s comments in his November 1 entry appear to be stating a fact in the record, not an opinion on an ultimate issue of fact. Accordingly, without more explanation from Trageser, her vague and unsubstantiated allegation here is insufficient for a finding of bias or prejudice. <em>See In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 8} As to the other comments in the judge\u2019s entry, Trageser states that one \u201cwould expect [the statements] to come from the opposing counsel, but to be uttered by a Judge in his ruling on a motion in the middle of a trial is without a doubt tainting the due process of a fair and impartial hearing.\u201d \"For his part, Judge Baronzzi explains that after observing Trageser\u2019s testimony at both the hearing on her motion to disqualify Laslo and the July merit hearing, he had developed \u201csignificant concerns\u201d regarding her \u201cgeneral veracity and/or motivations.\u201d He further explains that he was \u201ccandid and honest\u201d with her in his findings that there was no credible evidence to support her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">{\u00b6 9} Contrary to Trageser\u2019s contention, a judge, like any trier of fact, is expected to assess a witness\u2019s character and credibility. <em>In re Disqualification of Gaines, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1259, 1261, 657 N.E.2d 1359 (1994). And when a judge\u2019s opinion regarding a party\u2019s credibility is formed on the basis of evidence presented during the course of the proceedings, that opinion is not deemed to be the product of bias or prejudice. <em>See id. </em>(judge\u2019s unfavorable comments about the affiant\u2019s parenting skills were formed over protracted litigation in which the judge had multiple opportunities to observe the affiant; therefore, the judge\u2019s comments were not grounds for disqualification). Here, Judge Baronzzi claims that he formed his opinion about Trageser\u2019s credibility as a result of her testimony at two hearings. Rather than reflecting bias, the judge\u2019s language in his entry displays his rationale for denying her motion \u2014 that is, why he doubted the truthfulness of her allegations. On this record, Trageser has not sufficiently demonstrated that the judge\u2019s language reveals that he has reached a fixed anticipatory judgment in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. * * * A judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome here. Accordingly, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Baronzzi.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">{\u00b6 11} In addition, it is ordered that the sealed documents from the juvenile court that Judge Baronzzi submitted with his response to the affidavit of disqualification shall be placed under seal by the clerk of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
