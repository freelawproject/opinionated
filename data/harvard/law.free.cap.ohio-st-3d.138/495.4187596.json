Both the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) and the Ninth District Court of Appeals agreed that state law preempted the local tax as applied to \u201cmotor transportation companies\u201d that are subject to state taxes, fees, and regulatory requirements. The Central Collection Agency (\u201cCCA\u201d) and its tax administrator and the Seville Board of Income Tax Review have appealed from the judgment of the court of appeals, contending that the state law at issue does not preclude the imposition of generally applicable local income taxes. We disagree and affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">{\u00b6 2} These consolidated cases are separately filed appeals from the same court of appeals decision, one filed by the Seville Board of Income Tax Review and the other filed by the CCA and its tax administrator, Nassim Lynch.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">{\u00b6 3} By letter dated March 5, 2007, appellee, Panther II Transportation, Inc., requested refunds for tax years 2005 and 2006 of the amounts paid, totaling $161,761. The claim was predicated on preemption of the village\u2019s income tax under former R.C. 4921.25. By letter dated August 2, 2007, CCA denied the refund claim, and Panther appealed to the Seville Board of Income Tax Review. That board issued its decision denying the appeal on June 5, 2008, after which Panther appealed to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">{\u00b6 4} In its August 23, 2011 decision, the BTA reversed, holding that former R.C. 4921.25 did in fact preempt Seville\u2019s tax on net profits as applied to a motor-transportation company such as Panther. <em>Panther II Transp., Inc. v. Seville Bd. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>of Income Tax Review, </em>BTA No. 2008-M-1247, 2011 WL 3795676, *2-3 (Aug. 23, 2011). When CCA and the Seville Board of Income Tax Review appealed, the Ninth District Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the BTA. 2012-Ohio-3525. Both CCA and the Seville Board of Income Tax Review appealed to this court. We originally denied jurisdiction, but then granted a motion for reconsideration and accepted jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">\n<em>1. Seville\u2019s income tax is imposed on an allocated share of corporate net profit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 5} In 2005 and 2006, Seville\u2019s income-tax ordinance imposed municipal income tax on the \u201cadjusted federal taxable income\u201d of corporations that have property, payroll, or receipts within the village limits. The starting point was federal taxable income, after which the ordinance required some adjustments to arrive at what was referred to as \u201cadjusted federal taxable income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 6} Next, a \u201cbusiness allocation percentage\u201d was computed based on the location of the corporate taxpayer\u2019s property, payroll, and receipts. Three percentages were calculated, using the property, payroll, and receipts inside the village of Seville as numerators; and property, payroll, and receipts everywhere as the denominators. The average of these three percentages was the business-allocation percentage, which was then multiplied by the taxable net profits to derive the net profits allocable to Seville. That portion of Panther\u2019s income was then subjected to Seville\u2019s tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">\n<em>2. Panther is a regulated entity under state law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A0m\">{\u00b6 7} According to testimony and documentation presented at the BTA, Panther has been operating since 1992, holds a certificate of the Federal Highway Administration, is registered with the Ohio Public Utilities Commission (\u201cPUCO\u201d) as a motor carrier for hire, and holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the PUCO. The certificate of public convenience and necessity was a requirement for Panther to operate as a \u201cmotor transportation company\u201d in Ohio pursuant to former R.C. 4905.07 and 4921.10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>federal and state authorities at one time regulated rates, that function was phased out, and currently the regulations impose important safety requirements. As Panther\u2019s witness, Allen Motter, explained, the PUCO \u201cgive[s] a carrier a life\u201d as to its intrastate operations, because former R.C. 4921.10 prohibited operation as a motor-transportation company without a certificate issued by the PUCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">{\u00b6 8} Panther also presented copies of receipts showing payment of the per-vehicle tax imposed by former R.C. 4921.18, which is referred to in the statute at issue, former R.C. 4921.25. Panther maintains that Motter\u2019s testimony and the receipts establish that Panther itself paid a substantial amount of fees imposed by former R.C. 4921.18.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 9} CCA offered the testimony of Robert G. Meaker, a CPA who is an assistant tax administrator at CCA. Meaker established that Panther had an extensive history of filing and paying municipal income taxes on its net profits, both in Medina and in Seville. This course of performance supposedly establishes a general understanding that state law does not preempt the tax as to motor-transportation companies. However, statements by amici Con-Way Freight, Inc. and United Parcel Service indicate that, for the most part, trucking companies have successfully persuaded local governments that former R.C. 4921.25 does preempt the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">{\u00b6 10} Three provisions of the Ohio Constitution underlie the statutory issue presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">{\u00b6 11} First, the Home Rule Amendment, Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Constitution, confers upon municipalities the \u201cauthority to exercise all powers of local self-government,\u201d and there can be \u201c \u2018no doubt that the grant of authority to exercise all powers of local government includes the power of taxation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co. v. Cincinnati, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 599, 602, 693 N.E.2d 212 (1998), quoting <em>State ex rel. Zielonka v. Carrel, </em>99 Ohio St. 220, 227, 124 N.E. 134 (1919). Second, Article XIII, Section 6 provides that the General Assembly \u201cshall provide for the organization of cities, and incorporated villages, by general laws, and restrict their power of taxation * * * so as to prevent the abuse of such power.\u201d Third, under Article XVIII, Section 13, \u201c[l]aws may be passed to limit the power of municipalities to levy taxes and incur debts for local purposes * * Thus, municipal governments have a plenary power to tax, but the General Assembly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>has authority to impose specific limits on that power. <em>Cincinnati Bell </em>at 602; <em>see also Gesler v. Worthington, </em>138 Ohio St.3d 76, 2013-Ohio-4986, 3 N.E.3d 1177, \u00b6 17, 21. Moreover, we have held that the state\u2019s power to preempt must be exercised by express provision; we will not imply a preemption merely by virtue of the state\u2019s entering a particular area of taxation itself. <em>Cincinnati Bell </em>at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 12} The question before us concerns the preemptive scope of former R.C. 4921.25, 1953 H.B. No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">The fees and charges provided under section 4921.18 of the Revised Code shall be in addition to taxes, fees, and charges fixed and exacted by other sections of the Revised Code * * *, <em>but all fees, license fees, annual payments, license taxes, or taxes or other money exactions, </em>except the general property tax, assessed, charged, fixed, or exacted by local authorities such as municipal corporations, townships, counties, or other local boards, or the officers of such subdivisions <em>are illegal and, are superseded </em>by sections 4503.04, 4905.03, and 4921.02 to 4921.32, inclusive, of the Revised Code. On compliance by such motor transportation company with sections 4503.04, 4905.03, and 4921.02 to 4921.32, inclusive, of the Revised Code, all local ordinances, resolutions, by laws, and rules in force shall cease to be operative as to such company, except that such local subdivisions may make reasonable local police regulations within their respective boundaries not inconsistent with such sections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">{\u00b6 13} The focal point of the dispute in this case is the preemptive sweep of the italicized language: does the statute broadly exempt motor-transportation companies from generally applicable local taxes, or is the preemption limited to regulatory fees and taxes, as CCA and the village tax review board contend?</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">{\u00b6 14} We think that former R.C. 4921.25 by its plain and expansive terms shows the General Assembly\u2019s intent to impose the broadest possible preemption of local taxing power. Far from limiting the scope of that preemption to regulatory fees and taxes, the statute unmistakably expands the preemption to encompass generally applicable taxes, including the tax on corporate net profits at issue here. The list of precluded levies includes not only \u201call fees, license fees, annual payments, license taxes,\u201d but extends beyond that to \u201ctaxes or other money exactions.\u201d The General Assembly could not have expressed itself more clearly: all monetary \u201cexactions\u201d of any kind, be they regulatory or ordinary tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>measures, are declared to be \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201csuperseded\u201d by state-law regulatory provisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 15} Any remaining doubt as to the breadth of the statute\u2019s scope is removed by the explicit saving of \u201cgeneral property tax\u201d: because the scope of preemption broadly extended to generally applicable taxes, it became necessary to expressly permit the property tax to be imposed. Nor is there any merit to CCA\u2019s claim that reading the statute literally leads to a chamber of horrors. For example, CCA argues that a literal reading of former R.C. 4921.25\u2019s broad language would lead to a preemption of local building and zoning ordinances. But the legislature already preserved those local ordinances: former R.C. 4921.25 expressly permitted \u201creasonable local police regulations\u201d not in conflict with the state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 16} In light of the clear import of the statutory language, our duty is to apply the statute rather than interpret it, as\u00bbCCA would have us do here. <em>Lancaster Colony Corp. v. Limbach, </em>37 Ohio St.3d 198, 199, 524 N.E.2d 1389 (1988), citing <em>Provident Bank v. Wood, </em>36 Ohio St.2d 101, 105-106, 304 N.E.2d 378 (1973); <em>Sears v. Weimer, </em>143 Ohio St. 312, 55 N.E.2d 413 (1944), paragraph five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 17} Against our straightforward reading of the words of the statute, CCA argues that at the time the statute became law as part of the Ohio Motor Transportation Act in 1923, G.C. 614-98, H.B. No. 474, 110 Ohio Laws 211-223, there were no local income taxes in Ohio. Indeed, the constitutionality of such taxes was established many years after the enactment of the preemption provision. <em>See Angell v. Toledo, </em>153 Ohio St. 179, 91 N.E.2d 250 (1950), paragraph one of the syllabus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But CCA\u2019s argument lacks merit because R.C. 4921.25 by its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>terms does not limit its preclusive effect to taxes on the books on the date of its enactment; to the contrary, the statute broadly preempts without regard to when the municipality might choose to pass a new tax ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 18} To bolster its position, CCA reiterates the central holding of <em>Cincinnati Bell </em>that \u201ca proper exercise of [the power to limit the taxing authority of municipalities under Ohio Constitution Article XVIII, Section 13] requires an express act of restriction by the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Bell, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 605, 693 N.E.2d 212. Because former R.C. 4921.25 does not explicitly mention a prohibition of local income taxes, the imposition of those taxes has supposedly not been subjected to \u201can express act of restriction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 19} That argument is mistaken because it confuses two different things: explicitness on the one hand and specificity on the other. <em>Cincinnati Bell </em>does require \u201can express act of restriction by the General Assembly\u201d for local taxes to be preempted. <em>Id. </em>Consistent with that requirement, former R.C. 4921.25 very explicitly states that local taxes are \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201csuperseded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 20} But <em>Cincinnati Bell </em>does not state that an express preemption must specifically identify the tax to be preempted. Nor does it necessarily follow that the legislature must specifically have that tax in mind (here, an income tax that did not exist when the predecessor of former R.C. 4921.25 was enacted) as the type of tax that will be preempted. Indeed, in the context of <em>Cincinnati Bell\u2019s </em>reasoning, the requirement of \u201can express act of restriction\u201d means only that the state does not preempt local taxes merely by enacting a similar tax of its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 21} Equally unavailing is CCA\u2019s reliance on R.C. Chapter 718. CCA points to R.C. 718.01(D)(l)\u2019s requirement that \u201cno municipal corporation shall exempt from a tax on income * * * the net profit from a business or profession.\u201d Contrary to CCA\u2019s suggestion, this provision on its face does not somehow mandate taxation of Panther. The argument is flawed for two reasons. First, R.C. 718.01(D)(1) by its terms restricts the <em>acts of the local government, </em>not other laws enacted by the General Assembly itself. Second, as the Ninth District pointed out, R.C. 718.01(J) specifically prevents R.C. Chapter 718 from superseding other state-law restrictions on the local taxing power: \u201cNothing in this section or section 718.02 of the Revised Code shall authorize the levy of any tax on income that a municipal corporation is not authorized to levy under existing laws * * CCA completely ignores this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">{\u00b6 22} Additionally, CCA contends that Panther is not exempt if its contractors pay the fees imposed by R.C. 4921.18. Panther owns primarily trailers, which are not subject to the fees, but usually does not own the tractors, which are. Panther contracts with the owner-operators of the tractors, and CCA asserts that \u201c[u]nder Panther\u2019s owner-operator lease agreement, it is clear that the parties have \u2018contractually\u2019 agreed that the owner-operators will pay the R.C. 4921.18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>tax.\u201d But the plain language of former R.C. 4921.25 preempts locally imposed taxes based on the regulatory status of the potential taxpayer. Namely, the statute declares local taxes to be \u201cillegal\u201d because they are \u201csuperseded by sections 4503.04, 4905.03, and 4921.02 to 4921.32, inclusive, of the Revised Code,\u201d i.e., the provisions regulating a former \u201cmotor transportation company\u201d (currently, a \u201cfor-hire motor carrier\u201d) such as Panther. Nothing in the statute conditions the exemption on the allocation of financial burdens under the parties\u2019 contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, CCA contends that the principle of strict construction that we apply to tax exemptions requires us to restrict the scope of former R.C. 4921.25. To be sure, \u201c[t]ax exemption statutes must be strictly construed,\u201d a principle necessary \u201cin order to preserve equality in the burden of taxation.\u201d <em>Lutheran Book Shop v. Bowers, </em>164 Ohio St. 359, 362, 131 N.E.2d 219 (1955). But that principle does not help CCA. As a potential taxpayer, Panther had the onus of showing that \u201cthe language of the statute \u2018clearly expresses] the exemption\u2019 in relation to the facts of the claim.\u201d <em>Anderson/Maltbie Partnership v. Levin, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 178, 2010-Ohio-4904, 937 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Ares, Inc. v. Limbach, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 102, 104, 554 N.E.2d 1310 (1990). It did so by showing that it was regulated as a motor-transportation company and that former R.C. 4921.25 preempted local taxes as applied to such entities. Under strict construction, nothing more was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">{\u00b6 24} For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the BTA and the Ninth District Court of Appeals correctly determined that Seville\u2019s tax on corporate net profits was preempted by former R.C. 4921.25. We therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b637-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AuzA\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-9\">. The 129th General Assembly enacted 2012 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 487, effective June 11, 2012. The act completely rewrote R.C. Chapter 4921; among other things, it eliminated the category \u201cmotor transportation company\u201d and established the new designation \u201cfor-hire motor carrier.\u201d R.C. 4921.01 and 4921.02. The statute preserved but recodified two provisions that, in their former iteration, are of interest in this case: former R.C. 4921.18, which imposed fees on former motor-transportation companies, is now codified at various divisions of R.C. 4921.19, while former R.C. 4921.25 \u2014 the tax-immunity provision directly at issue in this case \u2014 is now codified as modified at R.C. 4921.19(J). Because this case involves refund claims for tax years 2005 and 2006, we will refer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>to the former version of the statutes that were in effect at that time and to \u201cmotor transportation company\u201d as the category of regulated entity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-12\">. There is some dispute about the testimony in this regard. CCA\u2019s cross-examination of Motter focused on the fact that Panther owns trailers but not tractors. Tractors were taxed under former R.C. 4921.18, but trailers were not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\">. CCA attempts to accord \u201cexaction\u201d a limited meaning, but in actual usage the term connotes the broadest sense in which government demands money from the citizenry. For a persuasive example, we look no further than the United States Supreme Court case addressing the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Writing for a majority of justices, Chief Justice Roberts concluded that the monetary payment Congress enacted as a \u201cpenalty\u201d could properly be understood as a \u201ctax\u201d within Congress\u2019s taxing power. The chief justice used the word \u201cexaction\u201d repeatedly as a broad and neutral term that avoided the pitfall of using either the narrower term \u201cpenalty\u201d or the narrower term \u201ctax.\u201d <em>Natl. Fedn, of Indep. Business v. Sebelius, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 2594-2601, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012). The four justices who dissented from that ruling also used the word \u201cexaction\u201d in the very same broad and neutral sense. <em>Id. </em>at 2651-2655.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b635-11\">. CCA quotes a passage of <em>Angel\u00ed, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus, to the effect that \u201cthe General Assembly has not * * * passed any law limiting the power of municipal corporations to levy and collect income taxes.\u201d This pronouncement, according to CCA, shows that R.C. 4921.25, the predecessor of which, G.C. 614-98, was on the books when <em>Angel\u00ed </em>was decided, cannot be read to preempt an income tax. That argument has no merit. In context, the syllabus merely asserts that no general limitation of the local power to impose income taxes had been enacted by the General Assembly as of the date on which <em>Angel\u00ed </em>was decided. The <em>Angel\u00ed </em>court was not asserting that no state laws precluded the imposition of a local income tax under particular circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b637-11\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A5j\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Cincinnati Bell Tel.

The General Assembly made clear that it intended to preempt only the area of transportation-related taxes and fees when it excepted \u201cthe general property tax\u201d from the scope of the statute in R.C. 4921.25. Again, there were no municipal income taxes to except from the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 27} Furthermore, the income of a motor-transportation company is clearly not exempt from municipal income taxation under R.C. 718.01 or 715.013. The majority decision holding that the income of a motor-transportation company is now exempt from municipal income tax because of a law enacted in 1923 that taxes motor-transportation companies by the vehicle, G.C. 614-94, now R.C. 4921.18, and has nothing to do with the <em>income </em>of a motor-transportation company is counterintuitive and runs counter to this court\u2019s holding in <em>Angell v. Toledo, </em>153 Ohio St. 179, 91 N.E.2d 250 (1950), paragraph two of the syllabus, which recognized the power of Ohio municipalities to levy and collect income taxes and noted that \u201cthe General Assembly has not * * * passed any law limiting [that] power. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">{\u00b6 28} Finally, we must strictly construe tax-exemption statutes \u201cin order to preserve equality in the burden of taxation.\u201d <em>Lutheran Book Shop v.
