VII(5b), the Board on the Unauthorized Practice of Law has recommended that we approve a consent decree proposed by relator, Cleveland Metropolitan Bar Association, and respondents, Norm Hernick, a.k.a. Nick Shelly, Law Online, Inc., and A Divorce Fast, Inc. We accept the board\u2019s recommendation and approve the proposed consent decree submitted by the parties, which provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">1. Relator filed a complaint against Respondents alleging that they engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, in part by preparing a complaint for divorce on behalf of Andrea Colburn, formerly known as Andrea Derousse in <em>Andrea Beth Derousse v. Derik Clark Derousse, </em>Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations case no. DR-07-317040.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">2. Norm Hernick is a natural person who is not licensed or authorized to practice law in Ohio. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">3. Ms. Colburn has testified in deposition that she was advised by A Divorce Fast that she did not require legal advice or representation, and that having a contested divorce can be very time consuming depending on the nature of the items in dispute and consequently very expensive in terms of attorney fees; that she paid $539; that she was told by a Lisa from A Divorce Fast that the grounds for divorce were \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d; that she told A Divorce Fast that she wanted child custody and support; that A Divorce Fast prepared a complaint for divorce without any provision for child custody or support; that when she took the complaint to court, she was told it was completely unacceptable, and court personnel helped her with her divorce; that she went back to A Divorce Fast several times but never received a return call from a supervisor or got her money back; that ultimately she was granted a divorce on grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>of incompatibility and living separate and apart for over one year \u2014 not \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d as suggested by A Divorce Fast; that she relied on the advice that A Divorce Fast gave her; and that she obtained child support through her efforts, although A Divorce Fast led her to believe they would do that for her.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AGc\">Russell A. Moorhead and D. John Travis, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ATQ\">Norm Hernick, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">4. Hernick has not complied with an order of the Supreme Court of Ohio to respond to discovery, including submitting to a deposition. Relator nonetheless is willing to settle this matter, in keeping with the provisions of this Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">5. Respondents admit that they engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in the <em>Derousse </em>matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">6. Respondents agree to desist from engaging in Ohio in the unauthorized practice of law, directly or indirectly, personally or through any corporation, organization, or other business entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">7. Relator waives all claims for reasonable expenses and attorney fees in obtaining the March 4, 2010 and August 25, 2011 Orders from the Supreme Court of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">8. Respondents shall reimburse Andrea Colburn $539.00 and pay a penalty of $1,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">9. Relator agrees that if this Agreement is approved, Respondents reimburse Andrea Colburn $539.00, and Respondents pay any civil penalty that may be imposed, the jail time sanction should be purged and any arrest warrants vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">10. Costs shall be the responsibility of Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">11. The parties stipulate to the foregoing, waive notice and hearing, and consent to a decree consistent with this settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b347-14\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
