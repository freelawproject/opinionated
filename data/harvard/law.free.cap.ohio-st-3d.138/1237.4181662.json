Jacobson-Kirsch <em>v. </em>Kaforey.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"b719-6\">[Cite as <em>In re Disqualification of Carr, </em>138 Ohio St.3d 1237, 2013-Ohio-5927.]</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b719-8\">(No. 13-AP-124</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ayg-dedup-0\">Decided December 30, 2013.)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b719-10\">O\u2019Connor, CJ.</author>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant JoAnn Jacobson-Kirsch has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 and 2501.13 seeking to disqualify Judge Donna J. Carr from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. 26708, pending on Jacobson-Kirsch\u2019s application for reconsideration in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Judicial District.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">{\u00b6 2} Jacobson-Kirsch claims that Judge Carr has a \u201cconfirmable judicial history of bias favoring\u201d defendant Ellen C. Kaforey and an \u201cunfavorable history towards\u201d Jacobson-Kirsch. In the underlying case, Jacobson-Kirsch has sued Kaforey, who had been appointed to serve as Jacobson-Kirsch\u2019s conservator, for allegedly interfering with Jacobson-Kirsch\u2019s parental custody rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">{\u00b6 3} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Carr.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">{\u00b6 4} As an initial matter, Jacobson-Kirsch has waived her right to object to Judge Carr based on these allegations. An affidavit of disqualification must be filed \u201cas soon as possible after the incident giving rise to the claim of bias and prejudice occurred,\u201d and failure to do so may result in waiver of the objection, especially when \u201cthe facts underlying the objection have been known to the party for some time.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Grady, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 1240, 1241, 674 N.E.2d 353 (1996). Here, Jacobson-Kirsch claims that Judge Carr presided over appellate proceedings involving some of the same parties in 2002 and 2004. Yet Jacobson-Kirsch waited until <em>after </em>the court of appeals issued its final decision and entry in the underlying case to file her affidavit of disqualification. Jacobson-Kirsch claims that she did not know that Judge Carr was presiding over her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>appeal, but in affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, the affiant has the burden to demonstrate that the affidavit is timely filed. <em>In re Disqualification of Capper, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1271, 2012-Ohio-6287, 984 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 11. Jacobson-Kirsch has not further explained how she did not know the identity of the judges deciding her appeal, and on this record, she has waived her right to disqualify Judge Carr based on these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">{\u00b6 5} Alternatively, even if Jacobson-Kirsch had not waived her objections to Judge Carr, she has not set forth sufficient grounds for disqualification. Absent extraordinary circumstances, an appellate court judge will not be subject to disqualification when the only matter pending is a motion for the court of appeals to reconsider its final decision. To succeed at such a late stage in the proceeding, the affiant must show that the appellate court judge has an actual bias that undermines the fairness and integrity of the proceedings. Here, Jacobson-Kirsch claims that there are some \u201cobvious questions\u201d suggesting judicial bias, but these questions do not establish actual bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">{\u00b6 6} First, Jacobson-Kirsch questions whether Judge Carr can fairly preside over the underlying civil matter because the judge presided over Jacobson-Kirsch\u2019s 2002 appeal of her custody case and an unrelated 2004 case that involved Kaforey and garnered \u201cnational news.\u201d However, \u201c[s]tate and federal courts have been virtually unanimous in holding that \u2014 absent a showing of actual bias\u2014 a judge who presided over prior proceedings involving one or more parties presently before the court is not thereby disqualified from presiding over later proceedings involving the same parties.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Bryant, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1251, 2006-Ohio-7227, 885 N.E.2d 246, \u00b6 4. Without more, the fact that Judge Carr heard appeals in two previous proceedings involving Jacobson-Kirsch and Kaforey \u2014 and the judge ruled against Jacobson-Kirsch and in favor of Kaforey in those cases \u2014 does not show actual bias in the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">{\u00b6 7} Second, the fact that all Summit County trial court judges recused themselves from the underlying case does not indicate a bias on behalf of Judge Carr. Jacobson-Kirsch speculates \u2014 without providing any evidence to support her speculation \u2014 that all Summit County common pleas court judges recused themselves because Kaforey is a \u201chigh profile\u201d Summit County attorney who has been appointed as either a guardian or conservator in at least 138 cases. But as noted above, Jacobson-Kirsch has the burden to set forth specific claims of judicial bias. R.C. 2701.03; <em>see also In re Disqualification of Mitrovich, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-7358, 803 N.E.2d 816, \u00b6 4 (\u201cAn affidavit must describe with specificity and particularity those facts alleged to support the claim of bias or prejudice\u201d). Here, Jacobson-Kirsch has not explained how the same alleged conflict that applied to the common pleas court judges applies to Judge Carr, a judge of the court of appeals. Jacobson-Kirsch\u2019s vague and unsubstantiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>allegation is insufficient for a finding of actual bias or prejudice. <em>See In re Disqualification of Flanagan, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1236, 2009-Ohio-7199, 937 N.E.2d 1023, \u00b6 4 (\u201cAllegations that are based solely on hearsay, innuendo, and speculation \u2014 such as those alleged here \u2014 are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. * * * A judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">{\u00b6 9} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Carr.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
