Parisi has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge Michael J. Holbrook from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. 12-CV-2858, a legal-malpractice action pending in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Parisi claims that Judge Holbrook is biased and prejudiced against her because he issued a discovery order that was \u201cimpossible\u201d for her to comply with and because the judge made \u201cdisparaging\u201d comments to her. Judge Holbrook has responded in writing to Parisi\u2019s allegations, asserting that he does not harbor any bias or prejudice against her. Marion H. Little Jr., counsel for the defendants, has filed an affidavit stating that Judge Holbrook has been fair and impartial to all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">{\u00b6 3} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Holbrook.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Judge Holbrook\u2019s discovery order</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">{\u00b6 4} Judge Holbrook inherited the underlying case in December 2012, and at a January 24, 2013 status conference, he gave Parisi two additional weeks to respond to the defendants\u2019 outstanding document requests. At the next status conference, on March 12, 2013, Judge Holbrook found that Parisi had not complied with his previous order, and he then ordered that she take the requested documents to a copy shop, pay for copies, and deliver the copies to defense counsel by 5:00 p.m. that day. The judge further stated that Parisi would be sanctioned if she failed to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">{\u00b6 5} In her affidavit, Parisi claims that compliance with the judge\u2019s order was impossible because the documents were too voluminous to copy in one day, and when she informed Judge Holbrook\u2019s staff that the copy shop had indicated that it could not complete the job in a day, the staff advised her that the judge stood by his order. According to Parisi, the shop later estimated that copying the documents would take about 30 days and cost $9,574.50. Parisi argues that under the civil rules, she should not bear the burden of paying for the defendants\u2019 discovery requests. Accordingly, she has moved Judge Holbrook to require the defendants to pay the copying costs, but at the time she filed her affidavit of disqualification, Judge Holbrook had not yet ruled on her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">{\u00b6 6} In response to Parisi\u2019s claims, Judge Holbrook states that when he was assigned this case, he discovered \u201csevere discovery problems,\u201d including Parisi\u2019s failure to produce requested documents. He admittedly became frustrated with Parisi at the March 12 status conference because she had not complied with his previous order; nonetheless, he claims that he gave her another opportunity to comply by the end of that day. Judge Holbrook avers that he was \u201ctrying to get the matter to trial\u201d and that he did not issue the March 12 order with the expectation that Parisi\u2019s compliance was impossible. Finally, he states that he had not yet ruled on Parisi\u2019s pending motion about copying costs because the motion was not ripe for decision at the time she filed her affidavit of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Trial judges are entitled to exercise considerable discretion in the management of cases on their dockets, especially in discovery matters, and any alleged abuse of that discretion should be remedied on appeal, not in an affidavit-of-disqualification proceeding. Accordingly, it is well settled that an affidavit of disqualification \u201cis not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4. And a party\u2019s disagreement or dissatisfaction with a court\u2019s legal rulings, even if those rulings may be erroneous, does not constitute bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 4. On the record here, Parisi has not demonstrated that Judge Holbrook\u2019s discovery order was motivated by a personal bias against her, and therefore the judge\u2019s order is not grounds for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Judge Holbrook\u2019s alleged disparaging comments</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">{\u00b6 8} Parisi also alleges that Judge Holbrook made disparaging comments to her at the January and March status conferences. Specifically, Parisi claims that Judge Holbrook stated, \u201cNobody\u2019s going to believe you, you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d and \u201cWhat am I going to do with you?\u201d Judge Holbrook acknowledges making the comments, but he places them in context, indicating that he was attempting to explain to Parisi that if she could not produce any evidence in discovery, then no one would believe her claims at trial. As to the second comment, Judge Holbrook states that at that point, he had become \u201cabsolutely frustrated with [Parisi\u2019s] noncompliance with the discovery process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">{\u00b6 9} Judges \u201care certainly entitled to express dissatisfaction with attorneys\u2019 dilatory tactics inside and outside the courtroom,\u201d but that dissatisfaction should be expressed in a way that promotes public confidence in the integrity, dignity, and impartiality of the judiciary. <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2004-Ohio-7354, 826 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 10. Given Judge Holbrook\u2019s explanation for his comments, his words do not reflect a \u201c \u2018hostile feeling or spirit of ill-will * * * with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment\u2019 \u201d that would mandate his removal from this case. <em>See In re Disqualification of O\u2019Neill, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1232, 2002-Ohio-7479, 798 N.E.2d 17, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956) (setting forth the definition of the term \u201cbias or prejudice\u201d). Accordingly, Parisi\u2019s claim here is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. * * * A judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">{\u00b6 11} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Holbrook.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
