In 2000, we publicly reprimanded him for using undignified language and shouting at another attorney during negotiations before a domestic-relations court magistrate. <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Gonzalez, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 470, 733 N.E.2d 587 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">{\u00b6 2} In 2012, relator, disciplinary counsel, charged Gonzalez with commingling personal and client funds in his client trust account, failing to maintain records of client-related expenditures, misappropriating a portion of a client\u2019s settlement award, and abandoning another client on the final day of trial. Although Gonzalez stipulated to many of the allegations in relator\u2019s amended complaint, he denied that most of his actions violated the Rules of Professional Conduct. After a hearing, a three-member panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline issued a report finding that Gonzalez had committed most of the charged misconduct and recommending that we indefinitely suspend him from the practice of law in Ohio, with reinstatement conditioned on restitution to a former client. The board adopted the panel\u2019s report and recommendation in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">{\u00b6 3} Gonzalez objects to the board\u2019s findings of misconduct in three of the seven counts against him. Upon our review of the record, we sustain Gonzalez\u2019s objections in part and overrule them in part and find that the appropriate sanction in this case is a two-year suspension with the second year stayed and payment of restitution as a condition of reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"azs-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><em>Count one </em>\u2014 notice <em>of lack of liability insurance</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_W\">{\u00b6 4} Gonzalez is a solo practitioner concentrating in the areas of domestic relations, criminal defense, civil litigation, real estate, and personal injury. He has not maintained professional liability insurance since February 2007. Under Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(c), if a lawyer does not maintain professional liability insurance over certain amounts, the lawyer must notify clients of this fact on a \u201cseparate form * * * signed by the client.\u201d The prescribed \u201cseparate form\u201d is set forth at the end of Prof.Cond.R. 1.4. At the panel hearing, Gonzalez testified that he notified clients in his fee contract that he did not carry malpractice insurance, but at oral argument, he acknowledged that he does not always use a fee or retainer contract. Because Gonzalez did not use the prescribed separate notice form, the board found, and we agree, that Gonzalez violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\"><em>Count two </em>\u2014 commingling <em>personal and client funds</em></p>\n<p id=\"atq-dedup-0\">{\u00b6 5} In 2009, a jury awarded damages to Gonzalez\u2019s wife in a personal-injury case filed by her and Gonzalez. In July 2009, Gonzalez deposited his wife\u2019s award of $122,169.86 into his client trust account, and by the end of August 2009, Gonzalez had disbursed $38,065 to pay their attorney\u2019s fees and $50,500 to himself, his wife, and to cash. Gonzalez, however, kept the remaining amount of his wife\u2019s personal-injury award, $33,604.86, in his client trust account, and over the next five months, he issued 25 checks drawn on his trust account to various individuals and entities for personal items and services. For example, in September 2009, he issued trust-account checks for car repairs and to purchase kitchen cabinets; in November 2009, he issued a trust-account check for chimney work; and in January 2010, he issued a trust-account check for tile work. During that same time period, Gonzalez held another client\u2019s funds in his trust account. As a result, the board found that Gonzalez violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a) (requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients in an interest-bearing client trust account, separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property). Relator also charged Gonzalez with violating Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law). The board, however, recommends that we dismiss the charge under Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h) because Gonzalez did not mishandle or misappropriate any of the client\u2019s funds commingled with his wife\u2019s personal funds. We accept the board\u2019s recommendation and hereby dismiss the alleged violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h) in count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\n<em>Gonzalez\u2019s objections</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 6} Gonzalez appears to object to the board\u2019s findings here, stating in his brief that the trust-account disbursements from his wife\u2019s settlement were requested by her, that he \u201cdid not hold money for clients,\u201d and that his trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>account was \u201cprimarily used for insurance settlements.\u201d Whether Gonzalez\u2019s wife authorized the trust-account disbursements, however, is irrelevant to the alleged violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a). The problem was that Gonzalez held his wife\u2019s personal funds in his trust account for five months, during which time period he had also deposited client funds. Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a) expressly requires a lawyer to hold property of clients \u201cseparate from the lawyer\u2019s own property\u201d in an interest-bearing account. In addition, Gonzalez\u2019s objection that he did not \u201chold money for clients\u201d in his trust account is contradicted by the record. During the board proceedings, Gonzalez stipulated and testified that at the time he kept his wife\u2019s personal funds in his trust account, he had also deposited funds belonging to a client in that account. Accordingly, Gonzalez\u2019s objections to the board\u2019s findings in count two are overruled, and we agree that Gonzalez violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\"><em>Count three </em>\u2014 Fernando <em>Perez matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 7} On October 21, 2010, Gonzalez deposited a $20,000 settlement check into his trust account on behalf of Fernando Perez, whom Gonzalez represented in a personal-injury case. Over the next two weeks, Gonzalez disbursed $6,000 to himself for his attorney fees in the Perez matter, $5,000 to a doctor related to Perez\u2019s case, and $7,697.73 to Perez. Gonzalez, however, faded to produce any records accounting for the remaining $1,302.27 from Perez\u2019s settlement. And within five months of depositing Perez\u2019s settlement funds into his trust account, Gonzalez overdrew the account by issuing trust-account checks unrelated to Perez\u2019s case. Specifically, in January 2011, Gonzalez issued a check to the clerk of a court of appeals, although he could not establish the owner of the funds for that check, and he also issued a $1,000 check to himself. And in March 2011, he issued two checks on behalf of a client who had no money in the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">{\u00b6 8} Relator charged Gonzalez with misappropriating $1,302.27 from Perez. Gonzalez disputed the allegation, claiming that he used the remaining $1,302.27 from the settlement for expenses and fees relating to Perez\u2019s case. Although Gonzalez could not produce any receipts accounting for these alleged case-related expenditures, he testified that Perez\u2019s settlement statement indicated how all of Perez\u2019s settlement proceeds were disbursed. Gonzalez, however, refused to produce a copy of the settlement statement to relator, insisting that it was protected by the attorney-client privilege and that relator had the burden to first obtain a release from Perez. Gonzalez also refused to ask Perez for a release himself, claiming that Perez had no complaints about him, and therefore Gonzalez did not want to unnecessarily involve Perez in the disciplinary matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">{\u00b6 9} Based on this record, the board determined that Gonzalez had violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a)(2) (requiring a lawyer to maintain a record for each client on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>whose behalf funds are held), 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\n<em>Gonzalez\u2019s objections</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 10} Gonzalez claims that relator failed to prove any rule violations regarding his representation of Perez and specifically objects \u201cto the conclusion [that] he has been dishonest with his clients or that he did not give his clients what they were entitled to receive from their cases.\u201d In support, Gonzalez attached to his brief an affidavit from Perez and a copy of the previously undisclosed settlement statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 11} We have recognized, however, that \u201cGov.Bar R. V provides for a formal evidentiary hearing before a panel of the board and does not provide for the introduction of additional evidence once the proceedings are before this court.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Squire, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 368, 2011-Ohio-5578, 958 N.E.2d 914, \u00b6 45, fn. 3. Accordingly, we will accept additional evidence at this late stage only \u201cunder the most exceptional of circumstances.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Sterner, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 164, 672 N.E.2d 633 (1996). Here, Gonzalez could have called Perez to testify in his defense at the panel hearing, and he could have submitted a copy of the settlement statement into the record below \u2014 either in response to relator\u2019s requests or as evidence at the panel hearing. Gonzalez, however, chose not to and instead insisted that relator had the burden to obtain the document from his client. On this record, no exceptional circumstances exist that would allow Gonzalez to introduce these documents for the first time in his objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 12} Nevertheless, we sustain in part and overrule in part Gonzalez\u2019s objections in this count. We agree with the board\u2019s findings that Gonzalez violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a)(2) and 8.4(h). Gonzalez failed to maintain or produce receipts and other documentation accounting for $1,302.27 from Perez\u2019s settlement, and he also overdrew his trust account, issued two trust-account checks on behalf of a client who had no funds in that account, issued a trust-account check to the clerk of courts on behalf of a client he could not identify, and failed to keep client ledgers for Perez\u2019s account. In short, Gonzalez flagrantly violated the disciplinary rules requiring that he maintain detailed records of the money held and disbursed on behalf of clients, and that conduct adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">{\u00b6 13} However, we disagree with the board\u2019s conclusion that relator proved that Gonzalez misappropriated client funds or otherwise engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation' in violation of Prof. Cond.R. 8.4(c). In his amended complaint, relator alleged that Gonzalez \u201cmisappropriated $1,302.27 belonging to Perez.\u201d Although the board did not expressly conclude that Gonzalez \u201cmisappropriated\u201d from Perez, it found that because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Gonzalez \u201ccould not account for the missing $1,302.27,\u201d he \u201ccommitted the violations alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 14} In attorney disciplinary proceedings, the relator bears the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, the facts necessary to establish a violation of a disciplinary rule. <em>Squire, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 368, 2011-Ohio-5578, 958 N.E.2d 914, \u00b6 34. Although relator proved that Gonzalez failed to account for $1,302.27 in client funds \u2014 for which we are separately sanctioning him \u2014 this misconduct alone does not necessarily show that Gonzalez also misappropriated the money from Perez or defrauded him. \u201c[Misappropriation is \u2018[t]he application of another\u2019s property or money dishonestly to one\u2019s own use.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 40, quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1088 (8th Ed.2009). The board did not cite any evidence that Gonzalez had dishonestly used Perez\u2019s money for his own purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 15} Instead, the board cited <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Weiss, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 236, 2012-Ohio-4564, 977 N.E.2d 636, for the proposition that Gonzalez had a duty to produce records establishing the proper disbursement of Perez\u2019s funds and because he refused to do so, he acted dishonestly with the money. The board\u2019s reliance on <em>Weiss </em>is misplaced. <em>Weiss </em>was a default proceeding in which a former client of Weiss clearly believed that he was entitled to additional portions of settlement funds held in Weiss\u2019s trust account, and evidence in the record supported the former client\u2019s position. But Weiss moved to Florida and would not respond to inquiries from his former client\u2019s attorney or relator. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5-11. The board characterized Weiss as having \u201cessentially gone into hiding to avoid paying his client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 16} In contrast, Perez did not testify against Gonzalez, and therefore the record is unclear whether Perez believed that Gonzalez had misappropriated any of his money. And this is not a default proceeding \u2014 Gonzalez repeatedly testified that he had not misappropriated or acted dishonestly with any of Perez\u2019s money. <em>Weiss </em>is factually distinguishable, and we cannot rely on <em>Weiss </em>to presume that Gonzalez dishonestly used Perez\u2019s money for his own use. On this record, Gonzalez\u2019s deficient recordkeeping and accounting practices are at least as likely to blame for the missing funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">{\u00b6 17} Acts of misappropriation result in the \u201cstrictest discipline,\u201d with a presumptive sanction of disbarment. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Kelly, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 39, 2009-Ohio-317, 901 N.E.2d 798, \u00b6 17, quoting <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Belock, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 98, 100, 694 N.E.2d 897 (1998). Given the seriousness of the charge and the consequences of a violation, we find that relator has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Gonzalez misappropriated Perez\u2019s money or otherwise acted dishonestly in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">{\u00b6 18} In sum, we sustain Gonzalez\u2019s objection with respect to the violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) and hereby dismiss that charge. We overrule his remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>objections relating to this count and find that Gonzalez violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a)(2) and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><em>Count four </em>\u2014 trust-account <em>recordkeeping violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">{\u00b6 19} Since February 2007, Gonzalez has not maintained client ledgers for funds deposited in his trust account, nor has he performed monthly reconciliations of his trust account or retained client records required for reconciliations. Based on these recordkeeping improprieties, the board found that Gonzalez had violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a)(2) and 1.15(a)(5) (requiring a lawyer to perform and retain a monthly reconciliation of transactions involving the lawyer\u2019s client trust account). We concur with the board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\"><em>Count five </em>\u2014 Ramon <em>Colon matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">{\u00b6 20} In March 2011, Ramon Colon, a client of Gonzalez, gave him $400 to retain an expert. Gonzalez, however, placed Colon\u2019s money in a client file, rather than his trust account, and Gonzalez then paid the expert with a trust-account check. Gonzalez also admitted that he did not maintain client ledgers for Colon\u2019s funds. Based on this conduct, the board found, and we agree, that Gonzalez violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a)(2) and 1.15(c) (requiring a lawyer to deposit into a client trust account legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\"><em>Count six </em>\u2014 Maria <em>Samame matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">{\u00b6 21} In 2009, Maria Samame, a Venezuelan native, hired Gonzalez to represent her in a divorce ease. According to Gonzalez, Samame discharged him in July 2010 for financial reasons, but the trial judge would not release him as counsel. Trial commenced in January 2011, and Gonzalez claimed that Samame had discharged him again on the morning of the fourth day of trial. According to the trial transcript, Gonzalez stated the following to the magistrate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">I am formally requesting that I be allowed to withdraw since I\u2019ve been discharged twice in this case, and it was only at the behest of Judge Earner that I remain, because I was trying to help Miss Samame with understanding the process here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">And at this point, in as much as, again, it\u2019s been very clear to me that this court is not going to award any attorney fees to Miss Samame, then I wish to withdraw. I\u2019m not going to work for free.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">{\u00b6 22} The magistrate denied Gonzalez\u2019s request to withdraw and ordered him to continue his representation of Samame. Samame indicated that she could not afford to pay Gonzalez, but the magistrate explained to her that he had not yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>made any decision on attorney fees and that because she had no legal background, he would not allow her attorney to withdraw in the middle of trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">{\u00b6 23} At that point, Gonzalez was in the middle of cross-examining plaintiff, Samame\u2019s husband, but after the magistrate denied his withdrawal request, Gonzalez stated that he had no further questions. He then withdrew two previously marked exhibits. The magistrate asked Gonzalez whether he understood the position in which his actions were placing his client, but Gonzalez insisted again \u2014 despite the fact that the magistrate had already denied his request to withdraw \u2014 that he had been discharged by his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 24} Plaintiffs counsel then testified regarding his attorney fees, and Gonzalez again offered no questions on cross-examination. After plaintiff rested his case, Gonzalez informed the magistrate that Samame wanted to testify in narrative form, but the magistrate ordered him to ask his client questions under direct examination. The magistrate also pleaded with Gonzalez to represent his client, explaining that the court had to make findings of fact for spousal support and division of property and without evidence for her case, Samame would be in a \u201cdangerous position\u201d and \u201creally vulnerable.\u201d The magistrate further questioned whether Samame genuinely appreciated the danger that could result if she did not offer any evidence into the record. Despite the magistrate\u2019s pleading, Gonzalez\u2019s direct examination consisted of one question \u2014 \u201cwhat do you wish to tell the court?\u201d \u2014 and after a brief narrative response by Samame, Gonzalez did not offer any substantive follow-up questions. Nor did he call any other witnesses to support Samame\u2019s case-in-chief. In addition, the magistrate had to order Gonzalez to make a closing argument, which lasted only 30 seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 25} Despite Gonzalez\u2019s fears regarding not getting paid, the magistrate ultimately awarded attorney fees to Samame. Specifically, in his April 2011 entry granting the parties\u2019 divorce, the magistrate ordered plaintiff to pay Gonzalez $1,754.05 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 26} At the panel hearing, relator called the magistrate and plaintiffs counsel to testify about Gonzalez\u2019s conduct during the fourth day of Samame\u2019s divorce trial. The magistrate described Gonzalez\u2019s effort as \u201c[h]alf-hearted at best,\u201d and he testified that Gonzalez placed his client in an \u201cuntenable position\u201d and that he \u201cwasn\u2019t doing his job.\u201d For his part, Gonzalez testified that Samame discharged him because she could not afford to pay him and that he was only following her instructions not to cross-examine any witnesses or otherwise participate in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>{\u00b6 27} The board determined that relator\u2019s witnesses corroborated relator\u2019s contention that Gonzalez \u201chad failed to take the necessary measures to protect Samame\u2019s interests.\u201d Further, the board concluded that Gonzalez\u2019s conduct was \u201cmotivated by financial considerations and not by the wishes or needs of Samame,\u201d as evidenced by his statement to the magistrate that he would not \u201cwork for free.\u201d Accordingly, the board found that Gonzalez had violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.2(a) (requiring a lawyer to abide by the client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and to consult with the client as to means by which they are to be pursued), 1.3 (requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client), 1.16(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from withdrawing from representation in a proceeding without leave of court if the rules of the tribunal so require),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice), and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\n<em>Gonzalez\u2019s objections</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">{\u00b6 28} Gonzalez claims that relator has not proven any rule violations regarding his representation of Samame. Specifically, he reiterates his position that Samame instructed him not to continue with the divorce case, and he further points to the testimony of plaintiffs counsel, who stated that Samame ultimately received everything from the divorce to which she was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 29} We overrule Gonzalez\u2019s objections with respect to the board\u2019s findings that he violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.3, 1.16(c), 8.4(d), and 8.4(h). The fact that Samame ultimately received a fair judgment in the divorce proceeding \u2014 to the extent that is true \u2014 does not absolve Gonzalez\u2019s professional misconduct. After the magistrate denied Gonzalez\u2019s request to withdraw and ordered that he proceed with his representation of Samame, Gonzalez nonetheless continued to insist that he had been discharged and displayed little, if any, effort to protect his chent\u2019s best interests. He affirmatively withdrew exhibits that he had previously marked, and the magistrate had to order him to conduct a direct examination of his client and a closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 30} In the end, the panel members, who observed Gonzalez and the other witnesses at the panel hearing, determined that Gonzalez was more concerned about his compensation than ensuring that Samame receive the most equitable resolution in her divorce proceeding. \u201cUnless the record weighs heavily against a hearing panel\u2019s findings, we defer to the panel\u2019s credibility determinations, inasmuch as the panel members saw and heard the witnesses firsthand.\u201d <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Wise, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 164, 2006-Ohio-550, 842 N.E.2d 35, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u00b6 24. Accordingly, we accept the panel members\u2019 conclusions here about Gonzalez\u2019s motivations.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">{\u00b6 31} However, we cannot conclude that relator has proven by clear and convincing evidence that Gonzalez also violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.2(a). That rule requires a lawyer to \u201cabide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of representation\u201d and \u201cconsult with the client\u201d about those objectives. Here, relator admitted that Samame refused to testify at the panel hearing. Thus, we do not know the specific decisions she made about her case or whether Gonzalez failed to abide by her decisions. Gonzalez testified that he consulted with Samame and she instructed him not to ask any further questions on cross-examination. Neither relator nor the board has pointed to any evidence demonstrating that Gonzalez failed to abide by his client\u2019s decisions. Indeed, the magistrate testified at the panel hearing that it was \u201cevident\u201d that Gonzalez and Samame had discussed whether he would proceed with the case. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence that Gonzalez violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 32} Thus, we sustain Gonzalez\u2019s objection with respect to the violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.2(a) and hereby dismiss that charge. We overrule his remaining objections relating to this count and find that he violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.3, 1.16(c), 8.4(d), and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\n<em>Count seven^-failure to cooperate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 33} In October 2011, plaintiffs counsel in the Samame matter submitted a grievance to relator regarding Gonzalez\u2019s conduct during that trial. Relator sent a letter of inquiry to Gonzalez by certified mail, and despite confirming receipt of the letter, Gonzalez failed to respond. Gonzalez also failed to respond to a second letter sent by relator in December 2011. Gonzalez appeared for a deposition in January 2012 and testified that he received relator\u2019s letters but found them to be \u201cof no consequence.\u201d In May 2012, relator sent Gonzalez letters requesting copies of client files relating to his representation of Samame, Perez, Colon, and another former client, but Gonzalez did not respond or object to the requests until September 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 34} The parties stipulated that Gonzalez violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.1(b) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly fading to respond to a demand for information by a disciplinary authority during an investigation) and 8.4(h). The board accepted the parties\u2019 stipulations, adding that \u201cin light of [Gonzalez\u2019s] explicit contempt for the disciplinary process and his complete lack of responses to the reasonable demands made by Relator,\u201d clear and convincing evidence supported the violation for Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h). We agree that Gonzalez violated Prof. Cond.R. 8.1(b) and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 35} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider several relevant factors, including the ethical duties violated, the actual injury caused, the existence of any aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B), and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21. The board recommends that Gonzalez be indefinitely suspended, with reinstatement conditioned on payment of restitution to Perez in the amount of $1,302.27. Gonzalez does not address the appropriate sanction in his objections. Instead, he indicates that he is contemplating retirement and that he submitted objections only to contest the board\u2019s conclusion that he has been dishonest with his clients. Upon consideration of the relevant factors, we find that a two-year suspension with the second year stayed, along with payment of restitution to Perez as a condition of reinstatement, is the appropriate sanction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 36} The board found the existence of four aggravating factors \u2014 a prior disciplinary offense, multiple offenses, lack of cooperation in the disciplinary process, and refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg.lO(B)(l)(a), (d), (e), and (g). The board did not find any mitigating factors. We concur in the board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 37} For precedent, the board again relies on <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Weiss, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 236, 2012-Ohio-4564, 977 N.E.2d 636, a default proceeding in which an attorney was charged \u2014 as Gonzalez was \u2014 with using his client trust account as a personal account, failing to cooperate in the disciplinary proceeding, and dishonestly converting a portion of a client\u2019s settlement to his own use. But in contrast to the facts here, in <em>Weiss </em>we found that the relator had sufficiently proven all of the charged misconduct, including a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) \u201cby using dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation to convert a portion of those [settlement] funds to his own use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13. Accordingly, we indefinitely suspended Weiss from the practice of law and ordered that he make restitution to the client whose settlement funds he had converted. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16. Because we do not find that the evidence here supports a finding that Gonzalez similarly violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c), a lesser sanction than in <em>Weiss </em>is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 38} However, we nonetheless accept the board\u2019s recommended condition that Gonzalez make restitution to Perez. Although the evidence does not clearly and convincingly show that Gonzalez dishonestly converted the $1,302.27 to his own use, Perez\u2019s money remains unaccounted for. And Gonzalez was either unable or unwilling to produce any receipts or any other records demonstrating how he expended those client funds. Without any evidence showing the proper disbursement of the missing funds, we must assume that the money belongs to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Perez, and therefore Gonzalez must make restitution to Perez in the amount of $1,302.27.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Au6v\">Joseph Caligiuri, Chief Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AVh8\">Vincent Ferdinand Gonzalez, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">{\u00b6 39} To summarize, Gonzalez has failed to properly notify clients that he lacks malpractice insurance, commingled client and personal funds, failed to account for client funds in his trust account, failed to keep records for client-related expenditures, failed to cooperate in this disciplinary proceeding, and engaged in a range of misconduct during the trial of a client\u2019s case. Given this misconduct, and having reviewed the aggravating factors and finding no mitigating factors, we hold that the appropriate sanction in this case is a two-year suspension with the second year stayed on the condition that Gonzalez commit no further misconduct during the term of his suspension. If Gonzalez fails to comply with the condition of the stay, the stay will be lifted and he will serve the full two-year suspension. In addition, reinstatement is contingent on the condition that Gonzalez make restitution to Perez in the amount of $1,302.27. Costs are taxed to Gonzalez.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Kennedy, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b466-7\">French, J., concurs with the sanction but would allow Gonzalez to submit an accounting of the proper disbursement of settlement funds to Perez in lieu of restitution to Perez.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b466-8\">Lanzinger, J., dissents and would impose an indefinite suspension, as recommended by the board.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-8\">. Loc.R. 7 of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, Domestic Relations Division, provides that an attorney of record may not be relieved of his or her responsibilities unless the court permits the attorney\u2019s withdrawal. The local rule further states that the trial court may deny an attorney\u2019s request to withdraw if a trial date has been scheduled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\">. The board\u2019s report states that Gonzalez violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.6(c), which is a typographical error, as relator\u2019s amended complaint charged Gonzalez with violating Prof.Cond.R. 1.16(c) and the board\u2019s description of the rule matches Prof.Cond.R. 1.16(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
