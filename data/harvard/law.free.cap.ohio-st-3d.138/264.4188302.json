Two months later, appellee, Christopher Anderson, was arrested and charged with Zurcher\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 2} Anderson has now been subjected to five trials in seven years. He has been incarcerated for more than a decade, but he has never been lawfully convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">{\u00b6 3} When the state attempted to prosecute Anderson for the sixth time, he moved to dismiss the indictment against him. In so doing, he argued that the prosecution was barred by the Double Jeopardy and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">{\u00b6 4} Our task today is not to determine whether Anderson is guilty of the murder, or even whether he can be forced to stand trial for a sixth time. Rather, we answer a narrower question: Was the trial court\u2019s order denying Anderson\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment a final, appealable order that the appellate court had jurisdiction to review? We conclude that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">{\u00b6 5} Accordingly, we affirm the appellate court\u2019s decision denying the state\u2019s motion to dismiss Anderson\u2019s appeal, and we remand the cause to the court of appeals to address Anderson\u2019s appeal on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">{\u00b6 6} Because the question before us is a question of law, it is not necessary to extensively detail the facts. For our limited purposes here, we summarize the state\u2019s evidence against Anderson and the procedural path that brought this appeal before us as they have been described by the appellate court\u2019s prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">\n<em>The Murder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">{\u00b6 7} Facts surrounding the murder and the first two trials are set forth here as stated in the appellate court\u2019s opinion in the appeal from the second trial. 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 03 MA 252, 2006-Ohio-4618, 2006 WL 2573785. On June 2, 2002, Zurcher went to Chipper\u2019s Bar in Youngstown. There, she met several friends, including Sandy Shingleton and John Orosz.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">{\u00b6 8} After the bar closed, Zurcher and her friends went to Zurcher\u2019s apart.ment in Austintown, where they continued to drink. By 3:50 A.M., only Anderson, Orosz, and Shingleton remained in Zurcher\u2019s apartment. When they left, Zurcher was clothed. Orosz locked Zurcher\u2019s door from the inside, shut the door, and checked to make sure it was locked. Anderson then drove Orosz and Shingleton to Orosz\u2019s pizzeria, where he dropped them off and then departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">{\u00b6 9} A few hours later, Zurcher\u2019s mother, Diane Whiteman, grew concerned because Zurcher had not come to retrieve her son from Whiteman as they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>planned. After Zurcher did not answer or respond to Whiteman\u2019s repeated phone calls, Whiteman went to Zurcher\u2019s apartment building and secured a key to Zurcher\u2019s apartment from the building manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 10} When Whiteman entered the apartment, she found Zurcher\u2019s naked, dead body on the floor near the door. There were no signs of forced entry into the apartment and no indication that Zurcher had been robbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 11} A deputy coroner determined that Zurcher had died around 4:00 A.M. due to asphyxiation by strangulation. Ligature marks around Zurcher\u2019s neck were consistent with the conclusion that Zurcher had been strangled by cord or wire, but neither was recovered from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 12} Near the time of her death, Zurcher had also sustained a deep scalp contusion and multiple bruises to her body. A contusion on her left breast appeared to be a \u201clove bite,\u201d or \u201chiekey.\u201d The DNA sample taken from that site was consistent with Anderson\u2019s DNA profile. Zurcher\u2019s fingernail scrapings contained a mixture of DNA profiles consistent with the DNA of Anderson, Zurcher\u2019s son, and a third person. Foreign DNA was not found in Zurcher\u2019s oral, vaginal, or rectal cavities.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 13} Zurcher was buried on June 6, 2002. That day, Zurcher\u2019s friends gathered again at Chipper\u2019s Bar. Anderson arrived wearing a jacket with long sleeves. When he removed it, witnesses noticed that he had scratches on his hand and arms that had not been present three days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">\n<em>The Trials and Appeals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">{\u00b6 14} The first trial in this case began May 27, 2003. On the day of trial, Anderson successfully moved in limine under Evid.R. 404 to preclude the state from introducing evidence of prior bad acts through testimony from Donna Dripps. The state intended to have Dripps testify that prior to Zurcher\u2019s death, Anderson had choked Dripps and bitten one of her breasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">{\u00b6 15} Although Anderson\u2019s motion was granted, another witness, Nichole Ripple, testified during trial that Zurcher had called Anderson \u201ca freak\u201d and that Anderson had \u201ctried to strangle his ex-girlfriend.\u201d That portion of Ripple\u2019s testimony was repeated on a local evening news broadcast. On Anderson\u2019s motion, the trial court granted a mistrial based on the undue prejudice caused by Ripple\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">{\u00b6 16} A second trial began November 18, 2003. During the second trial, the state was permitted to introduce the same testimony by Dripps that previously had been excluded. The jury found Anderson guilty of murder, and the trial court imposed a prison sentence of 15 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">{\u00b6 17} The court of appeals, however, found error in the admission of the bad-acts evidence. It reversed Anderson\u2019s conviction, finding it \u201cdifficult, if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>impossible, to correlate the two opposing decisions by the trial court on this matter.\u201d 2006-Ohio-4618, 2006 WL 2573785, \u00b6 45. We declined to review that decision. 112 Ohio St.3d 1443, 2007-Ohio-152, 860 N.E.2d 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">{\u00b6 18} Subsequent history of the case is set forth in the opinions of the court of appeals concerning the order now on appeal before us. 7th Dist. Mahoning App. No. 11-MA-43, 2012-Ohio-4390, 2012 WL 4391545.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">{\u00b6 19} A third trial began in December 2008. The jury was unable to return a verdict, and the court declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 20} The fourth trial began in April 2010. During voir dire, defense counsel fell asleep. The court declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">{\u00b6 21} After a fifth trial in August 2010, the jury was again unable to reach a verdict. The court declared another mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 22} When the trial court set a sixth trial date, Anderson moved to dismiss the indictment, asserting that making him stand trial a sixth time violated his right to protection from double jeopardy and his right to due process. The trial court denied the motion, and Anderson appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">{\u00b6 23} The state moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the denial of Anderson\u2019s motion to dismiss was not a final, appealable order. The court of appeals rejected its claim, \u201cfinding that in this particular situation where there have been multiple mistrials, the order appealed is a final, appealable order as defined by R.C. 2505.02.\u201d 2012-Ohio-4390, 2012 WL 4391545, at \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">{\u00b624} On the state\u2019s motion, the court of appeals sat en banc to consider whether the order was final and appealable. The court was equally divided on the issue; two judges agreed that the order was a final, appealable order, and two would have held that it was not. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the original appellate court determination \u2014 that the order was a final, appealable order \u2014 stood. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">{\u00b6 25} We accepted the state\u2019s discretionary appeal, which asserts that the denial of a motion to dismiss on due-process and double-jeopardy grounds is not a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2505.02. 134 Ohio St.3d 1448, 2013-Ohio-347, 982 N.E.2d 727. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">{\u00b6 26} We hold that the denial of a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds is a final, appealable order. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals to the extent that it held that the denial of a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds is a final, appealable order. We need not, and do not, reach the issue of a whether a motion to dismiss on due-process grounds is also a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">{\u00b627} We are presented with two important considerations: the prudential concerns that limit which orders an appellate court can review and the constitutional protections against double-jeopardy violations. Although we have not specifically addressed the issue in light of the General Assembly\u2019s most recent amendments to the definition of \u201cfinal order\u201d in R.C. 2505.02, we do not write on a blank slate. Indeed, we have answered this important question repeatedly, but admittedly inconsistently, over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 28} The requirement of a final, appealable order is equally important in both civil and criminal cases. \u201cAn appellate court can review only final orders, and without a final order, an appellate court has no jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Supportive Solutions, L.L.C. v. Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow, </em>137 Ohio St.3d 23, 2013-Ohio-2410, 997 N.E.2d 490, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 29} R.C. 2953.02 authorizes appellate courts to review the judgment or final order of a trial court in a criminal case. <em>State v. Muncie, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 440, 444, 746 N.E.2d 1092 (2001). To determine whether the order issued by the trial court in a criminal proceeding is a final, appealable order, appellate courts must apply the definitions of \u201cfinal order\u201d contained in R.C. 2505.02. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>State ex rel. Leis v. Kraft, </em>10 Ohio St.3d 34, 36, 460 N.E.2d 1372 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 30} Here, the specific question before us is whether the denial of a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds is a final, appealable order within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>Owens v. Campbell, </em>27 Ohio St.2d 264, 272 N.E.2d 116 (1971), syllabus, we held that an accused could invoke the original jurisdiction of Ohio\u2019s appellate courts through extraordinary writs to adjudicate his right against being placed in double jeopardy. But less than a decade later, we overruled that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">{\u00b6 32} In <em>State v. Thomas, </em>61 Ohio St.2d 254, 400 N.E.2d 897 (1980), syllabus, we unanimously held that the accused has the right to immediately appeal the denial of a motion to dismiss that is predicated on double-jeopardy grounds. In so doing, we made clear the importance of providing an immediate appeal in such a situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">It is clear that the Double Jeopardy Clause is a guarantee against being twice put to trial for the same offense. <em>Abney v. United States </em>(1977), 431 U.S. 651, 661 [97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651]. It is equally clear that an order affecting a right of constitutional dimensions is an \u201corder affecting a substantial right,\u201d within the contemplation of R.C. 2505.02. It would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>seem reasonable to conclude that some form of review prior to judgment is necessary to preserve this right. <em>Id. </em>at page 660.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">We believe that a proceeding on a motion to dismiss for double jeopardy should be considered a special proceeding as well. A claim of double jeopardy raises an issue entirely collateral to the guilt or innocence of the defendant. While it is a complete defense, it is more than that, for it, in principle, bars a new trial as well as a new conviction. Additionally, an erroneous decision on a double jeopardy claim cannot be effectively reviewed after judgment within the second trial; by that time, the defendant\u2019s right has been violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">We hold, therefore, that the overruling of a motion to dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy is a final appealable order under R.C. 2953.02 and 2505.02. <em>Owens v. Campbell </em>([1971], 27 Ohio St.2d 264 [272 N.E.2d 116]) is hereby overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 33} Ten years after <em>Thomas, </em>we again abruptly changed course in <em>State v. Crago, </em>53 Ohio St.3d 243, 559 N.E.2d 1353 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Crago, </em>we held that a defendant cannot appeal the denial of a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy until after the trial is concluded. Our explanation in <em>Crago </em>was conclusory and based solely on the definition of \u201cfinal order\u201d in R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">{\u00b635} Specifically, we noted that R.C. 2505.03(A) directs that every \u201cfinal order\u201d may be reviewed on appeal. At the time, \u201cfinal order\u201d was defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">An order that affects a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, an order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment, or an order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">Former R.C. 2505.02, 1986 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 412, 141 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3563, 3597.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">{\u00b6 36} We summarily determined that \u201cthe denial of a motion to dismiss on the basis of double jeopardy is not a \u2018final order\u2019 with the meaning of R.C. 2953.02 as the definition of \u2018final order\u2019 contained in R.C. 2505.02 is applicable to criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244-245. We then proceeded to overrule <em>Thomas, </em>without further explication. <em>Id. </em>at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">{\u00b6 37} Shortly after <em>Crago, </em>we decided <em>Wenzel v. Enright, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 63, 623 N.E.2d 69 (1993). Applying <em>Crago, </em>a slim majority of this court held that neither an extraordinary writ nor an interlocutory appeal was available to an accused after the denial of a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. We held that the accused may seek review only on direct appeal, at the conclusion of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 38} Our decision in <em>Crago </em>has been questioned by members of this court and the appellate courts. <em>E.g., State v. Gunnell, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 442, 2012-Ohio-3236, 973 N.E.2d 243, \u00b6 42 (Lanzinger, J., concurring) and \u00b6 55 (McGee Brown, J., concurring); <em>State v. Anderson, </em>2012-Ohio-4390, 2012 WL 4391545, \u00b6 31 (DeGenaro, J., concurring); <em>Mentor v. Babul, </em>11th Dist. Lake No. 98-L-244, 1999 WL 820583, *4 (July 16, 1999) (holding that the denial of a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds is not a final, appealable order, but noting \u201cthe very persuasive argument that can be made in support of the immediate exercise of appellate jurisdiction\u201d because of \u201cthe unique nature\u201d of the motion). But in order to resolve this appeal, we need not delve into the merits, or lack thereof, of <em>Crago.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 39} As we have in other cases, we decide the appeal based on the new statutory language, which altered the language that was dispositive to our decision in <em>Crago. See, e.g., State v. Chambliss, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 507, 2011-Ohio-1785, 947 N.E.2d 651 (departing from the court\u2019s prior holding in <em>State ex rel. Keenan v. Calabrese, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 176, 631 N.E.2d 119 (1994), which held, under a previous version of R.C. 2505.02, that an order denying a defendant\u2019s counsel of choice was not a final, appealable order).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The 1998 Amendments to R.C. 2505.02</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 40} In 1998, the General Assembly amended R.C. 2505.02. 1998 Sub.HJB. No. 394, 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3277, 3278. The prior language of R.C. 2505.02 \u201cwas more restrictive concerning what constitutes a final, appealable order than the one currently in effect.\u201d <em>State v. Upshaw, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 189, 2006-Ohio-4253, 852 N.E.2d 711, \u00b6 7. Put another way, the revised language now in place is more extensive than the language we construed in <em>Crago.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 41} Most notably, through Sub.H.B. No. 394, the General Assembly expanded the definition of a \u201cfinal order\u201d to include two additional categories: (1) orders that grant or deny a \u201cprovisional remedy\u201d and otherwise satisfy certain specified criteria and (2) orders that determine whether an action may be maintained as a class action. The latter category is clearly inapplicable here, and our analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>will focus on whether an order that denies a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds is a provisional remedy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 42} R.C. 2505.02(B)(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">(B) An order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">(4) An order that grants or denies a provisional remedy and to which both of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">(a) The order in effect determines the action with respect to the provisional remedy and prevents a judgment in the action in favor of the appealing party with respect to the provisional remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">(b) The appealing party would not be afforded a meaningful or effective remedy by an appeal following final judgment as to all proceedings, issues, claims, and parties in the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">Thus, in order to qualify as a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(4), three requirements must be satisfied: (1) the order must grant or deny a provisional remedy as that term is defined in the statute, (2) the order must in effect determine the action with respect to the provisional remedy, and (3) the appealing party would not be afforded a meaningful review of the decision if that party had to wait for final judgment as to all proceedings in the action. <em>Upshaw, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 189, 2006-Ohio-4253, 852 N.E.2d 711, \u00b6 15, citing <em>Muncie, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 446, 746 N.E.2d 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">{\u00b6 43} For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the denial of a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds satisfies these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">\n<em>A motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds is a provisional remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">{\u00b6 44} A \u201cprovisional remedy\u201d for purposes of defining \u201cfinal order\u201d is \u201ca proceeding ancillary to an action.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">{\u00b6 45} The statute sets forth as examples, introduced by the phrase \u201cincluding, but not limited to,\u201d certain types of proceedings that fall within the definition of an ancillary proceeding, including motions to suppress evidence. The statutory phrase \u201cincluding, but not limited to\u201d means that the examples expressly given are \u201ca <em>nonexhaustive </em>list of examples.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Muncie, </em>91 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>at 448, 746 N.E.2d 1092, citing <em>State v. Lozano, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 560, 562, 740 N.E.2d 273 (2001); <em>Boedeker v. Rogers, </em>140 Ohio App.3d 11, 18, 746 N.E.2d 625 (2000) (noting that by its express terms, the list of provisional remedies in R.C. 2505.02(A)(3) is \u201cillustrative and not exhaustive\u201d). Thus, the failure to include a motion to dismiss in the list does not undermine the notion that a motion to dismiss is an ancillary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 46} Because the statute does not define the term \u201cancillary proceedings,\u201d we must define it according to its plain, common, ordinary meaning. R.C. 1.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 47} As we recognized in <em>Muncie, </em>\u201cfor purposes of R.C. 2505.02(A)(3)\u2019s definition, \u2018[a]n ancillary proceeding is one that is attendant upon or aids another proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Muncie </em>at 449, quoting <em>Bishop v. Dresser Industries, </em>134 Ohio App.3d 321, 324, 730 N.E.2d 1079 (1999). An ancillary proceeding is an \u201cancillary suit,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>101 (9th Ed.2009), i.e., \u201c[a]n action, either at law or in equity, that grows out of and is auxiliary to another suit and is filed to aid the primary suit, to enforce a prior judgment, or to impeach a prior decree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1572.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b6 48} We have little trouble concluding that a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds is an ancillary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">{\u00b6 49} A motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds \u201cgrows out of\u2019 the primary suit, i.e., the prosecution. The act of prosecution triggers a defendant\u2019s constitutional protection against double jeopardy. A motion to dismiss is certainly \u201cattendant\u201d upon the underlying prosecution because it is \u201cconsequent; concomitant; associated; [and] related\u201d to the prosecution. <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>133 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">{\u00b6 50} As one commentator has recognized, a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">separate from and entirely collateral to the substantive issues at trial. The defendant\u2019s right not to be tried has nothing to do with guilt or innocence. The proceeding on the issue is independent of the main trial * * *. Such a position is entirely consistent with the court\u2019s willingness to broadly define what constitutes an ancillary hearing and thus a \u201cprovisional remedy\u201d under R.C. 2505.02(A)(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">John Paul Sellers III, <em>Between a Rock and a Hard Place: Does Ohio Revised Code Section 2505.02 Adequately Safeguard a Person\u2019s Right Not to Be Tried?, </em>28 Ohio N.U.L.Rev. 285, 299 (2002). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">{\u00b6 51} A motion to dismiss on the basis of double jeopardy is a provisional remedy satisfying the first prong of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\n<em>A motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds can determine the action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">{\u00b6 52} We thus turn to the second prong: whether the motion in effect determines the action. Orders denying a motion to dismiss an indictment on double-jeopardy grounds \u201cconstitute a complete, formal, and, in the trial court, final rejection of a criminal defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim.\u201d <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. at 659, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651. And orders granting a motion to dismiss generally end the prosecution. We thus have no trouble concluding that a decision on a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds determines the action because it permits or bars the subsequent prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\n<em>Absent an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds, the moving party would not be afforded meaningful review of the decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 53} We turn now to the third and final prong of the test for final, appealable orders for purposes of R.C. 2505.02(A)(3): whether the appealing party would not be afforded a meaningful review of the decision if that party had to wait for final judgment as to all proceedings in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">{\u00b6 54} The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution ensures that a state may not put a defendant in jeopardy twice for the same offense. <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969). The \u201cbasic theory\u201d underlying the doctrine of double jeopardy \u201cis that it is wrong for one to be subjected more than once <em>to the danger of being punished </em>for an offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Best, </em>42 Ohio St.2d 530, 532, 330 N.E.2d 421 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">{\u00b6 55} The denial of an interlocutory appeal to an accused arguing that a prosecution is barred by double jeopardy vitiates one of the very protections the Constitution provides: the right not to be improperly forced to stand trial repeatedly for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">{\u00b6 56} As the Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">[The] protections [of the Double Jeopardy Clause] would be lost if the accused were forced to \u201crun the gauntlet\u201d a second time before an appeal could be taken; even if the accused is acquitted, or, if convicted, has his conviction ultimately reversed on double jeopardy grounds, he has still been forced to endure a trial that the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to prohibit. Consequently, <em>if a criminal defendant is to avoid exposure to double jeopardy and thereby enjoy the full protection of the Clause, his double jeopardy challenge to the indictment must be reviewable before that subsequent exposure occurs.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>(Emphasis added in part, and footnote omitted.) <em>Abney, </em>431 U.S. at 662, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">{\u00b6 57} In <em>Wenzel, </em>a slim majority of this court relied heavily on <em>Crago </em>to hold that <em>Abney </em>does not mandate that a state provide a mechanism for an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds. <em>Wenzel, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 67, 623 N.E.2d 69, fn. 1. That analysis has been described as \u201csuperficially dismissive\u201d and has been criticized for failing to address the constitutional analysis set forth in <em>Abney. Anderson, </em>2012-Ohio-4390, 2012 WL 4391545, \u00b6 38 (DeGenaro, J., concurring). That criticism is not unfair, particularly given that after <em>Crago </em>and <em>Wenzel, </em>a defendant\u2019s only way to secure pretrial judicial review of the denial of the motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds was through federal habeas relief. <em>See, e.g., Harpster v. Ohio, </em>128 F.3d 322, 326 (6th Cir.1997); <em>Lucas v. Hamilton Cty. Mun. Ct, </em>S.D.Ohio No. l:12-cv-138, 2012 WL 1986680, *4 (June 4, 2012) (in finding that the prisoner-petitioner had exhausted his state-court remedies before seeking federal habeas relief, the court noted the state\u2019s concession that there is no right to an interlocutory appeal from a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds and rejected the state\u2019s argument that mandamus is available to secure pretrial review of a double-jeopardy claim). Yet <em>Abney </em>makes clear that as a matter of federal constitutional law, retrial itself is one of the harms at issue in double-jeopardy cases. That harm cannot be remedied by a subsequent acquittal in the trial court or by the reversal of any conviction through appeal after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c \u2018A post-conviction appeal may offer <em>a </em>remedy, but not an <em>adequate </em>one * * *.\u2019 (Emphasis sic.)\u201d <em>Chambliss, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 507, 2011-Ohio-1785, 947 N.E.2d 651, at \u00b6 26, quoting <em>State ex rel. Keenan, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 180, 631 N.E.2d 119 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). In the context of double jeopardy, we agree that a postconviction appeal is not an adequate remedy \u201cbecause the protection against double jeopardy is not just protection against being punished twice for the same offense, it is also the protection against being tried twice for the same offense.\u201d <em>Wenzel, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 68, 623 N.E.2d 69 (Wright, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">{\u00b6 59} We therefore conclude that an accused would not be afforded a meaningful review of an adverse decision on a motion to dismiss and discharge on double-jeopardy grounds if that party must wait for final judgment as to all proceedings in order to secure review of the double-jeopardy decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The Denial of a Motion to Dismiss on Double-Jeopardy Grounds Is a Final, Appealable Order</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">{\u00b6 60} Having determined that an order denying a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds denies a \u201cprovisional remedy\u201d as that term is defined in the statute, that the order in effect determines the action with respect to the provisional remedy, and that the appealing party would not be afforded a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>meaningful review of the decision if that party had to wait for final judgment as to all proceedings in the action, we hold that the order is a final, appealable order. In so doing, we are not bound by <em>Crago, </em>which was decided on a different, narrower statutory definition, or by <em>Wenzel, </em>which relied on the decision in <em>Crago.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"Avu5\">Paul J.

Thus, the trial court\u2019s denial of Anderson\u2019s motion to dismiss was a final, appealable order.
