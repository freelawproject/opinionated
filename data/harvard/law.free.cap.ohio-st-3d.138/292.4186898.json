The appellant, the state of Ohio, advances one proposition of law: \u201cA trial court is without authority to modify a lifetime driver\u2019s license suspension where defendant fails to meet the statutory criteria providing for modification as set forth under R.C. 4510.54.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">{\u00b6 2} At oral argument, the state articulated the legal issue as whether the Revised Code permits a court to grant limited driving privileges to a person subject to a lifetime driver\u2019s license suspension within the first 15 years of that suspension. We hold that when a trial court grants limited driving privileges and issues an entry in compliance with R.C. 4510.021(A), that grant is not a modification of a lifetime suspension within the meaning of former R.C. 4510.54(A). We therefore overrule the state\u2019s proposition of law. But we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals in part and reverse it in part. The trial court\u2019s entry failed to conform to the law. We therefore remand the cause to the trial court to issue a new entry in conformity with R.C. 4510.021(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">{\u00b6 3} Defendant-appellee, Giovanni A. Manocchio, was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (\u201cDUI\u201d) and speeding in February 2003. Manoc-chio pled guilty to a third-degree-felony violation of former R.C. 4511.19(A), 1999 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Am.Sub.S.B. No. 22, 148 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 8353, 8405, which resulted in his fourth DUI conviction and second felony DUI conviction. Manocchio was sentenced to one year in prison and a \u201clifetime drivers license suspension.\u201d Although the entry did not cite a statute, the lifetime suspension was most likely imposed under former R.C. 4507.16(B)(4). 2001 Sub.H.B. No. 7, 149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 4000, 4039-4043. That statute provided that \u201cno judge shall suspend the first three years of suspension required under division (B)(4) of this section * * <em>Id. </em>at 4048.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 4} In 2008, Manocchio filed a motion for \u201ctermination of suspension and/or restoration of driving privileges with appropriate monitoring,\u201d which the court denied. In February 2012, Manocchio moved for limited driving privileges. Over the state\u2019s objection, the trial court granted Manocchio those privileges \u201csolely during daylight hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 5} The state appealed, asserting that granting limited driving privileges violated the mandate of former R.C. 4510.54(A), which prohibited the modification of a lifetime suspension until 15 years had lapsed. 2006 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 461, 151 Ohio Laws, Part V, 9293, 9409.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 6} Although Manocchio was convicted and sentenced under now amended statutes, the parties and the court of appeals analyzed the issues under current, corresponding statutes, R.C. 4510.02(A) (setting forth the various classifications of suspensions, with Manocchio\u2019s suspension qualifying as a \u201cclass two\u201d suspension under (A)(2)) and 4511.19(G)(l)(e)(iv) (authorizing a prison sentence and license suspension for a third-degree-felony DUI). The court of appeals also invoked R.C. 4510.13(A)(5)(g)(i) (prohibiting driving privileges during the first three years of a lifetime license suspension). A divided Eighth District Court of Appeals held that R.C. 4510.13(A)(5)(g)(i) gives a trial court discretion to grant limited driving privileges during a lifetime suspension because the granting of such privileges is not a \u201cmodification or termination of the suspension\u201d within the meaning of former R.C. 4510.54(A). In support of this holding, the court noted that R.C. 4510.13(A)(5)(g) specifically permits a trial court to grant limited privileges after three years of a mandatory three-years-to-life license suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 7} However, the dissenting judge observed that the authority of the trial court to grant limited driving privileges is restricted by R.C. 4510.021(A), which directs that driving \u201cprivileges shall be for any of the following <em>limited purposes:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(1) Occupational, educational, vocational, or medical purposes;</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(2) Taking the driver\u2019s or commercial driver\u2019s license examination;</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(3) Attending court-ordered treatment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Moreover, R.C. 4510.021(A) further requires that the court \u201cspecify the purposes, times, and places of the privileges.\u201d \u201cAn entry that merely specifies \u2018daytime hours only\u2019 does not satisfy this requirement.\u201d 2012-Ohio-5720, 2012 WL 6061380, \u00b6 18 (Conway Cooney, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">II. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 12} We begin our analysis with R.C. 4510.021. It says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">(A) Unless <em>expressly prohibited </em>by section 2919.22, section 4510.13, <em>or any other section of the Revised Code, </em>a court may grant limited driving privileges for any purpose described in division (A)(1), (2), or (3) of this section during any suspension imposed by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">(Emphasis added.) The statute then names the limited purposes quoted above. No argument is made that either R.C. 2919.22 (endangering children) or 4510.13 (mandatory suspension periods, disabling devices, restricted licenses) has any application to Manocchio.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 13} The state argues, however, that former R.C. 4510.54(A) does expressly prohibit the granting of driving privileges in this case. Former R.C. 4510.54(A) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">[A] person whose driver\u2019s * * * license has been suspended for life under a class one suspension or as otherwise provided by law or has been suspended for a period in excess of fifteen years under a class two suspension may file a motion with the sentencing court for modification or termination of the suspension. The person filing the motion shall demonstrate all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">(1) At least fifteen years have elapsed since the suspension began.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">151 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 9409. The statute then sets forth the procedures that a defendant must follow to have the suspension modified or terminated. Former R.C. 4510.54(A) through (D), <em>id. </em>at 9409-9410.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">{\u00b6 14} The state\u2019s interpretation of the interplay between R.C. 4510.021 and former R.C. 4510.54(A) is correct only if granting limited driving privileges is a \u201cmodification or termination of the suspension.\u201d To support its position, the state relies on a layman\u2019s understanding of the vocabulary: \u201cA term of the suspension \u2014 a complete prohibition against driving \u2014 has been modified \u2014 Manoc-chio may now <em>drive. </em>Manocchio\u2019s suspension <em>has </em>been modified and altered.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>{\u00b6 15} Manocchio, however, argues that the General Assembly has clearly distinguished the granting of limited driving privileges from the modification or termination of a license suspension. He notes that in the entire Revised Code, only R.C. 4510.54 addresses \u201cmodification\u201d of a license suspension, and that statute does not mention limited driving privileges. By contrast, he says, none of the many other Revised Code provisions addressing limited driving privileges mention modification of a license suspension. Furthermore, he asserts that the modification procedure detailed in R.C. 4510.54 does not resemble the statutory procedures for seeking limited driving privileges in R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13 and other statutes. He concludes that former R.C. 4510.54(A) is not an \u201cother section of the Revised Code\u201d that \u201cexpressly prohibit[s]\u201d granting Manocchio limited driving privileges within the meaning of R.C. 4510.021(A). \u201cExpressly\u201d means \u201cin direct or unmistakable terms * * * explicitly.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>803 (1986). Contrary to the state\u2019s contention, it would be more correct to say that the General Assembly expressly distinguished between the granting of driving privileges during a license suspension and the modification of that license suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">{\u00b6 16} Moreover, the statutory language supports Manocchio\u2019s position that limited driving privileges are compatible with license suspensions and do not terminate or modify them. R.C. 4510.01(H) defines \u201csuspend\u201d or \u201csuspension\u201d as \u201cthe permanent or temporary withdrawal, by action of a court or the bureau of motor vehicles, of a driver\u2019s license, commercial driver\u2019s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege for the period of the suspension or the permanent or temporary withdrawal of the privilege to obtain a license, permit, or privilege of that type for the period of the suspension.\u201d The Revised Code does not define limited driving privileges, but R.C. 4510.021(A), the statute at issue here, expressly allows them <em>\u201cduring </em>any suspension.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, the granting of limited driving privileges does not affect the underlying suspension itself, whereas terminating or modifying a suspension clearly does.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 17} The Revised Code directs that \u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to * * * common usage,\u201d but adds that \u201c[wjords and phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.\u201d R.C. 1.42. <em>See also Klemas v. Flynn, </em>66 Ohio St.3d 249, 250, 611 N.E.2d 810 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 18} Here, the General Assembly has carved out two procedures by which drivers under license suspensions may seek to drive and has given them distinct labels. One procedure allows limited driving privileges. R.C. 4510.021 and related statutes. The other allows termination or modification of the suspension. R.C. 4510.54. Therefore, former R.C. 4510.54 might have prevented Manocchio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>from pursuing the modification or termination of his license suspension, but it did not prevent him from pursuing limited driving privileges, and the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion is correct.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AH1\">Timothy J. McGinty, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Mary H. McGrath, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ALi\">Harvey B. Bruner Co., L.P.A., and John D. Mizanin Jr., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">{\u00b6 19} We therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 20} The trial court, however, failed to comply with R.C. 4510.021(A). That subsection requires the court granting limited driving privileges to \u201cspecify the purposes, times, and places of the privileges\u201d and restricts the permissible purposes (as relevant in this case) to \u201c[ojccupational, educational, vocational, or medical purposes.\u201d The entry specifies a time (\u201csolely during daylight hours\u201d) but does not specify a purpose or a place.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 21} We hold that when a trial court grants limited driving privileges and issues an entry in compliance with R.C. 4510.021(A), that grant is not a modification of a lifetime suspension within the meaning of former R.C. 4510.54(A). We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals in part and reverse it in part. The trial court\u2019s entry failed to conform to the law. We therefore remand the cause to the trial court to issue a new entry in conformity with R.C. 4510.021(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b432-9\">O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b432-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b432-11\">Pfeifer, J., dissents and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-12\">.
