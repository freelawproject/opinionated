Nyce, counsel for defendant Mark Rothwell, filed an affidavit of disqualification on January 27, 2014, against Judge P. Randall Knece of the Court of Common Pleas of Pickaway County. Nyce\u2019s affidavit was denied by entry dated February 4, 2014, because the record failed to indicate what, if anything, remained pending before Judge Knece in the underlying case. <em>See In re Disqualification of Hayes, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1221, 2012-Ohio-6306, 985 N.E.2d 501, \u00b6 6 (\u201c[t]he Chief Justice cannot rule on an affidavit of disqualification when * * * nothing is pending before the trial court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">{\u00b6 2} On February 11, 2014, Nyce filed two supplemental affidavits of disqualification, averring that since the filing of his initial affidavit, he had filed a motion in the trial court under Civ.R. 59 and 60. Nyce also set forth additional bias allegations against Judge Knece.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Knece has responded in writing to the allegations in Nyce\u2019s initial and supplemental affidavits, denying any bias or prejudice against Nyce or his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Knece.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">\n<em>Nyce\u2019s First Supplemental Affidavit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-16\">{\u00b6 5} As noted above, Nyce filed his initial affidavit of disqualification on January 27, 2014. The next scheduled hearing in the underlying case was set for that same day on plaintiffs motion to disburse the supersedeas bond posted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After filing his affidavit, Nyce appeared for the scheduled hearing and presented a copy of the affidavit to Judge Knece. Judge Knece moved forward with the hearing and entered an order directing the clerk of courts to disburse the supersedeas bond proceeds to plaintiff. Nyce argues that the filing of his initial affidavit should have barred Judge Knece from proceeding with the January 27 hearing and disbursing the bond proceeds. Nyce further states that at the hearing, Judge Knece \u201cfunctioned in a manner not appropriate to neutral judicial temperament,\u201d engaged in a \u201cunilateral argument\u201d with Nyce about the affidavit of disqualification, \u201chad significant words demonstrating animosity,\u201d and was \u201caggressive, demeaning and unresponsive\u201d to Nyce\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">{\u00b6 6} Under R.C. 2701.03(D)(1), if the clerk of this court accepts an affidavit of disqualification for filing, \u201cthe affidavit deprives the judge against whom the affidavit was filed of any authority to preside in the proceeding until the chief justice of the supreme court * * * rules on the affidavit.\u201d <em>See also State v. Myers, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 335, 2002-Ohio-6658, 780 N.E.2d 186, \u00b6 57 (the filing of an affidavit \u201cautomatically divests the judge of jurisdiction to proceed until the matter is resolved\u201d). However, there are statutory exceptions to this prohibition against proceeding after the filing of an affidavit of disqualification. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(D)(2) and (3). Most relevant here, R.C. 2701.03(D)(3) authorizes a judge against whom an affidavit is filed to decide matters that do not \u201caffect a substantive right of any of the parties.\u201d Courts have interpreted this exception as allowing a judge to undertake ministerial acts during the pendency of the affidavit. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Stern v. Mascio, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 297, 299, 691 N.E.2d 253 (1998); <em>State ex rel. Kreps v. Christiansen, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 313, 317, 725 N.E.2d 663 (2000) (interpreting analogous provision in R.C. 2701.031); <em>Columbus Checkcashers, Inc. v. Guttermaster, Inc., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-106, 2013-Ohio-5543, 2013 WL 6708396, \u00b6 18, 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">{\u00b6 7} Judge Knece appears to invoke this exception, arguing that his order disbursing the supersedeas bond was \u201cministerial in nature\u201d and in compliance with the appellate court\u2019s directive to carry its judgment into execution. Nyce disagrees, claiming that the issue of bond disbursement was not yet ripe for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>{\u00b6 8} If there is any question whether a judge\u2019s ruling during the pendency of an affidavit could affect a party\u2019s substantive rights, the more prudent course of action would be to refrain from making such a ruling until the affidavit is resolved. However, it is beyond the scope of this proceeding to determine whether Judge Knece had statutory authority to issue the January 27 order. The issue in disqualification proceedings is \u201climited to determining whether a judge in a pending case has a bias, prejudice, or other disqualifying interest that mandates the judge\u2019s disqualification from that case.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Griffin, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1219, 2003-Ohio-7356, 803 N.E.2d 820, \u00b6 9. <em>Compare Stem </em>at 299-300 (issuing writ of prohibition voiding a judge\u2019s orders on substantive matters relating to a contempt conviction issued during the pendency of an affidavit of disqualification) and <em>Kreps </em>at 317 (denying a request for writs <em>of </em>prohibition and mandamus against a judge who had made a \u201cministerial\u201d order directing a party to pay a previously ordered judgment during the pendency of an affidavit).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">{\u00b6 9} Although a judge\u2019s ruling during the pendency of an affidavit could be evidence of bias, <em>see, e.g., In re Disqualification of Celebrezze, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1242, 657 N.E.2d 1348 (1992), Judge Knece\u2019s legal determination here that the issue before the court on January 27 was \u201cministerial\u201d \u2014 and therefore not prohibited by the filing of Nyce\u2019s affidavit \u2014 does not, by itself, indicate bias or prejudice against Nyce. It is well settled that a party\u2019s \u201cdissatisfaction or disagreement with a judge\u2019s rulings, even if those rulings may be erroneous, does not constitute bias or prejudice and is not grounds for the judge\u2019s disqualification.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">{\u00b6 10} However, a judge could be disqualified if his or her adverse rulings were accompanied by words or conduct that call into question the manner in which the proceedings are being conducted. In addition, attorneys have a right to file an affidavit of disqualification challenging a court\u2019s perceived partiality \u201c \u2018without the court misconstruing such a challenge as an assault on the integrity of the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Shimko, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 544, 2012-Ohio-5694, 983 N.E.2d 1300, \u00b6 32, quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>72 F.3d 25, 29 (5th Cir.1995). Here, Nyce claims that after he presented his affidavit to Judge Knece at the January 27 hearing, the judge \u201chad significant words demonstrating animosity\u201d and engaged in a \u201cunilateral argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">{\u00b6 11} Nyce, however, has failed to substantiate these allegations with specific examples or a transcript of the hearing. In affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, the burden falls on the affiant to submit \u201cspecific\u201d allegations of bias. R.C. 2701.03(B)(1). And the affiant is generally \u201crequired to submit evidence beyond the affidavit of disqualification supporting the allegations contained therein.\u201d <em>In </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number><em>re Disqualification of Baronzzi, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1212, 2012-Ohio-6341, 985 N.E.2d 494, \u00b6 6. Instead of submitting the transcript himself, Nyce requests this court to obtain the January 27 transcript for him. But it is not the chief justice\u2019s duty in deciding an affidavit of disqualification to further investigate an affiant\u2019s claims or obtain evidence on the affiant\u2019s behalf. Nyce had the burden of proof, and based on the record here, his vague and unsubstantiated allegations regarding Judge Knece\u2019s alleged animosity are insufficient for a finding of bias or prejudice. <em>See In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988) (\u201cvague, unsubstantiated allegations of the affidavit are insufficient on their face for a finding of bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">\n<em>Nyce\u2019s Second Supplemental Affidavit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">{\u00b6 12} On January 28, 2014, the day after Nyce filed his affidavit, Judge Knece initiated a teleconference with counsel in the underlying case. Nyce claims that during the conference, the judge stated that he had reviewed the docket in the underlying matter and discovered that plaintiff had a motion for contempt that had not yet been ruled on by the court. Judge Knece then allegedly stated that he would not make any rulings in the case pending resolution of Nyce\u2019s initial affidavit but that plaintiffs counsel should \u201crevisit\u201d the contempt motion. Nyce claims that the judge\u2019s conduct indicated \u201cintentional intimidation\u201d and was \u201ccontrary to the required elements of judicial fairness and neutrality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">{\u00b6 13} In response, Judge Knece explains that Nyce had claimed in his initial affidavit that the court had not timely ruled upon two of Nyce\u2019s motions. According to Judge Knece, he therefore reviewed the case docket and determined that Nyce\u2019s referenced motions were moot. The judge asserts that in reviewing the docket, he also determined that plaintiff had filed a contempt motion in May 2012, which remained pending. Judge Knece states that he then scheduled the teleconference for the sole purpose of \u201cestablishing procedural parameters to bring pending matters to a close, not for the purpose of intimidation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">{\u00b6 14} In affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, \u201c[a] judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Given Judge\u2019s Knece\u2019s explanation for initiating the teleconference and referring to plaintiffs pending contempt motion, those presumptions have not been overcome in this case. Accordingly, Nyce has failed to establish that the judge\u2019s conduct was a product of bias against Nyce or his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">{\u00b6 15} For the reasons explained above, Nyce\u2019s supplemental affidavits are denied. The case may proceed before Judge Knece.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\">. Under R.C. 2701.03(B), an affidavit of disqualification must be filed \u201cnot less than seven calendar days before the day on which the next hearing in the proceeding is scheduled.\u201d However, this statutory deadline may be set aside \u201cwhen compliance with the provision is impossible,\u201d such as when the alleged bias or prejudice occurs fewer than seven days before the hearing date or the case is scheduled or assigned to a judge within seven days of the next hearing. <em>In re Disqualification of Leskovyansky, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 1210, 723 N.E.2d 1099 (1999). Here, Nyce sufficiently demonstrated that he had received notice of the hearing on January 25, 2014, which was less than seven days before the hearing. Therefore, his affidavit was considered timely filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
