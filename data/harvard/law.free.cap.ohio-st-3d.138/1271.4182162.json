Burge from serving on a three-judge panel in case No. 08CR076222, a capital case pending in the Court of Common Pleas of Lorain County.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">{\u00b6 2} For the reasons explained below, the affidavit is well taken, and Judge Burge is disqualified from serving on the three-judge panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">{\u00b6 3} On January 15, 2014, Judge Burge issued two entries removing himself from cases assigned to Assistant Prosecutor Cilio. Specifically, Judge Burge issued one entry recusing himself from three pending cases in which Cilio served as counsel, including a death-penalty case. The judge also issued a blanket entry recusing himself \u201cfrom all cases assigned to him and which are coterminously assigned, or have previously been assigned by the Lorain County Prosecutor, to Attorney Anthony D. Cilio.\u201d The blanket entry did not give any reason for the judge\u2019s recusal or otherwise limit the scope of the judge\u2019s recusal in cases previously assigned to Cilio.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">{\u00b6 4} In the underlying matter, Cilio has served as first chair for the state since 2008. On February 12, 2014, defendant Vincent Jackson Jr. requested a three-judge panel, and the presiding judge of the Lorain County Common Pleas Court randomly selected two judges from that court to serve on the panel with Judge James Miraldi, who had been assigned to preside over Jackson\u2019s jury trial. Judge Burge was selected, and despite his blanket entry recusing himself from Cillo\u2019s cases, the judge agreed to serve on the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">{\u00b6 5} Will and Cilio subsequently filed this affidavit of disqualification, primarily asserting that Judge Burge\u2019s \u201cattempt to circumvent his own voluntary recusal establishes the mere appearance of impropriety.\u201d Affiants also argue that Judge Burge has a bias against Cilio and that given other facts in the underlying case, Judge Burge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">{\u00b6 6} Judge Burge has responded in writing to the allegations in the affidavit, averring that his decision to recuse himself from Cillo\u2019s cases was unrelated to any bias against Cilio. Instead, the judge claims that he recused himself because the amount of time consumed by the prosecutor\u2019s office in attempting to remove him from Cillo\u2019s cases \u2014 and the amount of time consumed by him in defending himself against the prosecutor\u2019s attempts \u2014 was \u201ca poor use of public funds and bad government in general.\u201d In addition, Judge Burge notes that Cillo\u2019s three cases had been significantly delayed, and the judge removed himself to obviate the possibility that he had been an \u201cobstacle\u201d to timely resolution of those matters. According to Judge Burge, he would not be serving as the assigned or presiding judge in the underlying matter, but only as a \u201ctrier of fact on a three-judge panel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">Merits of the affidavit of disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe law requires not only an impartial judge but also one who appears to the parties and the public to be impartial.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2005-Ohio-7153, 850 N.E.2d 720, \u00b6 11. Here, Judge Burge\u2019s blanket order plainly disqualified him from all cases previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>assigned to Cilio. The judge believes that his blanket order should not apply to the underlying matter because he would be serving only as a \u201ctrier of fact on a three-judge panel.\u201d The judge\u2019s position, however, significantly downplays each judge\u2019s role in a three-judge-panel case. Under R.C. 2945.06, \u201cthe judges or a majority of them may decide all questions of fact and law arising upon the trial,\u201d and more importantly, \u201cthe accused shall not be found guilty or not guilty of any offense unless the judges unanimously find the accused guilty or not guilty.\u201d In addition, if the accused pleads guilty to a charge of aggravated murder, the three judges \u201cshall examine the witnesses, determine whether the accused is guilty of aggravated murder or any other offense, and pronounce sentence accordingly.\u201d Contrary to Judge Burge\u2019s opinion, one judge\u2019s role on a panel in a capital case is no less significant than a judge\u2019s role in any other case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">{\u00b6 8} Accordingly, Judge Burge has failed to sufficiently explain how the underlying matter is distinguishable from other cases in which Cilio appears as counsel. As a federal appellate court noted, \u201ca trial judge cannot, without explanation, recuse himself in a substantial number of cases and, at substantially the same time, decline to recuse himself in another group of cases that appears indistinguishable for purposes of recusal.\u201d <em>Selkridge v. United of Omaha Life Ins. Co., </em>360 F.3d 155, 170 (3d Cir.2004). From an appearance perspective, this is what Judge Burge has attempted to do here. <em>See id. </em>Once Judge Burge had recused himself from all of Cillo\u2019s cases, he could not then pick and choose, without reasonable justification, which cases involving Cilio to hear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cPreservation of public confidence in the integrity of the judicial system is vitally important,\u201d and \u201c[a]n appearance of bias can be just as damaging to public confidence as actual bias.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Murphy, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1206, 2005-Ohio-7148, 850 N.E.2d 712, \u00b6 6. Accordingly, disqualification is appropriate when, as here, the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the judicial system is at stake. <em>See In re Disqualification of Saffold, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1204, 2010-Ohio-6723, 981 N.E.2d 869, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">{\u00b6 10} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is granted to avoid any appearance of impropriety. The case is returned to the presiding judge of the Lorain County Common Pleas Court for random selection of another judge of that court to serve on the three-judge panel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-9\">. This is not to say that Judge Burge cannot later decide to withdraw his blanket order if the grounds precipitating his recusal no longer exist. <em>See In re Disqualification of Celebrezze, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1218, 2012-Ohio-6304, 985 N.E.2d 499.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
