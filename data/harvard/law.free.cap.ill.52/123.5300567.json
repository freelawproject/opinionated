Merriman against the Toledo, Peoria &amp; Warsaw Eailway Company, for failing to deliver certain goods and chattels of the plaintiff, to be carried by the defendants to the city of Washington.</p> <p id=\"b129-6\" pgmap=\"129\">The goods delivered to the defendants\u2019 agent at Peoria, were placed in a box marked to the plaintiff at Washington, in the District of Columbia, and for which a receipt, or bill of lading was made out and delivered to the plaintiff\u2019s agent at Peoria. The goods failed to reach their destination.</p> <p id=\"b129-7\" pgmap=\"129\">The defense was, that they were not liable as common carriers beyond the terminus of the defendants\u2019 road, which was at the State line, and, as it was not shown the loss happened on defendants\u2019 road, the plaintiff could not recover.</p> <p id=\"b129-8\" pgmap=\"129\">This defense is utterly groundless, as the receipt, or bill of lading, offered in evidence, shows upon its face it was a \u201c through freight contract,\u201d and it was in proof by the defendants\u2019 agent that freight received by this company as through freight, was never unloaded or delivered at their terminus, but forwarded on to its place of destination in the cars in which it was received. It is idle, then, for the defendants to claim this was not a through contract, and that their liability did not extend beyond the terminus of their own road.</p> <p id=\"b129-9\" pgmap=\"129\">The defendants must perform their contract, or show some valid excuse for non-performance. Hone is shown in this case. The plaintiff\u2019s right to recover the value of his goods cannot be questioned. This the jury have allowed him.
