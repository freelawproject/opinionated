Officer Daniel Brown<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Baltimore City Police Department testified that on the morning of December 13, 1990, he and Officer Kevin Sewell<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were in a marked patrol car in the Eastern district of Baltimore City. The officers were stopped at a traffic light when they looked into an alley and observed what they perceived to be a Controlled Dangerous Substance (CDS) sale. Specifically, the officers saw Guy Coffey, appellant, taking money from another man (Michael Gee) in exchange for a glassine bag of white powder. When the traffic light changed, Officer Brown proceeded to intercept appellant and the other individual by driving around the block to the other side of the alley. Officer Brown stated that appellant and the other individual were rather startled to see the police vehicle at the other side of the alley and immediately ran in different directions. Officer Brown chased appellant and eventually found him hiding behind an oil tank. Officer Brown attempted to place appellant under arrest but allegedly appellant resisted and elbowed the officer several times. Eventually, appellant was subdued and placed under arrest. In the meantime, Officer Sewell arrested the other individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In July, 1991, appellant and Gee were tried and convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City. We reversed the trial court and remanded for a new trial. <em>Gee and Coffey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 240, 611 A.2d 1081 (1992).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequently, appellant was tried again and convicted of possession of heroin and sentenced to three years imprisonment. On appeal, he asks us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">Did the trial court abuse its discretion in refusing to declare a mistrial after a police officer testified that Appellant had been found guilty in an earlier trial in this case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We are constrained to respond in the affirmative and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The First Remark\u2014Prior Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In the instant case, there were two instances where either Officer Brown or Officer Sewell remarked about the prior trial. Each instance related to evidence that had been presented at the first trial and was subsequently destroyed. The following colloquy, which occurred immediately before the presentation of evidence is instructive with respect to the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">THE COURT; Any reason why we can\u2019t proceed with the jury at this time, Mr. Lautz?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">MR. LAUTZ [defense counsel]: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">THE COURT: Call the matter for the record, please, so we know what we\u2019re talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">MR. ROSE: State of Maryland calling the case of Guy Coffee, 891074007. Shawn Rose for the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-12\">MR. LAUTZ: Thad Lautz, Your Honor, for Guy Coffey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANu\">MR. ROSE: Now in the original case, Your Honor, the photographs of the drugs were entered into evidence. They\u2019re not in the court file anymore. I\u2019m not sure if they were destroyed or what.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-13\">I\u2019ve sent my officer to see if he can find some more photographs of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-14\">THE COURT: So what do you want me to do? Now that you\u2019ve told me, you haven\u2019t asked me to do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>MR. ROSE: That is\u2014that is the situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">THE COURT: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">MR. LAUTZ: May we approach, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">THE COURT: For what? Tell me from where you are....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD4\">THE COURT: [Are you] [a]sk[ing] for [a] dismissal because there is no photograph of the drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">MR. LAUTZ: There are no drugs, there is no photograph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5F\">THE COURT: Say what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">MR. LAUTZ: There are no drugs. Are they going to be able to produce the drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-11\">MR. ROSE: That\u2019s why they\u2019ve gone to the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-12\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know. If they can\u2019t produce the drugs or whatever, you make the proper motion, but it\u2019s kind of late\u2014kind of premature at the moment, don\u2019t you think?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-13\">MR. LAUTZ: I love it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-14\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying Mr. Lautz. You\u2019re saying because there is no photograph there can be no case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-15\">MR. LAUTZ: There are no photographs of the drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKg\">THE COURT: There is no photograph of my birth. That doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t born.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-16\">MR. LAUTZ: But you\u2019re sitting there. You\u2019re sitting there it\u2019s accepted but there are no drugs sitting here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-17\">THE COURT: Do you\u2014do you\u2014I\u2019m confused so straighten me out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-18\">There was an arrest, there were drugs, they were analyzed, there is a chemist report, there is no photograph</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akg\">MR. LAUTZ: There is no photograph and there is no physical evidence. There is no photograph. There is no physical evidence. This chemist report means nothing because they will not be entering the chemist report into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-19\">MR. ROSE: Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>THE COURT: Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">MR. LAUTZ: I have already filed my omnibus motion in that I\u2019ve asked for the chemist, I\u2019ve asked for chain of custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">THE COURT: The chemist will be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">MR. LAUTZ: But he\u2019s going to have to\u2014the State is going to have to produce other evidence other than the chemist coming in saying I analyzed something. They\u2019re going to have to have chain of custody. They cannot show\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">THE COURT: Why don\u2019t you let Mr. Rose try his case and when he fumbles make the [motion]. Until then this [is] all hypothetical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">MR. LAUTZ: I know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">During the trial, Officer Brown testified on behalf of the State. On cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel questioned him regarding the CDS that the officers recovered. Appellant\u2019s counsel asked the officer whether he had a \u201cpicture of [the CDS].\u201d The officer replied that he did not and that a negative might exist somewhere in police headquarters. Questioned further regarding the original, the following exchange transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">MR. LAUTZ: what about the original that\u2019s supposed to be offered into evidence in the courtroom, where is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aud\">OFFICER BROWN: Well, the first time the picture and the photograph of the CDS were brought into the first trial\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">MR. LAUTZ: Sir\u2014Oh my goodness. Approach your hon- or?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-13\">THE COURT: Denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-14\">MR. LAUTZ: Make a motion, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-15\">THE COURT: Denied. You opened the door. Move right along please, Mr. Lautz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-16\">THE COURT: Next question please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-17\">MR. LAUTZ: All right, let\u2019s open the door then, might as well. There is supposed to be evidence presented at trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>any trial, this trial, previous trial, you got to have evidence and it\u2019s not here, right?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">On redirect, Officer Brown was asked the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">MR. ROSE: Now, during the cross-examination the defense attorney questioned about photographs and items of evidence that were\u2014and why you don\u2019t have them today. No other\u2014in an earlier year were those photographs and items like the drugs entered into evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Over defense counsel\u2019s objections, Officer Brown responded that evidence is generally destroyed after a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The Second Remark\u2014Prior Trial and Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">In attempting to establish the chain of custody of the subject CDS, the State asked Officer Sewell whether the CDS and the photographs were submitted into evidence at an earlier trial. The following exchange occurred when the State attempted to introduce into evidence the laboratory report of the items seized by the officers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">MR. LAUTZ: Also they do not have the CDS. We do not have the CDS, we do not have the photograph of the CDS and therefore that is part of the chain that has to be met here. The State is never going to be able to produce that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGO\">THE COURT: Where in the law does it state that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">MR. LAUTZ: That they have to have the evidence in here? You see this is not proving anything. All this is doing is saying that this piece of evidence that I bring\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">THE COURT: I know exactly but we have two kinds of ways we prove things in courts of law, by direct evidence and circumstantial. This what is submitted, the chemist says this is what I examined and it\u2019s heroin. You\u2019re trying to tell me I\u2019m supposed to throw the case out now because the actual dope is not in the courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-13\">MR. LAUTZ: Yes I am because. These things are not relevant unless you have the actual evidence. All this report does is saying\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-14\">THE COURT: You mean State\u2019s Exhibit Number One.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>MR. LAUTZ: Exactly. All that State\u2019s Exhibit Number One is supposed to do and does in any case is says this piece of evidence is\u2014this piece of evidence is recovered in this case and it\u2014you can tell by looking at it\u2014it is heroin. Without having that piece of evidence in here this is not relevant. Absolutely not relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">THE COURT: As I understand the evidence in this case so far, following the first trial in this case the evidence was destroyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">MR. LAUTZ: That\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">THE COURT: Is that my understanding of what happened to it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">MR. LAUTZ: We don\u2019t know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">THE COURT: Somebody testified to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">MR. LAUTZ: But I objected. Somebody testified to it and I objected because he has no basis of knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">THE COURT: That\u2019s the only evidence we have in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-11\">MR. LAUTZ: We don\u2019t have any evidence at all that it was destroyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-12\">THE COURT: We don\u2019t have any evidence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-13\">MR. LAUTZ: That it was destroyed. He said it probably was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-14\">THE COURT: But that\u2019s the only evidence we have in the case as to what happened to it so far.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-15\">MR. LAUTZ: I would submit that evidence is useless in making a decision as to whether it was or wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-16\">THE COURT: Okay. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-17\">MR. LAUTZ: Since it is not <em>going to be in </em>here, this is not quite relevant yet. Not yet. Until they bring it in. Bring in a photo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-18\">THE COURT: They are never going to bring it in so what you\u2019re asking me to do is dismiss the case because the State can\u2019t present the corpus delicti which is the drugs themselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-19\">MR. LAUTZ: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>THE COURT: AH right. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">MR. LAUTZ: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">THE COURT: The objection and request of defense is overruled and denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Officer Sewell\u2019s testimony regarding the events of December 13, 1990, essentially reiterated that of Officer Brown. Sewell also testified that he \u201csubmitted the glassine bags containing the white powder [recovered from Mr. Gee] and the money that was recovered from Mr. Coffey\u201d to the evidence control unit at police headquarters. The officer testified that these items were photographed and that he filled out some paper work so that the alleged CDS could be analyzed at the crime lab. Additionally, the officer identified \u201ca chain of evidence laboratory report\u201d he had filled out. The prosecutor, over objection, then elicited from the officer that an earlier trial was held in the same matter and that the photographs and drugs were submitted into evidence. The following colloquy then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">MR. ROSE: Since that time, officer, have you had an occasion to check to see whether those photographs or drugs\u2014the drugs still existed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">MR. LAUTZ: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">OFFICER SEWELL: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">MR. ROSE: And when did you check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-13\">OFFICER SEWELL: I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-14\">MR. LAUTZ: Objection. May I have a continuing objection, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-15\">THE COURT: You may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-16\">MR. LAUTZ: As to this Hne.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-17\">OFFICER SEWELL: Yes, I checked after the <em>conviction of the defendant in the first trial.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-18\">MR. ROSE: A11 right, and what happened? And were you able to determine whether or not those things still existed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIC\">OFFICER SEWELL: <em>After the defendant was found guilty in the first trial, </em>our poHcy in the Baltimore City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>police department is whether the drugs should still be kept around. At that particular time, I said\u2014I submitted the report saying No, you can go ahead and destroy the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">(emphasis added). After the officer finished testifying, the Court summoned counsel to the bench and held an on-the-record conference. The Court informed counsel that it was concerned by the officer\u2019s disclosure of appellant\u2019s prior conviction on the same counts. Specifically, the following exchange transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">THE COURT: During the course of the examination of this witness as to the nonproductivity of the actual heroin and/or the photograph in this case, you [defense counsel] made a continuing objection [to the Prosecutor\u2019s] line of questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">During the course of that questioning it was disclosed by the witness that following the defendant being found guilty in the first trial, the witness destroyed the exhibit or gave permission [that] the exhibit be destroyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">Because you have a continuing objection, I want to clarify the record at this point or at least find out what if anything you want me to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">The questioning from the State\u2019s Attorney was along the line as to why the exhibit and/or the photograph are no longer available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">It has now been disclosed to this jury that in the first trial it was a guilty finding and that is what led the witness to disclose\u2014or just to have the evidence destroyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">In light of that, your continuing objection of which I didn\u2019t know he was going to say guilty or maybe you [the prosecutor] didn\u2019t either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\">MR. ROSE: Neither did I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-13\">THE COURT: My question to you [defense counsel] is in light of your continuing objection on a related line in which that fact was elicited, what if anything do you want me to do about it?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Defense counsel contended that the court should grant a mistrial. The court denied this motion; instead the court determined that it would give curative instructions because it concluded that the \u201cconvicted\u201d and \u201cguilty\u201d disclosures were not \u201cintentional and there have been other references throughout to the other hearing, et cetera.\u201d Thus, the court concluded that in its opinion, because several references had been made to the prior trial, the curative instructions would negate any prejudice emanating from the two Officer\u2019s disclosures. In view of the court\u2019s ruling on the motion for mistrial, defense counsel did not oppose the court\u2019s decision to give curative instructions. The court then proceeded to give the following curative instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">Members of the jury, from this witness you have heard certain references to a previous finding as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant in another proceeding prior to today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">You are to disregard any testimony, on the issue of any previous finding of guilt or not guilty in reference to the defendant in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">As far as this court is concerned and you are concerned, this is a trial de novo. What that means in lay[person]\u2019s terms is this is the first trial as if a previous trial never happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">That is the posture for you, that is the posture for the State, the defense and the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">That information was elicited during the course of this trial from this witness only for the limited purpose of explaining to you why no photographs of the money or the narcotics [ ] alleged in this case exists at this time. And you are to consider such testimony as to the previous trial only for the limited purpose as an explanation to you as to why those exhibits and/or narcotics are not available at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">It is well established that the decision to grant a motion for a mistrial rests in the discretion of a trial judge and our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>review is limited to determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 277, 604 A.2d 489 (1992). The question is one of prejudice. <em>Rainville v. State, </em>328 Md. 398, 408, 614 A.2d 949 (1992); <em>Hawkins, </em>326 Md. at 276, 604 A.2d 489. Recently, in <em>Burks v. State, </em>96 Md.App. 173, 187, 624 A.2d 1257, <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 381, 631 A.2d 451 (1993), we stated that a mistrial is \u201can extreme sanction that sometimes must be resorted to when such overwhelming prejudice has occurred that no other remedy will suffice to cure the prejudice.\u201d Additionally, where the motion for mistrial is denied and the trial judge gives a curative instruction, we must determine \u201c \u2018whether the evidence was so prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair trial\u2019; that is, whether \u2018the damage in the form of prejudice to the defendant transcended the curative effect of the instruction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rainville, </em>328 Md. at 408, 614 A.2d 949 (quoting <em>Kosmas v. State, </em>316 Md. 587, 594, 560 A.2d 1137 (1989)); <em>see also Hawkins, </em>326 Md. at 277, 604 A.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Denial of the Motion for Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to declare a mistrial after Officer Sewell testified that the appellant had been found guilty in an earlier trial. Appellant explains that even if defense counsel had inadvertently \u201copened the door\u201d regarding the Brown disclosure, the door was not open regarding the Sewell disclosure about the prior conviction. Appellant asserts that Officer Sewell\u2019s disclosure of his prior trial and conviction on the very same charges on which he was being retried was manifestly prejudicial. He notes that this disclosure is similar to the one in <em>Rainville, </em>328 Md. at 411, 614 A.2d 949, where the Court of Appeals stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">it is highly probable that the inadmissible evidence in this case had such a devastating and pervasive effect that no curative instruction, no matter how quickly and ably given, could salvage a fair trial for the defendant. The defendant is not to blame\u2014he anticipated the possibility of just such a problem, and prudently attempted to avoid it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Accordingly, he would have us hold that the trial court erred in not granting his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Here, the State produced the testimony of two officers, both of whom were qualified as experts, who observed appellant engage in what they perceived to be a CDS sale. When the officers confronted appellant and Gee, both of them tried to run away from the officers. Officer Brown pursued appellant and arrested him. The State also introduced into evidence the chain of evidence report/laboratory report that indicated that the item seized from Gee was heroin. Officer Sewell identified this report as the one he had filled out to process the items recovered from Gee. The State also introduced the testimony of Fuad Jarjoura, an expert in the field of CDS analysis and identification employed by the Baltimore City police laboratory, who testified that the seized item was heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In other words, under normal circumstances, the jury had sufficient facts before it so that it could determine from the facts alone whether the appellant was guilty as charged. But, in this case, the jury did not make that determination from the facts alone. Instead, Officer Sewell, an experienced member of the Baltimore City Police Department, blurted out twice that appellant had been tried and found guilty previously on the very same charges. Commendably, the court recognized the possible prejudice emanating from this disclosure and held an on-the-record discussion with counsel to discuss what, if anything, should be done under these circumstances. The court concluded that curative instructions would overcome any prejudice to the appellant. We, therefore, are faced with the question as to whether, in so doing, the trial court abused its discretion. Specifically, we must determine whether in a criminal case, where a defendant is retried on the same charges, does an experienced police officer\u2019s mention of the defendant\u2019s previous trial and conviction for those same charges ordinarily warrant a mistrial. We conclude that it does and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">At the outset, we note that the coveted \u201ccase in point\u201d has eluded us; cases where the Court of Appeals has held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>mistrial was necessary are, however, instructive in our analysis. The Court of Appeals has on numerous occasions addressed conduct that constitutes grounds for a mistrial. In <em>Poole v. State, </em>295 Md. 167, 193-94, 453 A.2d 1218 (1983), the Court addressed whether a mistrial should have been granted because a State\u2019s witness responded to the prosecutor\u2019s question by stating \u201cI remember the <em>last trial, the last time </em>I said, it was a safari coat.\u201d (emphasis added) The Court concluded that reversible error was not committed because even though the remark may \u201chave conveyed the fact of a previous trial to the jury,\u201d it did not result in an error that \u201cwas necessarily prejudicial to the [defendant\u2019s] right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194, 453 A.2d 1218. The Court explained its decision by quoting from <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 431, 326 A.2d 707 (1974) (quoting <em>People v. Mackins, </em>17 Ill.App.3d 24, 308 N.E.2d 92, 110 (1974)) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">[T]he mere occurrence of improper remarks does not by itself constitute reversible error. There must be an additional element for this conclusion to be reached. If we cannot say that the assailed argument constituted \u201ca material factor in the conviction\u201d; must have resulted in \u201csubstantial prejudice to the accused\u201d or that \u201cthe verdict would have been different had the improper closing argument not been made ... \u201d, then we must necessarily conclude that no prejudicial error resulted from the argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">In <em>Guesfeird v. State, </em>300 Md. 653, 659, 480 A.2d 800 (1984) the Court explained that, in ascertaining whether references to a lie detector test required a mistrial, the following factors be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">whether the reference to [inadmissible evidence] was repeated or whether it was a single, isolated statement; whether the reference was solicited by counsel, or was an inadvertent and unresponsive statement; whether the witness making the reference is the principle witness upon whom the entire prosecution depends; whether credibility is a crucial issue; [and] whether a great deal of other evidence exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>In that case, because the sole prosecution witness made an inadvertent reference to'having taken a lie detector test, the Court noted that \u201c[t]he unavoidable inference for the jury to make is that if she took the test, she passed and was telling the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666, 480 A.2d 800. Thus, the Court held that the defendant was prejudiced and the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>at 666-67, 480 A.2d 800. Similarly, in <em>Rainville, </em>328 Md. at 410, 614 A.2d 949, the Court held that the prejudice emanating from inadmissible evidence was not cured by curative instructions and \u201cmay well have meant the difference between acquittal and conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We recognize that, contrary to the case <em>sub judice, </em>there was a dearth of evidence in <em>Guesfeird </em>and <em>Rainville </em>and that here the trial court issued curative instructions, which might negate Officer Sewell\u2019s disclosures\u2019 prejudicial impact. The Supreme Court, however, noted in <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 1627, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">there are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Recognizing the inherent limitations of a jury to disregard highly prejudicial testimony, Professor Lynn McLain states that \u201c[t]he efficacy of an instruction to disregard is questionable. Not only may jurors not be able to erase from their minds the inadmissible information they have heard, but an instruction to disregard may emphasize it.\u201d Lynn McLain, <em>5 Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 130.10, 30-31 (1987 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.1994) (footnotes omitted). Based upon our review of the testimony, we conclude that this is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Our decision is consistent with <em>Bailey v. State, </em>521 A.2d 1069 (Del.1987) (cited with approval in <em>State v. Crutchfield, </em>318 Md. 200, 211, 567 A.2d 449 (1989)). In that case, the trial court declared a mistrial, <em>sua sponte, </em>because three witnesses made references to the defendant\u2019s prior trial and the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>witness referred to the defendant\u2019s prior conviction on the same charges for which he was being retried. In affirming the trial court\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">we are hard pressed to think of anything more damning to an accused than information that a jury had previously convicted him for the crime charged. It seems unreasonable to expect a juror to divorce from his deliberative process, knowledge that a defendant had been previously tried and convicted, and following a reversal has been once again subjected to prosecution. The mere expenditure of so much time and expense on the part of the state might lead the average lay person to assume that such a defendant must, in fact, be guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\"><em>Bailey, </em>521 A.2d at 1076. (quoting <em>Hughes v. State, </em>490 A.2d 1034, 1044 (1985)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Weber v. State, </em>501 So.2d 1379, 1382-83 (Fla.App.1987) (reversing the trial court because the jury learned that defendant was previously convicted and sentenced for the same crimes and that his convictions and sentences had been reversed on a technicality); <em>Arthur v. Bordenkircher, </em>715 F.2d 118, 119-20 (4th Cir.1983) (stating that reversible error was committed because the jury was instructed by the court that the defendant \u201chad already been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>convicted of the same crime and that the present jury was to retry the defendant only because the prior conviction was reversed on procedural grounds.\u201d). <em>See also United States v. Eccleston, </em>961 F.2d 955 (D.C.Cir.1992) (reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of a mistrial because the police witness gave inadmissible hearsay testimony and \u201c[although the district court instructed the jury to disregard the statement ... given the frailty of the government\u2019s case, the instruction was inadequate to cure the highly prejudicial impact of the officer\u2019s testimony.\u201d) There are, of course, a number of federal cases that address possibly prejudicial \u201cblurts\u201d where a mistrial was denied. None of these cases, however, involve a blurt of a \u201cconviction\u201d on the same charges by a witness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Our decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>must be based on the record before us and, unlike the <em>Bailey </em>court, we do not hold that \u201cjuror knowledge of a prior conviction that comes during the course of subsequent proceedings is cause for a mistrial <em>ipso facto.\u201d Bailey, </em>521 A.2d at 1076 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Additionally, we note that Officer Sewell\u2019s disclosures regarding the prior trial and conviction could not have been admitted under the doctrine of \u201copening the door.\u201d In <em>Clark v. State, </em>332 Md. 77, 84-85, 629 A.2d 1239 (1993), the Court of Appeals explained this doctrine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">The \u201copening the door\u201d doctrine is really a rule of expanded relevancy and authorizes admitting evidence which otherwise would have been irrelevant in order to respond to (1) admissible evidence which generates an issue, or (2) inadmissible evidence admitted by the court over objection. Generally, \u201copening the door\u201d is simply a contention that competent evidence which was previously irrelevant is now relevant through the opponent\u2019s admission of other evidence on the same issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The Court further explained that where, in a rape case, an officer testified that the defendant was implicated in another rape case, the trial court should have undertaken the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">Where, as in the instant case, an adverse witness gives an unresponsive, unanticipated prejudicial answer to a question, the issue is whether the admission of rebutting evidence is controlled by the \u201copening the door\u201d rules of expanded relevancy or by the more limited rules of curative admissibility. The answer depends on the character of the responsive evidence sought to be admitted. If the proffered responsive evidence is competent evidence that would otherwise be admissible if relevant, then it is tested by the rules of relevancy ... If the proffered responsive evidence would be incompetent (e.g., hearsay) regardless of its relevance, then it is only admissible if permitted by the principles of curative admissibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 91-92, 629 A.2d 1239. The Court then held that because the defendant\u2019s counsel sought to counterattack the police officer\u2019s disclosure by utilizing \u201cotherwise irrelevant <em>and </em>incompetent hearsay\u201d evidence, the doctrine of curative admissibility was applicable. <em>Id. </em>at 92, 629 A.2d 1239. The Court also noted that the \u201cdamage to [the defendant\u2019s] case [caused by the disclosure] cannot be overstated ... [and] may have been sufficiently prejudicial to justify a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. See also Terry v. State, </em>332 Md. 329, 338-39, 631 A.2d 424 (1993) (noting that admission of prior conviction for same or similar crime to counter defense counsel\u2019s improper opening statement was prejudicial and \u201ctantamount to killing an ant with a pile driver.\u201d) In the instant case, even if we were to hold that Officer Brown\u2019s testimony was admissible under either the \u201copening the door\u201d or curative admissibility theory, based upon our review of the record we cannot hold that Officer Sewell\u2019s disclosure regarding the previous conviction was admissible under either theory. In fact, we cannot think of a more prejudicial disclosure than a jury learning that the defendant had been tried and convicted by another jury for the very same charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>We recognize that the nature of the defense\u2014that the State could not produce a critical portion of the corpus delicti (i.e., the CDS)\u2014required the State to explain the absence of the physical evidence and consequently the evidence of a prior trial. The blurt, however, of a conviction in this very case was so egregious that not withstanding the trial judge\u2019s valiant efforts to avoid a mistrial, through the issuance of curative instructions, a mistrial was the only cure. Accordingly, we conclude that when the jury learned of appellant\u2019s prior trial and conviction on the very same charges, this information was \u201cso prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair trial\u201d and \u201ctranscended the curative effect of the instruction.\u201d <em>Rainville, </em>328 Md. at 408, 614 A.2d 949 (quoting <em>Kosmas v.

Jurors in criminal cases may quickly conclude that the primary reason for a second trial is not a prior mistrial but reversal of a prior conviction after appeal. Each situation and possible solution must be scrupulously reviewed by the trial court. Juror knowledge of a prior trial during a subsequent trial must be assiduously avoided. Before any retrial for the same offense, counsel has a responsibility to caution their witnesses not to refer [to the] prior trial, even as prior proceedings. Counsel should try to question witnesses about their prior testimony in generic terms, e.g. about \u201cpreviously sworn statements in matters concerning these proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-9\"><em>Bailey, </em>521 A.2d at 1076 n. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b642-5\">. <em>See United States v.
