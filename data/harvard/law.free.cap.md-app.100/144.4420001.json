Mangels and Alice B. Mangels (Mangels), filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the Circuit Court for Kent County, asking the court to declare that, as dominant tenants, they possessed an easement over and through the property of the servient tenants, appellants, William S. Beck and Pauline G. Hand<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Beck). The trial court found that an easement of necessity had been created in 1931, that it was not extinguished by a subsequent conveyance of additional property to Mangels\u2019s predecessor in title, that the parties had consented by acquiescence to a relocation of the way in 1948, and that the present right-of-way should be a total of fifteen feet in width. Appellant poses eleven questions in the form that follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">1. Will this Appellate Court overturn at least 125 years of law in this State concerning easements by necessity by affirming the trial court\u2019s decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">2. Was it reversible error for the trial court to utilize criteria applicable to prescriptive easements rather than easements by necessity in this case, if in fact an easement by necessity existed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>3. Was it reversible error for the trial court to enlarge an undisputed eight (8) foot wide road to a greater width?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">4. Was it reversible error for the trial court to permit the Appellees to place macadam or concrete along the road when it had never been so improved in the past?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">5. Was it reversible error for the trial court to provide for a road that would permit vehicles larger than those in existence in 1931 to service Appellees\u2019 property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">6. Was it reversible error for the trial court to not make findings of fact as to what permission, if any, was given to the Appellees by the Appellants; whether the Appellee stated to the witnesses Shivery and Wilson at the time of the sale that the Appellee knew he had no right of way, except by permission; and whether or not the witnesses, Bramble and Shivery, heard the Appellee request permission to use the said lane shortly after the sale?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">7. Was it reversible error for the trial court to fail to state the evidence it relied on in rendering the opinion as to the size of the trees in 1931?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">8. Was it reversible error for the trial court to fail to interpret the meaning of the language in the second 1931 deed \u201cextending from the land of Martenet to the public road\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">9. Was it reversible error for the trial court to fail to state the evidence it relied on in determining that Martenet began using the Beck lane in 1947/48, particularly in light of the testimony of Bramble, Beck, Shivery and Wilson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">10. Was it reversible error for the trial court to fail to state the evidence the court relied on in making a finding that Beck and Hand agreed to transfer the servitude from the Bramble property to the Beck/Hand property and when it occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">11. Was it reversible error for the trial court to fail to state what evidence it relied on in determining that the \u201cconstruction of a road would have been extremely expensive in 1931\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>With respect to questions 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11, Beck objects to what he perceives to be the trial court\u2019s failure to state in its opinion the evidence it relied on to support its findings, not that the findings are wrong. In question 8, Beck asks whether it was reversible error for the trial court to \u201cfail to interpret\u201d certain language when it rendered its opinion. Neither in his brief, nor at oral argument, did Beck offer any substantial argument supporting his position on these specific questions. Md.Rule 8-504(a)(5) requires a party to present \u201cargument in support of the party\u2019s position.\u201d <em>See also Bond v.

We do note that many of the questions may be answered as we address those issues that were properly presented by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Likewise, we shall not respond to question 1, as it is an inappropriate question. Our function is to address the actions of the trial court in order to determine whether it erred. Should we err, the question can be presented to higher authority. We are thus left with four questions\u20142, 3, 4, and 5\u2014to resolve directly. In order to address these questions, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>is necessary to determine whether the trial court correctly found that a way by necessity existed in the first instance. We shall first discuss those facts we deem necessary to resolve the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The Relevant Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">In 1931, when both the dominant and servient estates in the case at bar were in unity of title, a common title predecessor to both appellants and appellees, Gale, conveyed from his tract of land formerly known as Gresham College a tract to appellees\u2019 predecessor in title, the Martenets. At that time, there was no explicit easement of access from the Martenet parcel over the remaining Gale parcel to the public road (Tolchester Road). The Martenets then used a way across a portion of the Gale land, in a northerly direction sometimes referred to by the trial court as the Martenet Branch,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to a road on the remaining Gale parcel referred to as \u201cGale lane\u201d and then over \u201cGale lane\u201d to access the public road.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Several months later, Gale conveyed to the Martenets a thirty foot wide strip of land along the irregular southern or western boundary of the original tract, running from the property originally conveyed to the public road. This second conveyance occurred on December 24, 1931. At the time of this second conveyance, no mention was made of the Martenets\u2019 rights concerning the use of the Martenet Extension and Gale lane. The thirty foot strip has never been improved and apparently during the time relevant to this case has been overgrown in a forest. It is composed in substantial part of wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">In November of 1937, Gale conveyed a large tract of land to William A. Beck. The northerly property line of this Beck tract was parallel with and ten feet distant from the center line of Gale lane. This tract ran from the public road to the bay and separated the Martenet property along the Marten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>ets\u2019 northerly property line from Gale lane and the balance of the Gale property. As to the Martenet Extension, if it was a way of necessity, the Beck tract was, even then, the servient estate with the Martenet tract being the dominant estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The remainder of the Gale property lying north of the Beck off-conveyance was conveyed to others and subsequently to David Bramble and is now called the Bramble tract. The present suit by the Mangelses (the Martenets\u2019 successors in title) does not claim any easement over the Bramble tract. Accordingly, we shall only address that tract from time to time as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Around 1948, Bramble\u2019s predecessor, Campbell, noticed that Gale lane was deteriorating. At that point, both Campbell and Beck were successors to the original servient estate. Gale lane was on the Campbell/Bramble property, and abutting the Beck property. Because Gale lane had deteriorated, Mr. Beck had a lane constructed abutting on his northerly property line and Gale lane. It was approximately fifteen feet south of the center line of Gale lane.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was referred to below as the \u201cBeck lane.\u201d We attach to our opinion as our Exhibit A a not to scale drawing of the locations of the various tracts indicating the approximate position of the various property lines, lanes, strips, and ways. We have prepared it from several exhibits attached to the trial court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">After Beck lane was constructed, the Martenets began to use it for ingress and egress to their property. When the Mangelses inspected the property prior to its purchase in 1963, they utilized the Beck lane. The Mangelses have continued to use Beck lane and have incurred expenses in maintaining both the Martenet Extension and Beck lane since.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">We shall address other relevant facts as we address the issues necessary to resolve this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\n<em>Declaratory Relief</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">In an action properly brought under the Declaratory Judgments Act, the court ordinarily must declare the rights of the parties in light of the issues raised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\"><em>Jennings v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>302 Md. 352, 355, 488 A.2d 166 (1985). In <em>Robert T. Foley Co. v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>283 Md. 140, 155, 389 A.2d 350 (1978), a case in which the trial court failed to declare whether certain resolutions were valid, the Court of Appeals, quoting from its earlier case of <em>Dart Drug Corp. v. Hechinger Co., </em>272 Md. 15, 29, 320 A.2d 266 (1974), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">\u201cWhile a declaratory decree need not be in any particular form, it must pass upon and adjudicate the issues raised in the proceeding, to the end that the rights of the parties are clearly delineated and the controversy terminated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\"><em>See also Donnelly Advertising Corp. v. Mayor and City Council, </em>279 Md. 660, 672, 370 A.2d 1127 (1977). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the plaintiffs (appellees here) prayed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">1. That the Plaintiffs be granted a Declaratory Judgment determining that Plaintiffs and their successors in title and interest have an easement appurtenant to their property over and through the property of the Defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">We presume that appellants responded by asking the court not to make that declaration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judge Price, in an extensive, well-reasoned opinion, found certain facts and declared certain rights. We include here those we deem pertinent to our decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">The Martenet/Mangels property adjoined the Chesapeake Bay, but it did not touch any public road. The deed by which the property was conveyed contained no express grant of easement for ingress and egress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\">The parties agree that an easement by necessity was thus created on August 31, 1931 over a portion of the remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>lands of Gresham College to allow ingress and egress to and from the Martenet/Mangels property....<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> The Martenets therefore accessed their property by travelling in a westerly direction up the farm lane which serviced the Gale farm house, hereinafter referred to as the \u201cGale lane,\u201d to a point approximately 800 feet from the Chesapeake Bay. They then created a new lane in a southerly direction to their property, hereinafter referred to as the \u201cMartenet branch.\u201d [We refer to it as the Martenet Extension.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">On December 24, 1931, almost four months after the initial conveyance to the Martenets, J. Page Gale conveyed to the Martenets, from his remaining acreage, a strip of land 30 feet in width, parallel with, contiguous to, and north of the division line between Hinchingham Farm and Gresham College, extending from the Martenet/Mangels property to Maryland Route 445.... This 30 foot wide strip is over a mile long and consists of 3.497 acres, more or less, most of which was, and still is, forest. There is no evidence that there has ever been an attempt to use this strip as an access road to the Martenet/Mangels property....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">In approximately 1948, due, in part, to the poor condition of the Gale lane, William M. Beck had a lane constructed on the Beck property. This lane, hereinafter referred to as the \u201cBeck lane\u201d was parallel to and approximately 15 feet South of the Gale lane. The Beck lane began at Maryland Route 445 and continued in a Westerly direction, intersecting the Martenet branch and terminating at the Beck homesite close to the shore of the Chesapeake Bay....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">Subsequent to the construction of the Beck lane, it being a newly constructed lane, and the Gale lane being in disrepair, the Martenets began to use the Beck lane for ingress and egress to their property....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Since their purchase of the Martenet/Mangels property in 1963, Plaintiffs have used the Martenet branch and the Beck lane as their sole means of ingress and egress. Plaintiffs have borne the expense of maintaining the Martenet branch and the Beck lane during the time they have used them. The plaintiffs have used the property for residential purposes and for some agriculture and hunting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">Defendants, and their predecessors in title since the conveyance [to them] on November 27, 1937, have acquiesced to Plaintiffs (and Plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors in title) use of the Martenet branch and Beck lane. Plaintiffs\u2019 use and maintenance of this right of way has been with the intention to use the right of way for ingress and egress, but to not interfere with Defendants^] fee simple ownership and use of same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">The aforementioned 30 foot wide strip of land which extends from the Martenet/Mangels property to Maryland Route 445 contains extensive areas of nontidal wetlands and large trees. As can be seen from the plats appended hereto and from the deed description, the first two changes in course for this 30 foot wide strip after leaving Maryland Route 445, shown as \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d on Plat No. 4 appended hereto, contain acute angles. [We have incorporated the relevant portions of the trial court\u2019s plats in our exhibit.] While there is no evidence as to the exact size of the trees or timber on the 30 foot wide strip in 1931, one can infer that the strip was woodland then and the nontidal wetlands existed then as they do today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">Due to the relative narrowness of the 30 foot wide strip, the aforementioned acute angles (\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d), its topography, the \u201cbogs\u201d located therein and the necessary clearing and grubbing operation required for the construction of any new lane thereon, the construction of a lane in 1931, or any time thereafter, would have been extremely expensive. Construction of a lane over this strip today would cost between $200,000.00 and $345,000.00, assuming, arguendo, all wetlands and critical areas permits could be secured. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The present fair market value of Plaintiffs\u2019 property (with proper access) is approximately $675,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">If a roadway or lane could have or could now physically be constructed within the 30 foot wide strip, its shape, width and the aforementioned acute angles, would have and would still limit its use to smaller vehicles. Even in 1931, any longer wheel-based truck such as a moving van, would have been unable to negotiate the curves which would have resulted from the aforementioned two acute angles. Not all fire apparatus would have been able to negotiate the resultant curves in 1931 or thereafter. Modern fire trucks are now wider and longer than those of 1931, modern moving vans are wider and longer than those of 1931 and modern ambulances are wider and longer than those of 1931. Many of these vehicles would now be unable to negotiate a lane constructed only on the aforementioned 30 foot wide strip.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGB\">The trial court then found that the parties had conceded that an easement of necessity was originally created in 1931. As we have said, there is some question as to whether such a concession was made. In any event, the finding stated by the trial court indicates that it found that an easement of necessity had been created. We agree. The law we shall hereafter refer to dictates that result. The court in its opinion then addressed whether the way of necessity had been terminated, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">To determine whether the easement by necessity has been extinguished, we must look at the facts from December 24, 1931 to the present day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">This Court concludes that the conveyance of the thirty foot wide strip on December 24, 1931 from J. Page Gale to the Martenets was insufficient by itself to extinguish the existing easement by necessity. Due to the relative narrowness of the thirty foot wide strip at the acute angles (\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d as shown on Plat No. 4 appended hereto), its topography, and the \u201cbogs\u201d located therein, the thirty foot wide strip has never been a suitable means of access to the Martenet/Mangels property. It would be unreasonable to conclude that the thirty foot wide strip was intended to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the means of access to the public highway when its utilization (were a lane to have been built on it) would preclude access by many vehicles, especially fire and emergency vehicles. This was true in 1931 and has remained the case until today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">Therefore the Court concludes that even if a lane could have been constructed within the thirty foot wide strip at a reasonable expense not out of portion to the value of the land of the Martenet/Mangels property, that said lane would not provide reasonable access to allow full utilization of the land of the Martenet/Mangels property. Reasonable access would be that access required for the dominant estate to make full utilization of its land....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">The Court also concludes that even if an inferior lane or access were constructed it could not have been, nor could it now be, constructed without unreasonable expense out of proportion to the value of the land of the Martenet/Mangels property. Due to the relative narrowness of the thirty foot wide strip, the aforementioned acute angles (\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d), its topography, the \u201cbogs\u201d located therein and the necessary clearing and grubbing operation required for the construction of any new lane thereon, the construction of a lane in 1931, or any time thereafter would have been a vast undertaking and would have required unreasonable expense out of proportion to the value of the land of the Martenet/Mangels property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">Therefore, the easement by necessity created on August 31, 1931 over a portion of the remaining lands of Gresham College has never been extinguished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The court then addressed the location and relation of the easement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">C. Having determined that an easement by necessity exists in favor of the Martenet/Mangles property, what is the <em>present </em>location of such easement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">At the time of the creation of the easement by necessity on August 31, 1931, the Martenet/Mangels property became the dominant estate and the remainder of Gresham College <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>became the servient estate. That relationship has continued to today. The subsequent purchase of the Beck property by William M. Beck, on November 27, 1937, did not change the servient nature of that property. The Bramble property (the Brambles are not joined herein) and the Beck property together comprise the servient estate created on August 31, 1931.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\">Upon the facts of this case it is clear that the owners of both the dominant and servient estates acquiesced in the change of location of a portion of the original easement by necessity from the Gale lane to the Beck lane. The location of that portion of the easement over the Martenet branch [Extension] has never changed. The Court concludes that the owners of the dominant and servient estates consented by their acquiescence to a change in the location of a portion of the easement by necessity from the Gale lane to the Beck lane. The Court finds as a fact that this was a slight change in the location of a portion of the easement, that both the owners of the dominant and servient estates consented to this change and that the change does not invalidate the rights of the persons who are entitled to use the way. [Citation omitted, emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The court then declared that the appellees had a fifteen foot wide easement by necessity, extending 7.5 feet from the center line on each side over the Beck lane and Martenet Extension, and that the appellees also had the non-exclusive right to maintain and repair the easement including the right to maintain drainage, install utility facilities serving their property, and to surface and pave a twelve foot wide portion of the fifteen foot way. The court limited the use of the way to ingress, egress for \u201cresidential purposes, utilities, ... fishing, farming and hunting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The trial court made extensive findings (many of which are included here) and made a declaration that passed upon and adjudicated the issues raised, thus declaring the rights of the parties. We now must determine if it did so correctly. In order to so determine, we must acknowledge the law relating to: (1) easements (ways) of necessity; (2) termination of ways <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>of necessity; (3) relocation of ways of necessity; and (4) the increase in the scope and extent of ways of necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Easements (Ways) of Necessity</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">In a case involving a dispute over the use of two dirt roads over contiguous parcels, the Court of Appeals first noted that a quasi-easement can arise when one owner of two parts of the same property has used one part for the benefit of the other in such a fashion that, if the two parts had been owned by different parties, a presumption of easement could exist. <em>Dalton v. Real Estate and Improvement Co., </em>201 Md. 34, 92 A.2d 585 (1952). The Court of Appeals then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">[T]he doctrine of quasi-easements has been extended to include established ways where they are reasonably necessary to the enjoyment of the property conveyed----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">A distinction has been maintained in the law between implied grants and implied reservations. If an easement is ... necessary to the reasonable enjoyment of the premises granted, it will be implied that the grant included the easement. However, if a grantor intends to reserve any rights ... he must reserve them expressly, and the only exception is of easements, including ways, of actual, strict necessity----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">If, however, there is a simultaneous conveyance ... of both the serviently and dominantly used parts of land, the more liberal implied grant rule applies and not the more strict implied reservation test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 46-47, 92 A.2d 585. <em>See also Zimmerman v.

Oletsky, </em>280 Md. 355, 360-61, 373 A.2d 1234 (1977), though primarily concerned with a <em>reserved </em>way of necessity, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">Judge Charles C.

The Court of Appeals held in a later case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABe\">There has been some confusion in some of the cases because they have not distinguished between <em>implied grants </em>of easements and <em>implied </em>reservations.... The reason for sustaining implied grants is apparent as \u201ca grantor shall not derogate from his grant,\u201d and when he intends to limit, restrict or burden the use of property conveyed ... for the benefit of property retained, he should express his intention in language that is not easily misunderstood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\"><em>Eliason v.

They are: <em>Condry v. Laurie, </em>184 Md. 317, 41 A.2d 66 (1945) <em>(Condry </em>I) and <em>Condry v. Laurie, </em>186 Md. 194, 46 A.2d 196 (1946) <em>(Condry II). </em>The Lauries were the interior property owners (the dominant tenants) who claimed access to a public road over the property of Condry (the servient tenant). In <em>Condry I, </em>they first claimed a way by prescription by tacking on the use of their predecessor in title\u2014the Hittles. The Court of Appeals rejected that claim, stating \u201cthe Hittles used the private road for more than twenty years in pursuance of a license, and therefore did not acquire a prescriptive right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>184 Md. at 321, 41 A.2d 66. It went on to note, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The chancellor granted an injunction commanding defendants to remove the obstruction.... He based his decree ... on ... a way of necessity.... The doctrine is based upon public policy, which is favorable to full utilization of land and the presumption that parties do not intend to render land unfit for occupancy.... \u201cBut this way of necessity, is a way of new creation by operation of law, and is only provisional; for it is only brought into existence from the necessities of the estate granted, and continues to exist only so long as there may be a necessity for its use. If, therefore, the grantee acquires a new way ... the way of necessity is thereby extinguished.\u201d [Quoting from <em>Oliver v.

Miller, </em>52 Md.App. 108, 447 A.2d 109 (1982). <em>Condry I </em>was remanded for the trial court to determine whether yet another alternate right-of-way was available to the Lauries. In <em>Condry II </em>the court accepted the lower court\u2019s findings that a road over the Lauries\u2019 own property would cost $651.75, and that even if the Lauries had the right to use the \u201calternate road,\u201d it would cost between $1,000 to $2,000 to reopen it and another $400 to build a bridge over a stream. The court noted that the cost and present value of the Laurie property was $435. The Court of Appeals then held: \u201c[T]he cost of constructing a road, other than the one in dispute ... would be out of proportion to the value of the land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>$435, and therefore ... a way of necessity exists to the appellees\u2019 land.\u201d <em>Condry II, </em>186 Md. at 199, 46 A.2d 196. <em>See also Greenwalt v.

In <em>Mullins, </em>the dominant owner\u2019s property abutted a public road and the area was flat terrain similar to the proposed way of necessity. Thus, unreasonable expenses would not be incurred in constructing an alternate way.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Court in <em>Hancock v. Henderson, </em>236 Md. 98, 104-05, 202 A.2d 599 (1964), opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">[T]he [initial] necessity must be determined from the conditions as they existed at the time of the conveyance.... The theory is that such an easement, being appurtenant, passes with each conveyance to subsequent grantees. Hence a remote grantee of land not being used at the time of severance may nevertheless, when the use becomes necessary to the enjoyment of his property, claim the easement under his remote deed.... This rule is consonant with the generally held view that non-use alone is not sufficient to extinguish a way of necessity____ [Citations omitted, emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">North Carolina is one foreign jurisdiction that has addressed this issue. The North Carolina appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">[T]he owner of the servient estate has the right to select the location of a way of necessity.

Greco, </em>69 N.C.App. 739, 318 S.E.2d 335, 339-40 (1984). Likewise, in <em>Beeson v.

Hence this brings about a termination of his easement of necessity....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The trial judge in the case <em>sub judice </em>found that the unimproved thirty foot strip of wilderness land acquired over the original grantor\u2019s southern boundary was not susceptible to egress/ingress in 1931, or now, because of the peculiar layout of the tract and its wilderness, <em>i.e., </em>forested, wetland character. Judge Price further found that the cost of constructing a road along the thirty foot strip would be out of proportion to the value of the dominant estate. Reviewing the evidence, we note that a Mr. Rodney Schwarm was qualified as an expert in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permitting process and wetlands delineation. On appeal, no objection to his qualifications are presented. He testified that the thirty foot wide parcel was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>a matrix of wetlands and upland areas. Every depression in that soil ... is a nontidal wetlands____ [I]t\u2019s.going to require permits to cross a number of small nontidal wetlands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">Within the forested area ... close to <em>% </em>of the right-of-way was wetlands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">... He would have to apply for a permit ... through the Army Corps of Engineers, ... the Maryland Department of the Environment, ... the Maryland Department of Natural Resources ..., the Kent County Planning and Zoning [for the part within the critical area] ... you would have to be able to provide mitigation for it as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">... [T]hey are going to require 2 to 1 mitigation\u20142 acres for every acre that you are going to disturb....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">... [I]t will come up to 2.27 acres of disturbance, which would require 4.54 acres of mitigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Currently, to construct a road over the 3.497 acre strip of land would require 6.81 acres of area\u20142.27 + 4.54 or more. Thus, if only the 30 foot wide strip is used, it would be presently impossible to accommodate the requirements of the road on site.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Mr. Schwarm also testified that the cost for the preparation of a mitigation plan for a way constructed over the thirty foot tract would be approximately $10,000. He testified that he would charge $65 per hour for these additional services.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">Mr. Baines was qualified as an expert in civil engineering. He testified that he was retained to conduct a feasibility study on whether a right-of-way over the thirty foot tract could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>constructed that could safely accommodate vehicles, including emergency vehicles. Using basic guidelines, he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHJ\">The outside turning radius of a passenger vehicle is ... 24 feet ... [with an] inside radius of 15 feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">... [A] truck or a small bus ... has an outside turning radius of 42 with an inside of 28 ... a travelway at the corner\u2019s minimum width would be required of approximate 17 feet....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">... [F]ire truck[s] ... have an outside turning radius of about 44 feet and an inside ... of about 28 feet. So it\u2019s quite apparent that a[n] ... area, larger than a 7 or 8 foot wide gravel road, would be necessary to gain access....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">... [Y]ou would have to have ... 12 to 15 foot minimum for a paving area. Additionally ... you should have areas to pull off [for] a vehicle coming in, a vehicle going out type situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">... [A] tandem axle trailer [with] a 50 foot wheel base ... is your typical ... tractor and trailer or a moving van type situation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">... [T]he outside turning radius of ... a tractor and trailer [is] 46, the inside turning radius [is] 5$.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">... [A] simple tractor trailer type rig ... can not [sic] make the corner without going off the [30 foot] right-of-way area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">As a result of the investigation of the ... 30 foot area itself, it appears that it is insufficient to support access to the property in any acceptable manner.... The State Highway Administration ... will only accept a[n] entrance ... with a range of from 70 to 110 degrees. This areas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>enters the state highway at approximately 140 degrees.... [I]n my opinion it is a[n] unsafe intersection onto the state highway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">He then testified that while fire trucks of today are probably wider and longer than they were in 1931, tractor/trailer rigs have \u201creally not changed in that period of time.... [T]hey are basically the same design criteria.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Mr. Luff was qualified as an expert to testify as to the costs associated with engineering, surveying, and associated design work for constructing a right-of-way over the thirty foot strip. He testified that the design work would cost approximately $18,950.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Mr. Myers was qualified as an expert in the design and construction layout of roads. He testified that it would be \u201cimpossible and impractical\u201d to construct a driveway on the thirty foot strip and that construction easements would have to be obtained from neighbors in order to accommodate the equipment necessary to build the road.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In discussing the sharp angles in the road, he noted \u201cthe raises would be so short that most vehicles, other than the real small cars today, would not be able to negotiate.\u201d He further testified that the entrance to the state highway from the strip could not meet state guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Mr. Lindstrom, a contractor, was qualified as an expert in road construction and its cost. Basing his estimates on a fifteen-foot road within the thirty foot strip, he estimated that constructing the road would cost $345,000,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> plus the cost of the wetlands, engineering, etc. He testified that mitigation costs would be approximately $78,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Based upon the evidence we have mentioned, and that contained in the record but not specifically mentioned, we hold that Judge Price was correct in finding that the thirty foot strip of land was insufficient for reasonable access to the dominant estate of appellees, and that even if it were sufficient the costs and problems associated with opening up the right-of-way would be out of all reasonable proportion to the value of the dominant estate. He did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Relocation of Ways of Necessity</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In <em>Hanley v.

We noted evidence indicating that garbage trucks could only get through the baffle gates by opening them, that some fire apparatus had difficulty traversing past the baffle gates, and that some fire apparatus could not traverse the land even if the baffles were not present. <em>Id. </em>There was also evidence that the baffle gates were warranted by the traffic situation on the right-of-way.

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">And see where the Virginia court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-14\">\u201cThe kind of way, and the sort of and quantity of traffic over it are to be determined by the reasonable necessities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>for the enjoyment of the land---- [T]he limits of the way are to be determined simply by the needs of the land at the time of the creation of the way, <em>but </em>the scope of the way may increase to meet the increased necessities of the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-6\"><em>Keen v. Paragon Jewel Coal Co., </em>203 Va. 175, 122 S.E.2d 543, 546 (1961) (quoting Ribbel, <em>Minor on Real Property, </em>2d Ed., Vol. 1, \u00a7 98 at 134) (emphasis added). <em>See also Lease v. Doll, </em>485 Pa. 615, 403 A.2d 558, 563 (1979); <em>Wagoner v. Jack\u2019s Creek Coal Corp., </em>199 Va. 741, 101 S.E.2d 627 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">We hold that the scope of ingress/egress ways of necessity may reasonably increase with the dominant estate\u2019s necessary and reasonable needs as those needs exist, present and future. We further hold that the trial court\u2019s establishment of Beck lane as being fifteen feet wide and its declaration that the lane could be paved and maintained by appellees reflects the current needs of the dominant estate owned by appellees. We note that there was testimony by Mr. Lindstrom that he had, in the past, inspected Beck lane (and apparently done improvement and maintenance work on it). He testified that the improved portion was twelve to thirteen feet in width and that the total right-of-way was even then fifteen feet. If so, that width was already established prior to Judge Price\u2019s opinion, which, in any event, we hold was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">In addressing the four issues we framed in this opinion, we have addressed all issues necessary to resolve the remaining questions in the case, whether those questions are specifically framed in our resolutions. Accordingly, we do not deem it necessary to address the issues further. We shall affirm Judge Price\u2019s declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-11\">. Pauline G. Hand died on February 23, 1933. Pauline H. Hess, Dorothy Griffin, and Ruth Shivery are the co-personal representatives of her estate. We shall generally refer to all the appellants as \u201cBeck.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-9\">. Generally, in this region of the state \"branch\u201d refers to an extension of a waterway. We thus shall hereafter refer to this roadway as an \"extension\u201d rather than a \u201cbranch.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b191-9\">. The trial judge in his opinion referred to it as fifteen feet southerly of the center line of Gale lane. As we are holding that the way has been relocated, the exact location of the center line of Gale lane is of no importance in our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b192-13\">. The index to the extract and appendix does not indicate that appellants\u2019 answer is included therein. We have not found it there. In any event, we presume they opposed the declaration below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[5]\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\">5. In the issues presented in their brief and during oral argument, appellants indicated that they had not necessarily so agreed. We shall, accordingly, address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b204-14\">. We acknowledge that the authorities can authorize mitigation off site. That has no bearing on whether this thirty foot strip can suffice for access.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b206-11\">. Easements would be necessitated because an area wider than the road being constructed is required in the construction process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b206-12\">. Additionally, because no area owned by appellees is adjacent along the strip, all debris generated would have to be removed over the 30 foot strip, <em>i.e., </em>midway in the strip debris would have to be moved a half mile one way or the other\u2014to the highway and thence to a disposal site or alternately a half mile to Mangels's other property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b210-11\">. We note that in <em>Sibbel, </em>a case involving an express reservation of an undescribed right-of-way, the location of which was firmly established by long usage, the Court observed that \u201cthe same principles with reference to the location of a way of necessity and the location of a way reserved in general terms are applicable.\u201d The owner of the servient estate in <em>Sibbel, </em>the original grantee, later conveyed part of the property, over which about fifty feet of the established way ran, to the appellants\u2019 predecessor in title, retaining the land traversed by the greater part of the established right-of-way. When appellants built a new road or driveway, the owners of the easement used it instead of the old way, and then claimed that their permissive use had accomplished a change of location of their right-of-way. The Court stated that the appellants were not the owners of the servient tenement (except as to about fifty feet, about which there was no dispute) and that their grant of permission to use their driveway did not constitute an agreement to the relocation of the right-of-way from the servient tenement to their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">We need not determine whether the holding or the language in <em>Sibbel, </em>where the right-of-way was created by express reservation, would apply with respect to relocation of a right-of-way of necessity. Since that issue was not initially timely raised below and was neither presented as an issue nor argued on appeal, we shall not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
