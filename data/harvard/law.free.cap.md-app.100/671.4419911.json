Mrs. Pagani\u2019s job description included preparing time cards, filing, invoicing, answering the phone, and doing the bank deposits. Specifically, Ms. Alexander <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>testified that Mrs. Pagani was instructed to \u201cpull the pink paper [MIFCO\u2019s copy of the invoice] ... mark it paid with the check number, and the date on it, then stamp the back of the check with the Maryland Industrial Finishing stamp, with the address and phone number, and also to use the for deposit only [stamp], and make up the deposit slip.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Beginning around June 23, 1989, Mrs. Pagani started depositing checks made out to MIFCO into checking account number 353-7219 at Citizens (this account was titled in both Mr. and Mrs. Pagani\u2019s names). At trial, Mrs. Pagani noted that almost \u201c90 percent\u201d of the time she used a drive-thru window to make the deposits. Mrs. Pagani undertook this deception by first typing \u201cMIFCO\u201d onto a blank deposit slip upon which she wrote her own account number. She then endorsed the checks with MIFCO\u2019s stamp and submitted the \u201cMIFCO\u201d deposit slip with the check for deposit to her account with Citizens. Apparently, Citizens failed to detect this scheme. Mrs. Pagani along with her husband, Michael Pagani, allegedly utilized the embezzled funds to pay for their household, automobile, insurance expenses, and a vacation to Florida. Ms. Alexander discovered the defalcation sometime in February, 1990. MIFCO then brought an action against Citizens and Mr. and Mrs. Pagani alleging negligence, conversion, unjust enrichment, and constructive trust. Judgment was entered against Mrs. Pagani in the amount of $35,683.70 in compensatory damages and $10,000.00 in punitive damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Citizens made a motion for judgment, which the trial court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On appeal, MIFCO asks us the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">1. Did the trial court err in not finding a conversion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">2. Did the trial court err in requiring expert testimony from the plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>3. Should the trial court have awarded pre-judgment interest?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Scope of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In the instant case, Citizens\u2019 motion for judgment was granted at the conclusion of the appellant\u2019s case. In <em>Pahanish v. Western Trails, Inc., </em>69 Md.App. 342, 353, 517 A.2d 1122 (1986), we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">[i]n a <em>non-jury </em>trial, when a party has moved for judgment, the court is allowed as trier of fact to determine the facts and render judgment thereon. The trial judge is not compelled to make any evidentiary inferences whatsoever in favor of the party against whom the motion for judgment is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">(Emphasis in the original). <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-519(b) (1994). In the case sub judice, however, the trial court granted the motion for judgment because it did not agree with MIFCO\u2019s assertion that Mrs. Pagani\u2019s unauthorized indorsement was the functional equivalent of a \u201cforged indorsement\u201d under CL \u00a7 3-419(l)(c). Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s judgment to ascertain whether it was legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">1. <em>Conversion Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in granting Citizens\u2019 motion for judgment because an \u201cunauthorized indorsement <em>is </em>a forged indorsement.\u201d Citizens agrees with the proposition that to sustain a claim for conversion, it must be demonstrated that it paid checks with \u201cforged indorsements.\u201d <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 3\u2014419(l)(c). Citizens, however, posits that we do not need to address the issue of whether an instrument is converted when it is paid on an unauthorized endorsement because Mrs. Pagani had the authority to endorse the instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">a. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">It is axiomatic that a payee whose signature is forged can successfully maintain a conversion action against the drawee (bank) for paying funds upon that forged endorsement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>Mid-Atlantic Tennis Cts. v. Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>658 F.Supp. 140, 143 (D.Md.1987). We, thus, clarify that this is not a contract action. Our analysis is focused solely on the tort of conversion. <em>See Levin v. Union Nat'l Bank, </em>224 Md. 603, 607, 168 A.2d 889 (1961) (\u201cThe cases also recognize that the payee whose signature is forged would have a conversion action against the drawee, but not a contract action, for paying funds upon an instrument bearing his forged indorsement.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"AaA\">The Court of Appeals explained the tort of conversion in <em>National Union Bank v. Miller Rubber Co., </em>148 Md. 449, 457, 129 A. 688 (1925) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\">\u201cIf a negotiable instrument having a forged indorsement come to the hands of a bank and is collected by it, the proceeds are held for the rightful owners of the paper, and may be recovered from them, although the bank gave value for the paper, or has paid over the proceeds to the party depositing the instrument for collection.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ace\">Currently, conversion is defined at CL \u00a7 3\u2014419(l)(e), (3) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">(1) An instrument is converted when</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">ijs # <em>if: </em>:}! sjt</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">(c) It is paid on a forged indorsement \u201e</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>(3) Subject to the provisions of Titles 1 through 10 of this article concerning restrictive indorsements a representative, including a depositary or collecting bank, who has in good faith and in accordance with the reasonable commercial standards applicable to the business of such representative dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one who was not the true owner is not liable in conversion or otherwise to the true owner beyond the amount of any proceeds remaining in his hands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><em>But see C.S. Bowen Co. v. Maryland Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>36 Md.App. 26, 37-38, 373 A.2d 30 (1977) (listing several defenses available in a conversion action).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">MIFCO asserts that the evidence presented during the trial established that Mrs. Pagani endorsed \u201cchecks made payable to MIFCO with a rubber stamp provided to her and then put her own account number on the check and deposited the checks in her own account at Citizens.\u201d MIFCO explains that Mrs. Pagani\u2019s duties included making bank deposits into MIF-CO accounts by endorsing the checks with the MIFCO stamp, that contained MIFCO\u2019s address and phone number, and a \u201cfor deposit only\u201d stamp. Mrs. Alexander specifically testified that Mrs. Pagani was instructed to use both the stamps and then make the deposits into MIFCO accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The trial court specifically found that Mrs. Pagani\u2019s actions were not a forgery because she was authorized to endorse the checks with the MIFCO stamp. In so concluding, the court summarized its understanding of the case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">[T]he number of the account was only put on the deposit slip. If the procedure used was to put the number of the account on the check as part of the signature, and that number somehow was modified, or altered, or changed or something, you might have an argument. But that was never on the check. All that ever showed on the check was, one, <em>the name of the company, which was used as the endorsement, </em>and two, for deposit only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">(Emphasis added). We conclude that the trial court erred in its analysis and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>b. Other jurisdictions</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">In <em>Matco Tools Corp. v. Pontiac State Bank, </em>614 F.Supp. 1059 (E.D.Mich.1985) the court addressed whether a payee of a negotiable instrument could bring an action against the depository bank for accepting the instrument over an unauthorized endorsement. On the issue of the endorsement, the Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">[t]he parties seriously dispute whether any endorsement on the check can be considered \u201cforged.\u201d Matco clearly gave Cox authority to endorse checks from customers. Travelers, however, was not a customer of Cox. [U.C.C.] Section 3-401(2) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">A signature is made by use of any name, including any trade name or assumed name, upon an instrument, or by any word or mark used in lieu of a written signature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">Here, the check bore an endorsement stamp bearing the words \u201cMatco Tools.\u201d This suffices as Matco\u2019s signature under section 3^401(2). Section 1-201(43) defines an unauthorized signature to mean \u201cone made without actual, implied or apparent authority and includes a forgery.\u201d Conversely, a signature which is authorized is not a forgery. It is clear that Cox had no express authority to endorse the check on behalf of Matco because Travelers, the drawer of the check, was not a customer of Cox.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1062 (citations omitted). The Court then effectively concluded that the bank had converted the instrument because it \u201cdeposited the check in the account of DMC Enterprises over the unauthorized endorsement of Matco.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court further opined that the bank\u2019s assertion that \u201cnothing on the face of the check put it on notice that Cox was acting beyond the scope of his authority\u201d was relevant to the issue of whether it had acted in a commercially reasonable manner. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Numerous other jurisdictions have held that the term \u201cforgery,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in their respective equivalent <em>of CL \u00a7 </em>3-419, is applicable to unauthorized endorsements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See generally, Equitable Life Assur.

Van Norman, </em>513 Pa. 572, 522 A.2d 503, 507 (1987). Thus, as in the case of a forgery, when a bank accepts an instrument with an unauthorized endorsement, it has exercised \u201cdominion and control over the instrument inconsistent with the rights of the owner, and results in liability for conversion.\u201d 2A <em>West\u2019s Unif. Laws Ann., </em>Unif. Comm.Code, Off. com. 3 to \u00a7 3\u2014119, p. 341 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">We find the reasoning of these cases and other authorities to be persuasive on this point and conclude that CL \u00a7 3-419(l)(c) is applicable in instances of unauthorized endorsement. CL \u00a7 3-202(1) explains that an instrument<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is negotiated by \u201cthe transfer of an instrument in such form that the transferee becomes a holder. If the instrument is payable to order it is negotiated by delivery with any necessary indorsement.\u201d Thus, a check drawn to the order of the payee, MIFCO, may not be negotiated without the payee\u2019s indorsement. A holder is one who receives an instrument that is \u201cissued or indorsed to him or his order\u201d or in blank. CL \u00a7 1-201(20). Citizens cannot be a holder or holder in due course, CL \u00a7 3-302, without MIFCO\u2019s valid indorsement. An unau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>thorized signature (or indorsement)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by a forger does not operate as the true payee\u2019s signature because CL \u00a7 3-404(1) provides \u201c[a]ny unauthorized signature is wholly inoperative as that of the person whose name is signed unless he ratifies it or is precluded from denying it.\u201d In William D. Hawkland &amp; Lary Lawrence, 4 <em>Uniform Commercial Code Series, </em>\u00a7 3-404:01, 633-37, the authors explain that an \u201cunauthorized indorsement will not operate to negotiate the instrument.\u201d (footnotes omitted). Thus, the transferee of an instrument with a forged or unauthorized indorsement (i.e., Citizens) does not become a holder or a holder in due course because there can be no negotiation of an instrument with an unauthorized signature. Only a holder or her agent may properly present the instrument for payment. CL \u00a7 3-504(1). CL \u00a7 4-401 states that a \u201cbank may charge [a customer] ... any item which is otherwise <em>properly </em>payable.\u201d (Emphasis added). White and Summers, 1 <em>Uniform Commercial Code, </em>\u00a7 15-3, 751-52 (3rd ed. 1988), explain that \u201csection 4-401 authorizes the drawee bank to charge to its customer\u2019s account items \u2018properly payable\u2019 and by negative implication denies the drawee bank the right to charge amounts not properly payable.\u201d They further explain that \u201c[i]n the case of an order instrument, forgery precludes negotiation, so that no subsequent transferee can be a holder under Article Three; accordingly, no payment can be proper since only a holder can make proper presentment and receive payment.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 879 (footnotes omitted). Thus, the key issue in this case is the extent of Mrs. Pagani\u2019s authority because \u201c[a]n unauthorized signa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>ture may be a forgery or a signature by an agent in excess of his actual or apparent authority. No distinction is made between forgeries and unauthorized signatures by agents.\u201d William D. Hawkland &amp; Lary Lawrence, 4 <em>Uniform Commercial Code Series, </em>\u00a7 3-404:01, 633 (footnotes omitted). We now turn to ascertain the scope of Mrs. Pagani\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">c. Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">It is clear that negotiation of order paper requires the authorized signature of the named payee. CL \u00a7 3-202(l)(2). Accordingly, in order to avoid liability, Citizens asserts that, because Mrs. Pagani was expressly authorized to endorse checks payable to MIFCO and deposit them in MIFCO\u2019s account, she was authorized to make the deposits into her personal account. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In <em>Taylor v. Equitable Trust Co., </em>269 Md. 149, 156, 304 A.2d 838 (1973), the Court of Appeals noted that \u201cthe power to sign for another may be expressly given, or may be implied, or may rest on apparent authority: otherwise, the signature would be unauthorized under \u00a7 1-201(43).\u201d Chief Judge Bond, speaking for the Court, in <em>Atlantic Trust Co. v. Subscribers, etc., </em>150 Md. 470, 475-76, 133 A. 319 (1926), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">The controlling rule is that a principal can be bound by the acts of another as agent only so far as he, the principal, has empowered or permitted the other to represent him; and if the banker has been misled by an appearance of authority not known and acquiesced in by the principal, and so has accepted unauthorized endorsements, the banker is answerable for the loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">In the instant case, it is uncontroverted that Mrs. Pagani\u2019s duties were to open MIFCO\u2019s mail, receive customer\u2019s checks, endorse the checks received with the address stamp and the \u201cfor deposit stamp\u201d, fill out MIFCO\u2019s deposit slip, deposit the checks into MIFCO\u2019s accounts at Citizens, and reconcile MIF-CO\u2019s bank statement. Mrs. Pagani was further instructed to file a duplicate copy of the deposit slip with MIFCO\u2019s pink copies of the invoice. There is, however, absolutely no evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>dence to indicate that Mrs. Pagani\u2019s authority extended to making deposits into her personal account. To the contrary, Mrs. Pagani specifically stated that she had not been given \u201cpermission to deposit any of MIFCO\u2019s checks into any other account than MIFCO\u2019s.\u201d This was corroborated by Ms. Alexander. Accordingly, we conclude that the uncontradicted evidence demonstrates that Mrs. Pagani\u2019s authority was limited to making deposits into the corporate account only.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">We further note that our decision is consistent with other jurisdictions that, either explicitly or implicitly, have concluded that an employee who had the authority to endorse checks for deposit into the employer\u2019s account was \u201cunauthorized\u201d to do so in other accounts. For example, in <em>Oswald, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at 1238, 13 Cal.Rptr.2d 193, the defendant, a bookkeeper, opened two separate checking accounts in two banks with a name similar to that of his employer. He then obtained a deposit-endorsement stamp that he utilized to endorse the checks into the two accounts. After the defalcation was discovered, the employer brought suit against the two banks alleging conversion. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the banks because \u201cthere was no triable issue of material fact as to whether the endorsements stamped on the misappropriated checks were \u2018forgeries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1243, 13 Cal.Rptr.2d 193. The appellate court reversed by first concluding that an unauthorized indorsement was actionable as a \u201cforged endorsement\u201d under the California equivalent of CL \u00a7 3-419. The Court then analyzed the defendant\u2019s scope of authority and concluded that summary judgment was improvidently granted since (1) the defendant \u201chad no authority to open accounts\u201d in the employer\u2019s name, (2) the defendant was \u201cnever authorized to obtain or use the endorsement stamps for those accounts\u201d, (3) the defendant\u2019s \u201cauthority with respect to the company\u2019s incoming checks was limited to endorsing them in the true name of the corporation\u201d for deposit into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>employer\u2019s accounts. <em>Id. </em>at 1247, <em>13 </em>Cal.Rptr.2d 193. <em>See also Confederate Welding, </em>458 So.2d at 1374-75 (holding that the authority to endorse for deposit did not include authority to affix corporation\u2019s endorsement for purpose of depositing to president\u2019s personal account); <em>Grosberg v. Michigan Bank-Oakland, </em>420 Mich. 707, 362 N.W.2d 715, 719 (1984) (\u201cWe accept as given the trial court\u2019s finding that Goldman had <em>actual </em>authority to [e]ndorse and deposit incoming checks only in the account maintained by Grosberg at Manufacturers National Bank, and not in the account opened by Goldman at defendant bank.\u201d) (Emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">2. <em>Expert Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">MIFCO asserts that the court erred in imposing upon it the burden of proof under CL \u00a7 3-419. Specifically, MIF-CO contends that \u201conce a conversion has been established via an unauthorized indorsement it is [Citizens\u2019] burden to establish that it acted in \u2018accordance with the reasonable commercial standards.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Dominion Construction, Inc. v. First National Bank of Maryland, </em>271 Md. 154, 166-67, 315 A.2d 69 (1974) (explaining when a bank has acted in accordance with reasonable commercial standards.) In this respect, we agree. CL \u00a7 3-419(3) delineates an affirmative defense available to a defendant-bank once the plaintiff has established that the \u201cinstrument is converted\u201d under CL \u00a7 3-149(l)(c). In as much as the court erred in its decision on whether MIFCO had established conversion by Citizens, at the new trial, Citizens will have the burden of establishing that it dealt with the instrument \u201cin good faith and in accordance with the reasonable commercial standards.\u201d CL \u00a7 3-419(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">3. <em>Pre-judgment interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">MIFCO also asserts that the court erred in not awarding prejudgment interest. Although that issue is not properly before us, there having been no judgment entered against Citizens, should the trial court find for MIFCO against Citizens, then legal interest should run to the date of the verdict. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number><em>Abbott v.

In the criminal law arena, forgery is \"comprised of essentially three elements. First, there must be a writing which is the proper subject of forgery. Secondly, this writing must be false. Finally, the writing must have been rendered false with intent to defraud.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>283 Md. 86, 90, 388 A.2d 122 (1978). <em>See also </em>Article 27, \u00a7 44(a) (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol. &amp; Supp.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b719-5\">. The Code does not define \"forgery.\u201d Instead, it explains what an unauthorized signature or indorsement is as \"one made without actual, implied or apparent authority and includes a forgeiy.\u201d CL \u00a7 1-201(43). Professor Thomas M. Quinn explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\u201cForged\" is a term in common use and carries a familiar content. The law on forgeries is contained, in part, in the Code. What may come as a surprise to many, however, is that the Code uses the term \"forged\u201d only rarely. The preferred Code terminology is \"unauthorized signature.\u201d The ugly reality of forgery, if you will, is clothed in singularly neutral terminology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">There is a reason for the change. The term \u201cunauthorized signature\u201d includes not only the crude forgeiy commonly associated with one who, for example steals and signs a check but also a wide range of other signings. Thus, even where there has been no theft and where the signing is well intentioned, it may still be \u201cunauthorized.\u201d The term \u201cunauthorized signature,\u201d to quote the drafters, \u201cincludes both a forgery and a signature made by an agent exceeding his actual or apparent authority.\u201d (Official Comment No. 1 to 3-404.) The effect of either type of signing, however, is the same. Thus, whether the signature affixed is a rank forgery of the grossest sort or merely an agent\u2019s signing without adequate authority, the unauthorized signature is \"wholly inoperative as that of the person whose name is signed unless he ratifies it or is precluded from denying it....\u201d (3-404(1).) Both types of signings, therefore, are equally valueless as the signature of the named party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">The importance of this information lies in the fact that the rules that apply to \"unauthorized signatures\u201d normally operate in the same way for both types of signings. The point bears emphasis, since it is likely to be at variance with the common misconception that a crude forgery is so different from the signing by an agent without authority that the applicable legal rules, even under the Code, must be miles apart. [19 UCCLL 7 (Sept. 1985).] They aren\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Thomas M.
