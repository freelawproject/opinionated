(Pier One) is from a decision of the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County affirming a Final Decision of the Department of National Resources (DNR), appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">On October 22, 1990, DNR issued a Site Complaint alleging that \u201cnon-water dependent structures, including a storage shed and gas pumps were constructed, and or placed on a floating pier, adjacent to the marina inlet.\u201d The complaint further alleged that this activity was in violation of Md.Code (1974, 1990 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-104(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Natural Resources Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint was later amended by deleting the reference to the gas pumps and sought only removal of the dockmaster\u2019s office!</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">Section' 9-104(c) reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>(c) Permits\u2014(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may not issue a permit under this title for any project involving the construction of a dwelling unit or other <em>non-water </em>dependent structure on a pier located on private wetlands. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Pier One operates the Pier One Marina located on Kent Island south of the southeast end of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, between U.S. Route 50 and the Bay Bridge Commercial Airport. The site consists of approximately 47 acres. Situated near the entrance to the marina is floating pier \u201cA,\u201d which contains three fuel pumps, a sewage pumpout facility, and a 10' by 18' enclosed structure known as the \u201cdockmaster\u2019s office.\u201d That structure is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Pier One purchased the marina in 1986 and, during 1986, received final site plan approval from Queen Anne\u2019s County to permit the expansion of the marina basin from nine acres to fifteen acres. DNR issued a wetlands permit authorizing the expansion. According to appellant, and not disputed by appellee, included with the permit for the project issued by DNR were drawings of pilings, piers, and slips to be constructed within the expanded marina basin. Again, according to appellant, because the placement of pilings, piers, and slips did not constitute a dredge or fill activity within DNR\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction, the permit did not refer to the pilings, piers, and slips.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In September 1990, Pier One placed two gas pumps, a pump-out facility, and a dockmaster\u2019s office on the deck of Pier \u201cA.\u201d Activities to be conducted from the dockmaster\u2019s office include monitoring vessel traffic within the marina basin, providing fuel to boaters, sanitary sewage pump-out facility operations, and other marina services. Because the dock-master services the gas pumps and oversees the pump-out facility, the office is located adjacent to those operations. In addition, the dockmaster\u2019s office houses electrical shut-off switches for the fuel pumps, the emergency master shut-off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>switch for fuel flow from the tanks located on shore, and containment booms and absorbent pads for oil or gas spills.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">On October 22, 1990, DNR issued a site complaint, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">Mr. Bingham found that between April 19, 1990 and the date of this Order, that dredging had occurred without a valid wetland license in tidal wetlands at or adjacent to your property known as Pier One Marina, in Queen Anne\u2019s County, Maryland. This is in violation of Title 9-202(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland 1990 Replacement Volume. Between April 19, 1990 and the date of this Order, it was also found that non-water dependent structures, including a storage shed and gas pumps were constructed and or placed on a floating pier, adjacent to the marina inlet. This is in violation of Title 9-104(b) of the Annotated Code of Maryland 1990 Replacement Volume.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Initially, at the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), heard on February 28, 1991, the parties stipulated that the wetlands at issue are private wetlands. Mr. Bingham, the inspector who issued the citation, testified before the ALJ, and it is clear that he issued the complaint pursuant to \u00a7 9-104(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Before the ALJ, the DNR argued that the structure in question was a non-water dependent structure, and that \u00a7 9-104 provides the basis for the complaint. Appellant argued that the structure was, in fact, a water dependent structure and, as such, \u00a7 9-104 was inapplicable. In addition, appellant pointed out that COMAR Regulation 08.05.07.03(c) permits certain structures to be built without notice to DNR. These structures include walkways, footbridges, duckblinds, docks, boathouses, boat shelters, and other similar structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">In her decision, rendered on May 16, 1991, the ALJ stated that a telephonic prehearing conference was held on January 31, 1991, at which time the scope of the hearing was narrowed to the dockmaster\u2019s office, the non-water dependent uses having been removed from the premises. In addition, in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>findings of fact, the ALJ found that the drawings associated with the 1991 Wetlands permit show the dockmaster\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In her conclusions of law, she noted that \u00a7 9-303 was amended in 1989. \u201cOf special significance to the instant case, the General Assembly specifically provided at that time:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u2018[T]he exemptions from certain permit requirements provided by this Act may not be construed as applying to the construction of a dwelling unit or structure on a pier, wharf, dock, walkway, bulkhead, breakwater, pile or other similar structure.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">1989 Md.Laws Ch. 691, Section 2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The ALJ found that the construction of a structure on a pier is subject to the Department\u2019s permitting requirements and found that, because appellant did not obtain a permit, it violated \u00a7\u00a7 9-104 and 9-301 <em>et seq. </em>The ALJ subsequently found that the dockmaster\u2019s office was a water dependent structure and recommended that the site complaint be withdrawn. On May 30, 1991, both Pier One and DNR filed exceptions to the Recommended Decision. The matter was then reviewed by the Director of the Water Resources Administration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Director\u2019s Final Decision rejected the ALJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>recommendations and found that the site complaint was properly issued pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 9-104 and 9-306.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The Director found that \u00a7 9-104 \u201csubjected structures on docks to regulatory review under the Natural Resources Article Title 9 which became effective July 1,1989.\u201d The Director concurred with the ALJ in finding that \u00a7 9-104 subjected construction of the dockmaster\u2019s office to regulatory review, but disagreed with her recommendation that the complaint be dismissed. The Director found that the question of water dependency should be addressed on a case by case basis, and, therefore, appellant could only come into compliance by obtaining a permit or removing the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The Director\u2019s order is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">Pier One shall either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">a) within 30 days from the date of this Decision and Order, apply for a permit under Natural Resources Article, \u00a7 9-306, for authorization to leave the dockmaster\u2019s office on the dock, which authorization will be granted only if the Tidal Wetlands Division of this Administration determines that the dockmaster\u2019s office is a water dependent structure; or b) if no application is made within 30 days, remove the dockmaster\u2019s office within 45 days of the date of this Decision and Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">The matter proceeded on appeal to the circuit court, and, after a full presentation of legal arguments on December 16, 1992, the circuit court held, in an oral opinion issued the same day, that the issue was very narrow: \u201cthat issue being simply whether or not the Director was correct when she concluded that she had jurisdiction with respect to what was on the piers.\u201d In this regard the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">I cannot read 9-306(a) in any other manner than saying that any person proposing to conduct on any wetland an activity not authorized by the regulations, and those regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>relate to dredging, filling, removing or otherwise altering or polluting private wetlands, under the provisions of 9-302, shall apply for a permit with the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">Now, the appellant reads 9-302 as very sweeping and setting the authority, the entire scope of the authority of the Department. I simply don\u2019t read it that way. Those are regulations which relate to one aspect of what might take place on State wetlands\u2014one, and one only. Well, they are related. Actually, there\u2019s one, two, three\u2014three specific\u2014 dredging, filling and removing, and then, or otherwise altering or polluting private wetlands. After that, if you want to do any other activity, then you have to get a permit. It could be that those regulations would say that you could put out a pier, for which you would need no permit. Those regulations could just as easily say you can put out a pier that has no structure on it without a permit, but you cannot put a pier out with a structure on it unless you do get a permit. There are myriad possibilities, and I simply don\u2019t think that the State, by any stretch of the imagination, did not give to the Secretary the authority to regulate anything conducted on any wetland. And, on, there, is used in its most expansive sense, meaning on, over, above or whatever. I think this intention of the General Assembly is made clear by its adoption of Section 9-104, which says the Secretary may not issue a permit for any project involving the construction of a dwelling unit or other non-water dependent structure on a pier located on a private wetland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">Now, if the authority of the Department or the Secretary was nonexistent in that regard before, it certainly was strange in the extreme to prohibit the Secretary from issuing a permit under this Title for any project involving the construction of certain types of units, and that\u2019s all that that Section purports to do. And therefore, so far as the conclusion of the Secretary or the Director here with regard to her authority, I have no trouble with that, whatsoever, that the authority to regulate anything on a wetland includes what was on a pier on a wetland, or whatever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>It is clear that the trial judge found jurisdiction in the DNR and that jurisdiction was based upon his reading of \u00a7 9-306(a) which reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">Any person proposing to conduct on any wetland an activity not authorized by the regulations adopted under the provisions of \u00a7 9-302 of this subtitle shall apply for a permit with the Secretary, on the form the Secretary prescribes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMq\">The trial judge found that \u00a7 9-104 did not confer jurisdiction on the DNR saying that it \u201cprohibit[s] the Secretary from issuing a permit under this Title for any project involving the construction of certain types of units, and that\u2019s all that Section purports to do.\u201d He did find that the enactment of \u00a7 9-104 evidenced the fact that the General Assembly believed construction on private wetlands required a permit prior to the enactment of \u00a7 9-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Before the ALJ, DNR took the position that Pier One was in violation of \u00a7 9-104(c) because the dockmaster\u2019s office was a non-water dependent structure and was not permitted pursuant to the clear mandate of \u00a7 9-104(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The primary issue argued before the ALJ was whether the dockmaster\u2019s office is a water dependent structure. The ALJ found that the structure at issue \u201cis indeed water dependent within the meaning of Section 9-104(c), and is capable of being permitted.\u201d Accordingly, the ALJ recommended that the Administration vacate and withdraw the site complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">In her Final Decision, the Director of the Water Resources Administration agreed with the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact and also with her conclusions of law with the exception of \u201cthe disposition of the Site Complaint SC-0-91-0064 vis \u00e1 vis the dock-master\u2019s office.\u201d The conclusion of the Director is that \u00a7 9-104 \u201cclearly subjected \u2018construction of a dwelling unit or structure on a pier, wharf, dock, walkway, bulkhead, breakwater, pile, or other similar structure,\u2019 to regulatory review under Natural Resources Article, Title 9. ... It is sufficient to reiterate that after July 1, 1989, Pier One was required to have wetlands permit under Natural Resources Article \u00a7 9-306, in order to legally construct the dockmaster\u2019s office.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The Administration, therefore, took the position that \u00a7 9-104, which is entirely void of any reference to water dependent structures and refers exclusively to non-water dependent structures, somehow requires appellant to obtain a permit pursuant to \u00a7 9-306 for what the ALJ found to be a water dependent structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In her Final Decision and Order, the Director ordered Pier One to apply for authorization to leave the dockmaster\u2019s office on the dock. If the Administration determined that the office was a water dependent structure, it would remaih; if the Administration determined that it was not water dependent, it must be removed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">It is noteworthy that the Director predicated her decision in part on \u00a7 9-306, a provision that had not previously been relied upon by DNR as giving it jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The DNR argued before the trial court that it had never taken the \u201cexpansive interpretation\u201d of \u00a7 9-306 that the court put forth. When asked where the DNR found jurisdiction, counsel for DNR replied that to deny such jurisdiction creates a nullity of \u00a7 9-104. When pressed, DNR also stated that \u201cwe\u2019re covered under 9-302.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">We believe the DNR is correct in not embracing the interpretation of \u00a7 9-306 espoused by the trial judge. While the language of \u00a7 9-306, taken literally, indicates that any person proposing to conduct an activity on a wetland shall apply for a permit, it could not mean that any activity whatsoever in any wetland would require a permit. That interpretation is an obvious absurdity. It would mean that even a person engaged only in bird watching would need a permit to do so. We reject the notion that the General Assembly intended by these statutes to give such broad scope of authority to the DNR. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>We note that DNR itself has never claimed such authority; indeed, it denied it had such authority to the trial judge and to this panel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In <em>Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 324, 558 A.2d 715 (1989), the Court of Appeals stated, \u201cAs helpful as the various rules of statutory construction may be in determining legislative intent, perhaps the soundest guidance comes from the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that we give the language of a statute a \u2018commonsensical meaning.\u2019 <em>United States v. Universal Corp., </em>344 U.S. 218, 221, 73 S.Ct. 227, 229, 97 L.Ed. 260 (1952).\u201d Judge McAuliffe writing for the Court of Appeals in <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. 182, 185, 567 A.2d 126 (1989), observed, \u201cIn attempting to determine legislative intent, we look first to the words of the statute, read in light of the full context in which they appear, and in light of external manifestations of intent or general purpose available through other evidence.\u201d Where the words of a statute are susceptible of more than one meaning, the court should adopt, the construction that is in harmony with its general purpose. <em>Baltimore County Coalition Against Unfair Taxes v. Baltimore County, </em>321 Md. 184, 582 A.2d 510 (1990). \u201c[Ujnreasonableness of the result produced by one alternative possible interpretation of a statute is reason for rejecting that interpretation in favor of another which would produce a reasonable result.\u201d <em>D &amp; Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>320 Md. 534, 538, 578 A.2d 1177 (1990), quoting 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 45.12 (4th ed. 1984). The real legislative intention will prevail over the intention indicated by the literal meaning of the words. <em>Potter v. Bethesda Fire Dept., </em>309 Md. 347, 353, 524 A.2d 61 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">It appears to us that the apparent difficulty with understanding the import of \u00a7 9-306 is that the statute cannot be read in isolation. When considered and read in harmony with \u00a7 9-302, however, it makes perfect sense. The scope of \u00a7 9-302 is to grant DNR power to make regulations governing dredging, filling, removing, or otherwise altering or polluting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>private wetlands. Pursuant to that authority, the Department adopted COMAR 08.05.07.02, which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao6\">The following uses are permitted in private wetlands if otherwise permitted by law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\">C. (1) The construction and maintenance of walkways, foot bridges, duckblinds, docks, boathouses, boat shelters, and other similar structures, provided that the structures are so constructed on pilings as to permit the unobstructed flow of the tide and preserve the natural contour of the private wetland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In our opinion, that part of \u00a7 9-306 that refers to \u201can activity not authorized by the regulations adopted under the provisions of \u00a7 9-302\u201d refers to an activity associated with \u201cdredging, filling, removing, or otherwise altering or polluting private wetlands.\u201d We, therefore, hold that \u00a7 9-306 requires that a permit be obtained whenever a person is engaged in any activity involving \u201cdredging, filling, removing, or otherwise altering or polluting wetlands,\u201d which the DNR has not already authorized by regulation. This interpretation is consistent with long standing administrative interpretation by DNR and with the position taken by DNR in this case with respect to \u00a7 9-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">We now turn to \u00a7 9-104. It is clear from the legislative history of \u00a7 9-104 that this section was enacted to plug what was perceived as a loophole in the critical area legislation. Some members of the General Assembly became alarmed with respect to the construction of large non-water dependent structures on piers in Baltimore City. Section 9-104 was enacted to attempt to prevent more of these projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Section 9\u2014104(c), by its own terms, limits its applicability to non-water dependent structures. It states in pertinent part, \u201cthe Secretary may not issue a permit under this title for any project involving the construction of a dwelling unit or other non-water dependent structure on a pier located on private wetlands.\u201d DNR\u2019s position is that by stating a permit may not be issued for a non-water dependent structure, by implication, this section requires a permit for a water dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>structure. We believe that this leap in logic is untenable. The General Assembly certainly knows how to make its intentions known more clearly than in the nebulous, oblique manner suggested by DNR.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">DNR argued and the trial judge agreed that, by not giving the interpretation advocated by DNR, \u00a7 9-104 would be a nullity. We do not agree. Section 9-104 was enacted to prevent the construction of large scale housing projects. Already existing developments on piers and similar future projects were considered as under the jurisdiction of DNR and subject to permit approval because of their potential for pollution or the existence of dredging or filling. Taking this into consideration, \u00a7 9-104 does exactly what its proponents desired. It prevents the issuance of further permits for non-water dependent structures on piers.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 9-104, DNR did not attempt to assert jurisdiction over private wetlands except with respect to the authorization granted by \u00a7 9-302. This section grants authority to DNR to regulate dredging, filling, removing, or otherwise altering or polluting private wetlands. This grant of jurisdiction is rather inclusive since it is difficult to conceive of a substantial activity which does not implicate DNR\u2019s grant of authority. Following the enactment of \u00a7 9-104, DNR believed that that enactment gave it authority over the placement of both water dependent and non-water dependent structures on piers.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">We do not believe that \u00a7 9-104 has the effect of giving DNR authority over water dependent structures on piers. Therefore, the situation existing now with respect to water dependent structures on piers is what it was prior to the enactment of \u00a7 9-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The promulgation of COMAR Reg. 08.05.07.03(c) by DNR permits the construction of structures on piers such as, among other things, boathouses, boat shelters, and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>similar structures. It seems apparent that the dockmaster\u2019s office in the case at bar is such a structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">For the aforegoing reasons we must reverse the circuit court and direct that the circuit court order the Director of the Water Resources Department to withdraw Site Complaint No. SC-0-90-0064.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR QUEEN ANNE\u2019S COUNTY WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE WATER RESOURCES DEPARTMENT FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF SITE COMPLAINT No. SC-0-90-0064.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-12\">.
