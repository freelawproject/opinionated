The name of the second grantee was achieved by interlineation at the request of the original grantee, but without the grantor\u2019s consent. The added grantee has died, and an interest in the condominium has been claimed by the heirs of the added grantee. Their claim is disputed by the initial grantee, who intended, by adding the second grantee\u2019s name, to create a joint tenancy with a right of survivorship. The Circuit Court for Worcester County granted summary judgment in favor of the initial grantee, declaring that the second grantee\u2019s heirs \u201chave no legal interest\u201d in the property. Not surprisingly, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">In April 1983, appellee, Joseph W. Kirchner (Kirchner), entered into a contract with John A. Cummings (Cummings), agreeing to purchase Unit T-1706, Carousel Center Condominium, Ocean City, Maryland (the condominium). Kirchner made a deposit of earnest money and procured a commitment for financing from Second National Building and Loan (SNBL).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Unable to attend the scheduled settlement, Cummings met with the settlement officer, Myra A. Crowe (Crowe), an employee of South Atlantic Title Company (South Atlantic), on the morning of settlement and signed the deed of conveyance and the settlement sheet. Having done so, Cummings left these items with Crowe. The executed deed named Kirchner as the sole grantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Kirchner was accompanied to settlement by Stella C. Donovan (Mrs. Donovan). Kirchner reviewed and signed the settlement documents presented by Crowe, including a purchase money deed of trust in favor of SNBL. All of the documents named Kirchner as the sole purchaser and borrower. Kirchner then gave Crowe-a check covering the remaining balance of the purchase price and settlement costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Near the end of settlement, Kirchner asked that Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name be added to the deed as a joint tenant, so that title to the condominium would pass to the survivor upon the death of either. Crowe obtained SNBL\u2019s approval, and was told by SNBL that Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name need not be added to the deed of trust. Crowe did not seek Cummings\u2019s approval of adding Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name to the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">As recorded, the deed reflected that Cummings had conveyed the condominium to \u201cJoseph W. Kirchner <em>and Stella C. </em>Donovan, <em>Joint Tenants </em>parties of the second part, <em>their </em>heirs and assigns in fee simple forever.\u201d It is obvious from looking at a copy of the deed that Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name was added after the deed was first prepared, because the type is different and darker than all other typed portions of the document. It is also obvious from a look at the original deed that in two places the clause <em>\u201cparty </em>of the second part\u201d was changed to \u201cparties of the second part,\u201d and in another place the clause <em>\u201chis </em>heirs and assigns\u201d was changed to <em>\u201ctheir </em>heirs and assigns,\u201d by using \u201cwhite-out\u201d over the original language and typing over the \u201cwhite-out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Mrs. Donovan died on August 25, 1986, in an automobile accident. Her will named her children, appellants, John T. Donovan and Patresa C. Barnhart, as personal representatives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>and sole residuary legatees. An Information Report was tiled by appellants with the Register of Wills for Anne Arundel County, indicating that the condominium was held by Kirchner and Mrs. Donovan as joint tenants, and Kirchner paid inheritance taxes on one-half of its equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">When Kirchner contracted to sell the condominium in 1992, the attorney handling settlement asked appellants to sign some paperwork, appellants refused to do so, and claimed a one half-interest in the condominium. In response, Kirchner filed a Complaint for Declaratory and Equitable Relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Appellants\u2019 claim that the interlineation of Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name in the deed created a joint tenancy with Kirchner. They then assert that Kirchner\u2019s execution of the deed of trust in favor of SNBL severed the joint tenancy, creating a tenancy in common. Thus, appellants contend that Mrs. Donovan\u2019s interest in the condominium, although not specifically mentioned in her will, passed to appellants upon Mrs. Donovan\u2019s death, rather than to Kirchner.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In his complaint for declaratory relief, Kirchner asserted that appellants possess no interest in the condominium because the addition of Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name to the deed was a nullity, leaving him the sole owner of the condominium. Kirchner alternatively asserted in his complaint that he executed SNBL\u2019s deed of trust before adding Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name to the deed. Thus, if a joint tenancy was created, it was created after encumbering the condominium and the joint tenancy was therefore not severed, leaving Kirchner as surviving joint tenant. As a final alternative, Kirchner\u2019s complaint asserted that, if appellants\u2019 interpretation of the transaction was correct, severance of the joint tenancy was contrary to the express intentions of all of the parties, unjustly enriching Mrs. Donovan\u2019s estate and appellants. Consequently, Kirchner sought the imposition of a trust upon appellants\u2019 purported interest in the condominium and that appellants be ordered to convey their interest to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Both Kirchner and appellants moved for summary judgment. In support of his Motion for Summary Judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Kirchner provided affidavits from himself and from Crowe, attesting to the events that occurred at settlement. Following a hearing, the trial court accepted Kirchner\u2019s assertion that he had executed SNBL\u2019s deed of trust before adding Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name to the deed from Cummings, creating a joint tenancy after encumbering the condominium, and declared Kirchner to be \u201cthe sole surviving joint tenant,\u201d saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ard\">Well, I certainly think- that there is an irregularity here where all the documents beforehand are prepared from Mr. Cummings to Mr. Kirchner. The only document that includes Miss [sic] Donovan\u2019s name is the deed. From the affidavits, I feel comfortable in saying that the settlement had been completed, that the deed had been executed, the deed of trust had been executed, the money had been delivered at the time that the deed was then altered to include Miss Donovan\u2019s name. And it\u2019s clear to me the intention of that act was to create a joint tenancy. And I think the equitable relief certainly should be done in this particular case. For that, I don\u2019t find that the unities were destroyed because, in fact, Miss Donovan\u2019s name was added after the deed of trust and settlement had been completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\n<em>ISSUES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we are obligated to determine whether the trial court was legally correct in granting summary judgment. <em>Southland Corp. v. Griffith </em>332 Md. 704, 712, 633 A.2d 84 (1993). Nevertheless, appellants urge us to bifurcate our review of the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Despite challenging his final disposition of the matter, appellants accept and rely upon the trial court\u2019s holding that the interlineation of her name created a joint tenancy between Mrs. Donovan and Kirchner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>unable to determine whether the trial court was correct in holding that the joint tenancy was not severed by Kirchner\u2019s execution of a deed of trust in favor of SNBL, however, without first determining whether the trial court correctly determined that a joint tenancy was initially created. We have thus reframed the issues presented by appellants as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">I. Did the trial court err by considering the affidavits submitted by Kirchner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">A. Does the parol evidence rule preclude consideration of any evidence regarding the circumstances under which Mrs. Donovan was added to the deed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">B. Does the \u201cDead Man\u2019s Statute\u201d preclude consideration of Kirchner\u2019s affidavit regarding the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>stances under which Mrs. Donovan was added to the deed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">II. Is there a dispute of material fact such that summary-judgment was inappropriate in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">III. Whether the interlineation of Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name without the consent of the grantor while the deed was in escrow was effective to vest Mrs. Donovan with an interest in the condominium upon delivery of the deed by the escrow agent?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">We conclude that at least one of the affidavits presented by Kirchner was admissible, that summary judgment was properly granted, and that the interlineation of Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name was a nullity. We shall therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">\n<em>Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqU\">Maryland Rule 2-501 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>(a) Motion.\u2014Any party may file at any time a motion for summary judgment on all or part of an action on the ground that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party filing is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The motion shall be supported by affidavit if filed before the day on which the adverse party\u2019s initial pleading or motion is filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">(b) Response.\u2014The response to a motion for summary judgment shall identify with particularity the material facts that are disputed. When a motion for summary judgment is supported by an affidavit or other statement under oath, an opposing party who desires to controvert any fact contained in it may not rest solely upon allegations contained in the pleadings, but shall support the response by an affidavit or other written statement under oath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">(c) Form of Affidavit.\u2014An affidavit supporting or opposing a motion for summary judgment shall be made upon personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\n<em>Parol Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Appellants contend that Kirchner\u2019s and Crowe\u2019s affidavits should not have been considered by the trial court because the parol evidence rule precluded the facts contained in them from being introduced into evidence. The parol evidence rule precludes the introduction of evidence \u201ccontradicting, adding to, subtracting from, or varying the terms of a Deed, or controlling its legal operation and effect, except where it is impeached for fraud, or where it is sought to be reformed upon the allegation of fraud, accident or mistake.\u201d <em>Canatella v. Davis, </em>264 Md. 190, 200, 286 A.2d 122 (1972) (quoting <em>Mullins v. Ray, </em>232 Md. 596, 598-99, 194 A.2d 806 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>These exceptions to the parol evidence rule are not exhaustive, however. For example, parol evidence is admissible to prove that a deed\u2019s named grantee holds nothing more than bare legal title, while a stranger to the deed owns the beneficial interest under a resulting trust. <em>Siemiesz v. Amend, </em>237 Md. 438, 441, 206 A.2d 723 (1965); <em>Fitch v. Double \u201cU\u201d Sales Corp., </em>212 Md. 324, 330, 129 A.2d 93 (1957). Parol evidence may also be introduced to contradict a deed\u2019s recited consideration. <em>Dorsey v. Beads, </em>288 Md. 161, 170, 416 A.2d 739 (1980) (citing <em>Rinaudo v. Bloom, </em>209 Md. 1, 8, 120 A.2d 184 (1956) and <em>Koogle v. Cline, </em>110 Md 587, 73 A. 672 (1909)).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Another established, although infrequently mentioned, exception to the parol evidence rule is that which allows the introduction of parol evidence in order to prove that a deed or other instrument was altered after being executed. In Maryland, alterations apparent on the face of a deed are presumed to have been made prior to, or contemporaneously with, its execution. <em>Wickes\u2019 Lessee v. Caulk, </em>5 H. &amp; J. 36, 41 (1820) (\u201c[I]t is incumbent on the party who wishes to avoid a deed by its erasure, to prove that the alteration was made after its execution and delivery.\u201d); <em>see also Murdock v. Schindel, </em>128 Md. 633, 638, 98 A. 149 (1916) (\u201c[T]he presumption always would be, that the seal was affixed to the instrument on its delivery, in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d) (quoting <em>Trasher v. Everhart, </em>3 G. &amp; J. 234 (1831)); <em>cf. </em>15 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 1916 (3d ed. 1972); 3A C.J.S., Alt<em>eration of Instruments </em>\u00a7 101 (1973); 4 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Alteration of Instruments </em>\u00a7\u00a7 80-83 (1962); 30 A.L.R.3d 571 (1970) (each discussing various presumptions as to time of alteration). The presumption that an alteration was made before execution is, however, a rebuttable presumption, and relevant competent evidence may be presented to prove that the alteration occurred subsequent to the document\u2019s execution. <em>See </em>15 Williston, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1916 at p. 873; 3A C.J.S., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 105; 4 Am.Jur.2d, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>For instance, in <em>Union Bank of Maryland v. Ridgely, </em>1 H. &amp; G. 324, 416 (1827), it was said that \u201cthe defendant may, [under a plea of <em>non est factum </em>], give in evidence anything which goes to show that the instrument of writing was originally void at common law, as lunacy, fraud, coverture, &amp; c. or that it had become void subsequent to the execution, and before the bringing of the suit, as by erasure, alteration, &amp; c.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Burckmyer v. Whiteford, </em>6 Gill 1 (1847), the trial court refused to allow a witness to testify as to the reasons for the witness\u2019s alteration of a bill of exchange. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court, saying, \u201cIf it was of any importance in the cause to know who erased the special endorsement spoken of, surely it was but reasonable that the witness should be allowed to state when, why, and under what circumstances, the erasure was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In <em>Edelin v. Sanders, </em>8 Md. 118 (1855), the plaintiff, the named payee on a bond, was attempting to collect on the bond from the executor of the bond maker\u2019s estate. The trial judge allowed the executor to introduce evidence of prior suits against the plaintiff both by the maker and the estate, grounded on the executor\u2019s contention that the payee\u2019s name had been altered. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court after examining the instrument, and finding no erasures or other alterations, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">If, in point of fact, it was obvious on inspection that the paper had been altered, it was easy to have it noticed in the exception, either by an agreement to that effect or by calling to the stand an expert in handwriting, and asking his opinion as to its appearance. Had this been done, and had the witness testified that the paper appeared to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>altered or any portion of it erased, we are of opinion the testimony [objected to] in the first bill of exceptions ... would have been admissible as <em>tending </em>to show it had not been delivered in its then state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 130-31. If an alteration had been evident, the particular evidence objected to would have then been admissible to show fraud on the part of the plaintiff by showing his relations and dealings with the maker of the bond. <em>Id. </em>at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Other cases involving the alteration of deeds and other instruments review the parol evidence presented at trial without discussing its admissibility, thus tacitly approving its admission. <em>Downs v. </em>Downs, 154 Md. 430, 434-37, 140 A. 831 (1928) (alteration of deed); <em>Silverberg v. Silverberg, </em>148 Md. 682, 692, 130 A. 325 (1925) (alteration of deed); <em>Gerlach v. Warren, </em>146 Md. 668, 127 A. 411 (1925) (alteration of installment land sales contract); <em>Clark v. Creswell, </em>112 Md. 339, 76 A. 579 (1910) (alteration of deed).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Parol evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the alteration of an instrument is admissible because its object is \u201cnot to vary the terms of the instrument, but on the contrary to prove the terms thereof as originally executed.\u201d 4 Am.Jur. 2d, <em>Alteration of Instruments </em>\u00a7 86 (1962); <em>see also Dolan v. Carmel Canning Co., </em>71 Cal.App. 197, 234 P. 926, 928 (1925) (\u201cWhere it is claimed that an instrument in evidence fails to express the true contract or agreement of the parties by reason of alteration therein, extrinsic evidence is always admissible to prove that condition.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">As we noted earlier, the alterations here at issue are readily apparent on the face of the deed. The insertion of Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name is clearly of different type than the type on the remainder of the deed, and the use of \u201cwhite-out\u201d for changing the pronoun from \u201chis\u201d to \u201ctheir\u201d and changing of the word \u201cparty\u201d from singular to the plural is obvious. There is nothing whatever in the record before us indicating that Cummings was contacted, or consented to the changes. Even though it may be presumed that the alterations were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>made before Cummings executed the deed, it was permissible for Kirchner to present parol evidence to prove otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\n<em>The Dead Man\u2019s Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Appellants next contend that, even if the affidavits are admissible under the parol evidence rule, Maryland Code (1973, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-116 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJP), commonly known as the \u201cDead Man\u2019s Statute,\u201d renders the testimony contained in Kirchner\u2019s affidavit inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">CJP \u00a7 9-116 prevents \u201c[a] party to a proceeding by or against a personal representative, heir, devisee, distributee, or legatee as such, in which a judgment or decree may be rendered for or against them\u201d from testifying \u201cconcerning any transaction with or statement made\u201d by the deceased unless the party is called to testify by the opposite party or such testimony has already been received.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">We are not at all certain that Kirchner\u2019s affidavit concerns a \u201ctransaction with\u201d Mrs. Donovan. <em>See Schifanelli v. Wallace, </em>271 Md. 177, 183-87, 315 A.2d 513 (1974); <em>Ridgley v. Beatty, </em>222 Md. 76, 81-83, 159 A.2d 651 (1959). Nevertheless, as the Dead Man\u2019s Statute does not render Crowe\u2019s affidavit inadmissible, <em>see Walton v. Davy, </em>86 Md.App. 275, 284-86, 586 A.2d 760, <em>cert. denied, </em>323 Md. 309, 593 A.2d 669 (1991), Kirchner\u2019s affidavit is merely cumulative. Thus, even if erroneous, the trial court\u2019s consideration of Kirchner\u2019s affidavit was harmless.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">Appellants have submitted no affidavit controverting the facts contained in Crowe\u2019s affidavit. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 2-501(b). In fact, appellants have not contended that the events occurred differently than as described by Crowe. Instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>appellants claim solely that Kirchner\u2019s and Crowe\u2019s affidavits are not admissible, and, consequently, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Kirchner.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">As we have explained, Crowe\u2019s affidavit was admissible and properly considered by the trial court in deciding the motions for summary judgment. Consequently, the trial court had before it the contested deed, with alterations apparent on its face, and Crowe\u2019s affidavit, attesting that she inserted the alterations after Cummings executed the deed without obtaining his consent. As this portion of Crowe\u2019s affidavit is not refuted by appellants, there is no dispute as to material facts precluding summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">This brings us to the legal effect of inserting, by interlineation, Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name as a grantee. Kirchner contends that <em>Downs v. Downs, </em>154 Md. 430, 140 A. 831 (1928) is dispositive. <em>Downs </em>was a divorce action in which a wife claimed that she held an interest in the marital home as tenant by the entirety. The Court of Appeals explained the circumstances under which the wife\u2019s name appeared on the deed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">[T]itle was conveyed to [Mr. Downs] upon his payment in full of the purchase price. The deed was executed by the grantors on December 26th at the office of the title company employed by Mr. Downs in the transaction, and was left with the company to be filed for public registration. On the following day Mr. Downs, in pursuance of his wife\u2019s request that she be joined with him as a grantee of the property, called at the title company\u2019s office and stated his desire to have his wife\u2019s name inserted in the deed in order that they might hold the title as tenants by the entireties. He was informed, by the official who had been acting in the matter, that such a change could be made with the consent of the grantors. The proposed interlineation was subsequently made and the deed recorded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 432, 140 A. 831. The wife\u2019s claim to title was rejected by the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\">There is no sufficient basis for the claim in the cross-bill that Mrs. Downs has an interest in the home property as a tenant by the entirety.... The interlineation of her name in the deed after its execution and delivery was ineffectual to make her a grantee of the property. There can be no doubt that the deed had then been fully executed and finally delivered by the grantors. After signing and acknowledging the instrument, they had left it with the title company, which was acting solely as the agent of the grantee whom the deed then designated. It was thereafter beyond the power of the grantors to recall the deed or to modify its provisions. The testimony does not prove with reasonable certainty that they actually consented to the subsequent insertion of Mrs. Downs\u2019 name in the deed, but such consent could not affect the title of which they had divested themselves by an irrevocable conveyance. The purpose which the grantee afterwards manifested to invest his wife with an equal interest in the title could not be effectuated by the informal and irregular method described.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 434-35, 140 A. 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Kirchner because \u201csettlement had been completed\u201d when the deed was altered. If that be true, <em>Downs </em>renders the alteration a nullity that neither changed the nature of the conveyance nor constituted a conveyance from Kirchner to Mrs. Donovan.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Nonetheless, as appellants point out, the case at hand differs from <em>Downs </em>in one critical respect. <em>Downs </em>involved a \u201cfully executed and finally delivered\u201d deed, and the grantors had no further title to convey. As a consequence, Mr. Downs\u2019 attempt to make Mrs. Downs a grantee had no effect whatever. In contrast, the instant case involves an escrow closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The deposit of a deed or other written instrument with a third party to be held for delivery to the grantee or obligee on the performance of a condition or the happening of</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>a certain event, is termed an escrow closing.

Ridgely, supra, </em>1 H. &amp; G. at 416, for the proposition that evidence of delivery in escrow on a condition not performed is admissible to prove a deed or other legal instrument to be <em>non est </em>factum). In Maryland practice, however, escrow closings are often informal arrangements. That appears to be the situation in the case at hand, as neither Kirchner nor Donovan allege the existence of a written escrow agreement with South Atlantic. <em>See Natelson, supra, </em>\u00a7 17.9 at 463 (\u201cThe better practice is to reduce escrow agreements to writing, but parol agreements are enforceable.\u201d); 3 <em>American Law of Property, supra, </em>\u00a7 12.67 at p. 323 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Cummings deposited his executed deed with South Atlantic for delivery to Kirchner upon Kirehner\u2019s payment of the balance of the purchase price. Until the balance of the purchase price was received, Cummings retained legal title and Kirchner possessed but an equitable interest in the condominium. 3 American Law of Property, \u00a7 1267 at p. 324 (A.J. Casner, ed. 1952); Robert G. Natelson, Modern Law of Deeds to Real Property, \u00a7 17.9 at p. 465 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Read in the light most favorable to appellants, <em>Griffith v. Southland Corp., </em>94 Md.App. 242, 245 n. 1, 617 A.2d 598 (1992), <em>aff'd, </em>332 Md. 704, 633 A.2d 84 (1993), the affidavits presented by Kirchner support only a finding that Cummings\u2019s deed was altered near the end of the settlement. It is possible that the alteration occurred prior to satisfaction of the escrow condition, and thus prior to Cummings\u2019s deed being delivered to Kirchner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The issue before us then becomes the effect of an alteration made after the deed is executed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>deposited with an escrow agent, but before the escrow condition is satisfied by the grantee, and the escrow agent delivers the deed to the grantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Neither party has directed us to, nor have we found, a case in Maryland, or in any other jurisdiction, specifically addressing this issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After examining the general principles of the conveyance of real property and of escrow closings, however, it is clear to us that the grantor\u2019s intent is determined at the time the deed is placed in escrow. 3 American Law of Property \u00a7 12.67 at p. 320 (A.J. Casner, ed. 1952). We thus conclude that the holding in <em>Dovms </em>applies also to escrow closings; therefore, unless all parties consent, material modifications made after a deed is placed in escrow are of no effect.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the other hand, if all parties have consented, a material alteration made while a deed is in escrow will be valid. 3 American Law of Property, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.85 at p. 366 (\u201cWhile a deed is in escrow there has not as yet been such a completed delivery but that by consent of all parties there may be a material alteration, such as a change in the name of the grantee.\u201d). Neither Kirchner nor appellants assert that Cummings approved the addition of Mrs. Dono<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>van\u2019s name as grantee. Crowe\u2019s affidavit attests that she contacted SNBL about adding Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name to the deed, but mentions no contact with Cummings. There is thus no evidence that Cummings consented to adding Mrs. Donovan as a grantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The deed delivered to Kirchner by the escrow agent, therefore, did not comply with Cummings\u2019s intention, established when he placed the deed in escrow, to convey the condominium only to Kirchner. Whether Cummings would have consented to adding Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name to the deed had he been asked to do so is irrelevant. Not having been asked, Cummings had no intention to convey the condominium to Kirchner and Mrs. Donovan. Accordingly, the interlineation of her name as a grantee was a nullity, and the deed from Cummings conveyed the condominium only to Kirchner.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Moreover, the interlineation of Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name as grantee failed to transfer any portion of Kirchner\u2019s newly acquired interest in the condominium to Mrs. Donovan. <em>Downs, </em>154 Md. at 435, 140 A. 831; <em>see also </em>Maryland Code (1974, 1988 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-101 to 5-108 of the Real Property Article (Statute of Frauds). Hence, appellants\u2019 claim to a one-half interest in the condominium is completely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\">. Appellants presented the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">1. Does the conveyance of a Deed of Trust by a single joint tenant destroy the unities of interest and title and thus destroy the joint tenancy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>2. May the surviving co-tenant in realty testify, after the death of his co-tenant, as to the circumstances purportedly surrounding the creation of the tenancy, in an action to terminate the deceased co-tenant\u2019s rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">3. May the surviving co-tenant and/or the settlement officer testify as to the purported intent of the co-tenants in a case where there is no finding of mutual mistake, accident or fraud and the written instruments are complete in themselves?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">4. Can a delivery of a Deed in escrow, before settlement <em>is </em>completed and before the terms of the escrow are fulfilled, be construed to constitute delivery of the Deed to a grantee so that such grantee may be deemed to have thereafter conveyed a Deed of Trust to a lender, then reconveyed the property (by the same instrument) to himself and a co-tenant, although only one Deed exists, and that Deed is not signed by anyone other than the original grantor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">5. If a Deed and a Deed of Trust appear to be complete documents on the face, may a court grant summary judgment based on affidavits that purport to alter the clear meaning of those instruments or must a trial be held, as a matter of law, because such situation necessarily involves a question of fact?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">Appellants\u2019 contentions are then divided into three parts: (I) Kirchner\u2019s execution of the Deed of Trust severed the joint tenancy; (2) a dispute of material fact existed between the recorded instruments and the affidavits presented by Kirchner; and (3) the affidavits were not admissible under the parol evidence rule and the Dead Man\u2019s Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">Kirchner counters that the trial court\u2019s determination that he is sole owner of the condominium is correct and that the affidavits presented by him were properly before the court. On appeal, however, Kirchner asserts that the interlineation of Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name was of no effect, so that Mrs. Donovan had no interest in the condominium.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b458-11\">. In so doing, we acknowledge that \"the appellate court will not ordinarily undertake to sustain the judgment by ruling on another ground, not ruled upon by the trial court, if the alternative ground is one as to which the trial court had a discretion to deny summary judgment.\u201d <em>Three Garden Village Ltd. Partnership v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Corp., </em>318 Md. 98, 107-08, 567 A.2d 85 (1989) (quoting <em>Geisz v. Greater Baltimore Medical Center, </em>313 Md. 301, 314 n.5, 545 A.2d 658 (1988)). Whether the interlineation of Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name was of any effect, however, is a threshold issue that was before, and implicitly decided by the trial court. Hence, we are not sustaining the judgment of the trial court on an \"alternative ground,\u201d but are, in effect, reversing the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the interlineation of Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name had any effect, nevertheless arriving at the same legal result on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">Moreover, based upon the unrefuted facts established by Kirchner, the interlineation of Mrs. Donovan\u2019s name was of no effect as a matter of law. Consequently, the trial court was without discretion to deny Kirchner's Motion for Summary Judgment. <em>See Maryland Casualty Co. v. Lorkovic, </em>100 Md.App. 333, 356-359, 641 A.2d 924, 935-936 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\">. The material alteration by a party of an instrument of a contractual nature, such as a bond, note, or contract, after execution, even though innocently made, invalidates the instrument as to any nonconsenting party. <em>Markoff v. </em>Kreiner, 180 Md. 150, 153-54, 23 A.2d 19 (1941); Maryland Code (1975, 1992 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-407 of the Commercial Law Article. In contrast, the material alteration of a deed after delivery is a nullity and does not affect the operation of the deed as originally delivered. <em>Downs v. Downs, </em>154 Md. 430, 140 A. 831 (1928). <em>See </em>Section III <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b463-12\">. We note that Kirchner\u2019s affidavit is more favorable to appellants than Crowe\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b466-5\">. An escrow will not exist if the grantor reserves a right to recall the deed after depositing it with the escrow agent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">[T]he grantor must have surrendered all dominion and control over the interest to be conveyed. If he reserves a power to recall the deed, by word, act, or writing,, and regardless of whether he ever exercises it or not, no delivery has resulted and no transfer occurs.... But if delivered to the custodian with no reservation of right to recall, a subsequent attempt to recall the deed, or, even a repossession or destruction of it by the grantor, is of no effect\u2014it is the intention which the grantor expressed to the depositary at the time of delivery which is controlling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">3 American Law of Property \u00a7 12.67 at pp. 319-20 (A.J. Casner, ed. 1952). The burden of proving an escrow is upon the party defending against a claim under a deed or other legal instrument. <em>Union Bank of Maryland v. Ridgely, supra, </em>1 H. &amp; G. at 418. As appellants treat Cummings\u2019s deposit of his deed with South Atlantic as an escrow, we assume without deciding that an escrow existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\">. As generally used, the term delivery encompasses the concept of both the grantor's physical transfer of the deed to the grantee with the intent that the deed be presently effective as a conveyance, 6A Powell on Real Property \u00b6 898[2] at pp. 81A-75 to -77 (1993), and the grantee\u2019s acceptance of the deed. <em>Id. </em>at pp. 81A-88 to -89. Escrow closings have been characterized as having two deliveries\u2014the first from the grantor to the escrow agent and the second from the escrow agent to the grantee. 3 American Law of Property, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.67 at p. 318; Natelson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 17.9 at pp. 464-65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b468-6\">. Kirchner incorrectly refers to <em>Downs </em>as an escrow case. After raising the distinction between this case and <em>Downs, </em>appellants merely contend that Kirchner\u2019s right to assign his purchase contract with Cummings gave Kirchner the power to direct that title be vested in both he and Mrs. Donovan before accepting delivery. We agree that, absent a contractual provision prohibiting assignment, Kirchner had the right to assign his purchase contract from himself to himself and Mrs. Donovan. <em>See Burroughs v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 648, 652-53, 320 A.2d 587 (1974). If such an assignment were made, Kirchner and Mrs. Donovan could have required that Cummings\u2019s deed convey the condominium to both grantees. The right to assign a sales contact does not, however, translate into the right unilaterally to modify an executed deed and alter the identity of the grantees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">. It is possible that an alteration may manifest a refusal by the grantee(s) to accept the unaltered deed, or be so repugnant to the interests of the grantor as to be irreconcilable with the grantor's intent to convey the property. In such cases, the alteration, rather than being of no consequence, could render the deed void for lack of delivery. The alteration in the case <em>sub judice </em>is not of this nature, however, so we shall not at this time attempt to delineate exceptions to the general rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
