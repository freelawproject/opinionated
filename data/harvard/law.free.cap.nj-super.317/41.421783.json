The judge of compensation held that the employee\u2019s self-inflicted injury was compensable because he acted impulsively while at work and did not intend to harm himself. Although we have no quarrel with the judge\u2019s factual determinations, we nonetheless reverse because he failed to apply the correct principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act an award requires proof of an \u201caccident\u201d and proof that the accident arose \u201cout of\u2019 as well as \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment. An accident does not include an intentional act of violence to oneself that causes a reasonably expected injury. Although Klein was injured in the course of his employment, his reasonably anticipated and violently self-inflicted injury was not the result of an accident. Furthermore, the injury did not arise \u201cout of\u201d the employment because it resulted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Klein\u2019s personal proclivities and Ms unreasonable reaction to a supervisor\u2019s commonplace personnel action.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">On the evemng of November 16, 1994, Klein was at a plant owned by his employer, The New York Times Company, preparing a collating maeMne for operation, when he was called to the office by Ms supervisor who criticized his job performance. He was told that he was not setting up the maeMne properly and that if he did not \u201cbring Ms performance up to standard level ... he was gomg to be removed from the position.\u201d Klein, who had previously demonstrated his proclivity for reaetmg emotionally to criticism of Ms job performance, became agitated, screamed, and ran from the room. After complaining briefly to a umon representative, he walked toward the locker rooms, felt overwhelmed by anger, and mtentionally punched an electrical box, breaMng its Plexiglas cover and the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones of his right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">There can be no recovery under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-1 to -142, without proof of an accident. <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-1; <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-7. Although the concept of \u201caccident\u201d is not defined by the Act, its meaning in tMs context has been settled in general terms by our courts. \u201c \u2018[Ajceident\u2019 M the legislative sense is an \u2018unlooked for mishap or an untoward event wMch is not ejected or designed____\u2019\u201d <em>Ciuba v. Irvington Varnish &amp; Insulator Co., </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>127, 134, 141 A.2d 761 (1958). The concept was framed somewhat differently in <em>George v. Great Eastern Food Products, Inc., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>44, 207 A.2d 161 (1965), where the Court said that an occurrence is an accident under the Act \u201cif either the circumstance eausmg the injury <em>or </em>the result on the employee\u2019s person was unlooked for, regardless of whether the inception or the underlymg reason for the circumstance or result was personal or work connected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 207 A.2d 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Here, the circumstance eausmg the mjury, Klein\u2019s impulsive but violent and intentional punch of the electrical box, cannot be described as an unlooked for or unexpected occurrence smee it resulted from Ms willful action. And, although Klern may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>have intended to harm himself, as found by the judge of compensation, the resulting injury cannot be fairly described as \u201cunlooked for.\u201d In that regard, we note that the <em>George </em>Court used the phrase \u201cunlooked for\u201d as meaning \u201cunexpected\u201d and not as referring to the employee\u2019s lack of specific intent to cause self-injury. Thus, in reaching a conclusion favorable to the employee who had injured his head in a fall, caused by dizziness resulting from his cardiovascular illness, the Court said, \u201cHere ... \u2018both the circumstance causing the injury (the striking of the floor) and the consequence upon the employee\u2019s person were <em>unexpected. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 207 A.2d 161 (emphasis added). It is self-evident that a person who forcefully strikes a hard object with the knuckles of his fist should expect resulting injury to his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">No court of this State has permitted a workers\u2019 compensation recovery in comparable circumstances. Perhaps, the closest case is <em>Secor v. Penn Service Garage, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>315, 117 A.2d 12 (1955) (4-3 decision), in which a garage attendant, whose pants had just been splashed with gasoline while he was filling a customer\u2019s gas tank, and whose supervisor had suggested that he immediately change his pants, lit a match and instantaneously was in flames. The trier of fact found that Secor did not intend to ignite his clothing, but he did not determine whether Secor was about to light a cigarette, or was intending to prove the absence of a need for changing clothes, or \u201cwhether his act was an impulsive one designed to impress his employer with his lack of personal fear____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317, 117 A.2d 12. After resolving that under the first two scenarios Secor was clearly entitled to compensation, <em>id. </em>at 323, 117 A.2d 12, the Court addressed the third scenario, finding it analogous to the \u201ccuriosity cases,\u201d decisions allowing recovery to employees injured during intentional but slight and casual departures from duty occasioned by ordinary curiosity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">More troublesome is the question presented by the assumption that Secor was not motivated by either of the aforestated purposes but simply lit the match in a spirit of \u201cmock bravado.\u201d But even here, the compelling principles underlying the modem authorities, particularly the so-called \u201ccuriosity eases,\u201d lend adequate support for the compensation award to the employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 324, 117 A.2d 12 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The \u201ccuriosity cases\u201d do not provide adequate support to compensate Klein for his conduct. None involve, as does this case, an intentionally violent act that is a clear and substantial departure from the employee\u2019s assigned duties and causes an injury that should have been anticipated. <em>Id. </em>at 821-322, 117 A.2d 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The <em>Secor </em>Court emphasized, as a further reason supporting compensation, what it viewed as the minimal, momentary, and impulsive nature of the employee\u2019s deviation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">The evidence established that, in any event, Secor\u2019s deviation from the course of his ordinary work was not an intentional abandonment of his employment but simply a \u201cmomentary or impulsive act\u201d \u2014 it was not a \u201cdeliberate and conscious excursion\u201d____ An employee is not an automaton, and, even when he is highly efficient, he will to some extent deviate from the uninterrupted performance of his work. Such deviation, if it be considered minor in the light of the particular time, place and circumstance, is realistically viewed by both the employer and the employee as a normal incidence of the employment relation and ought not in this day be viewed as legally breaching the course thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">[19 <em>N. J. </em>at 324, 117 A.2d 12 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The <em>Secor </em>Court acknowledged that allowing compensation was \u201ctroublesome\u201d if one assumed the employee was motivated by \u201cmock bravado.\u201d The instant ease goes well beyond bravado and an allowance of compensation would be more than troublesome. Although we accept the finding of the judge of compensation that the act was in some sense impulsive, we are nonetheless satisfied that it was also deliberate and conscious and cannot be fairly described as a minor deviation from work performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Our conclusion, that an intentionally violent act that produces a reasonably expected self-injury is not an \u201caccident\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, accords with the weight of authority outside this State in cases involving the same circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Glodo v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>191 Ariz. 259, 955 P.2d 15 (Ariz.Ct.App.1997); <em>Wing v. Cornwall Indus., </em>418 A.2d 177 (Me.1980); <em>McKay Dee Hosp. v. Industrial Comm., </em>598 P.2d 375 (Utah 1979). <em>But see Cunningham v. Industrial Comm., </em>78 <em>Ill. </em>2d 35 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>772, 399 <em>N.E.2d </em>1300 (Ill.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Nor are we deterred from reaching our conclusion by the contrary view expressed by Professor Arthur Larson, a view noted and expressly rejected by the <em>Glodo </em>court with these observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av\">Larson\u2019s analysis suffers from apparent confusion of that which is \u201cintended\u201d and that which is \u201cexpected.\u201d Thus, Larson maintains that \u201c[t]o conclude that the claimant [in <em>McKay </em>] expected or intended to break his hand, and slammed the door with his fist anyway, is preposterous. There is no place in compensation law for this artificial and fictitious kind of \u2018intention.\u2019\u201d Larson, \u00a7 36.62 at 6-200.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">The dispositive question in deciding whether something is an accident is whether the result is \u201cunexpected\u201d or \u201cunforeseen,\u201d not whether the result was \u201cunintended.\u201d Our cases do provide compensation for unexpected injuries that were the result of intentional acts. While neither the claimant in <em>McKay </em>nor the one in the present case may have intentionally set out to break his hand, it would be pi-eposterous to say <em>it </em>was unanticipated that in punching a metal door, he could break his hand. If we were to adopt Larson\u2019s reliance on intent alone, compensation could be denied only when a claimant freely admitted to having intentionally punched a metal door in <em>order to </em>break his hand to spite his employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">Larson\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cthere is no place in compensation law\u201d for drawing such distinctions is simply wrong. Important social policy considerations support distinguishing the conduct in this ease from compensable conduct under the statute. It would be patently unwise to reward individuals who engage in this type of self-injurious conduct. Furthermore, our legislature has indicated its desire that we draw such distinctions by specifically limiting compensable claims under A.R.S. section 23-1021(A) to those occurring \u201cby accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">[955 P.2d at 19.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">As noted at the beginning of this opinion, a related but independent reason for rejecting Klein\u2019s compensation claim is that the risk of injury did not arise out of his employment. The phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 employment refers to causation. <em>Coleman v. Cycle Transformer Corp., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>285, 288, 520 A.2d 1341 (1986). A risk arises out of the employment when it \u201cmight have been contemplated by a reasonable person when entering the employment, as incidental to [that employment.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 520 A.2d 1341 (internal quotation marks omitted). A risk will be considered incidental to the employment when it \u201cbelongs to or is connected with what a workman has to do in fulfilling his\u201d duties. <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">In <em>Coleman, </em>the Court identified three types of risks, those distinctly associated with the employment, such as machinery breaking, objects falling, or fingers getting caught in gears; those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>which are neutral, such as lightning striking an employee during work; and those which are personal to the employee. <em>Id. </em>at 291-92, 520 A.2d 1341. Compensation is only permitted with respect to the first two kinds of risk. <em>Ibid. </em>With respect to the third category of risk, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">Risks falling within this classification [ (risks personal to the employee)) do not bear a sufficient causative relationship to the employment to permit courts to say that they arise out of that employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 292, 520 A.2d 1341.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In other words, when the harm arises because of the \u201cpersonal proclivities\u201d of the employee, compensation must be denied even though the injury takes place during the employment. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Applying these principles, we have denied recovery to an employee who shot himself while playing Russian Roulette. <em>Money v. Coin Depot Corp., </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>434, 691 A.2d 400 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>71, 697 A.2d 544 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">We conclude that the decedent\u2019s self-infliction of a fatal gunshot to his head resulted from a risk which was \u201cpersonal\u201d to him. The decedent\u2019s game of Russian Roulette was not a normal incident to his employment. It was a purely personal activity which was inimical to his employer\u2019s interests. It also was an activity which decedent ... could just as easily have engaged in while ... in his own automobile---- Moreover, even assuming decedent had no intention of taking his own life, his game of Russian Roulette was highly aberrant conduct which created a substantial risk of personal injury totally unrelated to the risks inherent in the normal conduct of the employer\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">[Id. at 438, 691 A.2d 400.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">Klein was prone to react with- intense emotion to criticism of his job performance. It was this personal proclivity that gave rise to his injury. Striking a hard object with his fist cannot be described as a normal incident of his employment. It was a purely personal act, however impulsive, adverse to his employer\u2019s interest, which created a serious risk of personal injury unconnected with the ordinary conduct of his work. Moreover, this case involves an injury resulting from an employee\u2019s fear that the criticism leveled against him by his supervisor suggested that he might lose his job. In <em>Walck v. Johns-Manville Products Corp., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>533, 267 A.2d 508 (1970), the Court said \u201c[tjhat kind of anxiety or tension cannot be considered a risk arising out of the employer\u2019s work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>557, 267 A.2d 508. And in <em>Cairns v. City of East Orange, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395, 631 A.2d 978 (App.Div.1993), we expanded on that theme with these observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">We recognize that drastic personnel action may in certain circumstances result in adverse mental and even physical consequences. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for businesses, even large enterprises, to cut back their workforce or to close their doors and displace an entire workforce. The resulting disability to a severed employee in some eases may be immediate, while in other instances it may occur slowly and progressively depending on personal factors such as inability of the layed-off worker to obtain work. It would be unusual for there not to be some emotional response by an employee to drastic personnel action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">Nonetheless, in the absence of evidence of a clear legislative intent to require payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for disability caused by varying personalized responses of employees to bona fide personnel decisions that alter an employee\u2019s work status, we are constrained to conclude that the burden of providing compensation to such employees may not be imposed upon an employer. Even where instances of such harm may be predictable, the stress or trauma caused by such personnel decisions is an ordinary part of life and is not so peculiar to the specific employment as to be deemed to arise out of the employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 401, 631 A.2d 978.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">In reaching our conclusion, we have kept in mind that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is \u201chumane social legislation designed to place the cost of work-connected injury upon the employer who may readily provide for it as an operating expense.\u201d <em>Tocci v. Tessler &amp; Weiss, Inc., </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>582, 586, 147 A.2d 783 (1959). Although we have demonstrated why we conclude the extant legal formulas will not permit compensation in this case, we have also considered the somewhat broader approach suggested by <em>Toed:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">The continued sweeping generality of the statutory language and its judicial definition suggest the conscientious endeavor to maintain a liberally just line between those accidental injuries which may be said to have had some work connection and those which may be said to have been unrelated to the employment. In drawing that line the courts have not rested on any legalistic formula but have sought to apply the comprehensive legislative compensation plan fairly and justly to the particular facts presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">[Id. at 587, 147 A.2d 783 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">In our view, a fair and just resolution of this case does not warrant compensation for this employee\u2019s willful, unreasonable, and idiosyncratic reaction to a commonplace personnel action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Therefore, the judgment entered by the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation is</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
