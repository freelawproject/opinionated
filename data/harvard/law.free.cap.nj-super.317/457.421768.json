(Rapid), was injured when struck by the door of a dumpster he was storing on land owned by defendant Enviro-Pak Systems Company, Inc. (Enviro).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the evidence, defendant moved for judgment, <em>R. </em>4:40-1. The trial judge, relying on <em>Majestic Realty Associates, v. Toti Contracting Co., </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>425, 153 A.2d 321 (1959), dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse and conclude that there were factual issues for the jury to consider as to the control retained by defendant over plaintiff\u2019s activity on defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We briefly recite the relevant facts. Plaintiff was employed as a dispatcher for Rapid, a residential and commercial trash hauler. In connection with its business, Rapid used large dumpsters approximately thirty feet in length, eight feet wide and six feet deep. The dumpsters had an open top and front panel which opened on hinges. For storage, dumpsters were turned on their sides and slid inside other dumpsters; however, such storage required maneuvering the inner dumpster so as to avoid damage to its components as well as to protect against the door falling and injuring someone. While the dumpsters were being moved, their doors were secured by a chain and fastened.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">On June 15,1993, plaintiff responded to a call from his supervisor, Geoffrey Ballah, to assist with storage of Rapid\u2019s dumpsters on the property of defendant,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an affiliated corporation that ran a recycling center. Ballah called upon plaintiff to assist him with the task; this was the first time plaintiff ever witnessed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>participated in this procedure. After moving the first set of dumpsters to the desired position, Ballah instructed plaintiff to remove the chain securing the outer dumpster\u2019s doorway so that it could be used to secure a new set of dumpsters for transport. When plaintiff removed the chain from the outer dumpster, the door of the inner dumpster dropped on him, causing his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The relationship between defendant and Rapid was explored at trial. Steve DiNardi was the president and one-third owner of both Rapid and Enviro. The remaining two-thirds were owned by his brother and sister. Both corporations were run as a \u201csmall family business,\u201d with DiNardi acting as the \u201ctop person\u201d in both. As to the daily operations, however, Geoffrey Ballah was the \u201coperations manager\u201d at Rapid, and Anthony Pannella was the \u201coperations manager\u201d at Enviro. Plaintiff testified that Ballah was plaintiffs supervisor at Rapid.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Conflicting testimony was presented as to the relationship between Ballah and Pannella. Clearly, Ballah had more seniority with the DiNardi companies. DiNardi noted that Ballah performed \u201csupervisory services\u201d for Enviro, including supervision of \u201cbasic operations and Mr. Pannella.\u201d DiNardi stated that although Pannella ran Enviro, he could \u201clook up to [Ballah'l to get information on ... how something may be handled.\u201d Further, if Pannella was out, the other Enviro employees could seek out Ballah for instruction. During a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing without the jury present, DiNardi explained that while Ballah was not paid by Enviro, responsibility overlapped because it was a small company \u2014 Ballah and Pannella \u201cworked close, hand-in-hand, because the Rapid Disposal vehicles dumped material at the Enviro-Pak facility.\u201d Ballah testified that he did have supervisory responsibilities at Enviro, as Pannella reported to him. Plaintiff corroborated that Pannella worked \u201cunder Ballah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Beyond the general organizational structure of the companies, the circumstances surrounding the specific dumpster storage procedure implemented on Enviro\u2019s property was also explored. Rapid stored up to thirty of its dumpsters on Enviro\u2019s property at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>a time, always without charge. According to DiNardi, he ultimately made the decision to store Rapid\u2019s dumpsters on Enviro\u2019s property, but he was unable to distinguish whether he made the decision as president of Rapid or Enviro. Essentially, he decided to store the dumpsters at Enviro in order to \u201cutilize additional space available to my businesses.\u201d Finally, DiNardi testified that the actual procedure of storing the dumpsters was left to Ballah\u2019s discretion, but he was aware of the process Ballah implemented. In sum, the lines of authority and control were not clearly defined as between Rapid and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Against this factual framework, we apply the applicable principles of law. \u201cAs a general rule, a landowner has a nondelegable duty to use reasonable care to protect invitees against known or reasonably discoverable dangers.\u201d <em>Dawson v. Bunker Hill Plaza Assoc., </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>309, 317, 673 A.2d 847 (App. Div.) (quoting <em>Kane v. Hartz Mountain Indus., </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 140, 650 A.2d 808 (App.Div.1994), <em>aff'd, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>141, 669 A.2d 816 (1996)), <em>certif. denied, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>569, 683 A.2d 1164 (1996); <em>Cassano v. Aschoff, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>110, 114-15, 543 A.2d 973 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>371, 550 A.2d 476 (1988); <em>see also Morris v. Krauszer\u2019s Food Stores, Inc., </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>529, 534-35, 693 A.2d 510 (App.Div.1997) (\u201cThe duty of the owner or possessor of land to protect business invitees from foreseeable harm is well established.\u201d). Clearly, this general rule operates to protect individuals performing work on the premises of the landowner, most commonly independent contractors and their employees. <em>Cassano, supra, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 115, 543 A.2d 973; <em>see, e.g., Dawson, supra, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 315, 673 A.2d 847 (carpenter employed by independent contractor injured while erecting roof trusses on the defendant\u2019s property); <em>Kane, supra, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 134, 650 A.2d 808 (steelworker employed by independent contractor injured while constructing steel structure for landowner\u2019s warehouse); <em>see also Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>sec. 332 and comments e and j (1964) (including industrial employees in definition of business visitor invitee).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>It is equally well-settled that the \u201clandowner is under no duty to protect an employee of an independent contractor from the very hazard created by doing the contract work.\u201d <em>Dawson, supra, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 318, 673 A.2d 847; <em>see Kane, supra, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 140, 650 A.2d 808. An independent contractor is one \u201cwho, in carrying on an independent business, contracts to do a piece of work according to his own methods without being subject to the control of the employer as to the means by which the result is to be accomplished but only as to the result of the work.\u201d <em>Bahrle v. Exxon Corp., </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>144, 157, 678 A.2d 225 (1996). This exception is carved out of the landowner\u2019s general duty to protect his invitees because the landowner may assume that the independent contractor and her employees are sufficiently skilled to recognize the dangers associated with their task and adjust their methods accordingly to ensure their own safety. <em>Dawson, supra, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 318, 673 A.2d 847; <em>Cassano, supra, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 115, 543 A.2d 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">This exception to the landowner\u2019s general duty of care is not absolute where the landowner retains a duty to exercise reasonable care for work involving independent contractors: first, where the landowner retains control over the \u201cmanner and means of the doing of the work which is the subject of the contract;\u201d second, where the landowner hires an incompetent contractor; or third, where the activity contracted for constitutes a nuisance <em>per se. Dawson, supra, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 318, 673 A.2d 847. These exceptions are the rule of <em>Majestic Realty, supra, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>at 431, 153 A.2d 321, utilized by the trial court here.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">We conclude that neither <em>Majestic Realty </em>nor the independent contractor exception to a landowner\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable care applies under the facts presented here. Rapid entered defendant\u2019s premises for the sole purpose of storing its own property for its own benefit. Rapid never contracted to do any work for defendant and was not acting as defendant\u2019s agent. As such, Rapid was not an independent contractor of defendant. However, a significant jury issue was presented as to defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>general duty as a landowner or occupant, including retention of control over the manner, methodology and placement of storage of the dumpsters on defendant\u2019s property. Whether Ballah was acting on behalf of defendant or Rapid was an issue for the jury, not for the trial judge on motion. The jury could have decided that given the interconnected relationship of the entities combined with the vague and ofttimes obscured lines of authority, defendant controlled the storage operation thus subjecting it to potential liability. We agree with the conclusion reached by the trial judge that the work performed did not create an inherently dangerous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Plaintiff is entitled to have the jury consider whether defendant is liable as the landowner based on the factual dispute as to the control exercised by defendant in the dumpster storage process.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"> Plaintiff also joined an affiliated company, Deco Maintenance Company, Inc., as a defendant. Deco was dismissed as a defendant by stipulation of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\"> Plaintiff\u2019s wife, Diane Accardi, was a named plaintiff on her <em>per quod </em>claim. For ease of reference, we will refer Joseph Accardi as plaintiff in the singular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-9\"> The property was actually owned by River Road Realty, a partnership of Rapid's principal.
