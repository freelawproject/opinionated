BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">Edward Wink, Jr., appellant, pled guilty in the Circuit Court for Charles County to distribution of PCP and was sentenced to four years imprisonment. Upon appellant\u2019s motion for modification of sentence, execution of the unserved portion of the sentence was subsequently suspended in favor of three-year supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">Appellant was charged with violating Rule 8 of his probation, which required that he not \u201cillegally possess, use or sell any narcotic drug, controlled dangerous substance, or related paraphernalia.\u201d At the revocation hearing, the State presented evidence that, upon execution of a search warrant at appellant\u2019s home, the following items were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>seized: from a kitchen cabinet, two bottles of parsley flakes; from the kitchen trash can, an empty parsley flake bottle, a vanilla extract bottle, and a sandwich bag with parsley flake residue; from the refrigerator, a glass jar containing several foil-wrapped packets of parsley, and two plastic film cannisters filled with parsley flakes; from the master bedroom, a set of scales, several cut squares of aluminum foil, and a \u20ac &amp; P Telephone bill addressed to the appellant. The State also presented expert testimony that parsley flakes are commonly used as a vehicle for, or diluent of, liquid PGP, and that individual quantities of PCP are commonly distributed as foil-wrapped packets of PCP-laced parsley.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The court concluded that appellant had violated his probation by possessing drug paraphernalia, revoked appellant\u2019s probation, and reimposed two years of the original sentence, with credit for eighteen months already served. Appellant presents two questions on appeal from that judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">1. Did the trial court err in applying an inappropriate standard in determining that appellant violated his probation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">2. Was the evidence insufficient to establish that appellant violated a condition of his probation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, appellant\u2019s counsel moved for judgment of acquittal. During his argument on the motion, he stated that the burden on the prosecution was \u201cto prove every element to a reasonable certainty. That is the test by a reasonable certainty.\u201d Interrupting counsel, the court stated that the test was \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Undeterred counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">No, Sir, reasonable certainty. That is the case law dealing with violation of probations, which is a higher standard than preponderance of the evidence and some people think it is [a] higher than clear and convincing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>It is definitely short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt but it is certainly more than by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The motion was denied and appellant rested without putting on a defense. Thereafter, appellant \u201crenewed\u201d his motion for judgment of acquittal and, after argument, during which no further mention of the standard of proof was made, the matter was presented to the court for decision. The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">I think that given the testimony in its entirety as to what was located in the house, I conclude that the State has shown that there was a violation of probation in that Mr. Wink did have in his possession controlled paraphernalia and I find him to be in violation of his probation on that basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Appellant contends that the court applied the wrong standard of proof. He claims that the court used the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard instead of the \u201creasonable certainty,\u201d standard and, because \u201creasonable certainty\u201d is a higher standard than \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d, his constitutional right to due process was violated. Although we, too, assume that the court applied the \u201cpreponderance\u201d standard, we will nevertheless affirm the judgment. We do not agree that \u201creasonable certainty\u201d is a more stringent standard of proof than \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">The nature of probation and of revocation proceedings is well-settled in Maryland. The Court of Appeals, in <em>Smith v. State, </em>306 Md. 1, 6-7, 506 A.2d 1165 (1986), quite recently has summarized their characteristics:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">Probation is a matter of grace which is in effect a bargain made by the people with the malefactor that he may be free as long as he conducts himself in a manner consonant with established communal standards and the safety of society. <em>Donaldson v. State, </em>305 Md. 522, 531, 505 A.2d 527 (1986) (quoting <em>Scott v. State, </em>238 Md. 265, 275, 208 A.2d 575 (1965).) <em>See also Matthews v. State, </em>304 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Md. 281, 292-93, 498 A.2d 655 (1985). Accordingly, the procedural protections given a probationer are not the same as those afforded a defendant at a criminal trial, and probation may be revoked by a trial court if it is reasonably satisfied that a violation of a condition of probation has occurred. <em>Howlett v. State, </em>295 Md. 419, 456 A.2d 375 (1983); <em>Hutchinson v. State, </em>292 Md. 367, 369, 438 A.2d 1335 (1982); <em>Dean v. State, </em>291 Md. 198, 202, 434 A.2d 552 (1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The State has the burden of proving that a violation of probation has occurred. <em>Coles v. State, </em>290 Md. 296, 429 A.2d 1029 (1981); <em>Humphrey v. State, </em>290 Md. 164, 428 A.2d 440 (1981); <em>Fuller v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 339, 349, 495 A.2d 366 (1985), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>308 Md. 547, 520 A.2d 1315 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Although we have interpreted \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d to require the establishment of the fact of a violation \u201c... with enough reasonable certainty\u2014but not beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014to satisfy the conscience of the court____ If the facts incline a reasonable and impartial mind to the belief that the probationer has violated a term of his probation, that is sufficient to revoke or modify,\u201d (citations omitted) <em>Herold v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 295, 302, 449 A.2d 429 (1982), we are not aware of any case decided in this jurisdiction which has considered whether it is a more or less stringent standard than \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d Other jurisdictions employing the same, or a similar, standard of proof in revocation proceedings have considered the issue, however, and those jurisdictions have defined \u201creasonable certainty\u201d or \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d as requiring less evidence than a preponderance. <em>See e.g., Armstrong v. State, </em>294 Ala. 100, 312 So.2d 620, 623 (1975) (less than a preponderance); <em>State v. Ford, </em>707 P.2d 16, 19 (Mont.1985) <em>{\u201cAll </em>that is required is ... that the judge is reasonably satisfied.\u201d (Emphasis in original)); <em>State v. Brinson, </em>248 Ga. 380, 283 S.E.2d 463, 465 (1981) (\u201cGeorgia adheres to the \u201cslight evidence\u201d rule in probation revocation proceedings.\u201d); <em>State v. Brusenhan, </em>78 N.M. 764, 438 P.2d 174, 176 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>(App.1968). (Standard is akin to Georgia\u2019s standard of \u201cslight evidence\u201d); <em>State v. Burkman, </em>281 N.W.2d 442, 443 (S.D.1979) (\u201cFour standards of proof have been adopted by the various jurisdictions in revocation hearings: 1) reasonably satisfied; 2) a preponderance; 3) clear and convincing; and 4) beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (citations omitted)). We find these cases persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Moreover, we think the nature of revocation proceedings militate in favor of the conclusion that \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d is no more stringent a standard than \u201cpreponderance.\u201d The proceedings are informal, <em>see Scott v. State, </em>238 Md. 265, 271, 208 A.2d 575 (1965); they are not subject to all of the limitations and restrictions which apply to a criminal trial, <em>Edwardsen v. State, </em>220 Md. 82, 88, 151 A.2d 132 (1959) and a probationer does not enjoy the procedural rights attendant to a criminal trial. <em>See Smith, </em>306 Md. at 6, 506 A.2d 1165. Evidence inadmissible in a criminal trial may be admissible in revocation proceedings, <em>See State v. Fuller, </em>308 Md. 547, 553, 520 A.2d 1315 (1987) (reasonably reliable hearsay) and <em>Chase v. State, </em>309 Md. 224, 251, 522 A.2d 1348 (1987) (evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure). And, of course, proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not required. <em>Herold, supra. </em>The nature of probation inclines us to the same conclusion; it is, after all, a discretionary matter\u2014a matter of grace, not entitlement. <em>Smith, supra. </em>Finally, the context in which the Courts have stated the standard is, we believe, consistent with the view we take. <em>See, e.g., Dean v. State, </em>291 Md. at 202, 434 A.2d 552, in which the Court of Appeals commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">The procedural protections afforded a probationer at a revocation of probation hearing are not equivalent to those accorded at a criminal trial. Formal procedures and the rules of evidence are not employed. Finally, before probation may be revoked, the trial court <em>need only be reasonably satisfied that there was, in fact, a violation of probation, </em>(Emphasis added, citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>and <em>Scott, </em>238 Md. at 272, 208 A.2d 575, in which the Court quoting, with approval, <em>Manning v. United States, </em>161 F.2d 827, 829 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>332 U.S. 792, 68 S.Ct. 102, 92 L.Ed. 374 (1947), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">\u201cBut proof sufficient to support a criminal conviction is not required to support a judge\u2019s discretionary order revoking probation. A judge in such proceeding need not have evidence that would establish beyond a reasonable doubt guilt of criminal offenses. <em>All that is required is that the evidence and the facts be such as to reasonably satisfy the judge that the conduct of the probationer has not been as good as required by the conditions </em>of probation.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Accordingly, we hold that appellant\u2019s constitutional right to due process was not violated by the court\u2019s use of the preponderance standard in determining that appellant violated a condition of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Appellant contends that the court abused its discretion in revoking his probation because the evidence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">(1) failed to show that the items seized were \u201cparaphernalia\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">(2) failed to establish that appellant was in possession of the items.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-11\">We disagree on both counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">Subsections (2) and (3) of Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 287(d) provide, in pertinent part, that \u201ccontrolled paraphernalia\u201d shall mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-14\">(2) ... any ... container suitable for the packaging of individual quantities of controlled dangerous substances in sufficient quantity to and under circumstances which reasonably indicate an intention to use any such item for the illegal manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of any such controlled dangerous substance. Evidence of such circumstances shall include but not be limited to close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>proximity of any such controlled paraphernalia to any adulterants or equipment commonly used in the illegal manufacture and distribution of controlled dangerous substances ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">(3) ... any ... substance suitable as a diluent or adulterant in sufficient quantity and under such circumstances which reasonably indicate an intention to use any such substance for the illegal manufacture, distribution or dispensing of any controlled substance. Evidence of such circumstances shall include but not be limited to close proximity of any such controlled paraphernalia to any other adulterants, diluents, or equipment commonly used in the illegal manufacture and distribution of controlled substances____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The evidence presented in this case was that aluminum foil squares are a \u201ccontainer suitable for the packaging of individual quantities of\u201d PCP, and are \u201ccommonly used\u201d as such. There was also evidence that parsley flakes are a \u201csubstance suitable as a diluent or adulterant\u201d of PCP, and are \u201ccommonly used\u201d as such. Moreover, evidence was presented showing that foil and parsley were found in the refrigerator in \u201cclose proximity\u201d of one another in the form of foil-wrapped packets of parsley. To be sufficient, the evidence in this case had to be such as to establish th\u00bf existence of \u201ccircumstances which reasonably indicate an intention to use any such item [substance] for the illegal manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of\u201d PCP. It is the existence of such circumstances that transforms an otherwise intrinsically innocuous item or substance into \u201ccontrolled paraphernalia.\u201d The cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to permit the trial judge to be \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d that the items seized were \u201ccontrolled paraphernalia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Appellant was present on the premises when the search warrant was executed. As we have already noted, one of the items seized was a telephone bill addressed to appellant at those premises. We think that evidence suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>cient to support an inference that appellant had a possessory interest in the premises. That, in turn, is sufficient to support the further inference that he, at least constructively, possessed the \u201ccontrolled paraphernalia\u201d found on the premises. <em>See Folk v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 508, 518, 275 A.2d 184 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">We hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in revoking appellant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
