Friel (\u201cFriel\u201d) is endeavoring to protect a food cannery it operates on land adjacent to property upon which the Triangle Oil Co. (\u201cTriangle\u201d) seeks to locate an oil storage facility. The Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County affirmed the County Board of Appeals' decision approving the issuance of a permit to Triangle, and Friel noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">Friel presents three questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">I. Was the Circuit Court correct in declaring the temporary zoning moratorium, void <em>ab initio </em>because it constituted a taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-14\">II. Was the moratorium void because it was stated to be effective less than ten days after the adoption hearing, in contravention of Code Article 66B, Section 4.04(a)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-15\">III. Did the Planning Commission and the Board of Appeals fail to independently review the project as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>to surrounding use compatibility and safety as required by the Site Plan Requirements and Review Procedure?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Effective July 16, 1986, Queen Anne\u2019s County adopted a temporary zoning moratorium, called an \u201cOverall Moratorium,\u201d to be in effect while the County completed a revised Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Ordinance (\u201cPlan\u201d). Various environmental factors necessitated the enactment of a new zoning plan. The moratorium was to expire on the earlier of December 31, 1986 or the adoption of the revised Plan, but was later extended to April 14, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Triangle applied for and was granted an exemption from the moratorium by Resolution No. 44, dated September 8, 1986. The exemption allowed Triangle to file for the permits required to develop an oil storage facility on an 8.5 acre parcel of land on Starr-Grange Hall Road. As grounds for the exemption, the Resolution stated: (1) the development would result in the relocation of an existing facility and would alleviate an existing potential health threat; (2) Triangle had been involved in obtaining permits for this property for over a year prior to the adoption of the moratorium; and (8) the proposed facility would not create additional sewage and was not inconsistent with the proposed Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">After obtaining the exemption, Triangle applied for and received, over Friel\u2019s objections, site plan approval and ultimately a building permit. Friel appealed to the Board of Appeals of Queen Anne\u2019s County, which made three findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">(1) Friel, as a third-party non-applicant, has no right of appeal from the Planning Commission\u2019s approval of the Site Plan, but does have standing to appeal the grant of a building permit; (2) the Board of Appeals has no jurisdiction to review the grant of an exemption by the County Commissioners; and (3) inasmuch as the various State agencies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>upon whose expertise the Zoning Board relies, had given their approval to the technical aspects of the safety of Triangle\u2019s proposal, and because the proposed use is permitted by the land\u2019s \u201cM-2\" zoning, the Board of Appeals has no authority to deny Triangle\u2019s application on the basis of Friel\u2019s allegation of \u201cincompatibility.\u201d The appeals board, therefore, affirmed the issuance of Triangle\u2019s permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Friel then appealed to the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County. In a Memorandum Opinion and Order dated August 20, 1987, the court agreed with the Board of Appeals and upheld the issuance of the permit. The court also held that the grant of an exemption from the moratorium by the County Commissioners to Triangle was unnecessary because the Overall Moratorium was void <em>ab initio </em>as an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In response to a Rule 2-534 motion by Friel, on October 27, 1987 the trial court issued a supplemental Memorandum Opinion and Order. This Order addressed Friel\u2019s contention that Triangle\u2019s exemption was ineffective because no publication or public hearing preceded approval of the exemption. The court agreed with Friel that proper notice and hearing had not been given before the exemption was granted. Moreover, the court found that there was no evidence that the County Commissioners complied with the procedure dictated by the moratorium which permits amendments by the County Commissioners that are \u201cbased upon the advise [sic] of the Queen Anne\u2019s County Planning Commission and the Planning Director as to the progress in the development of the proposed Master Plan and development regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The court also noted another ground for voiding the moratorium. The Maryland Code, art. 66B \u00a7 4.04 (1988 Repl.Vol.) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">(a) <em>Authority of local legislative body; public hear</em>ing.\u2014The local legislative body shall provide for the manner in which such regulations and restrictions and the boundaries of such districts shall be determined, estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>lished, and enforced, and from time to time amended, supplemented, modified, or repealed. However, a regulation, restriction, or boundary may not become effective until 10 days after at least 1 public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The court found non-compliance with this provision of the Code, and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">Unfortunately, the Overall Moratorium, which can certainly be classified as a \u201crestriction\u201d and also an \u201camendment,\u201d \u201csupplement\u201d or \u201cmodification\u201d to the original Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance as amended to that point in time, was adopted July 15, 1986 to be effective from July 16, 1986. This was less than 10 days after the public hearing held on July 8, 1986 and in contravention of the last mentioned statutory requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">It can be concluded from these findings that the Court disagrees with the contention of Triangle that the adoption of the Overall Moratorium and Resolution No. 44 are not subject to the procedures prescribed in Code Article 66B and the [Queen Anne\u2019s County Comprehensive Zoning] Ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Nevertheless, these findings did not affect the court\u2019s ruling on Triangle\u2019s behalf on the ground that the Overall Moratorium was unconstitutional and invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">I. Constitutionality of the Overall Moratorium</p>\n<p id=\"AWX\">In its first argument, appellant contends that the moratorium was imposed for the public good, was temporary (lasting less than nine months), and, therefore, did not constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d of private property without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">In <em>Ungar v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 472, 492 A.2d 1336 (1985), <em>US. cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1066, 106 S.Ct. 1379, 89 L.Ed.2d 604 (1986), this court was presented with a challenge to a sewer moratorium. In that case we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number><em>\u201cA </em>regulation which prohibits a beneficial use of private property constitutes a fair exercise of the police power if the public interest generally requires it and the regulation is reasonably necessary to achieve the public goal without being unduly oppressive upon individuals.\u201d <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. Comm\u2019n v. Chadwick, </em>[286 Md. 1] at page 9, 405 A.2d 241 [1979], <em>Edgewood Nursing Home v. Maxwell, </em>282 Md. 422, 384 A.2d 748 (1978), <em>Smoke Rise, Inc. v. Washington Suburban San. Com\u2019n, </em>[400 F.Supp. 1369 (D.Md.1975)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><em>Ungar, </em>63 Md.App. at 481-82, 492 A.2d 1336.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The Overall Moratorium at issue was adopted \u201cin the public interest to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of Queen Anne's County.\u201d A stated purpose was to avoid a flux of \u201cspeculative and poorly thought out development proposals prepared specifically to avoid the intent\u201d of the new land use regulations that were being prepared. The moratorium did not affect the development of single-family homes that had received approval, or the development of multi-family and commercial structures that had received final site plan approval. Initially, the moratorium was to last less than six months; it was, however, extended and was in effect for almost nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Nevertheless, the trial court held the moratorium unconstitutional. The trial court relied upon the recent Supreme Court decision, <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 , 107 S.Ct. 2378, 2388, 96 L.Ed.2d 250 (1987), which held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">\u201ctemporary\u201d takings which ... deny a landowner all use of his property, are not different in kind from permanent takings, for which the Constitution clearly requires compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The trial court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">Because the Overall Moratorium did not provide for the payment of just compensation, it was unconstitutional as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>applied to Triangle\u2019s property and was thus of no effect. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\">Although Triangle is not seeking compensation for even a 6 month\u2019s \u201ctaking\u201d, it can certainly seek relief by way of a declaration of invalidity as to its site plan application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We disagree with the trial court\u2019s analysis and conclusion. As the California Court of Appeals explained in <em>Guinnane v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>197 Cal.App.3d 862, 241 Cal.Rptr. 787 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">Although the Supreme Court has determined that a temporary regulatory taking is compensable, there is nothing in <em>First English </em>which changes the rule that \u201ctaking\u201d must occur before compensation may be claimed. In <em>First English, </em>the court <em>assumed </em>a taking had occurred. On the appeal from the trial court\u2019s order striking a portion of the complaint, the lower court and the Supreme Court <em>accepted as true </em>the allegation that the county\u2019s ordinance denied the landowner <em>all </em>use of the property. Thus, the court framed the issue before it as \u201cwhether abandonment by the government requires payment of compensation for the period of time during which regulations deny a landowner <em>all use </em>of his land.\u201d <em>(First English, supra, </em>482 U.S. at p. \u2014 [96 L.Ed.2d at p. 265, 107 S.Ct. at p. 2387], italics added.) The court remanded the matter for further proceedings on whether a regulatory taking had actually occurred: \u201cwhether the ordinance at issue actually denied appellant all use of its property or whether the county might avoid the conclusion that a compensable taking had occurred by establishing that the denial of all use was insulated as a part of the State\u2019s authority to enact safety regulations.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. \u2014\u2014 [96 L.Ed.2d at p. 262, 107 S.Ct. at pp. 2384-2385].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 868, 241 Cal.Rptr. at 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">In the case at bar, we need not decide whether there was a compensable \u201ctaking\u201d within the meaning of <em>First English </em>because Triangle did not and does not seek compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>sation. Moreover, even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that a \u201ctaking\u201d did occur, we would not hold the moratorium void. The Fifth Amendment does not prohibit the taking of private property; it merely makes compensation a condition of the exercise of that power. <em>See First English, </em>107 S.Ct. at 2385.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">It behooves us at this point to stress again that we do not now decide whether <em>First English </em>is applicable to a temporary moratorium as occurred here. The Supreme Court specifically limited its holding to the facts before it; it did \u201cnot deal with the quite different questions that would arise iii the case of normal delays in obtaining building permits, changes in zoning ordinances, variances, and the like.\u201d <em>First English, </em>107 S.ct. at 2389.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">As the <em>Guinnane </em>court reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">Although the United States Supreme Court in <em>First English </em>has now overruled the California Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Agins </em>decision on another point <em>[see Agins v. Tiburon, </em>447 U.S. 255, 100 S.Ct. 2138, 65 L.Ed.2d 106 (1980) ], there is nothing in <em>First English </em>which alters the established principle that the interim burden imposed on a landowner during the government\u2019s decisionmaking process, absent unreasonable delay, does not constitute a taking____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">We therefore discern from <em>Agins </em>and <em>First English </em>that the temporary suspension of land use which occurs during the normal governmental decisionmaking process does not constitute a taking. Accordingly, the interim delay which occurred herein while the city studied the possible acquisition of plaintiff\u2019s property as an open space area did not constitute a compensable taking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0\"><em>Guinnane, </em>197 Cal.App.3d at 869-70, 241 Cal.Rptr. 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we hold that the moratorium was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">II. Effective Date of the Moratorium</p>\n<p id=\"Ath\">Friel also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s holding that the moratorium was void because of its effective date. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The moratorium went into effect on July 16, 1986, eight days after a public hearing was held thereon. Article 66B, \u00a7 4.04(a) of the Maryland Code requires a minimum ten-day period between the holding of the requisite public hearing and the effective date of the County ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">As appellant correctly asserts, however, a premature effective date does not void the County\u2019s action; rather, the effective date is delayed to comport with the statute. <em>See, e.g., County Council v. Carl M. Freeman Assoc., Inc., </em>281 Md. 70, 78, 376 A.2d 860 (1977); <em>Woelfel v. State, </em>177 Md. 494, 504-05, 9 A.2d 826 (1939). Although the cases cited involved State laws, we would apply the rule equally to municipal ordinances. <em>See Yorkdale v. Powell, </em>237 Md. 121, 130, 205 A.2d 269 (1964). Thus, we conclude the moratorium was not voided by its premature effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">III. Compliance with \u00a7 17.161</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Section 17.161 of the \u201cAmendment to Queen Anne\u2019s County Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance to Provide for Site Plan Requirement and Review Procedure\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">In reviewing the site plan the Planning Commission or its designee shall consider the standards and purposes of these regulations <em>with a view toward achieving a maximum of coordination between the proposed development and the surrounding uses', </em>the conservation of woodland and prime agricultural land; the protection of all wetlands; the conservation of fish and wildlife habitats; the locations of areas to be maintained in existing state; the protection of watercourses from erosion and siltation; and the safety and convenience of the public. To these ends, the Planning Commission or its designee shall consider the location of buildings, parking areas, and other features with respect to the topography of the lot and existing features, such as streams and large trees; the efficiency, adequacy, and safety of the proposed layout of internal streets and driveways; the adequacy and location of any open space provided, bearing in mind the possible effects of irregularly shaped lots; the ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>quacy, location and screening of the parking lots; and such other matters as the Planning Commission or its designee may find to have a material bearing upon the stated standards and objectives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Appellant\u2019s attack focuses on the introductory phrase, and in particular on the words \u201cmaximum of coordination between the proposed development and the surrounding uses.\u201d Appellant contends that neither the Planning Commission nor the Board of Appeals properly considered the compatibility of a food cannery and a petroleum storage facility on neighboring parcels of land. Appellant complains that both agencies felt compelled to grant approval to Triangle because the proposed use is permitted by the property\u2019s \u201cM-2\u201d zoning. As the Board of Appeals stated, \u201c[njeither the Planning Commission, the Zoning Administrator nor this Board has the authority to substitute its judgment for that of the County Commissioners in matters relating to what uses should be permitted in what district.\u201d According to appellant, this deference to permitted uses conflicts with the agencies\u2019 duty to achieve \u201ccompatible uses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The concerns raised by Friel were fire safety, potential contamination of his food products through underground leakage, and aesthetic considerations. The record reflects that each of Friel\u2019s health, environmental and safety concerns were considered and addressed by the Planning Commission and the Board of Appeals. Various state agencies such as the Department of Health and the Department of Natural Resources approved Triangle\u2019s plans. Reliance on the opinion of these state agencies with regard to matters that are peculiarly within their competence was proper. <em>Amberley Community Ass\u2019n v. Board of Appeals, </em>229 Md. 261, 267, 182 A.2d 811 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Appellant now concedes that the technical requirements of Triangle\u2019s project were met, and that \u201cif the Planning Commission and the Board of Appeals had reviewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>project under the standards adopted in Section 17.161 of the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, the Circuit Court would be in no position to second guess these administrative agencies under the \u2018fairly debatable\u2019 doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Friel argues, however, that the proposed use is \u201cincompatible\u201d (within the meaning of \u00a7 17.161) with the existing use of his property. In essence, Friel is asking the County to reject an otherwise acceptable project because it is not aesthetically compatible with his business and will make a \u201cpoor impression\u201d on his customers. As Friel testified before the Board of Appeals, \u201cthe people that come visit us that buy our product, once they ride down the road and see that old tank farm installation, will [not] hold S.E.W. Friel in the posture that we have developed in 82 years of business. They simply will not condone it, they will not like it.\u201d To this assertion, the Board of Appeals reasoned it could not \u201csubstitute its judgment for that of the County Commissioners in matters relating to what uses should be permitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Although the Board of Appeals has made a correct statement of the law, we also find some merit in appellant\u2019s argument and, therefore, shall remand pursuant to Maryland Rule 1071. We explain.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">A site plan is a plan required to be submitted by the builder, showing the proposed location of the buildings, parking areas, and other installations on the plot, and their relation to existing conditions, such as roads, neighboring land uses, natural features, public facilities, ingress and egress roads, interior roads, and similar features.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Rathkopf, <em>The Law of Zoning and Planning </em>\u00a7 62.01 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Site plan review is a relatively recent feature of modern land use regulation. <em>See Moriarty v. Planning Bd., </em>506 N.Y.S.2d 184, 119 A.D.2d 188 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The discussion on \u201csite plan review\u201d in 5 Williams <em>American Land Planning Law </em>\u00a7 152.01 is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">Many modern zoning ordinances contain provisions for site plan review, and this is among the most useful techniques employed in modern zoning. In many communities, especially largely built-up ones, most new development takes place by the assembly of several lots and their redevelopment by private investment, usually without public assistance. In regulating such redevelopment, site plan review performs a function analogous to subdivision control (on vacant land) and urban renewal (for worn-out areas). Like most administrative arrangements, such provisions may of course be misconceived or misused, to deal with matters far beyond their appropriate function. Properly conceived, such regulations are concerned primarily with (a) the layout of buildings and open space, including parking areas, and (b) the provisons for access to and from the public street system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 281-282.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In direct opposition to the viewpoint espoused by appellant, <em>Williams, supra, </em>opines that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">[I]t is important that the distinction [between special permits and site plan review] be maintained\u2014particularly in those states where the planning board is not permitted to take over the special permit function. If in the course of site plan review the planning board takes over the power to decide whether the proposed use is appropriate at that spot, in terms of its impact on the neighborhood, the traffic it generates, etc., then site plan review becomes assimilated to the special permit function, and there is no difference between them. In order to avoid this, it is therefore important in drawing up a site plan review ordinance to spell out the grounds of review in detail\u2014and so to avoid making everything a special permit use by the planning board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>Williams, supra </em>at 282 (footnote omitted). <em>Cf. Southland Corporation 7-Eleven Stores v. Mayor and City Council of Laurel, </em>75 Md.App. 375, 541 A.2d 653 (1988).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">An expressly permitted use by zoning designation is \u201ctantamount to a legislative finding that the use [is] in harmony with the general zoning plan.\u201d <em>Rathkopf </em>at 62-17 (citing <em>Darswan, Inc. v. Capellini, 58 </em>A.D.2d 892, 397 N.Y.S.2d 4 (1977)). Thus, in reviewing a site plan, the Planning Commission may consider only those factors specifically enumerated in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In light of these principles, we conclude there is no merit to appellant\u2019s theory that the Planning Commission and Board of Appeals, in their decision making process, must consider the compatibility of existing and proposed uses. These bodies do not, under the guise of site plan review, have the discretion to deny a permitted use on the basis of a determination of \u201cincompatible uses.\u201d As we noted, appellant construes the phrase \u201ccoordination between the proposed development and the surrounding uses\u201d to mean \u201ccompatible uses.\u201d We reject this construction. The compatibility of uses is predetermined by the parcels\u2019 designated M-2 zoning. Rather, we conclude that the \u201ccoordination\u201d to be achieved is environmental and aesthetic. The statute stresses preservation of the environment and safety. Among other things, therefore, the Planning Commission is told to consider the land\u2019s topography, the adequacy and location of open spaces, and the screening of the parking lots. To the extent that the record supports the appellant\u2019s assertion that aesthetics was not a consideration of the Planning Commission and the Board of Appeals, we agree that there was noncompliance with \u00a7 17.161. Moreover, the Planning Commission must exercise its independent discretion in reaching its decision. We note in particular \u00a7 17.166, entitled \u201cPreliminary Site Plan Requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>and Review Procedure,\u201d subsection C \u201cAction by Planning Commission,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">The Planning Commission shall not approve a final site plan if it finds that the development would not achieve a maximum of compatibility, safety, and efficiency; and the fact that a site plan complies with all of the stated general regulations, development standards, or other specific requirements of the zone shall not, by itself, be deemed to create a presumption that the proposed site plan is compatible with surrounding land uses and, in itself, shall not necessarily be sufficient to require approval of the proposed site plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\n<em>Remand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The trial court, in its Memorandum Opinion and Order dated October 27, 1987, held that the exemption granted to Triangle was procedurally defective because of noncompliance with \u00a7\u00a7 21.21 and 22.22 of the Queen Anne\u2019s County Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance which specifies the proper procedure to amend the Overall Moratorium. Because the court held the Overall Moratorium unconstitutional and void <em>ab initio, </em>however, the defective exemption was irrelevant. Inasmuch as we have today upheld the validity of the Overall Moratorium, we remand to the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County directing it to remand the matter to the Planning Commission for Queen Anne\u2019s County with instructions to require a reapplication by Triangle and, if made, to review the application under the standards set forth in Section 17.161 of the former Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-6\">. We believe that the Mayor and City Council of Laurel effectively endowed its Planning Commission with the authority to determine whether the proposed use was appropriate at the proposed location in terms of its impact on the traffic that would be generated there. The County Commissioners of Queen Anne's County did not bestow such broad powers on its Planning Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">. The County Commissioners of Queen Anne\u2019s County, effective November 3, 1987, adopted a new Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations. Section 1003 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">C. <em>Pending matters. </em>Any of the following matters filed after December 31, 1985, and prior to the effective date of this section shall be processed and/or decided in accordance with the ordinance in effect on the date on which the particular matter was filed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>3. applications ... for site plan approval, if such application received preliminary approval by the Planning Commission prior to the effective date of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIzX\">In <em>Yorkdale </em>v. <em>Powell, supra, </em>it was held that \"... a change in the law after a decision below and before a final decision by the appellate court will be applied by that court unless vested or accrued substantial rights would be disturbed or <em>unless the legislature shows a contrary </em>intent____\u201d (Emphasis supplied). We discern a clear legislative intent on the part of the Commissioners for Queen Anne\u2019s County to apply the old rules rather than the new ones in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
