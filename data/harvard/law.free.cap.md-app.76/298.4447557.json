Our chore is complicated by counsel\u2019s non-compliance with Rules 8-501(h) and (i) (formerly Rule 1028 a) concerning the Table of Contents and Format of the Record Extract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Appellant and cross appellee, Janice L. Roebuck, and others, were sued in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County as guarantors of the debts of Express Liquors, Inc., a bankrupt corporation, by six liquor suppliers of that corporation. Alleging that any liability on her part to those creditors was caused by the conduct of her attorney, R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Calvert Steuart, appellee and cross appellant, Ms. Roebuck filed a third party claim against Steuart, demanding indemnification from Steuart for any judgment entered against her in favor of those creditors. Rule 2-332(a). She added two other counts to her \u201cThird Party Complaint,\u201d alleging \u201clegal malpractice\u201d and \u201cbreach of fiduciary duty\u201d against Steuart. In those counts, she sought compensatory and exemplary damages from Steuart based on (1) a judgment for $60,238.85 entered against her in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland in favor of Suburban Bank, another creditor of Express Liquors, Inc., and (2) the loss of $22,379.36, the proceeds from the sale of her home, which she had paid toward the debts of Express Liquors. Both of these losses she attributed to improper action or inaction by Steuart as her attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Prior to trial, judgment was entered against Roebuck in favor of the liquor suppliers. Those claims are no longer a part of the case. At the conclusion of Roebuck\u2019s case, the circuit court granted Steuart\u2019s motion for judgment as to Roebuck\u2019s indemnity claim on those judgments. The trial court also ruled that there was insufficient evidence to permit jury consideration of the issues of punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees or mental anguish.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The jury found, on special issues submitted, that Steuart\u2019s malpractice caused Roebuck to lose the proceeds from the sale of her home and to suffer a judgment in favor of Suburban Bank in the amount of $60,000. The court entered judgment in favor of Roebuck against Steuart for $22,379.36, and further ordered that \u201cJanice L. Roebuck may hereafter have judgment against R. Calvert Steuart for the amount (not to exceed Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00)) which she proves she has paid to Suburban Bank on its judgment against her, including interest on said judgment.\u201d Both sides appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">On her appeal, Roebuck raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">I. Did the trial court err in deciding that the verdict of $60,000 in favor of Roebuck as damages for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>adverse Suburban Bank judgment should be contingent upon her payment of that judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">II. Did the trial court err in deciding that Roebuck did not prove that she would have terminated her revocable liquor supplier guarantees if so advised, or what her liability would have been had she terminated the guarantees, and in therefore precluding the jury from considering the adverse liquor suppliers\u2019 judgments as an element of Roebuck\u2019s compensatory damage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">III. Did the trial court err in deciding that the facts showing attorney Steuart\u2019s reckless disregard for his client\u2019s legal rights were insufficient as a matter of law to support punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees or recovery for mental anguish?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">On his cross appeal, Steuart questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">A. Whether Roebuck\u2019s claim for indemnity on the Suburban Bank judgment was barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">B. Whether Roebuck\u2019s claims as to the Suburban Bank judgment and the loss of the proceeds from the sale of her home were proper \u201cThird Party\u201d claims?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">C. Whether the trial court should have granted Steuart\u2019s motion for judgment because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">1. There was no evidence that Roebuck\u2019s investment of the $22,379.36 was in reliance on Steuart\u2019s statements or omissions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">2. There was no evidence that Steuart\u2019s conduct was the proximate cause of the Suburban Bank judgment against Roebuck?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">We shall reverse the trial court\u2019s order making the $60,-000 judgment contingent upon Roebuck\u2019s payment of Suburban\u2019s judgment against her, and affirm the judgment as to the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">From April of 1973 until May of 1983 appellant, Janice L. Roebuck, was married to John Oliverio. In May of 1976, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Oliverio and Mr. and Mrs. Howard Harrison purchased Express Liquors, Inc., becoming its sole stockholders. Appellee, R. Calvert Steuart, attorney, represented Oliverio in the purchase of the business, and thereafter represented Express Liquors, Inc., Oliverio and Roebuck in various corporate and personal legal matters. Roebuck testified that Steuart prepared her will, advised her in a child custody matter, represented her when she was personally sued, and generally fulfilled the role of her \u201cpersonal attorney.\u201d Although she was neither an officer nor a stockholder of Express, Roebuck joined with Oliverio and the Harrisons in the execution of guarantees to wholesale liquor suppliers to induce those suppliers to extend credit for inventory delivered to Express. Steuart was aware of the guarantees, which were revocable upon written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">While the specific chronology is not altogether clear, it appears that sometime in 1977 or 1978 the Harrisons\u2019 stock was redeemed by Express. Shortly thereafter, Steuart purchased 45% of the stock and later acquired the remaining 5%. Thus, by early 1979, Oliverio and Steuart each was the owner of 50% of Express. Sometime during this period, Suburban Bank made loans to Express totaling $60,000. These loans were personally guaranteed by Oliverio, Roebuck, and Mr. and Mrs. Steuart.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Sometime in late 1980, Oliverio began to \u201cfloat\u201d or \u201ckite\u201d checks between two Express Liquors bank accounts at First American Bank and Equitable Bank. There was evidence from which the jury could find that this scheme was with the knowledge and consent of Steuart, who at that time was an owner of Express and was performing bookkeeping functions for the company. Oliverio testified that checks were written by him based on Steuart\u2019s promises to \u201cget the money\u201d in time to cover them, which Steuart did not \u201cget.\u201d Roebuck had no knowledge of the financial situation at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On 30 July 1981, First American Bank notified Oliverio that it was aware of his check kiting scheme and that Express was overdrawn by $87,000. Oliverio discussed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>matter with Steuart, who \u201cexplained\u201d that the \u201ckite\u201d was actually only one-half that amount because it was between two banks. Oliverio then informed Roebuck of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Oliverio and Roebuck were to settle for the sale of their jointly owned home on the next day, and expected to receive $44,000 from that settlement. Oliverio asked Roebuck to agree to the application of the proceeds from that sale to save the business and to save him from going to prison. Roebuck tentatively agreed, with certain conditions, one of which was that her contribution of the proceeds of that sale would accomplish the intended result. Her subsequent discussions with Steuart, and his advice to her on that subject, are more fully set forth in the discussion of part C(l) of Steuart\u2019s cross appeal, <em>infra. </em>Suffice it to say at this point that Steuart told Roebuck he was aware of the check kiting, that he had suggested it, and that $35,000 would \u201ctake care of the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">On 7 August 1981, Equitable Bank, which had discovered overdrafts in the Express Liquors account in the amount of $167,958.60, filed suit and attached the assets of Express Liquors, causing the business to be closed. Under the local liquor laws, a closing for more than ten days would result in a forfeiture of the liquor license. The parties agreed to an extension and began negotiations toward settlement of the debt. Equitable agreed to consider releasing the attachment to permit a sale of Express and to consider financing part of the purchase by an acceptable owner. Steuart located a purchaser, Jin-Mar, Inc. et al., at a price of $256,537.12. A contract was signed on or about 3 September 1981 between the buyers and Steuart and Oliverio as sellers. Available proceeds of the sale were to be applied to selected debts. One of the creditors to be satisfied was Suburban Bank, which held outstanding notes of Express, guaranteed by Steuart, Oliverio and Roebuck, approximating $60,000. Suburban agreed to accept $20,000 cash and a note from the buyers for $40,238.85. This new note was guaranteed by Steuart but not by Roebuck.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>In December of 1981, Express Liquors, Inc., was placed in involuntary bankruptcy. The trustee in the bankruptcy case instituted proceedings in the bankruptcy court to avoid the sale and to recover the proceeds paid to Equitable and Suburban. The bankruptcy court, among other things, held that the trustee could recover from Suburban the $20,000 cash and the note for $40,238.85 as avoidable preferences. That court held the note from Jin-Mar, Inc., guaranteed by Steuart, was void and, therefore, the original notes, guaranteed by Steuart, Oliverio and Roebuck, were reinstated. The court further found that Steuart\u2019s guarantee of the new note was a novation, releasing him from the original guaranty, but entered judgment in favor of Suburban against Roebuck in the amount of $60,238.85, based on her guaranty of the original notes. No part of this judgment has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Further facts will be supplied as necessary in the discussion of the various issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The trial court erred in making Roebuck\u2019s $60,000 judgment against Steuart contingent upon her payment of the Suburban Bank judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The resolution of this question depends upon whether the \u201cjudgment rule\u201d or the \u201cprepayment rule\u201d applies to this case. That question usually arises in actions on indemnity contracts. As explained by Judge Smith for the Court of Appeals in <em>Levin v. Friedman, </em>271 Md. 438, 317 A.2d 831 (1974), if the contract is an \u201cindemnity against liability,\u201d recovery from the indemnitor is allowed when judgment is entered against the indemnitee, even though it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>has not been paid, (the judgment rule), but if the contract is an \u201cindemnity against loss or damage\u201d (strict indemnity), the indemnitee cannot recover from the indemnitor until payment is made or he has otherwise suffered actual loss or damage (the prepayment rule). Obviously, this case is not a suit on an indemnity contract and such cases are inapposite. Equally inapplicable is <em>Baltimore County v. Stitzel, </em>26 Md.App. 175, 184-85, 337 A.2d 721, 727, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 745 (1975), cited by appellee, where this Court, citing provisions of The Uniform Contribution Among Tort-Feasors Act (Maryland Code (1957, 1986 Repl.Vol., 1987 Cum. Supp.), Art. 50, \u00a7\u00a7 16-22), held that \u201c[a] joint tort-feasor is not entitled to a money judgment for contribution until he has by payment discharged the common liability or has paid more than his pro rata share thereof.\u201d <em>See also Cotham and Maldonado v. Board, </em>260 Md. 556, 273 A.2d 115 (1971); <em>Southern Maryland Oil Company v. Texas Company, </em>203 F.Supp. 449 (D.Md.1962) and cases there cited. This is not a suit for contribution or indemnification among joint tort-feasors, who are identified as \u201ctwo or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury.\u201d Maryland Code, Art. 50, \u00a7 16(a). This is a tort action for alleged professional malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In <em>Hernandez v. Great American Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>464 S.W.2d 91, 94 (Tex.1971), the Supreme Court of Texas said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzU\">This strict indemnity limitation is inconsistent with the law of tort liability where the injured party is entitled to recover, as nearly as possible, compensation for the damages he suffers. This includes his expenses, past and future, paid or unpaid, to which he has been or will be put as a consequence of the tort. He need not prove payment of his medical bills, for example, to include them within his damages for which the tortfeasor is liable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">That case was a suit by the insured seeking reimbursement from his insurer for negligent failure to settle a claim within policy limits resulting in a judgment against the insured. Observing that \u201c[i]f the insured is too poor to pay the first judgment, it is the insurer responsible for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>judgment who escapes with what he should pay,\u201d the Court held the judgment rule should prevail over the prepayment rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Texas has also applied the judgment rule to cases of alleged malpractice by attorneys. In <em>Montfort v. Jeter, 567 </em>S.W.2d 498 (Tex.1978), a $40,000 judgment had been entered against the client due to the attorney\u2019s malpractice. No part of the judgment had been paid and no execution thereof had been attempted. The jury awarded $40,000 in compensatory damages and the Court of Civil Appeals reversed. Reversing the Court of Civil Appeals, the Supreme Court said that under the \u201cjudgment rule,\u201d the existing judgment was evidence of actual damage and, therefore, the Court of Civil Appeals erred in holding there was no evidence to support the jury verdict. Similarly, the Supreme Court of Iowa, in <em>Pickens, Barnes &amp; Abernathy v. Heasley, </em>328 N.W.2d 524 (Iowa 1983), applied the \u201cjudgment rule\u201d when the alleged malpractice is in negligently defending a case, which we find is analogous to the facts in the present case. The Iowa court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">The loss \"actually sustained\u201d from the adverse judgment in the prior case is the amount of that judgment including costs. 7 Am.Jur.2d <em>Attorneys-at-Law, </em>Sec. 226, at 270 (1980) (\u201cWhere an attorney is engaged to defend an action that is lost by his negligence, the amount of the judgment suffered by the client is a proper element of recovery in a malpractice proceeding against the attorney.\u201d); Annot., 45 A.L.R. 2d 62, 67 (1956).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Virginia has taken a contrary position. In <em>Allied Productions, Inc. v. Duesterdick, </em>217 Va. 763, 232 S.E.2d 774 (1977), the Court held that when a client has suffered a judgment for money damages as the proximate result of his lawyer\u2019s negligence, such judgment constitutes actual damages recoverable in a suit for legal malpractice <em>only </em>to the extent such judgment has been paid. The majority of the Court found such cases analogous to cases involving contribution among joint tort-feasors, citing to cases holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>a right of contribution arises only when one tort-feasor has paid or settled a claim for which other wrongdoers are also liable. In a well-reasoned dissent, however, Justice Poff observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">If the client has no cause of action until he has paid the judgment against him, then the larger the judgment, the greater the client\u2019s burden and the lawyer\u2019s impunity; the greater the injury wrongfully inflicted, the less the liability of the wrongdoer. The rule would seem to penalize a lawyer for his negligence when it costs his client a modest judgment but grant him immunity when his negligence results in a judgment too large for the client to pay. Furthermore, when the judgment forces the client into a state of insolvency, the rule may prejudice not only the client but his general creditors as well. Finally, the rule the majority adopt will force the client to choose whether to postpone suit against his negligent lawyer until he has paid his judgment-creditor in full or to institute a separate suit against his lawyer for each partial payment he makes. How the latter course might be affected by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>one can only wonder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\"><em>Id. </em>232 S.E.2d at 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Not mentioned by Justice Poff, but an equally vexatious problem if the \u201cprepayment rule\u201d were adopted, is the question of when the statute of limitations would begin to run. In this respect, at least, we have some guidance from our own Court of Appeals. In <em>Leonhart v. Atkinson, </em>265 Md. 219, 289 A.2d 1 (1972), and in <em>Feldman v. Granger, </em>255 Md. 288, 257 A.2d 421 (1969), professional malpractice actions against accountants for damages arising out of tax matters, the Court said the cause of action accrues when a deficiency assessment is received as that is when the wrong is discovered. Of particular significance is that, in both of those cases, the Court relied heavily on <em>Atkins v. Crosland, </em>417 S.W.2d 150 (Tex.1967), the same case relied upon by the Texas Court in <em>Hernandez v. Great American Insurance Co. of N.Y., supra, </em>in choosing the \u201cjudgment rule\u201d over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the \u201cprepayment rule\u201d in tort cases. While the time when the cause of action accrues is not necessarily the same as when the damages are fixed, in applying the \u201cprepayment rule,\u201d the Virginia Court held the complaint did not state a cause of action because the judgment had not been paid, that is, that no cause of action accrued. We think this is at variance with the Maryland cases above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We have been referred to no Maryland case, and our own research has disclosed none, specifically addressing the \u201cjudgment rule\u201d versus the \u201cprepayment rule\u201d in the context of legal malpractice cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals has addressed it, however, in the context of alleged negligent and bad faith refusal to settle a claim against an insured. In <em>Sweeten, Adm\u2019r. v. Nat\u2019l. Mutual, </em>233 Md. 52, 56, 194 A.2d 817, 818 (1963), the issue before the Court was \u201cwhether the existence of an unpaid judgment will suffice to show injury and damage in the legal sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In adopting the view that payment is not a requisite to recovery, the Court rejected the appellee\u2019s contention that the \u201cessence of the legal injury is pecuniary loss to the plaintiff,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">Before payment the mere existence of an unsatisfied judgment may cause legal injury by loss or impairment of credit, and inability to obtain or retain an automobile operator\u2019s license____ We are constrained to follow what we think is the great weight of authority at this time, in a question not previously decided in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-10\"><em>Sweeten, supra, </em>233 Md. at 57, 194 A.2d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">The Court went on to hold that the trial court should have overruled defendant\u2019s demurrer which was based on the contention that \u201cthe declaration did not allege that the administrator ever paid, was able to pay, or was ever requested to pay, any part of the prior judgment, and that in the absence of any allegation of pecuniary damage, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>declaration did not state a cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54, 194 A.2d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The reasoning of the Court in <em>Sweeten </em>is equally applicable to professional malpractice cases. Suits for negligent and bad faith refusal to settle have many similarities to suits against negligent attorneys. Both deal with breaches of fiduciary duty and both concern tort liability arising out of a contractual relationship. As to the cases from other jurisdictions, we find more persuasive those supporting the \u201cjudgment rule.\u201d We hold, therefore, that the trial court erred in applying the \u201cprepayment rule\u201d to the judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">There was no evidence upon which the jury could assess damages on Roebuck\u2019s third party claim for the liquor suppliers\u2019 judgments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Roebuck\u2019s second assertion is that the trial court erred in removing from the jury\u2019s consideration the liquor suppliers\u2019 judgments as an element of her compensatory damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">As stated previously, Roebuck had executed guarantees to the liquor suppliers prior to the time Steuart became a partner in Express Liquors. At trial, Roebuck presented evidence that in 1980, approximately one year after Steuart became a partner, Steuart suggested check-kiting as a means to obtain inventory for the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">On appeal, Roebuck contends that \u201c[a]t the initiation of the check-kiting scheme, Steuart had an obligation as attorney for Roebuck to advise her that she had a right to terminate her guarantees with the liquor suppliers,\u201d and that \u201c[n]ot only did Steuart fail to advise her that she had the right to terminate these guarantees but, in addition, he caused her to incur liability by advising Express to buy liquor with money it did not have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Roebuck contends 1) that the court erred \u201cwhen it stated that Roebuck did not prove what she would have done in the event that Steuart had advised her of her right to terminate the revocable guarantees,\u201d and 2) that the court erred in ruling that Roebuck failed to establish \u201cwhat her liability would have been had she terminated the guarantees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">With regard to the first issue, Roebuck advances a reasonableness test, stating: \u201cthe issue is not what she would have done, but what a reasonable person would have done under the circumstances.\u201d Steuart contends, however, that a subjective test is applicable in legal malpractice cases, with the \u201cburden on the plaintiff/ client to produce evidence that he either \u2018acted or chose not to act in reliance upon\u2019 the attorney\u2019s omissions.\u201d Because we find that Roebuck failed to establish any damages, we need not address the applicable standard as to this issue. (That question will be discussed in connection with part C(2) of the cross appeal.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The liquor suppliers\u2019 judgments against Roebuck were in the amount of $40,921.94. Roebuck contends that had Steuart properly informed her of the status of the business she would have terminated her guarantees and would have been liable only for the difference between the amount of Express Liquors\u2019 debts to the suppliers at the time of the hypothetical termination and the $40,921.94 in judgments entered against her. Assuming the validity of that position, this claim must fail because, as the trial judge found in granting Steuart\u2019s motion, there was no evidence from which the jury could determine the difference in those figures. The debt at the time of the hypothetical termination very well could have been equal to the amount of the judgments against her. Roebuck\u2019s evidence on that issue was pure speculation. She relied solely upon the testimony of Oliverio for determining the amount of debt outstanding at the time the check-kiting scheme began. That testimony was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">Q. How much money are we talking about or were you talking about at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>A'. I can\u2019t remember, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">Q. Okay. Was it thousands of dollars, tens of thousands, hundreds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">A. Well, I\u2019m sure it was several thousand. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The \u201cseveral thousand\u201d dollars mentioned by Oliverio was not the full amount of the indebtedness. It was an amount necessary to bring the accounts within two weeks of being current, so as to avoid being placed on a \u201ccash on delivery\u201d status by the suppliers. Oliverio testified that the total indebtedness at any given time may have been as much as $40,000 to $45,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">We find the evidence to be totally devoid of any reasonable certainty. One may recover only those damages that are affirmatively proved with reasonable certainty, and said damages may not be based on speculation or conjecture. <em>Empire Realty Co. v. Fleisher, </em>269 Md. 278, 305 A.2d 144 (1973); <em>Asibem Assoc., LTD. v. Rill, </em>264 Md. 272, 286 A.2d 160 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Ill</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">There was no evidence to support an award of punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees, or for mental anguish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">An action for professional malpractice against an attorney alleges the negligent breach of a contractual duty. <em>Mumford v.

Schwarz, instituted an action to recover from Equitable Bank and Suburban Bank payments received by those banks arising from the sale of Express Liquors to Jin-Mar, Inc. et al. Suburban filed a third party complaint against the Steuarts, Oliverio and Roebuck, based upon their guarantees of the debts to Suburban allegedly paid by preferential payments. Roebuck filed cross-claims against the other third party defendants and the buyers, seeking indemnification \u201cin an amount equal to the amount, if any, which third party plaintiff, Suburban Bank, may recover against her.\u201d Roebuck\u2019s cross-claim against Steuart, filed on 29 April 1985, was based upon an accommodation theory\u2014that she executed her personal guarantee on behalf of Express Liquors and for the benefit of its principals. Steuart was a principal in the business at the time of Roebuck\u2019s guarantee to Suburban.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">On 17 October 1986, Bankruptcy Judge A. Thomas Small entered judgment in favor of Suburban in its third party complaint against Oliverio and Roebuck in the amount of the avoided payments, $60,238.85. Judgment was entered for the Steuarts on Suburban\u2019s third party complaint against them.

Under 28 U.S.C.S., \u00a7 157, where a claim involves no issues of bankruptcy law, does not directly or indirectly involve the debtor or his property, and a decision on the merits of such claim would have no effect on any aspect of the bankruptcy proceeding, the claim is a <em>non-core, unrelated </em>proceeding over which the bankruptcy court has no jurisdiction. <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. v.

The trustee\u2019s causes of action against the banks were appropriately within one or more of those definitions. The bankruptcy judge specifically did not find Roebuck\u2019s cross-claim against Steuart to be within any of those categories.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">\u201cClaims (whether state-law or not) by the debtor against a non-creditor do not appear in the list of \u2018core proceedings\u2019 given in \u00a7 157(b)(2).

D.Minn.1985). Roebuck\u2019s cross-claim against Steuart, while perhaps related to the trustee\u2019s claim against the bank, did not in any way affect any claim by or against the bankrupt corporation. Neither the bankrupt debtor nor any of its creditors would receive any more or any less funds as a result of the litigation between Roebuck and Steuart. As to this claim, neither Roebuck nor Steuart was either a debtor or a creditor of Express Liquors, Inc. This cross-claim, therefore, was neither a \u201ccore proceeding\u201d nor a \u201crelated proceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 157 and was beyond the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.

We agree further that only the claims of the liquor suppliers against Roebuck, asserted in the first count of her cross-claim, were appropriate \u201cthird party claims.\u201d We are aware of no provisions in the Rules, however, which prohibit the joinder of other claims in other counts.

Counts II and III, while not part of the original plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Roebuck, also alleged Steuart\u2019s malpractice as the basis of his liability on those other claims. All of those claims involved common questions of law or fact and common subject matter. Steuart concedes as much. In his argument that Roebuck\u2019s claim as to the Suburban Bank judgment is barred by <em>res judicata, </em>Steuart asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">The \u201ccomplex of related facts\u201d supporting all of Roebuck\u2019s claims against Steuart is precisely the same.

By its affirmative answers to those issues, the jury found in substance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">1.

You know, I will apply the proceeds if this will take care of the problem and it will keep you from going to prison. And I went upstairs and I called Cal Steuart</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Roebuck testified that she met with Steuart the following morning and expressed to him her concern about the entire situation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>I told Cal [Steuart] that I understand the check kiting to be or floating to be thirty-five thousand dollars. I wanted to know why. I wanted him to explain it to me as I had asked John [Oliverio] the night before; why it took place, why it happened. I wanted to know in his opinion would they really come and arrest John. I wanted to know if I turn this money over which meant John and I had nothing left to our name, but there would be a business left. There would be something that we could work in. And that John had agreed to turn over half of his stock to me and would Cal draw up an agreement so that I would become half owner in the business so that I could work in it, at least keep tabs on what was going on since it would be the only thing left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">She also demanded to know how the debt arose.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">Mr. Steuart told me that the reason that they had to start floating money was because the business was short of cash, that John had come to him for money. He didn\u2019t have any more cash to invest and that\u2014that\u2019s how the floating got started. But, that thirty-five thousand dollars would take care of the problem and that he didn\u2019t have any money\u2014more money to put into the business. He also thought it was a great idea that he and I would become business partners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Roebuck further testified that Steuart drafted an agreement regarding the application of the proceeds to the business, that he reviewed it with her, that she and Oliverio signed the agreement and that she applied her half of the proceeds to the business debt. We conclude that the evidence sufficiently established facts from which the jury could find reasonable inferences that Roebuck would not have applied the proceeds to the business had she been properly informed of the business\u2019s status and that Steuart\u2019s advice was the proximate cause of this loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Finally, Steuart argues \u201cthere was no evidence presented at trial that Steuart\u2019s conduct was the proximate cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Roebuck suffering a judgment to Suburban.\u201d Specifically, he asserts there was no evidence to support the verdict of the jury on issue 6, that Roebuck would have joined in the execution of the second Suburban note had she been given the opportunity, and further, that there was no evidence that Suburban would have accepted her on that note\u2014an issue not presented to the jury. On the other hand, Roebuck asserts that it was not necessary \u201cto present proof of what <em>she </em>would have done had Steuart fully informed her of the true situation\u201d or \u201cwhether Suburban would have accepted her.\u201d Rather, she contends that an objective standard is applied to such controversies\u2014with the relevant inquiry being: was there evidence from which a jury could determine what a reasonable person would have done under the circumstances? She posits that the causality issue here is governed by the same standards articulated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Sard v. Hardy, </em>281 Md. 432, 379 A.2d 1014 (1977), discussing the doctrine of informed consent in medical malpractice cases. There, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">[T]hat the causality requirement in cases applying the doctrine of informed consent is to be resolved by an objective test: whether a reasonable person in the patient\u2019s position would have withheld consent to the surgery or therapy had all material risks been disclosed---Under this rule, the patient\u2019s hindsight testimony as to what he would have hypothetically done, though relevant, is not determinative of the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 450, 379 A.2d at 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">While perhaps not precisely so, we think the analogy is appropriate. Under the doctrine of informed consent in medical malpractice cases, it is the fiduciary relationship between the doctor and the patient which imposes upon the doctor an obligation to disclose to the patient all material facts necessary to an informed intelligent decision. <em>Sard v. Hardy, </em>34 Md.App. 217, 247, 367 A.2d 525, 542 (1976) (Davidson, J., dissenting) <em>(rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>281 Md. 432, 379 A.2d 1014 (1977)). The duty is one imposed by law in the same manner as imposed upon others in a similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>fiduciary relationship. <em>Cooper v. Roberts, </em>220 Pa.Super 260, 286 A.2d 647 (1971). That same fiduciary relationship exists between a lawyer and his client. As we have observed previously, the jury found that Steuart was Roebuck\u2019s attorney at the time of the purchase of Express Liquors by Jin-Mar, and that he failed to exercise reasonable care in his representation of her in connection with Roebuck\u2019s participation in securing financing from Suburban for that purchase. Both Steuart and Roebuck had been guarantors on the debt to Suburban. Steuart, at that time, was also an owner of Express Liquors. In negotiating the sale, without the knowledge or participation of Roebuck, Steuart took action which resulted in his release from their joint obligation while leaving his client responsible therefor. Roebuck presented expert testimony that Steuart, as a \u201ccareful\u201d and \u201ccompetent\u201d lawyer, should have foreseen those consequences. He cannot, while representing both himself and his client, secure a benefit to himself not secured for his client. To hold otherwise would be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahr\">to overlook the age-old principle applicable to fiduciary relationships that, unless there is a full disclosure by the agent, trustee, or attorney of his activity and interest in the transaction to the party he represents and the obtaining of the consent of the party represented, the party serving in the fiduciary capacity cannot receive any profit or emolument from the transaction. This is true even when the transaction benefits the principal or client, which does not readily appear to be the case in this transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\"><em>McGinnis v. Rogers, </em>262 Md. 710, 732, 279 A.2d 459, 470 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Viewed in the light most favorable to Roebuck, the evidence supported findings by the jury that Steuart knew or should have known that Roebuck\u2019s guarantee on the new note to Suburban would have secured her release as guarantor of the previous notes. As her attorney, he should have so advised her. The jury could, and apparently did, infer that a reasonable person in possession of that advice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>would have elected to join in the new guarantee. As the bank previously had accepted both Steuart and Roebuck as guarantors of Express Liquors, the jury could infer that a reasonable bank would accept both as guarantors of JinMar. The reasonable inference from all the evidence was that Steuart\u2019s conflict of interest was a proximate cause of the $60,000 judgment against Roebuck.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">THE ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY MAKING APPELLANT AND CROSS APPELLEE\u2019S $60,000 JUDGMENT CONTINGENT UPON HER PAYMENT OF THAT AMOUNT TO SUBURBAN BANK IS VACATED, AND THE CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENT ON THE VERDICT OF THE JURY; IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS, JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID ONE-THIRD BY APPELLANT-CROSS APPELLEE ROEBUCK, AND TWO-THIRDS BY APPELLEE-CROSS APPELLANT STEUART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-11\">.

Numerous documents contain neither filing date nor exhibit number and no indication of whether or when they were received in evidence.

Steuart correctly observes in his brief that this issue would become moot by a holding in his favor that this judgment is barred because (1) of the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>or (2) it is an improper third party claim, or (3) it was not caused by any act or omission of Steuart. For reasons to be discussed <em>infra, </em>we shall reject Steuart\u2019s argument on all those issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b339-12\">.
