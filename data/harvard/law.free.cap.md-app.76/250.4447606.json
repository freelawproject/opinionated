Brooke Etze attended the school during the period August, 1984, through June 7, 1986, when she was between four and six years of age. Brooke\u2019s parents were entirely satisfied with the school and with Ms. Craig while Brooke was enrolled there.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">On June 21, 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Etze read a newspaper article recounting complaints of children having been abused at Ms. Craig\u2019s school. A week or two later, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>received a letter inviting them to a meeting hosted by the county\u2019s sexual assault center and social services and health departments. They attended the meeting, and, as a result of what they learned, they contacted the sexual assault center and arranged to have Brooke evaluated by a therapist, Mary Burke. In her fourth or fifth session with Ms. Burke, Brooke said a number of things that led Ms. Burke to suspect that she had been the victim of abuse. Ms. Burke contacted the police and social services departments, who then joined in an investigation of Brooke's allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In ensuing conversations with her parents and in further sessions with Ms. Burke, Brooke revealed a number of incidents of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse committed by Ms. Craig directly, by two of Ms. Craig\u2019s children \u2014Jamal and Mika\u2014and by other children at the school. The direct abuse by Ms. Craig included kicking Brooke on the legs and in her \u201cprivate parts,\u201d inserting a stick in her vagina, and threatening her with the loss of her parents\u2019 love. A medical examination by Dr. Charles Shubin revealed a scarred hymen, with an opening nearly four times normal\u2014\u201cabnormal findings ... which represent very clear healed injury to this child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">As a result of these disclosures and investigations, a six-count indictment was returned in the Circuit Court for Howard County against Ms. Craig. It charged her with first degree sexual offense (Count 1), second degree sexual offense (Count 2), child abuse (Count 3), unnatural and perverted sexual practice (Count 4), common law assault (Count 5), and common law battery (Count 6). Each of these offenses, the indictment alleged, was committed \u201cduring the period of September 1984 to June 1986, at Howard County____\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Prior to trial, both sides filed a number of motions. Among those filed on behalf of Ms. Craig were a demand for particulars, a motion \u201cfor disclosure of impeaching information,\u201d a motion for discovery and production of documents, and a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude testimony by Ms. Burke as to statements made to her by Brooke. The demand for particulars, averring that the indictment lacked \u201cspecificity and particularity,\u201d sought, among other things, the \u201cspecific acts the State alleges the defendant did to constitute the crimes charged in each and every charge\u201d and \u201cthe date and time of the act or acts that the State alleges constituted a crime in each and every crime charged against the Defendant.\u201d In the discovery motion, Ms. Craig asked for \u201cany material or information which tends to negate the guilt of the defendant as to the offense(s) charged,\u201d copies of \u201call written memoranda which any of the State\u2019s witnesses will take with them to the witness stand or refer to while testifying during the State\u2019s case in chief,\u201d and \u201cthe substance of any oral report and conclusion made in connection with the Defendant\u2019s case by each expert consulted by the State, including the results of any physical or mental examination____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The State, for its part, moved to allow Brooke and other young children to testify through closed circuit television, pursuant to Md.Code Ann.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. art., \u00a7 9-102, and to allow certain \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence 'in order to establish \u201ca pattern of conduct on the part of the Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In lieu of a formal response to the demand for particulars and the two discovery motions, the parties agreed to an open-file discovery, i.e., the State agreed to \u201cprovide all non work-product reports in its files\u201d as well as \u201ca complete witness list.\u201d The one exception to this approach concerned certain records of the county health department which the Attorney General, presumably as counsel to the health department, delivered to the court for <em>in camera </em>inspection. Upon such review, the court denied the request to produce those documents, which it characterized principally as \u201ccor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>respondence, much of it apparently unsolicited, from parents of children attending the ... facility operated by the Defendant\u201d that did not tend \u201cto negate or mitigate the guilt or punishment of the Defendant as to the offense(s) charged.\u201d Counsel did not press the point further and accepted the open file discovery as a sufficient response to his various motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Ms. Craig\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>was effectively denied, at least to the extent that Ms. Burke was permitted to testify and to relate both verbal and non-verbal communications from Brooke made during the evaluation and therapy sessions. The State\u2019s motions were granted. Other children allegedly abused by Ms. Craig were allowed to testify as to what had occurred to them, and both they and Brooke were permitted to testify through closed circuit television.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">After 12 days of trial, the jury convicted Ms. Craig on all six counts. She then discharged her trial attorneys and employed new counsel, who filed amended motions for new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Extended evidentiary hearings were held on those motions. On September 21, 1987, however, the court finally denied the motions and imposed sentence. This appeal followed in which seven issues, three of them multi-part, are raised. Ms. Craig complains that: (1) the State withheld exculpatory evidence that it had a duty to disclose; (2) the indictment was defective; (3) the court erred in allowing the children to testify on closed circuit television; (4) it erred in admitting an opinion from Ms. Burke that Brooke was the victim of child abuse; (5) it erred in allowing Ms. Burke and Mrs. Etze to testify as to Brooke\u2019s statements to them; (6) it wrongfully excluded certain testimony of Ms. Craig\u2019s expert witness; and (7) it erred in allowing the testimony of other children as to abuse suffered by them. Interlaced with some of these complaints is the further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>charge that her trial counsel was Constitutionally incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">We find no merit in any of these complaints and shall therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">I. WITHHELD EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"Aaa\">(1) <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">As we observed, in lieu of a formal response to Ms. Craig\u2019s various motions, the State opted to provide an open file discovery. Pursuant to that agreement, it turned over to defense counsel the \u201cmain Investigative file\u201d of the county police department, the written statements of 16 witnesses, a therapist's report and a medical report on another alleged child-victim, all or parts of police reports involving Brooke and other children, and a report and addendum prepared by Brooke\u2019s therapist, Mary Burke.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The focus of Ms. Craig\u2019s complaint is on the material known or available to the State that was <em>not </em>disclosed, principally the therapy notes of Ms. Burke recording (1) statements made by Brooke directly to Ms. Burke, to Brooke\u2019s parents, or, in one instance, allegedly to Dr. Shubin, (2) statements made by other child-witnesses to Ms. Burke during the course of their evaluation and therapy, and (3) Ms. Burke\u2019s impressions of Brooke\u2019s credibility. Ms. Craig urges that these documents and some others recording like information contain material that is exculpatory to her, that was available to the prosecutor, that the prosecutor had a duty to disclose, and that could have influenced the verdicts in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">(2) <em>General Duty Of Disclosure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">The duty of a prosecutor to disclose exculpatory information is a matter of both Federal and State law. In <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), the Supreme Court held flatly that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d That holding was refined somewhat in <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), where the Court attempted to define the circumstances under which non-disclosure would warrant upsetting an adverse verdict and ordering a new trial. In that regard, the Court drew a distinction between evidence or information that was \u201cavailable to the prosecutor and not submitted to the defense\u201d and that which \u201chad simply been discovered from a neutral source after trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 111, 96 S.Ct. at 2401.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">As a prosecutor is under no \u201cconstitutional duty routinely to deliver his entire file to defense counsel,\u201d the Court rejected Agurs\u2019s plea to \u201ctreat every nondisclosure as though it were error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, it held, at 112-13, 96 S.Ct. at 2401-02:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">\u201cThe proper standard of materiality must reflect our overriding concern with the justice of the finding of guilt. Such a finding is permissible only if supported by evidence establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It necessarily follows that if the omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist, constitutional error has been committed. This means that the omission must be evaluated in the context of the entire record. If there is no reasonable doubt about guilt whether or not the additional evidence is considered, there is no justification for a new trial. On the other hand, if the verdict is already of questionable validity, additional evidence of relatively minor importance might be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">(Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Md.Rule 4-263 imposes and extends the requirement of disclosure as a matter of State law. Section (a) of the Rule requires the disclosure, even without a request, of \u201c[a]ny material or information tending to negate or mitigate the guilt or punishment of the defendant as to the offense charged.\u201d Section (b) requires the further disclosure, upon request, of additional classes of information, including written reports and the substance of oral reports by each expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>consulted by the State \u201cincluding the results of any physical or mental examination____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Under these requirements\u2014Federal and State\u2014where the question of non-disclosure arises after the trial is over and the issue is the validity of the verdict, at least three considerations are usually present: (1) was the information that was allegedly withheld really exculpatory, i.e., did it tend to negate or mitigate the guilt or punishment of the defendant as to the offense(s) charged; (2) was the information reasonably available to the prosecutor so that it could have been disclosed; and (3) was it material in the sense that, when \u201cevaluated in the context of the entire record,\u201d it \u201ccreates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 112, 96 S.Ct. at 2402; see also <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985); <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972); <em>Moore v. Illinois, </em>408 U.S. 786, 92 S.Ct. 2562, 33 L.Ed.2d 706, <em>reh. denied </em>409 U.S. 897, 93 S.Ct. 87, 34 L.Ed.2d 155 (1972); <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>299 Md. 297, 473 A.2d 450 (1984); <em>Yeagy v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 1, 491 A.2d 1199 (1985). Each of these considerations is in contention here. We shall begin with the second\u2014availability.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">(3) <em>Availability Of The Undisclosed Information</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">As we observed, the <em>Agurs </em>Court drew a distinction between information that was \u201cavailable to the prosecutor\u201d prior to or during trial and evidence \u201cdiscovered from a neutral source after trial.\u201d 427 U.S. at 111, 96 S.Ct. at 2401. It is in the former situation that due process is most directly and significantly implicated. Md.Rule 4-263 fleshes this out a bit. Section (g) of that Rule applies the obligation of disclosure to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">\u201cmaterial and information in the possession or control of the State\u2019s Attorney and staff members and <em>any others who have participated in the investigation or evaluation of the action and who either regularly report, or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>with reference to the particular action have reported, to the office of the State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Health and social service agencies do not ordinarily report their findings or suspicions to the State\u2019s Attorney; indeed, in most instances they are precluded from doing so by confidentiality statutes. See, for example, Md.Code Ann. Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. art., \u00a7 9-109. Normally, then, material in the files of those agencies, especially material protected by privilege, would not be subject to disclosure under either due process requirements or under Rule 4-263(a)(l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">A special situation exists with respect to child abuse cases, however. Since 1966, every health practitioner, every education, mental health, and social worker, and every law enforcement officer has been under a statutory obligation to make a written report whenever that person (1) has examined or treated a child, and (2) from that examination or treatment, has reason to believe that the child has sustained physical injury as a result of abuse. See 1966 Md.Laws, ch. 221. During the period relevant to this case, these reporting requirements and the follow-up actions required to be taken by the various health, social services, and law enforcement agencies were set forth in Md.Code Ann. Fam.Law art., \u00a7\u00a7 5-901\u20145-912.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 5-908 required the report to be made to the local department of social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>services but also required that a copy of that report be sent to the State\u2019s Attorney. That duty pertained \u201c[notwithstanding any law on privileged communications.\u201d In addition to certain specified information, the report was to contain \u201cany other information that would help to determine: (i) the cause of the suspected abuse; and (ii) the identity of any individual responsible for the abuse.\u201d \u00a7 5-903(c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Section 5-905 required that, promptly after receiving a report of suspected abuse, the department of social services or the appropriate law enforcement agency, or both, must make a \u201cthorough investigation.\u201d That investigation was to include, \u201c(1) a determination of the nature, extent, and cause of the abuse, if any; and (2) if the suspected abuse is verified ... a determination of the identity of the person or persons responsible for the abuse____\u201d \u00a7 5-905(b). Section 5-905(e) required, as of January, 1985, that the \u201cagencies responsible for investigating child <em>sexual </em>abuse,\u201d including the State\u2019s Attorney, \u201cimplement a joint investigation procedure for conducting joint investigations of child sexual abuse.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Finally, \u00a7 5-905(g) required that \u201c[w]ithin 5 business days after completion of the investigation, the local department [of social services], and the appropriate law enforcement agency, if that agency participated in the investigation, <em>shall make a complete written report of its findings to the local State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Pursuant to the directive in \u00a7 5-905(e), the Howard County State\u2019s Attorney entered into an agreement with the county police and social services departments providing for joint investigations by those agencies and the sharing of information among them. That agreement also provided for a \u201ccomplete written report\u201d of the investigation to be submitted to the State\u2019s Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">This requirement of information sharing was made known to Brooke\u2019s parents. Prior to the first session with Ms. Burke, Mrs. Etze signed a form acknowledging, among other things, that \u201cthe Howard County Sexual Assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Center is mandated by law to report <em>suspected </em>sexual abuse of children to the Police or to Protective Services of the appropriate community,\u201d that \u201cit is the policy of the Center to cooperate fully with the Police and Protective Services during the active investigation of the suspected sexual abuse or assault of a child under the age of 18,\u201d and that \u201cHoward County Sexual Assault Center records and information are subject to subpoenas which mandate release and disclosure.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In the case at hand, there was indeed close cooperation between the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and the other agencies, including the sexual assault center. Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Mary C. O\u2019Donnell attended approximately 12 of the therapy sessions conducted by Ms. Burke with Brooke, as well as several sessions conducted with the other child witnesses; she also had a dozen or so telephone conversations with Ms. Burke regarding Brooke. A written report summarizing five sessions with Brooke, from July 28 through September 2, 1986, was sent by Ms. Burke to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, supplemented by a further report in January, 1987, summarizing three additional sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">On these facts\u2014the statute, the agreement, and the actual contact and reporting\u2014it is clear beyond cavil that the requirements of Rule 4-263 would extend to relevant material in the hands of the sexual assault center and the police and social services departments. Those agencies \u201cparticipated in the investigation or evaluation of the action\u201d and \u201ceither regularly report, or with reference to the particular action have reported, to the office of the State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whether Ms. Burke had some subjective belief that her notes were privileged, as the State now claims, is quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>beside the point.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the governing legal precepts, this material was available to the prosecutor, whether or not it was physically in his files.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">(4) <em>Exculpatory Quality\u2014Materiality</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFQ\">There is, of course, a close relationship between the extent to which information is exculpatory and the extent to which it was material, and so we shall consider these two elements together. Did any of it tend to negate or mitigate Ms. Craig\u2019s guilt, and, if so, would it, evaluated in the context of the entire record, have created a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist?</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The case against Ms. Craig rested, to a large extent, on the credibility of Brooke, who was the lead-off witness. Brooke testified that Ms. Craig had kicked her \u201cin my leg\u201d and \u201c[i]n my privates,\u201d and had stuck her with thumbtacks. She said that Ms. Craig had touched her with a stick \u201c[i]n my private parts,\u201d which she defined as \u201c[hjere between my legs,\u201d and that this had occurred \u201c[a] lot of times,\u201d sometimes \u201cin the woods and sometimes in her office.\u201d She stated that Ms. Craig made up rules requiring the children to hurt each other. When asked why she did not tell her parents about these incidents, Brooke said that she was afraid because Ms. Craig had told her that \u201cmy parents wouldn\u2019t love me any more,\u201d that \u201cmy parents would get a divorce,\u201d and that \u201cshe would kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">On cross-examination, which was lengthy, Brooke twice stated that the stick wielded by Ms. Craig never went into her body\u2014that she was simply hit with it. Although she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>claimed that other children at the school occasionally chased her or threw sticks, she denied that they had ever actually hit her or bit her or touched her \u201cprivates\u201d with sticks. The thrust of her testimony was that the physical and sexual abuse of her was committed solely by Ms. Craig.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Dr. Charles Shubin, a pediatrician with considerable experience in dealing with abused children, examined Brooke at the request of the State. He testified that her hymen was \u201cgaped open\u201d to a 15 mm diameter, which was nearly four times the \u201cabsolute upper limit of normal\u201d published by the American Medical Association. In addition, he said, \u201cthe hymen itself was not normal.\u201d Instead of being \u201ccircumferential all the way around the fold of the vagina,\u201d as it should have been, \u201cthe lower edge was considerably thickened.\u201d There was, in addition, \u201ca retracted scar.\u201d In summary, Dr. Shubin stated that \u201c[t]hese are clearly very abnormal findings and which represent very clear healed injury to this child.\u201d As to causation of that injury, Dr. Shubin stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cTo cause injury to that tissue, stretch it, tear it, scar it would require pushing past an inch and a quarter with some penetrating force. Some object would have to be pushed into this child past an inch and a quarter which would be the normal range of motion to this tissue to cause the injury that we see in this diagram [that he drew for the jury].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Dr. Shubin said that \u201c[i]t\u2019s not possible just by examining her to say for sure what that object was and certainly impossible to say who did it\u201d and, because the injury had healed, it was equally impossible \u201cto say with certainty when it happened.\u201d He was quite certain, however, that the abnormal findings \u201cwere caused by the penetration of something inside of the body.\u201d A \u201cblow or an injury to the external part of Brooke Etze\u2019s body,\u201d he said, would not have caused that kind of injury; \u201c[i]t requires penetration into the child\u2019s body of an object small enough to fit into that area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>This opinion by Dr. Shubin was, of course, inconsistent with Brooke\u2019s testimony that the stick used by Ms. Craig had not entered her body. Dr. Shubin dismissed the inconsistency with the assertion that \u201cI\u2019m not aware that children are able to easily tell what inside the body means or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Dr. Shubin\u2019s testimony set the stage for testimony from Ms. Burke as to the revelations made to her by Brooke. She testified that Brooke had told her, during the therapy sessions, that Ms. Craig had \u201cstuck her in the privates with a stick,\u201d that she had kicked Brooke on the legs and \u201cin the private parts,\u201d stuck her with thumbtacks, and threatened that, if she told anyone about these incidents, her parents \u201cwill divorce, that they will abandon her or won\u2019t come to get her again.\u201d When asked how consistent Brooke was \u201cin her disclosures that Mrs. Craig is the person who did these things to her,\u201d Ms. Burke responded, \u201cShe was totally consistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Ms. Craig complains specifically about the non-disclosure of 34 items contained principally in Ms. Burke\u2019s therapy notes and in two intake reports. They seem to fall into two categories\u2014complaints by Brooke and some of the other children of abuse by persons other than Ms. Craig, and impressions by Ms. Burke of Brooke\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">An examination of the items falling within the first category reveals that, with one possible exception discussed below, none of it directly exculpates Ms. Craig. Nowhere is there to be found a statement by Brooke (or by anyone else) that Ms. Craig did not kick her, or touch her \u201cprivates\u201d with a stick, or stick her with thumbtacks, or encourage the children to abuse one another, or threaten her. Nor, with that one possible exception, did any of those items purport to attribute the vaginal injury described by Dr. Shubin to ' any third party to the exclusion of Ms. Craig. They simply record statements by Brooke and some of the other child-witnesses that Jamal, Mika, and some of the other children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>at the school, also mistreated Brooke and the other child-witnesses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Although it is clear that impeachment evidence falls within the <em>Brady </em>rule and must be disclosed (see <em>United States v. Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. at 676, 105 S.Ct. at 3380), a statement that someone other than the defendant <em>also </em>abused the victim does not necessarily detract from the evidence as to the defendant\u2019s conduct or directly tend to negate or mitigate her guilt. The bulk of this material, then, if exculpatory or of impeachment quality at all, is only marginally so. A good bit of that information, moreover\u2014 in particular, Brooke\u2019s assertions of mistreatment at the hands of Jamal, Mika, and at least five other children\u2014was made known to defense counsel through the open file discovery and was used by him in cross-examining Brooke\u2019s mother.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>There was one item in this category, however, that was not made known to counsel and that requires more specific consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In Ms. Burke\u2019s file was a copy of the written report of Dr. Shubin\u2019s examination of Brooke, and appended to it was a copy of a handwritten note from Ms. Burke to Fred Levi, of the protective services division of the county department of social services. The note says, in relevant part, \u201cAm going to refer Brooke for therapy next week. <em>Implicated Mika as perpetrator when speaking [with] </em>Shubin. \u201d (Emphasis added.) When questioned about that note at the hearing on the new trial motion, Ms. Burke indicated that this information had come to her through Brooke\u2019s parents, who were present during the examination of Brooke by Dr. Shubin. She had not discussed it with Dr. Shubin and claimed to have no recollection of what she thought of it when it was brought to her attention. Notwithstanding her statement, \u201c[i]mplicated Mika as perpetrator,\u201d Ms. Burke said that her own notes \u201csimply indicate ... that she [Brooke] told Dr. [Shubin] that somebody hurt me .down there, and they don\u2019t indicate who.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Dr. Shubin was not called to testify at the hearings on the motion for new trial; nor were Brooke\u2019s parents. They, of course, could have testified as to what, if anything, Brooke actually said to Dr. Shubin. As it is, all that we have is this somewhat cryptic note recording a double-level hearsay statement and Ms. Burke\u2019s somewhat vague explanation. On this record, we are unwilling to presume, as Ms. Craig urges us to do, that Brooke in fact exculpated her by attributing the vaginal injury solely to Mika. The note is, at best, an invitation to further inquiry, which, when pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>sued as post-trial counsel chose to pursue it, revealed nothing. Assistant State\u2019s Attorney O\u2019Donnell testified that she was unaware of the note until shown it at the new trial hearing, and that neither Ms. Burke nor Dr. Shubin had ever mentioned to her any such statement by Brooke.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The principal item in the second category came from an intake summary prepared by department of social services intake worker K. McKone on August 19, 1986, which was just after the first therapy session at which Brooke began to make disclosures leading Ms. Burke to contact the department. In the part of the summary entitled \u201cDescription of Abuse or Neglect,\u201d Ms. McKone states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">\u201cBrooke is currently being evaluated at the SAC [Sexual Assault Center] and has had several sessions with Ms. Burke. During play therapy Brooke has disclosed that someone had touched her private parts, and she pointed to the crotch area of a doll. She said \u2018Roger\u2019 (fictitious name) touched her with a stick and it hurt a lot. There is no validation yet of who did this to her and where although she did attend Craig[\u2019]s Country Pre-school. <em>According to Ms. Burke fantasy &amp; reality are mixed up for this child </em>and continued efforts will be made to determine what happened to her through continued evaluation. Next session is on 8/25\u201410 AM.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Although Ms. Craig complains of the passage concerning \u201cRoger,\u201d she calls particular attention to the emphasized portion indicating a belief by Ms. Burke that fantasy and reality were \u201cmixed up\u201d for Brooke. When questioned about that at the new trial motion hearing, Ms. Burke said that she had no recollection of making that particular statement, and that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t sound like a statement I would have made to a Protective Service worker.\u201d She allowed, however, that it may have been Ms. McKone\u2019s \u201cperception of what I was saying.\u201d Ms. Burke acknowledged \u201cin a clinical sense that fantasy and reality were mixed for that child at that time.\u201d She continued that \u201cthat would have been typical of a child who\u2019s working through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>abuse dynamics,\u201d that \u201cyoung children frequently mix fact in with other types of information which are distortions. Sometimes they are motivated that out of guilt, sometimes out of fear, that everything gets rolled up together.\u201d At no point in her lengthy examination, however, did Ms. Burke indicate any belief that Brooke\u2019s accusations against Ms. Craig were inaccurate or untruthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The trial court reviewed each of the passages complained of by Ms. Craig in the context of the documents whence they came, the extensive testimony concerning them, and the evidence presented at trial. It observed that there was \u201ctestimony going everywhere in this case. There was testimony that the jury could pick and choose.\u201d The items at issue here, it held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">\u201cit\u2019s not such evidence as in my judgment would probably have affected the outcome of the case. It would have just been other inconsistent statements, evidence that this jury could have perhaps reviewed and considered, but not evidence which, in my judgment, would have affected the outcome of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">We are not persuaded that the trial court\u2019s overall assessment was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">We observe initially that none of this newly discovered evidence would, in any manner, serve to negate or mitigate Ms. Craig\u2019s guilt under Counts 3, 5, or 6 (child abuse, assault, and battery). It in no way detracts from the evidence that Ms. Craig kicked Brooke or stuck her with thumbtacks. At best, it goes only to the alleged sexual abuse, in particular whether Ms. Craig inserted a stick into Brooke\u2019s vagina, and thus pertains only to Counts 1, 2, and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">There was, as we have indicated, some inconsistent testimony at trial, and some of it laid open the question of Brooke\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She specifically denied that other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>children had kicked, hit, or bitten her, whereas Ms. Burke recounted some of her statements to the contrary. Brooke\u2019s mother testified to specific instances of Brooke\u2019s not telling the truth, one of which involved a false accusation against another child. She conceded that \u201cto a degree, a typical amount,\u201d there was a problem with \u201cBrooke making up stories.\u201d She said, in particular, that, according to one of Brooke\u2019s teachers, \u201cit was a problem at school.\u201d Trial counsel had and used Ms. Burke\u2019s reports recounting Brooke\u2019s accusations of sexual abuse or touchings on the part of Jamal and at least five other children (see n. 8, ante).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Viewing the undisclosed material and the explanations of it developed post-trial in the light of the evidence presented at trial, we are unable to conclude that this material (1) necessarily negated or mitigated Ms. Craig\u2019s guilt (or punishment) or (2) sufficed to create a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist. We are simply not persuaded that the trial judge erred in his conclusion that, even if the relevant and admissible evidence (along with the attendant explanations of it) developed post-trial had been before the jury, the verdicts would not likely have been any different.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Ms. Craig makes two attacks on the indictment: (1) that the allegation as to when the offenses were committed \u2014\u201cduring the period of September 1984 to June 1986\u201d\u2014 was too broad and uncertain; and (2) that the indictment failed to inform her of the specific conduct charged. Although she claims that these complaints were effectively preserved for appellate review, she argues that, if they were not so preserved, it was due to the incompetence of trial counsel, which would justify relief on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">We begin by noting the requirement of Md. Rule 4-252(a) that \u201c[a] defect in the charging document other than its failure to show jurisdiction in the court or its failure to charge an offense\u201d must be raised \u201cby motion in conformity with this Rule and if not so raised [is] waived unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>court, for good cause shown, orders otherwise____\u201d With exceptions not alleged or relevant here, a motion under \u00a7 4-252(a) must be filed within 30 days after the appearance of counsel. It must state the grounds on which it is made and the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">No such motion is in the record before us; nor is there any reference to one in the docket entries. It appears that counsel filed a paper entitled \u201cMotions Pursuant To Maryland Rule 4-252\u201d in another case (No. 15461), apparently intending it to apply to all cases against Ms. Craig. The motion is captioned as \u201cCase #: 15461, and others\u201d and seeks a variety of different relief, including dismissal of the indictment on the ground \u201c[t]hat the indictment/information is defective.\u201d Although two cases <em>(Ayre v. State, </em>291 Md. 155, 433 A.2d 1150 (1981), and <em>Brown v. State, </em>285 Md. 105, 400 A.2d 1133 (1979)) are cited for that proposition, there is no averment as to how or why the indictment is defective\u2014 merely the bald allegation that it is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Quite apart from the failure to file the motion in this proceeding,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we do not regard that bald statement as adequate compliance with the requirement that the motion \u201cstate the grounds upon which it is made.\u201d Certainly, it did not suffice to raise either of the two particular complaints made here. Unless those alleged defects constitute a failure to show jurisdiction in the court or to charge an offense, therefore, they have been waived, notwithstanding that the trial court allowed Ms. Craig to raise the issue in her motions for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Md. Rule 4-202(a) requires a charging document to state \u201cwith reasonable particularity\u201d the time the offense occurred. But time is not ordinarily regarded an element of the offense or germane to jurisdiction, and it is certainly not so in this instance. The alleged violation in this regard, moreover, is not a complete absence of an allegation as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>time but rather a violation of the \u201creasonable particularity\u201d requirement. That is a matter that should and could have been raised by pre-trial motion when, if found to be meritorious, it could have been addressed and presumably corrected. The Rule does not allow such a complaint to be held until after trial has occurred and a verdict rendered. Ms. Craig\u2019s first complaint, as to time, has been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Her second complaint, which she characterizes as a failure to charge an offense, is simply without substantive merit. In <em>Williams v. State, </em>302 Md. 787, 791, 490 A.2d 1277 (1985), and later in <em>State v. Chaney, </em>304 Md. 21, 497 A.2d 152 (1985), <em>cert. denied </em>474 U.S. 1067, 106 S.Ct. 824, 88 L.Ed.2d 796 (1986), the Court made clear that not every deficiency in setting forth the elements of the offense or the particular conduct charged amounts to a jurisdictional defect. As stated in <em>Chaney, </em>304 Md. at 25-26, 497 A.2d 152:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201cWe said [in <em>Williams </em>j that a claim that an indictment fails to charge or characterize a crime is jurisdictional and may be raised at any time. But in determining, for jurisdictional purposes, whether an indictment sufficiently charges and characterizes a crime, we made clear in <em>Williams </em>that merely because the charging document does not allege, expressly or by implication, every essential element of an offense does not necessarily mean that no cognizable crime within the court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction has been charged. We said that while the customary method of identifying a particular crime charged in an indictment has been to aver its essential elements, that method is not exclusive 'and the use of other words that sufficiently characterize the crime will satisfy the jurisdictional requirement.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The language of the indictment here suffices, in our view, to charge the six offenses upon which Ms. Craig was tried and convicted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Any complaint as to lack of specificity in the precise conduct has also, therefore, been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>We shall defer, at this point, Ms. Craig\u2019s complaint about the competence of her trial counsel but shall consider her several complaints in that regard later in this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">III. TESTIMONY THROUGH CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Subject to certain conditions set forth in the statute, Md.Code Ann.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. art., \u00a7 9-102(a) provides that, in a case of child abuse, the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u201cmay order that the testimony of a child victim be taken outside the courtroom and shown in the courtroom by means of closed circuit television if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">(i) The testimony is taken during the proceeding; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">(ii) The judge determines that testimony by the child victim in the courtroom will result in the child suffering serious emotional distress such that the child cannot reasonably communicate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Applying this statute, the court allowed Brooke (and several other children) to testify in the proceeding from the judge\u2019s chambers, with counsel present, through closed circuit television.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Ms. Craig contends: (1) \u00a7 9-102 and the procedure authorized by it violate her Constitutional right of confrontation; (2) the court failed to follow the proper procedure in concluding that the children would suffer serious emotional distress such that they would be unable to reasonably communicate if required to testify in court; and (3) the procedure authorized by \u00a7 9-102 and used in this case violated her right of presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">(1) <em>Confrontation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">When this case was tried, the parties and the court were without the benefit of any controlling appellate consideration and construction of \u00a7 9-102. After the verdicts were announced, the Court of Appeals decided <em>Wildermuth v. State, </em>310 Md. 496, 530 A.2d 275 (1987), in which it considered a number of challenges to \u00a7 9-102, including claims that the procedure authorized by the statute contravened a defendant\u2019s rights of confrontation and presence. <em>Wildermuth </em>then became the focus of Ms. Craig\u2019s attack on the procedure used at trial, both at the hearings on the motions for new trial and in argument before us. More recently, however, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Coy v. Iowa, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 , 108 S.Ct. 2798, 101 L.Ed.2d 857 (1988), in which it too addressed the confrontation issues raised by procedures impairing face-to-face contact between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>child-witnesses and defendants on trial for having allegedly abused them.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Coy was charged with having assaulted two 13-year old girls as they slept in a tent in the backyard of their house. As the man who attacked them wore a stocking mask over his head and shined a flashlight in their eyes, the girls were unable to identify their assailant; they were not asked at trial to identify Coy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although no inquiry was made as to whether the victims would be able to present their testimony in Coy\u2019s presence, and the judge made no finding that they would be unable to do so, the trial court, acting pursuant to a recently enacted Iowa statute, permitted a semi-opaque screen to be placed in the courtroom between Coy and the witness stand. With certain adjustments to the lighting in the courtroom, the screen enabled Coy \u201cdimly to perceive the witnesses\u201d but totally precluded the witnesses from seeing Coy. The State sought to excuse the lack of any specific finding of necessity for separating the victims from the defendant on the ground that the statute authorizing the procedure \u201ccreate[d] a legislatively imposed presumption of trauma\u201d and thus <em>ipso facto </em>established the necessity. It urged as well that, as Coy\u2019s right of cross-examination was not impaired by the screen, there was, in fact, no violation of his right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In an Opinion authored by Justice Scalia, in which five other Justices joined, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. As to the latter, the Court made clear that the right of confrontation entails more than just the right to cross-examine. Repeatedly, Justice Scalia referred to the concomitant right, of even longer historical standing, to meet one\u2019s accuser \u201cface to face.\u201d Beyond even earlier Supreme Court decisions and English common law antecedents, he quoted from Shakespeare (Richard II), the New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Testament (Acts 25:16), and a 1953 speech made by President Eisenhower to the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith Anti-Defamation League for the proposition that \u201cthere is something deep in human nature that regards face-to-face confrontation between accused and accuser as \u2018essential to a fair trial in a criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d Thus, he announced, \u201c[w]e have never doubted ... that the Confrontation Clause guarantees the defendant a face-to-face meeting with witnesses appearing before the trier of fact.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at \u2014 , 108 S.Ct. at 2800. The screen, said Justice Scalia, \u201cwas specifically designed to enable the complaining witnesses to avoid viewing [Coy] as they gave their testimony, and the record indicates that it was successful in this objective---- It is difficult to imagine a more obvious or damaging violation of the defendant\u2019s right to a face-to-face encounter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">With that, Justice Scalia turned to the State\u2019s argument that the confrontation issue at stake was outweighed by the need to protect victims of sexual abuse. He recognized that, in earlier decisions, the Court had held that \u201crights conferred by the Confrontation Clause are not absolute, and may give way to other important interests\u201d but concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">\u201cThe rights referred to in those cases ... were not the right narrowly and explicitly set forth in the Clause, but rather rights that are, or were asserted to be, reasonably implicit\u2014namely, the right to cross-examine ...; the right to exclude out-of-court statements ...; and the asserted right to face-to-face confrontation at some point in the proceedings other than the trial itself____ To hold that our determination of what implications are reasonable must take into account other important interests is not the same as holding that we can identify exceptions, in light of other important interests, to the irreducible literal meaning of the clause: \u2018a right to <em>meet face to face </em>all those who appear and give evidence <em>at trial.\u2019 ... We leave for another day, however, the question whether any exceptions exist. Whatever they may be, they </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>would surely be allowed only when necessary to further an important public policy.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0s\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 108 S.Ct. at 2802-03. (Emphasis on last two sentences added; citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Extending that last statement, Justice Scalia specifically rejected the notion that the Iowa statute could, of itself, supply the necessity: \u201cThe exception created by the Iowa statute, which was passed in 1985, could hardly be viewed as firmly rooted. <em>Since there have been no individualized findings that these particular witnesses needed special protection, the judgment here could not be sustained by any conceivable exception.\u201d Id. </em>at-, 108 S.Ct. at 2803. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">Justice Scalia, as we indicated, wrote for himself and five other Justices, including Justices White and O\u2019Connor. Those two Justices, however, filed a Concurring Opinion, authored by Justice O\u2019Connor, to make clear their view that the right to face-to-face confrontation, which they agreed had been violated in that case, was \u201cnot absolute but rather may give way in an appropriate case to other competing interests <em>so as to permit the use of certain procedural devices designed to shield a child witness from the trauma of courtroom testimony.\u201d Id. </em>(Emphasis added.) They recognized that child abuse was a problem \u201cof disturbing proportions in today\u2019s society,\u201d that it was \u201cone of the most difficult problems to detect and prosecute, in large part because there often are no witnesses except the victim,\u201d and that, even when \u201can instance of abuse is identified and prosecution undertaken, new difficulties arise\u201d from the fact that \u201ca child victim may suffer trauma from exposure to the harsh atmosphere of the typical courtrooom \u2014 \u201d They observed that many States had, as a result, enacted statutes authorizing a variety of procedures to shield a child-witness, calling attention, in particular, to the fact that about half of the States permit the child\u2019s testimony to be given through closed circuit television, sometimes with and sometimes without the defendant\u2019s being present in the same room. The point of their concur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>rence was \u201cto make clear <em>that nothing in today\u2019s decision necessarily dooms such efforts by state legislatures to protect child witnesses.\u201d Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">In furtherance of that point, Justices O\u2019Connor and White concluded that \u201ceven if a particular state procedure runs afoul of the Confrontation Clause\u2019s general requirements, it may come within an exception that permits its use.\u201d There is nothing novel, they said, about the proposition that the Clause embodies a general requirement that a witness face the defendant. \"But it is also not novel to recognize that a defendant\u2019s \u2018right physically to face those who testify against him,\u2019 ... even if located at the \u2018core\u2019 of the Confrontation Clause, is not absolute, and I reject any suggestion to the contrary in the Court\u2019s opinion.\u201d The core of the concurrence was then stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">\u201cIn short, our precedents recognize a right to face-to-face confrontation at trial, but have never viewed that right as absolute. I see no reason to do so now and would recognize exceptions here as we have elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">Thus, I would permit use of a particular trial procedure that called for something other than face-to-face confrontation if that procedure was necessary to further an important public policy.... <em>The protection of child witnesses is, in my view and in the view of a substantial majority of the States, just such a policy. </em>The primary focus therefore likely will be on the necessity prong. I agree with the Court that more than the type of generalized legislative finding of necessity present here is required. <em>But if a court makes a case-specific finding of necessity, as is required by a number of state statutes ... our cases suggest that the strictures of the Confrontation Clause may give way to the compelling state interest of protecting child witnesses. Because nothing in the Court\u2019s opinion conflicts with this approach and this conclusion, I join it.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u2014\u2014, 108 S.Ct. at 2805. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Although Justice Sealia took gome pains in his majority Opinion to rebut points made by Justice Blackmun and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Chief Justice Rehnquist in dissent, he made no comment at all with respect to the concurring opinion; of particular significance, we think, he chose not to comment on the passage quoted immediately above or to suggest that Justices O\u2019Connor and White had misread either his Opinion or his intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">We glean at least three things from what the Justices, in their respective opinions, had to say: (1) the Court did not firmly conclude that the \u201cface-to-face\u201d requirement embodied in the Clause was absolute and would admit of no exceptions but simply left that question \u201cfor another day\u201d; (2) nor did it rule out the prospect of recognizing as such an exception the State\u2019s interest in protecting child-witnesses from trauma associated with testifying in open court in the defendant\u2019s close presence; and (3) to the extent that language in Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion might suggest that a closed circuit television arrangement based on a \u201ccase-specific finding of necessity\u201d would be regarded as impermissible under the Confrontation Clause, that view was not shared by more than four of the Justices who sat on the case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The issue that the Supreme Court chose to reserve for another day is upon us in this case and must therefore, of necessity, be decided by us today. Guided in part by the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis in <em>Wildermuth, </em>we are inclined to the view expressed by Justice O\u2019Connor in her concurring opinion. In accordance with, and to some extent extrapolating, that view, we hold that (1) the requirement of a face-to-face meeting in court is <em>not </em>absolute, but <em>does </em>admit of exceptions; (2) where a face-to-face meeting would, in fact, so traumatize a child-witness as to prevent him or her from reasonably communicating, the State may provide for that testimony to be taken in a setting that, as nearly as practicable, preserves all other aspects embodied in the right of confrontation, but does not require the witness to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>look directly upon the defendant or to testify in his direct physical presence; and (3) if \u00a7 9-102 is implemented in the manner prescribed by <em>Wildermuth, </em>that implementation will not be deemed so violative of the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation as to constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The procedure authorized by \u00a7 9-102 and used in this case was essentially as follows. The judge, Ms. Craig, one of her attorneys, and a prosecutor remained in the courtroom with the jury. The witness testified from the judge\u2019s chambers in the presence of a prosecutor, Ms. Craig\u2019s lead counsel, and a technician. The testimony was broadcast through closed circuit television to the courtroom where everyone there could see and hear it on one or more monitors. There was a private telephone line allowing two-way communication between Ms. Craig (and the attorney with her) and her attorney in the judge\u2019s chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">It is evident that this arrangement did not amount to the kind of face-to-face confrontation that the Supreme Court held was envisioned by the Sixth Amendment. The defendant and the witnesses were in different rooms, unable to see or hear each other directly. The witnesses, it would appear, were unable to see or hear Ms. Craig at all, as the broadcasting was one-way from the chambers to the courtroom; Ms. Craig could see and hear the witnesses but only through electronic means. It follows, then, that, if the face-to-face requirement, as explicated by Justice Scalia, is indeed absolute and admitting of no exceptions, this procedure would not pass muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">We do not believe that the requirement is so rigid, however. Neither the Supreme Court nor the Maryland Court of Appeals\u2014the two courts that bind us\u2014has ever held any aspect of the Confrontation Clause, and certainly not this aspect of it, to be so absolute. Moreover, when one considers the \u201cexceptions\u201d that <em>have </em>been allowed\u2014in particular the use of extra-judicial declarations based on a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule <em>(Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980); <em>United States v. Inadi, </em>475 U.S. 387, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>(1986))\u2014they nearly always involve a situation in which evidence is given without a face-to-face confrontation at trial. That the challenge to such evidence may have been couched in terms of the right of cross-examination or some other right embodied in the Confrontation Clause does not detract from that simple fact. <em>Coy </em>did not purport to overrule <em>Roberts, </em>or <em>Inadi, </em>or any of the other decisions allowing the use of extra-judicial declarations at trial under limited circumstances, and yet, it would seem to us, that would be precisely its effect if the \u201cface-to-face\u201d requirement, as interpreted by Justice Scalia, were regarded as absolute and unyielding. We construe the majority Opinion in <em>Coy </em>as did the concurring Justices, as simply striking down the procedure used in that case and reserving for further consideration whether the more common approaches authorized by most of the States will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">On that assumption, we may return to <em>Wildermuth, </em>where, although the point was apparently conceded by the defendants, the Court made clear its own view that the right of face-to-face confrontation \u201cfundamental as it is, is not absolute. It \u2018must occasionally give way to considerations of public policy and the necessities of the case.\u2019 \u201d 310 Md. at 514, 530 A.2d 275, quoting in part from <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 243, 15 S.Ct. 337, 340, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895). That suffices, for us, to establish the flexible quality of this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Having concluded that the right of face-to-face confrontation could yield to other considerations of public policy, the <em>Wildermuth </em>Court proceeded to examine the confrontation issue further in the context of the requirements set forth in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, supra, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, that in order to accept evidence in derogation of that right, even if generally permissible, there must be a showing (1) that the witness is \u201cunavailable\u201d and (2) that the statement offered from the witness bears adequate \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d The <em>Wildermuth </em>Court concluded that a finding under \u00a7 9-102(a)(l)(ii)\u2014that, if required to testify in open court the child would suffer serious emotional distress and be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>unable to \u201creasonably communicate\u201d\u2014was \u201ctantamount to a finding of unavailability in the <em>Roberts </em>sense, and meets the necessity <em>prong </em>of the <em>Roberts </em>test.\u201d 310 Md. at 519, 530 A.2d 275. The Court also found that the statute \u201cprovides for most of the aspects of confrontation that enhance the reliability of testimony\u201d and therefore also satisfied the \u201creliability\u201d prong of the <em>Roberts </em>test. <em>Id., </em>at 515, 530 A.2d 275. Thus, it held at 520, that \u201c[t]he degree of confrontation allowed by \u00a7 9-102 ... satisfies the constitutional requirements if there is compliance with subsection (a)(l)(ii) as a condition precedent to application of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Implicit in this examination is the underlying conclusion that the State has a legitimate and compelling interest in authorizing this kind of procedure, but, to the extent that conclusion was a tacit one in <em>Wildermuth, </em>we shall articulate it now. We conceive that the State has really a two-fold interest in allowing the testimony of a child abuse victim to be given <em>via </em>closed circuit television. Paramount, of course, is the fact that, if the child-victim is actually unable to testify otherwise\u2014if he/she would be so \u201ctraumatized\u201d by a face-to-face confrontation as to be unable to \u201creasonably communicate\u201d\u2014the truth of the matter might never be revealed, a terrible crime might go unredressed, and a dangerous person might be turned loose to continue his or her predation, perhaps (and, in some instances, likely) upon the same helpless victim. In addition, although somewhat related, the State has an interest in protecting children generally from trauma, especially trauma that would result from the deliberate action of the State itself. Keeping in mind the threshold requirement in \u00a7 9-102, what is to be gained from forcing a child-victim to testify in the direct presence of the defendant when the only product of it will be further suffering for the child rather than any meaningful evidence\u2014\u00bf\u00abculpatory or exculpatory? We have no doubt that the procedure authorized by \u00a7 9-102 is one that is \u201cnecessary to further an important public policy.\u201d <em>Coy v. Iowa, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014\u2014, 108 S.Ct. at 2803.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Upon this analysis, we reject the general Confrontation Clause attack made by Ms. Craig.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">(2) <em>Findings As To Unavailability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In rejecting Iowa\u2019s argument of \u201cnecessity,\u201d Justice Scalia observed that \u201c[s]ince there have been no individualized findings that these particular witnesses needed special protection, the judgment here could not be sustained by any conceivable exception.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at \u2014 , 108 S.Ct. at 2803. The implication, of course, is that, if the right to face-to-face confrontation can be dispensed with or impaired at all, the departure must be based upon \u201cindividualized findings.\u201d It cannot rest upon some general presumption. Justices O\u2019Connor and White were in accord on that, allowing a relaxation of the requirement only upon a \u201ccase-specific finding of necessity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">The <em>Wildermuth </em>Court reached the same conclusion. Judge Adkins observed for the Court that the statutory standard set forth in \u00a7 9-102(a)(l)(ii) was indeed a difficult one, and that, to satisfy the constraints implicit in the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation, there must be \u201ca specific demonstration that the particular child witness concerned crosses the high statutory threshold.\u201d 310 Md. at 523, 530 A.2d 275. In that regard, the Court held, at 523-24, 530 A.2d 275:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">\u201cWhile personal observation by the judge may not be a <em>sine qua non </em>under \u00a7 9-102, it should be the rule rather than the exception____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">On the one hand, a judge\u2019s subjective and self-justifying recollections of a child\u2019s demeanor, absent support in the record, will not be enough to justify a finding that limits the right of confrontations [sic]____ On the other hand, expert testimony may not be essential to establish the necessary predicate____ For example, the testimony of a parent may be sufficient, when combined with the child\u2019s own testimony and judicial observation of the child____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>We shall not attempt to list all the possible ways in which evidence may meet the standard or all the ways in which it may fall short. We repeat, however, that ordinarily the judge should observe and question the child. Additionally, testimony about the likely impact on the particular child must be specific and must show much more than mere nervousness or excitement or some reluctance to testify.... While the testimony need not be given in the precise words of the statute, it must be clear that the statutory requirements are met in substance____ Testimony about the likely impact on the child testifying must be definite, related to the statutory standard, and specific to the potential child witness him or herself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3g\">(Citations omitted; footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">In <em>Wildermuth, </em>the trial court\u2019s finding was based exclusively on testimony from two social workers as to the difficulty that children in general might have testifying in court with the alleged abuser present. One witness opined that any child would find it \u201chard to respond at all in the courtroom.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 523, 530 A.2d 275. The other\u2019s testimony, though \u201cmore specific, indicating some degree of intimidation and a greater likelihood of inability to respond,\u201d still was couched in terms of \u201call children as a group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The judge \u201cnever questioned or even observed the child witness before he made his ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That, said the Court, did not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The case at bar is quite different. The testimony supporting the court\u2019s ruling here was far more specific than in <em>Wildermuth </em>and focused on each child. Ms. Burke, who had considerable experience in working with abused children, testified with respect to Brooke. She had observed Brooke in 20 therapy sessions, each lasting an hour to an hour and a half. Citing both Brooke\u2019s age and her perception of having been threatened, Ms. Burke opined that \u201cit would be very difficult if not impossible for Brooke to sit in the same room with Mrs. Craig and discuss the alleged abuse incidents.\u201d She \u201cwould probably stop talking and she would withdraw and curl up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Similar testimony was given with respect to the other child-witnesses who testified <em>via </em>closed circuit television. Ms. Burke treated two of those children, in addition to Brooke. One of them\u2014Justin\u2014Ms. Burke had seen in 18 therapy sessions. Seeing Ms. Craig as a \u201cthreatening figure,\u201d she said, \u201c[h]e\u2019s had difficulty talking\u2014making his disclosures to other people including police and protective services. He tends to change the subject which is his manner of avoiding the issue. He becomes agitated and depressed. He bursts into tears and would be unwilling or unable at that point to proceed.\u201d Of a third child\u2014Jessie\u2014 seen in 36 therapy sessions, Ms. Burke said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">\u201cAs to Mrs. Craig, she perceives herself, again, as her life has been threatened, that of her parents and her sibling too. She believes that that\u2014Mrs. Craig is capable and willing to carry out those threats at home and Jessie is fearful of this person. I believe that that fear would impair her ability to sit in front of that person or to be in the same room with that person, would be unable to discuss or to share with the required individuals that information which she has to share regarding these allegations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The fourth child-witness was being treated by Dr. Gladys Sweeney, a psychologist, who said of him: \u201che has experienced [an] extreme level of high anxiety and distress by talking about this very traumatic event and that his ability to communicate would be grossly impaired if he were to testify in an open court in the presence of Mrs. Craig.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AsR\">The testimony here, as to each child, was specific; it showed \u201cmuch more than mere nervousness or excitement or some reluctance to testify.\u201d It was upon that evidence that the court found, as a fact, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah7\">\u201cthe testimony of each of these children in a courtroom will result in each child suffering serious emotional distress and such that each of these children cannot reasonably communicate and accordingly I believe there\u2019s a need and its [sic] appropriate to direct that the testimony of these children be provided by way of closed circuit tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>vision consistent with the provisions of Section 9-102....\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Ms. Craig seemingly ignores the thrust of this evidence, concentrating instead on the fact that the judge did not examine each child directly. In the first place, as <em>Wildermuth </em>itself makes clear, personal observation of the child by the judge is not a <em>sine qua non </em>under \u00a7 9-102. We note, however, that the court here <em>did </em>have an opportunity to observe each child prior to his or her actual televised testimony, in the context of a <em>voir dire </em>examination as to their competence. Finally, although the <em>Wildermuth </em>opinion was not available when the children testified, it was available and was considered by the court in the post-trial proceeding. We assume that, in response to Ms. Craig\u2019s challenge, the court reconsidered its recollections and impressions in light of what the Court of Appeals said was required. In summary, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">(3) <em>Right Of Presence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In addition to the confrontation issue, the <em>Wildermuth </em>Court considered the argument that the closed circuit television procedure authorized by \u00a7 9-102 violated the defendant\u2019s common law and due process right of presence in that \u201cthe witness testified in a separate room, in which he was not permitted.\u201d 310 Md. at 529, 530 A.2d 275. The Court rejected the argument, observing that the defendant \u201ccould see the witness as she testified, could hear the questions asked of her and her responses, and could communicate with his lawyer in order to convey information or suggest questions to ask.\u201d Thus, the Court held, \u201c[t]he statutory procedure did not thwart a fair and just hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>in terms of due process\u201d and there was \u201cno violation of [the defendant\u2019s] due process right to be present.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 529, 530 A.2d 275. Nor, it continued, was there any violation of the common law right of presence, which had obviously been modified by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Ms. Craig seeks to distinguish her case from <em>Wildermuth </em>principally on the basis that she was \u201cunable to communicate contemporaneously with her counsel who was in chambers with the children during their testimony.\u201d In particular, she contends that the telephone line between the courtroom, where she was sitting with co-counsel, and the judge\u2019s chambers, where counsel was present with the witness, \u201cwas sufficiently disfunctional so as to deprive [her] the constant, reliable and contemporaneous communication with her attorney____\u201d The record does not bear that out.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The process was explained at the outset; there would be, and was, an open telephone line between counsel in chambers and Ms. Craig and co-counsel in the courtroom. Indeed, counsel specifically informed his client that, if she wanted to speak with him, \u201cyou merely talk on that telephone and that no one else is permitted to listen to that conversation.\u201d Ms. Craig\u2019s first complaint came after Brooke\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>examination as to competence. Brooke apparently let her voice drop a number of times, and Ms. Craig later said that \u201cshe could only hear part of what the child was saying.\u201d She did not ask that the examination be repeated, or indeed for any other relief.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Following the <em>voir dire </em>examination, but before any testimony by Brooke, counsel complained that his co-counsel had been unable to communicate with him. The court recessed and the problem was supposedly corrected. Twice more, however, counsel complained that Ms. Craig had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>unable to communicate with him, but again no specific relief was requested. The first instance came during counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Brooke. The court instructed co-counsel to interrupt the proceeding and inform the court if the problem recurred, and counsel thereupon resumed his cross-examination, apparently with the benefit of whatever Ms. Craig wanted to tell him. Following the State\u2019s brief redirect examination, counsel again noted that his client had been unable to reach him. He said that Ms. Craig had given him several questions to ask, and he sought leave to reopen his cross-examination to ask those questions. Permission was given and the questions were asked. Indeed, the cross-examination continued for nine pages of transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">On this record, we fail to see any prejudice to Ms. Craig.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">IV. THERAPIST\u2019S OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Taking a brief excerpt from Ms. Burke\u2019s testimony wholly out of context, Ms. Craig urges that the court allowed Ms. Burke, who was not qualified as an expert, to render an opinion that Brooke had been the victim of child abuse. The short answer is that Ms. Burke rendered no such opinion. She was asked to describe the kind of \u201cevaluative services\u201d she rendered for the sexual assault center. In her response, she said that children were referred to the center because of a suspicion that they had been subjected to abuse and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">\u201cmy job at that point would be to help make a determination through interviewing the child, working with them for a period of time, making a determination whether or not the symptoms and the behaviors that are being observed are consistent with those of a child who has been abused or assaulted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">We do not regard that statement\u2014the one of which Ms. Craig complains\u2014as an opinion that Brooke was subjected to abuse by Ms. Craig.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>V. REHABILITATION EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Ms. Craig complains here about the court\u2019s allowing Mrs. Etze and Ms. Burke to testify as to statements made to them by Brooke regarding the abuse inflicted on her by Ms. Craig. She correctly points out that, under the circumstances in which they were elicited, these hearsay statements would not be admissible as either excited utterances or fresh reports of sexual abuse and could come in only, if at all, as prior consistent statements to bolster Brooke\u2019s credibility. That, indeed, was the sole basis on which the court allowed the testimony. Ms. Craig argues, however, that the testimony was inadmissible even for that purpose because (1) Brooke\u2019s credibility had not as of then been impeached and (2) the statements at issue were not made prior to the existence of a motive to fabricate, those being the two predicate requirements under current Maryland law for the admission of a prior consistent statement. See <em>Finke v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 450, 492, 468 A.2d 353 (1983), <em>cert. denied </em>299 Md. 425, 474 A.2d 218, <em>cert. denied </em>469 U.S. 1043, 105 S.Ct. 529, 83 L.Ed.2d 416 (1984); <em>Boone v. State, </em>33 Md.App. 1, 363 A.2d 550, <em>cert. denied </em>279 Md. 681 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The first prong of Ms. Craig\u2019s argument proceeds from the fact that, although defense counsel suggested throughout his cross-examination that Brooke had made inconsistent statements to her parents and to Ms. Burke, that she had been coached in her testimony, and that she had been subjected to disapproval or reward depending on her answers, Brooke never admitted or concurred in any of those suggestions. Positing that impeachment can come only from answers and not merely from questions, she urges that, as Brooke never admitted counsel\u2019s implied accusations, her credibility had not legally been impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Although the precise issue does not appear to have been clearly decided before in Maryland (cf., however, <em>Finke v. State, supra, </em>56 Md.App. at 493-94, 468 A.2d 353), case law elsewhere indicates that \u201cimpeachment\u201d in this regard may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>arise from the tenor of questioning alone, and even from suggestions of counsel made in argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">In <em>Slater v. Baker, </em>301 N.W.2d 315 (Minn.1981), the plaintiff sued a physician for malpractice, alleging his failure to treat a lump in her breast that she claimed had been made known to the defendant during an examination in 1975. The doctor denied having made any such examination and vigorously cross-examined the plaintiff with respect to that alleged examination. Although the plaintiff never retracted her testimony that the examination had occurred, she attempted to introduce testimony from four witnesses of statements made by her in 1975 that the doctor had indeed examined her breast. The appellate court held the testimony admissible on the basis that \u201c[ijmplicit in respondent\u2019s vigorous cross-examination of appellant is the claim that she was being less than honest concerning the alleged 1975 examination.\u201d 301 N.W.2d at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The California courts have allowed prior consistent statements in the face of a single question on cross-examination suggesting a motive to falsify. See <em>People v. Armstrong, </em>275 Cal.App.2d 30, 79 Cal.Rptr. 668 (1969) (question whether witness had been promised payment for his testimony held to constitute an implication of motive to fabricate even though witness answered in the negative); and <em>People v. Pic\u2019l, </em>114 Cal.App.3d 824, 863, 171 Cal.Rptr. 106 (1981), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds </em>31 Cal.3d 731, 183 Cal.Rptr. 685, 646 P.2d 847 (1982) (prior consistent statement admissible following question whether witness had been granted immunity coupled with evidence that no criminal charges had been filed; even though witness denied having been granted immunity, \u201cthe question to her created the implication that her testimony lacked credibility and that she had a motive to give false testimony\u201d). See also <em>People v. DeLeon, </em>103 Mich.App. 225, 303 N.W.2d 447, 451 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aka\">\u201cThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing into evidence a prior consistent statement made by prosecution witness Garcia. Counsel for the defendant attempted to impeach witness Garcia\u2019s testimony on cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>examination <em>in closing argument by implying that recent fabrication had occurred. </em>The prosecution was properly allowed to rebut this implication with a prior consistent statement which was made by witness Garcia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIz\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">This rule has been applied as well in child abuse, particularly sexual abuse, cases. In <em>Dealing v. State, </em>100 Nev. 590, 691 P.2d 419, 421 (1984), the Court affirmed the allowance of a child\u2019s prior consistent statement where defense counsel \u201ccross-examined the child witness at considerable length with the apparent intention of implying that the child\u2019s credibility was questionable.\u201d See also <em>State v. Resendez, </em>82 Or.App. 259, 728 P.2d 562 (1986), and <em>Nusunginya v. State, </em>730 P.2d 172 (Alaska App. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Although some of these cases arose under Uniform Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B), which Maryland has not adopted, in the context of the issue before us here, they are both relevant and persuasive. There is an element of discretion here, and that discretion must be exercised not just on the basis of what a cold record ultimately will show but rather on the basis of the trial judge\u2019s perception of what has transpired. Questions alone <em>can </em>impeach. Apart from their mere wording, through voice inflections and other mannerisms of the examiner\u2014things that cannot be discerned from the printed record\u2014they can insinuate; they can suggest; they can accuse; they can create an aura in the courtroom that the trial judge can sense but about which we could only speculate. The most persistent denials, even from articulate adult witnesses, may not suffice to overcome the suspicion they can engender; a child witness, and especially a child victim, may be even more vulnerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In ruling on Ms. Craig\u2019s objection, the court noted that the whole case generated to that point by the defendant was whether Brooke\u2019s account was accurate: \u201c[i]s it the product of coaching, is it the product of ... being told something by the therapist____\u201d We find no error in the court\u2019s conclusion that Brooke\u2019s testimony had been sufficiently impeached to allow the prior statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>We turn then to whether Brooke\u2019s revelations to her parents and to Ms. Burke were made prior to the existence of any motive to fabricate.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In this regard, it is important to keep in mind the nature of the alleged motive to fabricate. There was no suggestion here that Brooke\u2019s testimony was based on some longstanding ill will against Ms. Craig or that it was the product of some general mendacity on Brooke\u2019s part. Nor is this a case in which, at some definable point in time, she either made a clearly inconsistent statement exculpating Ms. Craig or, by virtue of some event or agreement, acquired a previously nonexistent motive to testify against her. The point sought to be made on cross-examination and in the argument of counsel was rather that Brooke was coached into saying what she said on direct examination\u2014that these accusations were the product of suggestion and influence on the part of her parents and Ms. Burke.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The testimony from Mrs. Etze and Ms. Burke was designed to rebut that suggestion. The thrust of it was not the particular statements made by Brooke to her mother or Ms. Burke but rather the process used with Brooke to elicit what had occurred. Both witnesses persistently denied any coaching of Brooke, or of any system of reward and punishment based on her revelations. Both denied specific and direct questioning of Brooke or suggesting what her answers should be. The statements made by Brooke, beginning in August of 1985, were relevant not because they were made <em>before </em>any motive to fabricate but to demonstrate that there <em>was no </em>motive to fabricate. The emphasis, particularly of Ms. Burke\u2019s testimony, was on the context in which Brooke revealed what had occurred\u2014that she had been silent out of fear and that she began to open up only when made to feel comfortable and safe. The revelations at first were imprecise and hesitant; then they burst forth spontaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">This was a fair and proper response to the suggestions made on cross-examination. The particular statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>made by Brooke were part of that response, and, in that setting, were properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">VI. EXCLUSION OF DR. WALDER\u2019S OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"Ay9\">As part of her case, Ms. Craig called Dr. Leopold Walder, a clinical psychologist, to testify, based on hypothetical questions, that Brooke\u2019s responses were not within a range of what should be expected from victims of child abuse. Dr. Walder had never examined, or even talked with, Brooke, however; nor had he spoken with Ms. Burke or Brooke\u2019s parents. He had read Ms. Burke\u2019s report, referred to in Part I of this Opinion, summarizing some of the therapy sessions, and based essentially on that he seemed prepared to \u201cpresent [his] professional opinion on hypotheses about why [Brooke] would say things one way or another,\u201d and whether she \u201creacted consistent with her statements of alleged child abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Acknowledging Dr. Walder\u2019s general expertise, the court allowed him to testify \u201cconcerning the appropriateness [of] the methodology used in examining the child by [Ms. Burke].\u201d It refused, however, to allow specific testimony concerning \u201cthe manifestations of [Brooke] to the issue of child abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">We find no error. As we indicated in <em>Waltermeyer v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 69, 79, 480 A.2d 831, <em>cert. denied </em>302 Md. 8, 485 A.2d 249 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">\u201c[W]e have to start with the basic proposition that the admissibility of expert or opinion testimony is largely within the discretion of the trial court, subject to review on appeal, and that \u2018the test of admissibility of an expert\u2019s opinion should be whether his testimony will be of real appreciable help to the trier of fact in deciding the issue presented.\u2019 ... It follows from this that not every opinion of an expert is admissible, whatever its form or the source of the information upon which it is based.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8_\">(Citations omitted.) See also <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>It was evident that Dr. Walder knew no more about Brooke than what he had learned from a summary report covering some, but not all, of her therapy sessions. This alone distinguishes this case from <em>State v. Allewalt, </em>308 Md. 89, 517 A.2d 741 (1986), upon which Ms. Craig relies. The expert there, proposing to opine that the victim of an alleged rape suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, had examined the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">VII. \u201cOTHER CRIMES\u201d EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Ruling upon the State\u2019s pre-trial motion, the court determined that three children, other than Brooke, who had attended Ms. Craig\u2019s school and had allegedly been abused by her would be permitted to testify as to what had occurred to them. Based on the proffer made by the State, the court held that their testimony qualified under a number of exceptions to the rule generally excluding \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, including that tending to establish a common scheme or design and that tending to establish the identity of the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Pursuant to that ruling, and following <em>voir dire </em>examinations as to their competence, those children did indeed testify. Each stated that Ms. Craig had put an object into their anus.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Ms. Craig challenges this testimony on three bases. First, she complains that, during the course of their own therapy, these children had made statements casting doubt on their credibility, that these statements, discovered in Ms. Burke\u2019s therapy notes, had not been disclosed to defense counsel, and, had the court been aware of those statements, it may (or would) not have found that the testimony of the children sufficed to show either a common design or identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ty. Having examined the material cited by Ms. Craig in the context of all the material disclosed to counsel, we find no merit at all to that complaint. Second, she points out that Jamal Craig was charged with the \u201csame sexual child abuse\u201d of one of the children, and that fact alone \u201cundercuts the court\u2019s opinion\u201d that that child\u2019s testimony demonstrated that Ms. Craig was the actor. We do not see how or why the separate charge against Jamal, as yet untried, makes the child\u2019s testimony of what Ms. Craig did inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Finally, Ms. Craig argues that the separate indictments against her involving the other three children were \u201cas sweeping in their time frame\u201d as the one involving Brooke, and that it was \u201cas unfair to Ms. Craig to defend against them as against the indictment in this case.\u201d That argument was not presented below and therefore is not properly before us now. Md.Rule 8-131.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">VIII. COMPETENCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">As we indicated early in this Opinion, interlaced with some of the complaints made by Ms. Craig is the assertion that, by reason of various acts or omissions in the pre-trial and trial proceedings, trial counsel provided less than the minimum required level of competence, and that, as a result, she was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Her complaint in this regard centers principally on counsel\u2019s failure to obtain Ms. Burke\u2019s therapy notes and certain other material found in the files of the sexual assault center and the police and social services departments and his failure to make a proper motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Although ordinarily this issue is reserved for postconviction proceedings rather than for direct appeal, here the issue was fully tried in the hearings on Ms. Craig\u2019s motions for new trial. Trial counsel testified at great length; he was asked about nearly every facet of his approach to the case, his preparation, and his trial tactics. At the conclusion of those hearings, the judge observed that, unlike the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>normal postconviction setting where counsel\u2019s conduct is examined based on \u201csome sterile transcript,\u201d he had presided at both the pre-trial and trial proceedings. With that, he declined to find counsel incompetent \u201cas a matter of law\u201d or that Ms. Craig \u201cwas denied a fair trial as a result of [counsel\u2019s] participation in this case.\u201d More particularly, as we previously noted, the court concluded that the mass of \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence would probably not have affected the outcome of the case. The court had earlier indicated that, had it considered a motion to dismiss the indictment, it would have denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The standard to be used in assessing the performance of counsel is that enunciated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984): \u201cThe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d In selecting that standard and rejecting others suggested to it, the Court observed, at 693, 104 S.Ct. at 2067:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">\u201cEven if a defendant shows that particular errors of counsel were unreasonable ..., the defendant must show that they actually had an adverse effect on the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">It is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding. Virtually every act or omission of counsel would meet that test ... and not every error that conceivably could have influenced the outcome undermines the reliability of the result of the proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Upon the record as a whole, we are unable to conclude that the trial court\u2019s assessment of counsel\u2019s performance in the light of the <em>Strickland </em>standard was incorrect. As we indicated in Part I, the \u201cnewly discovered\u201d material presented at the post-trial hearings would not likely have changed the ultimate verdicts rendered by the jury. As to pressing a proper motion to dismiss the indictment, we observe that (1) counsel did obtain a good bit of detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>information as to the acts allegedly committed by Ms. Craig through the discovery process, (2) under the caselaw prevailing at the time, it is not at all clear that the broad time period alleged made the indictment defective, and (3) to the extent the court might have found fault with the indictment, the State would probably have been in a position to correct the fault. No claim has been made of any actual prejudice, i.e., of any inability to respond to the charges based on the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-7\">. The investigation into Ms. Craig and the activities at her school extended beyond what allegedly occurred to Brooke Etze. Ultimately, 13 separate indictments were returned against Ms. Craig. Her son Jamal Craig was also charged in two other indictments. Trial in this case proceeded only upon the one indictment of Ms. Craig involving Brooke Etze.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">. Trial counsel had already filed a motion and one amended motion for new trial on Ms. Craig\u2019s behalf. New counsel eventually filed two further amended motions for new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\">. We deal here, of course, with section (a)(1) of Rule 4-263, concerning information tending to negate or mitigate guilt or punishment, and not with section (a)(2) concerning searches, seizures, statements made by the defendant to a \"State agent\u201d that the State intends to use at trial, and pre-trial identifications of the defendant by a \"witness for the State.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">. Effective July 1, 1988, those provisions were amended and recodified. 1987 Md.Laws, ch. 635. They now appear as Fam.Law art., \u00a7\u00a7 5-701\u20145-715. The substance of the requirements noted in this Opinion has not changed. See, however, 1988 Md.Laws, ch. 769, providing a limited exemption from the reporting requirement where the disclosure would violate the attorney-client privilege provided for in Md.Code Ann.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. art., \u00a7 9-108 or the clergyman-parishioner privilege provided for in \u00a7 9-111 of that article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\">. This does not mean, of course, that every piece of information on every document in the hands of those agencies is necessarily subject to disclosure. The information must first fall within the ambit of sections (a) or (b) of the Rule, and, even if it does, subject obviously to Constitutional constraints, section (i) permits the court, upon good cause shown, to order \"that specified disclosures be restricted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\">. Ms. Burke acknowledged her awareness that \"[\u00a1Information is shared ... if there is a suspicion of child abuse.\" In light of that, in light of her allowing Assistant State\u2019s Attorney O\u2019Donnell to sit in on 12 therapy sessions with Brooke, in light of her dozen or so further telephone conversations with Ms. O\u2019Donnell, in light of the acknowledgment form signed by Mrs. Etze, of which Ms. Burke was aware, and in light of the statute requiring reports to be made to the State\u2019s Attorney \"[njotwithstanding any law on privileged communications,\u201d we find it difficult to understand how Ms. Burke could reasonably have supposed that her notes would not be obtainable by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b295-5\">. One item, of a somewhat different character, appeared in Ms. Burke\u2019s therapy notes on another child-witness, Justin. Among some undated notes is found the statement, \"Denied that anyone touched him in a way he didn\u2019t like but stated that Mrs. Craig would stop touching him so he could have his snack[.] Where: abdomen &amp; back.\u201d Ignoring the balance of the statement, Ms. Craig sees great significance in the first part\u2014\"Denied that anyone touched him in a way he didn\u2019t like\u201d\u2014as that was inconsistent with Justin\u2019s trial testimony that Ms. Craig had sexually abused him. Ms. Burke testified at the post-trial proceeding that this note reflected what Justin\u2019s mother had told Ms. Burke Justin had said to his pediatrician, Dr. \"Bob\u201d Irwin. Justin had never said any such thing to Ms. Burke, and Ms. Burke had never discussed it with Dr. Irwin. Neither Justin\u2019s mother nor Dr. Irwin were called as witnesses to shed any light on what, exactly, Justin had said. The note, then, represents a double-level hearsay statement which post-trial counsel could have, but did not, explore.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\">. As we indicated, Ms. Burke prepared a written report summarizing her therapy sessions with Brooke from July 28\u2014September 2, 1986. In that report, she recounted assertions by Brooke that \"Stacy touched her breast on top of her clothes,\u201d that \"[a] child at Sunday school touched her \u2018down there[\u2019] (points to crotch) and knocked her over,\u201d that Katie and Randy (other children at Craig\u2019s school) had told her to strip, and touched her stomach, her breast, and \u201cacross her bottom,\u201d that Salem had \"reached down the front of her blouse to retrieve a toy,\u201d that \u201csome other child\u201d had touched her on the breasts and \"touched\u201d her with a stick, and that Jamal did \"\u2018biting kisses\u2019 on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Brooke\u2019s chest and neck; that he had had his clothes off and had \u2018touched his body against mine.\u2019 \u201d Ms. Burke sent that report and a later addendum to it to the State's Attorney who turned it over to defense counsel as part of the open file discovery. Although counsel did not question Brooke about these assertions, he did ask Mrs. Etze whether Brooke had ever mentioned these incidents to her. She replied in the negative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\">.
