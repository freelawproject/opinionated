BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Ricky Hickman, appellant, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of robbery with a deadly weapon, attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. He was sentenced to a total of 25 years imprisonment. On appeal, appellant seeks reversal of his convictions on two bases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">1. The trial court erred by allowing the State to introduce, for impeachment purposes, evidence that appellant had a prior conviction for rogue and vagabond; and 2. The trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adqv\">For the purpose of resolving the issues presented on appeal, it is unnecessary that we set forth a detailed recitation of the facts. It is sufficient to note that, while walking in Baltimore City, the victims were accosted by two men armed with handguns. The two men took money, jewelry and clothing from one of the victims. After viewing separate photographic arrays, both victims chose the photograph of appellant as that of one of their assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">At a bench conference held during the State\u2019s case to discuss questions from the jury, the trial court inquired of the State whether it had any prior criminal record with which it intended to impeach appellant should he take the witness stand. The State responded by advising the court that it intended to use two theft convictions and a rogue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>and vagabond conviction. Appellant took issue with the propriety of using the rogue and vagabond conviction; nevertheless, the court ruled that it was a crime involving moral turpitude and, therefore, the State could use it. Appellant objected to that ruling. He did not renew his . objection, however, wh\u00e9n appellant, having elected to testify, was asked by the State on cross-examination about the rogue and vagabond conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">On appeal, appellant contends that permitting the rogue and vagabond conviction to be used for impeachment purposes was reversible error. The State responds, relying on <em>Prout v. </em>State, 311 Md. 348, 535 A.2d 445 (1988), that the issue has not been preserved for appellate review. To meet the State\u2019s non-preservation argument, appellant takes solace in <em>Watson v. State, </em>311 Md. 370, 535 A.2d 455 (1988). We think the State gets the better of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Notwithstanding that neither party made a motion <em>in limine </em>at the on-the-record bench conference proceedings, the effect of the court\u2019s ruling as to the admissibility of evidence of appellant\u2019s rogue and vagabond conviction was the same as if either appellant or the State, in an effort to admit or exclude the evidence, had done so. Thus, our analysis will proceed as if this issue arose by way of a motion <em>in </em>limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Prout, </em>explained the office of the motion <em>in limine:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">Typically, a motion <em>in limine </em>is a motion made before or during a jury trial outside of the hearing of the jury, the purpose of which is to prevent the jury from hearing certain questions and statements that are allegedly prejudicial to the movant. Specifically, the motion usually seeks an order restricting opposing counsel from offering questionable evidence before the judge has had an opportunity to rule on its admissibility. Evidence is most often sought to be excluded because it is incompetent, irrelevant, immaterial, privileged, or otherwise inadmissible. <em>See generally </em>McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 52, at 128 (E. Cleary, 3d ed. 1984). Thus, the real purpose of a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>in limine </em>is to give the trial judge notice of the movant\u2019s position so as to avoid the introduction of damaging evidence which may irretrievably infect the fairness of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">311 Md. at 356, 535 A.2d 445. In that case, the defendant moved <em>in limine, </em>after the jury had been selected but before opening statements, for permission to cross-examine a State\u2019s witness concerning, <em>inter alia, </em>convictions for solicitation of prostitution and prostitution. The trial court denied the motion and the defense did not make a proffer as to the convictions or, thereafter, mention the matter at trial. On appeal, responding to the defense argument that the trial court erred in denying the motion, the State contended that the issue had not been preserved for appellate review. The Court of Appeals disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Treating the lower court\u2019s ruling as if it were a grant of a motion to exclude\u2014the effect of the denial of the motion was to exclude evidence of the convictions, <em>see </em>311 Md. at 355 n. 4, 535 A.2d 445, the Court drew a distinction between the grant, and the denial, of a \u201ctraditional\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> motion <em>in limine. </em>It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">If the trial judge admits the questionable evidence, the party who made the motion ordinarily must object at the time the evidence is actually offered to preserve his objection for appellate review. However, when the trial judge resolves these motions by clearly determining that the questionable evidence will <em>not </em>be admitted, and by instructing counsel not to proffer the evidence again during trial, the proponent of the evidence is left with nothing to do at trial but follow the court\u2019s instructions. Under these circumstances, the court\u2019s ruling controls the subsequent course of the trial and the proponent\u2019s objection is preserved for review without any further action on his part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>311 Md. at 356, 535 A.2d 445. The court found support for its position in Maryland Rule 4-322.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Noting that subsection (a) requires \u201c[a]n objection to the <em>admission </em>of evidence [to] be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent,\u201d the Court held that when the court\u2019s ruling excludes evidence that subsection does not apply, (emphasis in original) 311 Md. at 356-57, 535 A.2d 445. On the other hand, it held that subsection (c), which pertains to the preservation of objections to a \u201c \u2018ruling or order\u2019 <em>other than one admitting evidence,\" </em>does apply. (Emphasis in original) 311 Md. at 357, 535 A.2d 445. \u201cThus, when a trial judge, in response to a motion <em>in limine, </em>makes a ruling to exclude evidence that is clearly intended to be the final word on the matter, and that will not be affected by the manner in which the evidence unfolds at trial, and the proponent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>evidence makes a contemporaneous objection, his objection ordinarily is preserved under Rule 4-322(c).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">We glean the following propositions from <em>Prout. </em>Whether the motion <em>in limine </em>is made before trial or during trial, a court\u2019s ruling which has the effect of admitting contested evidence does not relieve the party, as to whom the ruling is adverse, of the obligation of objecting when the evidence is actually offered. Failure to object results in the non-preservation of the issue for appellate review. On the other hand, when the effect of the ruling is to exclude the evidence, and the trial judge intends that ruling to \u201cbe the final word on the matter,\u201d a contemporaneous objection made at the time of the ruling ordinarily preserves the issue for appellate review. <em>See Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 37-38, 542 A.2d 1258, 1259-60 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, we do not believe that <em>Watson </em>has undermined these principles in any way. In <em>Watson, </em>the accused made a pretrial motion <em>in limine </em>for a ruling prohibiting the State from using, for impeachment purposes, his prior attempted rape and theft convictions. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that evidence of each of the convictions was competent for that purpose. At trial, after the accused had testified on direct, the State informed the court that it intended to use the attempted rape conviction in its cross-examination of the accused. The trial judge reiterated his pretrial ruling. Thereafter, the accused was cross-examined, without objection, as to the attempted rape conviction. On appeal, the Court of Appeals held that the issue had been preserved for appellate review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL8\">We find that Watson preserved his objection to the court\u2019s admission of his attempted rape conviction in spite of the fact that he did not object at the precise moment the testimony was elicited. Maryland Rule 4-322(a) provides that \u201c[a]n objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent.\u201d In <em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 535 A.2d 445 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>(1988), we concluded that when a trial judge makes a final ruling on a motion <em>in limine </em>to admit evidence, the party opposing the admission of the evidence must subsequently object at trial when the evidence is offered to preserve his objection for appeal. <em>Prout, </em>535 A.2d at 449. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial judge ruled prior to trial on the motion <em>in limine </em>to admit Watson\u2019s prior convictions. Thus, standing alone, Watson\u2019s objection to the trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling would be insufficient to preserve his objection for our review. However, the trial judge reiterated his ruling immediately prior to the State\u2019s cross-examination of Watson. It was during this cross-examination that the State elicited Watson\u2019s prior convictions. As we see it, requiring Watson to make yet another objection only a short time after the court\u2019s ruling to admit the evidence would be to exalt form over substance. We have repeatedly stated that neither this Court nor Rule 4-322(d) requires formal exceptions to the admission of evidence____ Accordingly, we find the issue of admissibility of Watson\u2019s attempted rape conviction preserved. (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">311 Md. at 372-73, n. 1, 535 A.2d 455. It was, then, the temporal closeness between the court\u2019s reiteration of its ruling on the motion <em>in limine </em>and the State\u2019s use of the conviction, which was the subject of the motion <em>in limine, </em>during cross-examination of the accused that mandated the result in <em>Watson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">In the instant case, the motion <em>in limine </em>was made during the trial, in the middle of the State\u2019s case and, hence, prior to the conclusion of appellant\u2019s testimony on direct examination. Moreover, in this case, the court did not reiterate its ruling just prior to the State\u2019s cross-examination of appellant. We hold, therefore, that the general rule explicated in <em>Prout </em>applies. Since appellant did not object when the evidence was offered, the issue is not preserved for our review. We do not read <em>Watson, </em>as appellant does, to apply to any motion <em>in limine </em>made during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">By way of defense, appellant sought to establish that he was somewhere else when the offenses with which he was charged were committed. He testified that he checked into the New Motel located some three miles from the place where the robbery occurred on the day before the robbery and that, except for about forty minutes beginning at 8:30 p.m. on the night of April 18,1986,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he remained in his hotel room until the morning of April 20, 1986. In connection with his testimony, appellant\u2019s counsel and the State entered into a stipulation that appellant had summonsed the registration records from the New Motel for the dates April 18-20, 1986; that the New Motel had been sold and, therefore, its records were unavailable; and that when they were available, defense counsel had seen the records and verified that a Ricky Hickman had been registered at the New Motel on April 19, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The stipulation having been communicated to the jury during appellant\u2019s cross-examination, the State asked appellant whether \u201cthe Court was asked for a summons for the Pilot Motel?\u201d Appellant\u2019s objection to the question was sustained. Although the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the question, it refused appellant\u2019s request for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Appellant now argues that the denial of his mistrial Motion was error. He asserts that, by asking about a summons for the Pilot Motel, the State suggested to the jury that defense counsel lacked integrity\u2014that counsel\u2019s verification that the New Motel records showed that appellant was registered at that motel during the applicable period was made suspect by the fact that she also sought to summons records from another motel. In appellant\u2019s view, this inconsistency could have been interpreted by the jury as evidence that counsel was untruthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>The decision whether to grant or deny a mistrial motion is vested in the sound discretion of the trial judge, the exercise of which will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of clear prejudice to the defendant. <em>Russell v. State, </em>69 Md. App. 554, 562, 518 A.2d 1081 (1987). Moreover, a mistrial should only be declared under extraordinary circumstances and where there is manifest necessity to do so. <em>Tibbs v. State, </em>72 Md. App. 239, 253, 528 A.2d 510, <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 286, 533 A.2d 1308 (1987). Where the issue involves an improper question, we defer to the trial court\u2019s judgment, since the trial judge is in the best position to evaluate the effect of the question on the jury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument is both highly speculative and conjectural. Notwithstanding that the State\u2019s question was improper and, thus, properly disallowed, on this record we do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for mistrial. We cannot say that the question caused \u201cclear prejudice to the defendant\u201d or constituted \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\">.
