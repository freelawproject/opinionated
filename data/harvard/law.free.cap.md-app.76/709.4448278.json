Bragg was injured when his motor vehicle was struck by a vehicle owned by Thomas Gaylin and driven by Timothy Fuhrman. As a result of that accident, Bragg filed a single count complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. He later amended that complaint to add an additional count. In Count I of the amended complaint, he sought to recover damages for injuries he claimed to have suffered as a result of the negligence of Fuhrman, Gaylin, and the driver of a phantom tractor trailer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In Count II Bragg sought to recover damages from Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company for breach of contract. Specifically, in Count II, Bragg asserted that Fireman\u2019s Fund had \u201crefused to live up to its contractural [sic] obligations under the phantom clause\u201d of the policy of insurance it had provided Bragg. Fireman\u2019s Fund filed a cross-claim<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking indemnification from Fuhrman and Gaylin.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">A jury found that the accident was caused by the negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>gence of Fuhrman, Gaylin and the phantom tractor trailer,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and assessed Bragg\u2019s damages at $70,000. Accordingly, after disposing of a flurry of post-trial motions, the trial judge entered judgments in favor of Bragg against Allstate Insurance Co. in the amount of $50,000 and against Fireman\u2019s Fund in the amount of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Following the entry of judgment, Fireman\u2019s Fund, Allstate and Timothy Fuhrman appealed, presenting a number of issues for our review. After responding to those issues, we shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case to that court for the entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The principle issues we have been asked to consider are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">I. Does the language of Article 48A, Section 541(c) apply to the facts of this case so as to reduce Fireman\u2019s Fund uninsured motorist liability to zero?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">II. Was the judgment and award of costs against Allstate Insurance Company for defendants, Fuhrman and Gaylin, proper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">III. Did the trial court commit prejudicial error when it permitted plaintiff\u2019s medical expert, Steven Mane-kin, to testify as to his opinion of plaintiff\u2019s character?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">IV. Did the trial court commit prejudicial error when it permitted plaintiff\u2019s medical expert to testify as to his opinion of a report written by defendant\u2019s medical expert?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-11\">V. Did the trial court commit prejudicial error when it permitted portions of appellant\u2019s deposition to be read into evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The most significant disagreement among, the parties involves the construction of Art. 48A, \u00a7 541 of the Maryland Insurance Code, entitled \u201cRequired and optional additional coverage.\u201d That section contains several subsections relating to minimum insurance coverage requirements as well as provisions for optional additional coverage. Section 541(c) provides for mandatory uninsured motorist coverage. The term \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d is defined in \u00a7 541(c)(1) as \u201ca motor vehicle whose ... use has resulted in the bodily injury or death of an insured, and for which the sum of the limits of liability under all valid and collectible liability insurance policies ... is less than the amount of coverage provided to the insured under this subsection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Section 541(c)(2) requires every motor vehicle insurance policy issued in Maryland to provide uninsured motorist coverage in at least the amounts required by Title 17 of the Transportation Article, and permits motorists to contract for higher amounts than those provided under Title 17. Section 541(c)(3) limits the liability of an insurer providing uninsured motorist coverage to \u201cthe amount of that coverage less the sum of the limits under the liability insurance policies ... applicable to the bodily injury or death of the insured.\u201d As Judge Eldridge pointed out for the Court of Appeals in <em>Hoffman v. United Services Automobile Association, </em>309 Md. 167, 172, 522 A.2d 1320 (1987) \u201c[t]his mandatory coverage has the \u2018purpose of providing minimum protection to individuals injured by uninsured motorists.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Initially, we are asked to determine whether \u00a7 541(c) is applicable to a situation, such as that in the case <em>sub judice, </em>where an individual is injured by the joint negligence of an insured and an uninsured motorist. We hold that \u00a7 541(c) is applicable to such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">While it may be that the legislature in enacting \u00a7 541(c) contemplated a situation where an individual is injured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the negligence of a single uninsured motorist, it is nevertheless clear to us that the legislation is not limited to that situation. As we said earlier, \u00a7 541(c)(1) defines an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d as one \u201cwhose use has resulted in the bodily injury or death of an insured.\" It does not provide that use of the uninsured vehicle must be the only cause of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Here, Bragg was injured by the joint negligence of Fuhrman, Gaylin and a phantom tractor trailer. The tractor trailer was a vehicle \u201cwhose use has resulted in the bodily injury ... of [the] insured.\u201d Additionally, the sum of the limits of liability under all valid and collectible insurance policies applicable to the phantom tractor trailer, (zero), was less than the amount of uninsured motorist coverage provided to Bragg by Fireman\u2019s Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Having determined that \u00a7 541(c) is applicable, we must now decide whether the limiting provision of \u00a7 541(c)(3) operates to prevent Bragg from recovering under the uninsured motorist provisions of his policy with Fireman\u2019s Fund. In other words, where, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>an individual is injured by the negligence of an insured and an uninsured tort-feasor, and the insured tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance equals the injured individual\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage, will the limiting provision of \u00a7 541(c)(3) prevent his recovery under the uninsured motorist provisions of his own policy? We hold that it will.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Section 541(c)(3) limits the liability of an insurer providing uninsured motorist coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">(3) The limit of liability for an insurer providing uninsured motorist coverage under this subsection is the amount of that coverage less the sum of the limits under the liability insurance policies ... applicable to the bodily injury ... of the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">The amount of uninsured motorist coverage provided to Bragg by Fireman\u2019s Fund was $50,000. From that must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>subtracted \u201cthe sum of the limits under the liability insurance policies ... applicable to the bodily injury ... of the insured.\u201d \u00a7 541(c)(3). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>as we have observed, the only liability insurance policy applicable to the bodily injury of Bragg is the one provided to Gaylin by Allstate Insurance Company. The limit under that policy is $50,000. Thus, the amount of uninsured motorist coverage provided to Bragg less the amount of liability insurance applicable to his injury equals zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">It is a settled principle of statutory construction that where the language of a statute is plain and free from ambiguity, there is no need to look beyond its words to find its meaning. <em>Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund v. Stith, </em>277 Md. 595, 597, 356 A.2d 272 (1976). When that principle is applied to the case at hand, we conclude that there is no need to look beyond the plain language of \u00a7 541(c)(3) to ascertain its meaning. Accordingly, we hold that Bragg may not recover from the uninsured motorist provision of his policy with Fireman\u2019s Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Despite the clear statutory language of \u00a7 541(c), Bragg nevertheless contends that \u00a7 541(c) does not apply to the facts of this case because the purpose for its enactment was to provide the insured the opportunity to recover only in an underinsured motorist situation. He relies principally on two recent Maryland decisions that discuss uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">In <em>Christensen v. Wausau Insurance Companies, </em>69 Md.App. 696, 519 A.2d 776 (1987) we were asked to interpret an insurance policy that provided separate coverage for uninsured motorists and underinsured motorists. Specifically, we were asked to determine what was meant by underinsurance, and whether, under the terms of Christensen\u2019s policy, Wausau was liable for underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">In that case, Christensen was injured when he was struck by a motor vehicle driven by Gerd W. Herrman. Although he settled with Herrman\u2019s insurance carrier for $20,000, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>maximum available under Herrman\u2019s policy, that settlement did not entirely cover the damages he suffered in the accident. Christensen therefore sued his insurer, Wausau, based upon an underinsured motorist endorsement in its policy, to recover the difference between the settlement and his actual damages. The trial court denied him recovery. Upon appeal, we reversed. We reasoned that uninsured motorist coverage is applicable when the vehicle involved in an accident is without insurance or is insured for less than the required liability limits. Underinsured motorist coverage, on the other hand, is applicable when the tort-feasor carries insurance which comports with the legal requirements, but that insurance is inadequate to cover the damages incurred. Since Christensen had paid a separate, additional premium for the underinsurance, we held that Wausau could not escape liability by claiming that the setoff provisions applicable to Christensen\u2019s uninsurance would also be applicable to his underinsurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">In <em>Hoffman v. United Services Automobile Association, </em>309 Md. 167, 522 A.2d 1320 (1987), Hoffman and his wife were passengers in a car driven by Richard Whelan. Hoffman was seriously injured and his wife killed when the vehicle in which they were riding was struck by a vehicle driven by Richard Nowakowski. Nowakowski was insured with Traveler\u2019s Insurance Company, which provided liability coverage of $20,000/$40,000. Whelan\u2019s car was insured by Hanover Insurance Company, which provided underinsured motorist coverage of $50,000/$100,000. By agreement of the parties, Nowakowski\u2019s liability coverage and Whelan\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage were apportioned.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsequently, Hoffman sued his own insurance carrier under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>supplementary endorsement relating to underinsured motorists. He sought to combine or \u201cstack\u201d the underinsured motorist coverage of the two cars owned by the Hoffmans for total coverage of $600,000/$l,000,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">In that case, although the Court of Appeals precluded stacking the underinsured motorist coverage it, concluded that \u00a7 543(a) does not apply to an automobile liability policy where the uninsured motorist coverage is amended by an endorsement providing supplementary underinsured motorist coverage as well as uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">While Bragg contends that <em>Christensen </em>and <em>Hoffman </em>stand for the proposition that \u00a7 541(c) applies only to an underinsured motorists situation, we see it quite differently. In <em>Christensen </em>we said that uninsured motorist coverage is applicable not only when the tort-feasor carries no liability insurance but also when the tort-feasor carries less insurance than the amount required by law. We did not intend, as appellee suggests, to limit the application of \u00a7 541(c) to \u201cunderinsured\u201d motorists situations. Similarly, in <em>Hoffman, </em>the Court of Appeals said that the purpose of Section 541(c)(1) \u201cwas to <em>broaden </em>the concept of an uninsured motor vehicle,\u201d 309 Md. at 172, 522 A.2d 1320. (Emphasis supplied). We do not believe the court intended, therefore, to limit \u00a7 541(c)(1) to underinsured motorist situations. While Bragg may find comfort from language in <em>Christensen </em>and <em>Hoffman </em>which seems to support his position, we point out that that language arose in a different context. Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 541(c) applies to the facts of this case, and operates to prevent Bragg from recovering under the uninsured motorists provisions of his policy with Fireman's Fund.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Although, as we have said, we are here dealing with an uninsured motorist situation, we believe that even if the phantom tractor trailer were located and found to be under-insured, the result would be ho different.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The one matter upon which all of the parties agree is Allstate\u2019s contention that the judgment rendered against it is invalid. They are, of course, correct because Allstate was not a party to this litigation. <em>See, Brashears v. Collison, </em>207 Md. 339, 349, 115 A.2d 289 (1955). Upon remand we shall direct the circuit court to correct the judgment to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The remaining arguments, raised by Fuhrman and Gaylin, challenge the admission of certain evidence during Bragg\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">First, they argue that the trial court committed reversible error when it permitted Bragg\u2019s medical expert, Dr. Manekin, to testify as to his opinion of Bragg\u2019s character. Inasmuch as the issue has not been preserved for review, we need not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">Rule 2-517 makes it clear that in order to preserve an issue for appellate review \u201c[a]n objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent.\u201d When a party has the option of objecting, his failure to do so is regarded as a waiver estopping him from obtaining review of that point on appeal. <em>Phil J. Corp. v. Markle, </em>249 Md. 718, 725, 241 A.2d 718 (1968). It is not enough that another party has objected to the same evidence. Each party must make it clear that he or she has an objection to the particular evidence. <em>See Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Here, although counsel for Fireman\u2019s Fund promptly objected when Dr. Manekin began to testify, on appeal Fireman\u2019s Fund is not challenging the admissibility of that testimony. At no point during Dr. Manekin\u2019s testimony did counsel for Fuhrman and Gaylin object, nor did he attempt to join in the objection voiced by Fireman\u2019s Fund. We therefore hold that the matter has not been preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Fuhrman and Gaylin next complain that the trial court erred when it permitted Dr. Manekin, during Bragg\u2019s casein-chief, to criticize a report written by their medical expert, Dr. Sapre. Dr. Sapre had not yet testified when Dr. Mane-kin told the jury that, in his opinion, Sapre\u2019s examination was incomplete and his findings were incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Of course, the order of proof in a civil trial is largely a matter left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>Thimatariga v. Chambers, </em>46 Md.App. 260, 416 A.2d 1326, <em>cert. denied, </em>288 Md. 744 (1980), <em>Martin Fertilizer Co. v. Thomas &amp; Co., </em>135 Md. 633, 109 A. 458 (1920). The plaintiff may present evidence during its case-in-chief which is relevant only because it rebuts an anticipated defense, if in the exercise of its discretion it is permitted by the trial court. <em>McGoldrick v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>430 Pa. 597, 241 A.2d 90, 93 (1968) (citing <em>Edensburg Trust Co. v. Pike, </em>296 Pa. 462, 146 A. 122 (1929)). <em>See also </em>McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 300.2 (1987). That decision will be disturbed on appeal only if it is shown to be an abuse of discretion resulting in clear prejudice. <em>McGoldrick, supra, </em>241 A.2d at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">While it is no doubt the better practice to permit a witness to testify prior to rebutting that testimony, we are unable to find that the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed the testimony of Dr. Manekin during Bragg\u2019s case-in-chief. Dr. Sapre was given ample opportunity to rehabilitate himself during Fuhrman\u2019s and Gaylin\u2019s case-in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>chief by testifying as to the accuracy of his examination and findings. Indeed, Dr. Sapre had the last word on the matter. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">During his deposition, Fuhrman was asked whether he agreed with a previous witness that the accident was his fault. Fuhrman\u2019s counsel objected and instructed Fuhrman not to answer the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The trial judge permitted a portion of Fuhrman\u2019s deposition to be read to the jury, including the portion we have just referred to. Fuhrman and Gaylin now argue that it was reversible error to permit the reading of that portion of Fuhrman\u2019s deposition as it contained an argumentative question which no doubt improperly influenced the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Questions concerning the admissibility of evidence are within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Q.C. Corp. v. Maryland Port Admin., </em>68 Md.App. 181, 510 A.2d 1101 (1986) , <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>310 Md. 379, 529 A.2d 829 (1987) . Ordinarily, that decision will not be reversed on appeal unless there has been clear prejudice. <em>Tully v. Dasher, </em>250 Md. 424, 436, 244 A.2d 207 (1968). <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 528, 495 A.2d 1 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">We have carefully examined the record and we fail to see how Fuhrman and Gaylin were prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s admission of the evidence about which complaint is made. They were no worse off than if an objection to the same question asked of Fuhrman at trial had been sustained. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">Upon remand the court shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-13\">(1) Strike the judgment and award of costs against Allstate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-14\">(2) Enter a judgment against Fuhrman and Gaylin in the amount of $70,000, and assess the costs of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>(3) Grant Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT VACATED.
