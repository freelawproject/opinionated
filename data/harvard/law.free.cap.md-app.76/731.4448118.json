At sentencing on November 26, 1982, Judge Hammerman, who presided over the trial, explained that appellant was entitled to more consideration than his co-defendants because he alone confessed to the crime, thus aiding in the convictions of the others, and because he alone expressed remorse. The judge imposed the maximum sentences the law allows on the two co-defendants. In contrast, instead of giving appellant the maximum sentence of life in prison, Judge Hammerman imposed a \u201clife sentence with fifteen years of it suspended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Appellant was understandably puzzled by the sentence. His counsel\u2019s inquiry to the trial judge as to what exactly the sentence meant was met with the response, \u201cThat\u2019s up to the Parole Board, not up to me.\u201d Appellant and his co-defendants then jointly appealed to this Court, appellant claiming, among other things, that the use of his confession at trial was unlawful and that he was entitled to be resentenced because the sentence was vague and indefinite. We affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>Ball v. State, 57 </em>Md. App. 338, 470 A.2d 361 (1984), <em>modified on other grounds </em>307 Md. 552, 515 A.2d 1157 (1986). In doing so, we noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGC\">\u201cWe agree with the appellant Coley that in this case, some clarification is in order. It may well have been that what the sentencing judge intended was to impose a sentence of life imprisonment, all but 15 years of which would be suspended. A definite term of imprisonment followed by a suspension of the remainder of the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>gives clear guidelines to the prison authorities, to the Parole Board, and to the appellant himself. The very indefiniteness of a life expectancy, however, would make it impossible for the parole authorities to calculate backward from an uncertain date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The resentencing hearing held on January 18, 1988 did not proceed as we had expected. Upon reminding the trial judge that \u201c[i]t was clearly the Court\u2019s intention, at the time of sentencing, that Mr. Coley receive something less than a life sentence, based on various mitigating factors ...,\u201d appellant\u2019s counsel was told by the judge that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">\u201c[I]f it can be said, and I emphasize the word \u2018if\u2019\u2014if it can be said, I felt because of what Mr. Coley did in the courtroom, he deserved some degree of consideration on the sentenced d]id he not in his appeal try to repudiate that which he did in the courtroom? And did he not really say that things shouldn\u2019t have gone down the way they did in the courtroom, and that my confession shouldn\u2019t have been admitted, and it\u2019s improper to consider it? Didn\u2019t he really retreat from his responsible acts in the courtroom?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The trial judge then resentenced appellant to life in prison with no time suspended. Although he commented that he did not hold appellant\u2019s appeal against him, the judge pointed out: \u201cMr. Coley, I do not have all the same feelings today that I did have the day that you were before me for sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Appellant brings this appeal as a result of this seeming increase in his sentence, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-10\">1. The trial judge illegally increased appellant\u2019s sentence by reinstating the suspended portion of his life sentence after remand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-11\">2. Appellant is entitled to be resentenced by another judge because the judge below has demonstrated an inability to disregard impermissible sentencing factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>We find merit in appellant\u2019s first contention but none in the second, and therefore shall remand to the trial judge for another resentencing, this time with a helpful suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The record of the initial sentencing hearing clearly shows that the trial judge intended to sentence appellant to something less than life in prison. Nevertheless, the judge imposed a full life sentence on remand.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">Trial courts in Maryland are directed by statute that: \u201cIf an appellate court remands a criminal case to a lower court in order that the lower court may pronounce the proper ... sentence ... the lower court may impose any sentence authorized by law to be imposed as punishment for the offense. However, it may not impose a sentence more severe than the sentence previously imposed for the offense unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">(1) The reasons for the increased sentence affirmatively appear;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">(2) The reasons are based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the original sentence was imposed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">(3) The factual data upon which the increased sentence is based appears as a part of the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 12-702(b) (1973). This statute in essence codifies <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), which held that although a sentence may sometimes be increased upon retrial after a successful appeal, a defendant is denied due process if the increase is designed to punish him for appealing. It further expands the <em>Pearce </em>doctrine to prohibit a retaliatory increase in sentence where the conviction is upheld on appeal but the sentence is vacated. <em>See Nimon v. State, </em>71 Md.App. 559, 526 A.2d 645 (1987); <em>Hill v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 194, 201, 494 A.2d 757 <em>cert. denied </em>304 Md. 298, 498 A.2d 1185 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">Applying \u00a7 12-702(b) to the case at bar, we find that the resentencing was improper. Although we cannot know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>exactly how long a life sentence with 15 years suspended is, it is clear really beyond cavil that, in imposing that sentence, the court intended that Coley\u2019s term of actual imprisonment be less than a full life sentence and that Coley be released from confinement at some point prior to the end of his life by virtue of the sentence itself. <em>See, in general, Hanson v. Hughes, </em>52 Md.App. 246, 447 A.2d 892 <em>aff'd </em>294 Md. 599, 451 A.2d 664 (1982). It is evident, then, that the resentencing involved an increase in sentence. While the trial judge could have increased the sentence due to some \u201cidentifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the original sentence was imposed,\u201d \u00a7 12-702(b)(2), the \u201cidentifiable conduct\u201d must have been criminal or other reprehensible behavior. <em>Cf. Davis v. State, 312 </em>Md. 172, 539 A.2d 218 (1988); <em>Jones v. State, </em>307 Md. 449, 514 A.2d 1219 (1986); <em>Briggs v. State, </em>289 Md. 23, 421 A.2d 1369 (1980). The record indicates no such conduct on appellant\u2019s part, and thus leads us to conclude that the sentence was increased solely because of the partially successful appeal. That is simply not allowed. The Supreme Court has warned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">\u201c[T]he very threat inherent in the existence of such a punitive policy would, with respect to those still in prison, serve to \u2018chill the exercise of basic constitutional rights.\u2019 [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">[S]ince the fear of such vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction, due process requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-7\"><em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. at 724-25, 89 S.Ct. at 2080.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">We do not miss the irony in the fact that appellant was able to use his confession as a shield for sentencing purposes but as a sword for purposes of his unsuccessful appeal. While we recognize the frustration this tactic may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>have caused the trial judge, we find it was simply not grounds to carve an exception to the <em>Pearce </em>or Maryland statutory doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">We are not persuaded by the State\u2019s argument that since the original sentence was vague and indefinite the resentencing cannot be seen as an increase and that the <em>Pearce </em>doctrine is therefore inapplicable. As explained, <em>supra, </em>though too indefinite to be executed, the original sentence was not so vague that we cannot discern that an increase has been made. Furthermore, although the indefiniteness of the sentence rendered it illegal, Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 639(a), and \u201cthe [trial] court may correct an illegal sentence at anytime,\u201d Md.Rule 4-345(a), this Court has held that an attempt to increase an illegal sentence on remand must be analyzed under <em>Pearce </em>to determine if the increase is being made for an improper purpose. <em>Hill v. State, </em>64 Md.App. at 199-202, 494 A.2d 757; <em>see also North Carolina v. Lowry, </em>10 N.C.App. 717, 179 S.E.2d 888, 889-90 (1971); <em>Grobarchik v. Wisconsin, </em>307 N.W.2d 170, 177, 102 Wis.2d 461 (1981). Simply to ignore the initial sentence\u2014to treat it as a nullity, something that never happened\u2014might be convenient, but it would fly in the face of <em>North Carolina v. Pearce </em>and our own statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The problem, of course, is how to comply with the <em>Pearce! </em>legislative mandate, given the nature of the initial sentence. Although there may be other ways, we suggest one that the court seriously consider; i.e., (1) at the resentencing hearing, take evidence and make a finding of Coley\u2019s life expectancy; (2) deduct 15 years from that life expectancy; and (3) impose a life sentence with all but that net amount (life expectancy less 15 years) suspended. That, at least, will approximate what we think the court initially intended to accomplish.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">We see no reason to direct that the resentencing be before a different judge. We presume that Judge Hammer-man will act in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR RESEN-TENCING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION; MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
