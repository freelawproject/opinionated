BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Ronald Nathaniel Wooten-Bey was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County of felony murder, attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court imposed sentences of life imprisonment and 20 years, to be served consecutively.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wooten-Bey raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">\u2014Was it reversible error for the trial court to deny Wooten-Bey access to his counsel during a luncheon recess?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>\u2014Did the trial court improperly advise Wooten-Bey about his right not to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u2014Did the trial court strike prospective jurors for cause without a sufficient basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u2014Should the trial court have admitted evidence offered by the defense purportedly showing that Wooten-Bey voluntarily surrendered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\u2014Did the trial court improperly restrict the cross-examination of a prosecution witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\u2014Were the trial court\u2019s jury instructions incorrect and biased in the prosecution\u2019s favor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">\u2014Does the rule of lenity operate so as to prevent Wooten-Bey\u2019s conviction of both conspiracy to rob and attempted robbery with a deadly weapon?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">We affirm, and hold that Wooten-Bey received a fair trial. We explain, addressing each issue raised by Wooten-Bey in the order in which it appears above. Facts relevant to each issue will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">RIGHT TO COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">Appellant testified in his own defense. Near the close of his direct testimony, appellant\u2019s attorney asked the trial judge if appellant could continue his direct testimony after the luncheon recess:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-13\">\u201cMR. CHRISTMAS [appellant\u2019s attorney]: Your Honor, I think I have about five more minutes, but I\u2019m not sure. May I inquire if we might take a luncheon break, and I can finish within five minutes. I may have even less then [sic] that, if that is agreeable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. [Jury Foreman], and ladies and gentlemen, we will indeed break until 1:30 for lunch. In case he\u2019s fooling, normally I don\u2019t break until 1:15, but I\u2019ve already ordered the jail cases to be here at 1:00. All right. Mr. Wooten-Bey, you are a sequestered witness sir, which means you may not now discuss with anybody, including Mr. Christmas anything about your testimony on the witness stand, because you are sequestered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>\u201cMR. CHRISTMAS: I think I do have the right to talk about what I may ask him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Under no circumstances may you talk to a witness under oath on the witness stand. You, or Mr. Harvey [State\u2019s Attorney], or anybody. That witness is sequestered, and under oath, and going through their testimony. As opposed to a sequestered witness outside, you can talk to. But not once the witness is sequestered by the oath, they\u2019re not to be approached by anybody. And with that, we\u2019ll\u2014please keep the admonitions in mind, [jury foreman], and ladies and gentlemen, and we\u2019ll recess for lunch until 1:30.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The trial judge then qualified this statement,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> telling defense counsel that he was <em>not </em>forbidding all consultation between appellant and his attorney during lunch, only consultation concerning appellant\u2019s \u201cprospective testimony.\u201d When the trial court reconvened after lunch, appellant\u2019s attorney had only two brief questions for his client before finishing his direct examination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cross-examination and redirect then ensued. After the prosecutor had completed his recross-examination, appellant\u2019s attorney informed the trial court that, although he wished to rest the defense, appellant wanted to resume the stand because he felt he had been \u201crushed\u201d through his testimony. The trial judge excused the jury for a recess and the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, now that he\u2019s off the stand, Mr. Christmas, how about taking the opportunity, if you feel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>it will be fruitful, of talking with him, and see what it is he wants to say, for the purpose of being able to advise him only. Not for advising me. That would be strictly confidential, what he tells you, and what you tell him. And then if he still feels that way, I\u2019ll inquire of him. If that is what he wants to do, the State says they have no objection. I\u2019ll let him do it. It\u2019s his trial. But I\u2019ll talk to him like a Dutch Uncle first. You want to talk to him ...?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\">\u201cMR. CHRISTMAS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Why don\u2019t I take a five minute recess, so you can talk to the man, and maybe I can help out the situation too.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">When the trial court reconvened after appellant and his attorney had conferred, appellant no longer wished to retake the witness stand, and the defense rested. Appellant was convicted by the jury, and defense counsel filed a motion for a new trial, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial judge had denied appellant his Sixth Amendment right to consult with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">We agree with appellant that the trial judge erred in imposing <em>any </em>restriction on appellant\u2019s right to consult with his attorney during the luncheon recess. We decline, however, to impose a per se rule of reversal where the denial of access was brief, limited in scope, and where the trial judge gave counsel and appellant time to confer when it became apparent that they needed to do so, thus curing any constitutional defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">In <em>Geders v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 80, 91, 96 S.Ct. 1330, 1336, 47 L.Ed.2d 592 (1976), the Supreme Court held that a trial judge\u2019s order denying the defendant all access to his attorney during a 17-hour overnight recess violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel. The Court explicitly declined to reach the question of whether a denial under other circumstances (presumably during circumstances involving a shorter period of time) would violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>In <em>Geders, </em>the Court stated that witness sequestration orders could not be applied to a defendant in the same manner in which they could be applied to nonparty witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">\u201cBut the petitioner was not simply a witness; he was also the defendant. A sequestration order affects a defendant in quite a different way from the way it affects a nonparty witness who presumably has no stake in the outcome of the trial. A nonparty witness ordinarily has little, other than his own testimony, to discuss with trial counsel; a defendant in a criminal case must often consult with his attorney during the trial. Moreover, \u2018the rule\u2019 accomplishes less when it is applied to the defendant rather than a nonparty witness, because the defendant as a matter of right can be and usually is present for all testimony and has the opportunity to discuss his testimony with his attorney up to the time he takes the witness stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-6\"><em>Geders, </em>425 U.S. at 88, 96 S.Ct. at 1335.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The <em>Geders </em>court found that there were methods other than a deprivation of counsel to accomplish the intended goal of a witness sequestration order. One method is a skillful cross-examination designed to elicit signs of witness coaching. The evidence of coaching may then be incorporated into an opposing party\u2019s closing argument. <em>Geders, </em>425 U.S. at 89-90, 96 S.Ct. at 1335-1336. The method most important for our analysis here is trial court control of the timing of a defendant\u2019s testimony. <em>Geders, </em>425 U.S. at 90-91, 96 S.Ct. at 1336-1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">In holding that the 17-hour deprivation required a new trial for the defendant, the <em>Geders </em>court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which had held that the defendant\u2019s failure to claim that he was prejudiced by his inability to consult with his counsel was fatal to his appeal. <em>Geders, </em>425 U.S. at 86, 96 S.Ct. at 1334. Implicit in the <em>Geders </em>holding, therefore, is that prejudice need not be shown where the deprivation has been complete and of 17-hour duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>The question of whether a <em>per se </em>rule requiring reversal and retrial should be automatically applied for <em>any </em>deprivation of the right of a criminal defendant to consult with his attorney has not been answered by the Supreme Court. Nor has this precise question been addressed by the Court of Appeals of Maryland. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has held, however, that it would not apply a <em>per se </em>rule of reversal where the deprivation occurred during a 15-minute recess, and where it had been shown that the defendant had been well represented by competent counsel throughout the proceedings, and where he had not been denied access to his attorney during numerous other recesses. <em>Perry v. Leeke, </em>832 F.2d 837, 845 (1987).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although we are not bound by an interpretation of the federal constitution made by the Fourth Circuit, <em>see United States ex. rel. Lawrence v. Woods, </em>432 F.2d 1072, 1076 (7th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 983, 91 S.Ct. 1658, 29 L.Ed.2d 148 (1971), we are persuaded by the analysis contained in <em>Perry, </em>finding it in keeping with the Supreme Court\u2019s view expressed in <em>Geders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The facts in the instant case are even more similar to those in <em>Perry </em>than to those in <em>Geders. </em>The defendant in <em>Perry </em>was on the witness stand and had completed direct testimony when the trial judge ordered a 15-minute recess. Perry\u2019s attorney tried to speak to Perry during the recess in order to advise him of his rights on cross-examination. The trial judge refused to allow the consultation because of concern that Perry would be coached. <em>Perry, </em>832 F.2d at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In holding that this denial of the right to counsel did not mandate reversal, the Fourth Circuit stated that its previous position that it was <em>always </em>reversible error for a trial judge to prevent a defendant and attorney from consulting, <em>United States v. Allen, </em>542 F.2d 630 (4th Cir.1976), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>denied, </em>430 U.S. 908, 97 S.Ct. 1179, 51 L.Ed.2d 584 (1977), and <em>Stubbs v. Bordenkircher, </em>689 F.2d 1205 (4th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 907, 103 S.Ct. 1879, 76 L.Ed.2d 810 (1983), was no longer viable in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984), and <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>467 U.S. 1267, 104 S.Ct. 3562, 82 L.Ed.2d 864 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\"><em>Strickland </em>and <em>Cronic </em>both concerned claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. In these cases, the Supreme Court held that the analysis of claims alleging a denial of assistance of counsel must center on prejudice because the purpose behind the Sixth Amendment is to ensure that criminal defendants receive a fair trial. <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. at 2046. Therefore, \u201cthe ultimate focus of inquiry must be on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 696, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. A complete denial of counsel during a critical stage of trial, however, will mandate automatic reversal. <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 659 and n. 25, 104 S.Ct. at 2047 and n. 25. The standard is whether the defendant received a fair trial in which \u201cevidence subject to adversarial testing is presented to an impartial tribunal for resolution of issues defined in advance of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 685, 104 S.Ct. at 2063. Counsel\u2019s assistance must be such as to \u201cjustify reliance on the outcome\u201d of the defendant\u2019s trial. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. at 2067.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The <em>Perry </em>Court found that it made little sense to distinguish between situations involving ineffective assistance of counsel and those involving a brief denial of counsel, stating that ineffective assistance of counsel throughout a trial \u201cis far more likely to have a prejudicial effect than the deprivation at issue here.\u201d Additionally, it noted that the Supreme Court had blurred any distinction by describing <em>Geders </em>in later opinions as both a denial of counsel case, and as a case involving ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Perry, </em>832 F.2d at 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The <em>Perry </em>Court, quoting <em>Rose v. Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986), stated that \u201c[a] <em>per se </em>rule of reversal is \u2018the exception and not the rule\u2019 under any circumstances.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>at 842. Such a rule is only warranted where the error is of the type that threatens the overall reliability of the trial. One of the major concerns of the <em>Perry </em>Court in imposing a <em>per se </em>rule in all situations involving even a brief denial of counsel was the high administrative and emotional price to be paid. The passage of time makes it difficult to find witnesses who have retained a clear memory of events, and makes a second prosecution problematical.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">\u201cEven if an effective retrial is possible, it imposes enormous costs on courts and prosecutors, who must commit already scarce resources \u2018to repeat a trial that has already once taken place.\u2019 It imposes costs on victims who must \u2018relive their disturbing experiences.\u2019 While \u2018prejudicial error\u2019 would require a retrial regardless of the inconvenience, those who participated in the initial proceedings should not be compelled to confront these dreadful events a second time if the first trial has been fair. Retrials, moreover, may lack the reliability of the initial trial where witness testimony was unrehearsed and witness recollections were more immediate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\"><em>Perry, </em>832 F.2d at 843 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The Court in <em>Perry </em>went on to determine that Perry had suffered no prejudice because he had failed to show that the brief deprivation altered his performance on cross-examination. The trial record before the <em>Perry </em>Court indicated that Perry \u201ctook full advantage of his rights on cross-examination and placed his version of events before the jury.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>832 F.2d at 843 (footnote omitted). Other factors, such as the overwhelming nature of the physical evidence against Perry, the vigor and competence of Perry\u2019s attorneys, the brief duration of the deprivation, and the fact that there was no other claimed defect in the long trial persuaded the Court that Perry received a fair trial even if the 15-minute deprivation was error. <em>Perry, </em>832 F.2d at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>In <em>Clark v. State, </em>306 Md. 483, 510 A.2d 243 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1084, 107 S.Ct. 1286, 94 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987), the Court held that prejudice need not be proved where the trial court prohibited consultation between defendant\u2019s counsel and counsel for co-defendant regarding their joint exercise of peremptory challenges. The Court went on to state, however, that the State may show that the deprivation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court in <em>Clark </em>held that the trial court\u2019s error impaired the defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel because \u201ceffective representation means representation in which the attorney is unhindered in the lawful pursuit for knowledge which might benefit the client.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>306 Md. at 489, 510 A.2d 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In the instant case, although the trial judge erred in denying appellant access to his attorney during the luncheon recess, the error was cured. When the court reconvened, the trial judge called a brief recess expressly for counsel to confer with his client. It is evident that the conference was fruitful because afterward appellant no longer wished to prolong his testimony. Appellant would also have had time during this conference to ask any questions he had concerning his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">We are unpersuaded that the trial judge\u2019s error in denying appellant access to his attorney in the instant case threatened the reliability of the trial. As in <em>Perry, </em>it is clear that appellant had an opportunity to and did confer with his counsel during other court recesses. The record reveals that appellant\u2019s attorney made diligent defense efforts for his client, including a fully argued new trial motion based on the deprivation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As in <em>Perry, </em>appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>had a sufficient opportunity to present his story to the jury. The trial record shows that appellant testified at length, and was an articulate witness. Again, as in <em>Perry, </em>there was ample evidence from which the jury could find appellant guilty of the charge. Appellant did not deny that the shooting occurred and that he was present at the time. The handgun involved was found in appellant\u2019s car. Other witnesses testified to appellant\u2019s involvement. The jury in the instant case also had appellant\u2019s written statement to consider, his flight from the scene, and his failure to go to the hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Appellant was admittedly deprived of his right to counsel for a longer period of time than was the defendant in <em>Perry. </em>In <em>Geders, </em>the Court did not require that prejudice be shown primarily because of the length of the deprivation and strategic importance of overnight consultation before the next day\u2019s trial. <em>Geders, </em>425 U.S. at 88, 96 S.Ct. at 1835. The hour-long deprivation here does not rise to the level where prejudice to appellant\u2019s case can be presumed, as it was in <em>Geders. </em>Moreover, in the instant case, the trial judge remedied the deprivation by calling a recess for consultation shortly after lunch. As pointed out in <em>Geders, </em>425 U.S. at 90, 96 S.Ct. at 1336, a trial judge has the inherent power to \u201cdirect that the examination of the witness continue without interruption until completion.\u201d The trial judge in the instant case could have required defense counsel to finish direct examination before the luncheon recess\u2014indeed, the trial judge could have required that direct and cross-examination be completed without interruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Although the Court of Appeals in <em>Clark </em>did not require that prejudice be shown, the deprivation involved there was very different from that in the instant case. What was prohibited in <em>Clark </em>was consultation between two attorneys in a joint trial. As a result of the deprivation, a concerted effort to choose jurors was impossible. In <em>Clark, </em>the effect of such a deprivation was immediately apparent, and affected the overall fairness of the conviction. In the instant case, there is no immediately ascertainable effect on appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">By our holding today, we impose no requirement that a criminal defendant divulge the contents of privileged consultations with his attorney in order to establish prejudice. Rather, we are stating that, where the deprivation is short enough so that prejudice cannot be presumed and it is apparent that the proceeding was fundamentally fair, a <em>per se </em>rule of reversal and retrial will not be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">For the above reasons, we hold that appellant has failed to show that the deprivation of counsel, which occurred during the luncheon recess, compromised his right to a fair trial. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the deprivation would have altered the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Appellant contends that the trial judge\u2019s on-the-record explanation of his constitutional right not to testify was misleading enough to constitute reversible error. We disagree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The portion of the explanation that appellant cites as erroneous is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: ... Let me see if I can address it to you in layman\u2019s terms. <em>If you choose not to take the witness stand, part and parcel of what goes along with that is the possible disadvantage that somebody on that jury panel is going to say, look, this guy is obviously guilty, because guilty people hide. </em>And innocent people are willing to talk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>\u201cThat could happen, and <em>all the judges instructions in America can not overcome a person who is of contrary mind, if you know what I mean. If I sit there and say you can\u2019t do this, and they say, the hell I can\u2019t. </em>So if you don\u2019t testify, obviously one of the disadvantages that could go along with not testifying, it doesn\u2019t mean it will. If they listen to my instructions to a fair-thee-well, and most jurors do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">\u201cIt\u2019s my experience they follow judges instruction\u2019s [sic] right down the line. Then that adverse part would not play a part. I can not tell you, you\u2019re saying to me, but what is this business about Harvey getting to cross examine me? Well, if you do take the witness stand, Harvey, Mr. Harvey will have the right to cross examine you. He may choose not too. Although honesty impels me to say, I can\u2019t conceive of that.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s emphasis.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">What appellant fails to mention is that this was the second time during the trial that the judge had touched on the right to remain silent. In fact, the portion appellant contends as error was in reality a continuance of a previous discussion between appellant, his attorney, and the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Before a jury had been impaneled, appellant\u2019s attorney requested and was granted an in camera hearing. At this hearing, the attorney asked to be released, informing the trial judge that he and appellant were \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d in regard to a defense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court declined to release Wooten-Bey\u2019s attorney. After the State\u2019s Attorney asked the trial judge to make an explicit finding that appellant did not intend to represent himself at trial, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Well, let\u2019s find out from [appellant] what he is asking for. What would you like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">\u201c[APPELLANT]: Ideally, I would like Mr. Christmas to be able do [sic] handle my case. But if he, as he has stated, has problems with a defense in my behalf, I believe whole heartedly, that <em>my greatest defense is going to be me on the stand. It basically boils down to, your Honor, what I believe to be the truth, and what the State is presenting. And his witnesses will have to testify on that behalf, and I\u2019ll have to testify for the defense.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">\u201cThat is basically the way it was in the first trial. Legal tactics, I\u2019m not a lawyer. So to answer Mr. Harvey, I don\u2019t wish to represent myself____\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The trial judge, obviously concerned that appellant understood the ramifications of his decision to testify, went on at some length to instruct appellant in this regard. During the ensuing discussion, appellant received a detailed explanation of his right to remain silent and, if appellant chose not to take the stand, \u201cthe Court\u2019s instruction to the jury in the strongest of terms, will be that they may not in anyway what-so-ever consider your silence in deciding upon your guilt or innocence.\u201d The trial judge went on to say that such an instruction was appellant\u2019s right and that, if the jury disregarded the instruction, it \u201cwould be in total violation of their office.\u201d Additionally, appellant fails to mention that the trial judge had, just minutes before the allegedly misleading explanation, at his counsel\u2019s request, informed appellant that both the federal and state constitutions afforded him the absolute right not to testify and that appellant was not required to prove his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">A long exposition to the accused on his right not to testify at his trial is unnecessary. Indeed, the trial judge covered the basics in the passages we have referred to above. In <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 1233, 14 L.Ed.2d 106, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>381 U.S. 957, 85 S.Ct. 1797, 14 L.Ed.2d 730 (1965), the Supreme Court held that it was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>violation of the Fifth Amendment for a jury to consider an accused\u2019s failure to testify in his own defense. In <em>Carter v. Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 805, 101 S.Ct. 1112, 1121, 67 L.Ed.2d 241 (1981), the Court held that a criminal defendant has a Fifth Amendment right to a cautionary instruction forbidding the jury from drawing any inference from an accused\u2019s failure to testify. The question here, however, is not the existence of these rights, but whether appellant was misled and induced by the trial judge\u2019s explanations into taking the stand, thus risking the jury\u2019s exposure to his prior criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We have taken the trouble to detail these parts of the trial judge\u2019s explanation excluded in appellant\u2019s assignment of error in order to show the breadth of the full comments made to appellant. It is apparent from appellant\u2019s statements contained in the trial record, <em>supra, </em>that he had made a decision to testify long before the trial judge made these allegedly erroneous comments. The trial judge made a full explanation to appellant then, and gave another full explanation before appellant was to testify. Appellant was an articulate and well-educated person\u2014in fact, a college graduate. The record shows that he received and understood the ample instruction about his right to remain silent, but that he was determined to testify in spite of counsel\u2019s advice to the contrary. Indeed, it is obvious from the record that the trial judge gave appellant extensive information at appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s request, and in response to appellant\u2019s direct questions of the court. We hold that the trial judge did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION OF PROSPECTIVE JURORS</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">During the voir dire examination of prospective jurors, the trial court asked any juror to stand if he or she had any moral, ethical, religious, political or other objection to the death penalty which would enter into his or her determination of a verdict, or which would prevent the juror from following court instructions. Fourteen jurors stood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>and were excused by the trial judge without an individual inquiry as to how or why their verdict might be affected. Appellant asserts that this removal of jurors was error because such an examination could have been \u201cenlightening and fruitful,\u201d and because the prospective jury candidates may have misunderstood the trial judge\u2019s question. Appellant also asserts that the trial court erred in excusing a juror who stated that \u201c[i]t\u2019s kind of hard to say,\u201d when asked if he could reach a fair and impartial verdict in spite of a relative\u2019s incarceration for murder. We disagree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 522-23, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-78, 20 L.Ed.2d 776, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>393 U.S. 898, 89 S.Ct. 67, 21 L.Ed.2d 186 (1968), the Supreme Court held that the State infringes a capital defendant\u2019s constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury when it excuses for cause all those members of the venire who express objections to the death penalty. Jurors may be excused for cause if they make it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\u201cunmistakably clear ... that they would <em>automatically </em>vote against the imposition of capital punishment or ... that their attitude ... would prevent them from making an impartial decision as to the defendant\u2019s <em>guilt.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqJ\"><em>Witherspoon, </em>391 U.S. at 522-23, n. 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1776-77, n. 21 (emphasis in original). The <em>Witherspoon </em>holding was, however, limited to the facts in that case\u2014a state statute provided that it was cause for challenge if a juror expressed \u201cconscientious scruples\u201d to the death penalty. <em>Witherspoon, </em>391 U.S. at 512, 88 S.Ct. at 1772.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">In <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 424, 105 S.Ct. 844, 852, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985), the Court clarified <em>Witherspoon </em>and held that the proper standard was not that enunciated in the <em>Witherspoon </em>footnote, but was that a juror should be excused where his or her views would <em>prevent or substan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number><em>tially impair </em>the performance of the juror\u2019s duties in accordance with the juror oath and the court\u2019s instructions. This standard does not require that a juror\u2019s bias be proved with unmistakable clarity; rather, the trial judge must be accorded the deference to exclude those jurors who appear to be incapable of faithfully and impartially applying the law. <em>Wainwright, </em>469 U.S. at 426, 105 S.Ct. at 853. In applying the new standard, the <em>Wainwright </em>Court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing for cause a juror who stated that her opinions about the death penalty would interfere with her determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. <em>Wainwright, </em>469 U.S. at 430, 105 S.Ct. at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\u201c[A]s long as the selection procedure results in a fair and impartial jury, the method and manner of conducting a voir dire rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Colvin v. State, </em>299 Md. 88, 102, 472 A.2d 953, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873, 105 S.Ct. 226, 83 L.Ed.2d 155 (1984). In <em>Colvin, </em>the Court held that it was no abuse of discretion for the trial judge to deny a request for individualized voir dire in a capital case. <em>Colvin, </em>299 Md. at 103, 472 A.2d 953. <em>See also Tichnell v. State, </em>297 Md. 432, 468 A.2d 1 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 993, 104 S.Ct. 2374, 80 L.Ed.2d 846 <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>467 U.S. 1268, 104 S.Ct. 3564, 82 L.Ed.2d 865 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Rule 4-312(d) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\u201cThe court <em>may </em>permit the parties to conduct an examination of prospective jurors or <em>may </em>itself conduct the examination after considering questions proposed by the parties. If the court conducts the examination, it <em>may permit </em>the parties to supplement the examination by further inquiry or may itself submit to the jurors additional questions proposed by the parties.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">It is thus apparent that the trial judge was not required to allow defense counsel to question individually each juror\u2014nor was the trial judge required to conduct such an individualized examination. Rule 4-312(d) is couched in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>permissive terms. The question thus becomes whether the selection procedure resulted in a fair and impartial jury panel. We hold it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Appellant argues that the excusing of these 14 prospective jurors was without cause. The record indicates that the trial judge intended and did separate that group of prospective jurors to whom the death penalty would pose a problem. As the Court noted in <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>297 Md. 563, 583, 468 A.2d 45 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 993, 104 S.Ct. 2374, 80 L.Ed.2d 846 <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>467 U.S. 1268, 104 S.Ct. 3564, 82 L.Ed.2d 865 (1984), a juror must be able to set aside his opinions and render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">As pointed out in <em>Wainwright, </em>there is no magic litany for determining when a juror\u2019s opinions would affect the juror\u2019s sworn duty. Explicit in the trial judge\u2019s question to prospective jurors was that these jurors would <em>not </em>be able to ignore their predilections and follow court instructions. The only appreciable difference between this case and <em>Wainwright </em>is the fact that here the trial judge\u2019s questions were addressed to the jurors as a group, and not to each juror individually. Appellant contends that individual questioning would have revealed jurors who misunderstood the trial judge\u2019s question, or who might <em>later </em>decide that they could follow his instructions. We find these contentions unpersuasive because in any voir dire, be it individual or group, is the risk of misunderstanding. The trial judge\u2019s question was not inherently confusing. Similarly, a juror, even if individually questioned, might decide later that he or she could do what the juror said previously he or she could not do. At some point, one must take a juror\u2019s answer as a given. As the Court found in <em>Wainwright, </em>unmistakable clarity is not required. We hold that to strike these jurors for cause was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">In regard to the juror who stated that \u201c[i]t\u2019s kind of hard to say,\u201d a serious question existed as to that juror\u2019s impartiality. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in striking this juror for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>VOLUNTARY SURRENDER</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Appellant contends that the trial judge improperly excluded evidence that appellant did not resist extradition to Maryland to face the charges against him. Appellant argues that, because the State had introduced evidence of appellant\u2019s flight after the fatal shooting, he should have been permitted to introduce the evidence that he did not resist under <em>Pierce v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 453, 490 A.2d 261 (1985). We disagree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We stated in <em>Pierce </em>that evidence of a defendant\u2019s flight is relevant because flight may reflect an awareness of guilt. The State may thus introduce such evidence. A defendant, however, can introduce proof of voluntary surrender to rebut this inference. Ordinarily, such evidence is irrelevant because voluntary surrender is considered usual behavior. It is only relevant to rebut the inference created by flight. <em>Pierce, </em>62 Md.App. at 456, 490 A.2d 261. In <em>Pierce, </em>we were presented with a different issue from that in the instant case\u2014whether a trial court was required to instruct the jury that voluntary surrender could indicate innocence. We held that no specific instruction was necessary. <em>Pierce, </em>62 Md.App. at 458, 490 A.2d 261. The trial court in <em>Pierce, </em>however, did admit evidence that the defendant had returned home after her alleged flight in order to make arrangements for her children, but voluntarily surrendered to police the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">What is lacking in the instant case is evidence that appellant voluntarily surrendered. The evidence appellant sought to have admitted was not and could not have been of \u201cvoluntary surrender,\u201d but was rather that appellant did not resist being returned to Maryland. Appellant was apprehended at police gunpoint when spotted in Washington, D.C. By no stretch of the imagination are we able to hold that these circumstances constitute voluntary surrender. Applying the <em>Pierce </em>standard, the inference of awareness of guilt created by a defendant\u2019s flight is not rebutted by submission to later extradition. We therefore hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the trial judge did not err in excluding this evidence as irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">RESTRICTION OF CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"A5N\">\u00b0 Detective San Felice testified for the State at appellant\u2019s trial. During cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel asked these questions of San Felice concerning the circumstances under which appellant gave his statement to police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\u201cQ. All right. Then you closed the door of the Metropolitan Police Department Homicide, and you talked to him twenty minutes while he\u2019s a prisoner of the Metropolitan Police Department; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">\u201cQ. Where are your notes of this discussion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">\u201cA.

And you didn\u2019t bring your notes with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-16\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-17\">\u201cQ.

CHRISTMAS: Credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-22\">\u201cTHE COURT: Not one of the recognized modes of impeachment. Sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-23\">The scope of cross-examination is limited to matters put in issue on direct examination, <em>Plank v. Summers, </em>205 Md. <em>598, </em>607, 109 A.2d 914 (1954), and the credibility of the witness. <em>DeLilly v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 676, 681, 276 A.2d 417 (1971). Additionally, a trial court may exercise its discretion to allow inquiry into additional matters. <em>Cald</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number><em>well v. State, </em>276 Md. 612, 618, 349 A.2d 623 (1976). In cross-examination, it is \u201cproper to allow any question which reasonably tends to explain, contradict or discredit any testimony given by the witness in chief, or which tends to test his accuracy, memory, veracity, character, or credibility.\u201d <em>DeLilly, </em>11 Md.App. at 681, 276 A.2d 417. It has been suggested that perhaps a more lenient standard should be applied where the defense is cross-examining a prosecution witness because cross-examination is the tool by which the constitutional right to confront one\u2019s accuser is given substance. <em>See State v. DeLawder, </em>28 Md.App. 212, 344 A.2d 446 (1975). In <em>Waldron v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 686, 697, 491 A.2d 595, <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 97, 497 A.2d 819 (1985), we held that it could be an abuse of discretion for the trial court to limit cross-examination for a prosecution witness in a manner preventing the defense from demonstrating bias or prejudice on the part of the witness. <em>Waldron, </em>62 Md.App. at 697, 491 A.2d 595. \u201cIt is the essence of a fair trial that reasonable latitude be given the cross-examiner, even though he is unable to state to the court what facts a reasonable cross-examination might develop.\u201d <em>Waldron, </em>62 Md.App. at 696, 491 A.2d 595, quoting <em>Alford v. United States, </em>282 U.S. 687, 692, 51 S.Ct. 218, 219, 75 L.Ed. 624 (1931). We went on to state in <em>Waldron, </em>however, that what the cross-examiner seeks to accomplish must be immediately obvious from the question asked or from an offer of proof. <em>Waldron, </em>62 Md.App. at 698, 491 A.2d 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In the instant case, appellant\u2019s counsel was allowed to ask numerous questions in regard to the detective\u2019s procedures and the substance of notes he made regarding appellant\u2019s statement. The only information requested and excluded by the trial court was whether the detective had realized that appellant\u2019s counsel would ask questions about the notes. Appellant does not maintain that he either requested or subpoenaed the detective\u2019s notes for use at trial. The detective was therefore under no obligation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>bring his notes to trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">It could be argued that the question posed by appellant\u2019s counsel should have been allowed because it would have eroded the jury\u2019s assessment of San Felice\u2019s credibility if the defense could show that the detective had deliberately left his notes behind. We cannot conclude that the trial judge\u2019s exclusion was an abuse of discretion, however., because the record shows that the trial judge allowed an otherwise full inquiry of the detective concerning his notes. We therefore hold that the trial judge\u2019s exclusion of this question did not prohibit appellant\u2019s demonstration of bias or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Appellant points to several ways in which the trial court\u2019s jury instructions were incorrect. We find no merit in these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Appellant argues that the jury instructions were defective because they were propounded in a manner highly favorable to the prosecution. Appellant, however, lodged no objection to the alleged State orientation of the instructions. Thus, the issue is not preserved for our review. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Appellant\u2019s next contention is that the trial judge erred in not clearly instructing the jury that a not guilty verdict was possible on the felony murder charge. We find this assertion is incorrect. The jury was given a verdict sheet and the trial judge instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: ... I\u2019m going to submit to you ... what we call a verdict sheet. It\u2019s just something to assist you all in your deliberations. When you come back, we will ask you essentially what is on the sheet. <em>Which is, how do you find to felony murder? Which will either </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>be guilty or not guilty. </em>Attempted robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon, either guilty, or not guilty, and use of a handgun in the commission of a violent crime, either guilty or not guilty. We await your considered deliberations.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">More important, implicit in the trial judge\u2019s instructions in regard to the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt was the jury\u2019s duty to find appellant not guilty if the State failed to prove its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Appellant\u2019s last contention in regard to the jury instructions is that the trial judge erred in not instructing that in order to convict appellant there must be a direct causal connection between the felony and the victim\u2019s death. The trial court read the applicable statute to the jury. We need only point to the instruction given to show that it contained the required elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">\u201c \u2018In order to convict the defendant of first degree felony murder, the State must prove, one, that the defendant, or another, participating in the crime with the defendant, committed, or attempted to commit,\u2019 in this case a robbery....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">\u201c[H]ere it\u2019s the commission of a simple robbery. If they committed, or attempted the [sic] commit a simple robbery. \u2018Two, that the defendant, or another, participating in the crime, killed the victim.\u2019 In this case [the victim]. <em>\u2018And three, that the act resulting in the death of [the victim] occurred during the commission or attempted commission of the </em>robbery.(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">We hold that the jury was adequately informed that, in order to convict appellant of felony murder, it had to find that appellant (or another) <em>participating in the crime </em>killed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">RULE OF LENITY</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">At his first trial, appellant was convicted of conspiracy to rob and sentenced to 10 years. The jury at the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>trial could not agree as to a felony murder charge and a mistrial as to this charge was declared. <em>See </em>n. 1, <em>supra. </em>At the retrial leading to this appeal, appellant was convicted of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, as well as of felony murder.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellant contends that, under the rule of lenity, only a single conviction for robbery was permissible, and asks us to merge his conviction for conspiracy to rob into the attempted robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The \u201crequired evidence test\u201d is used to determine whether two offenses arising from the same incident are to be treated as one for merger purposes. If <em>each </em>offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, the offenses are not the same and will not merge. If only one offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, however, the offenses are deemed the same and separate sentences for each offense are prohibited. <em>Brooks v. State, </em>284 Md. 416, 419, 397 A.2d 596 (1979). Appellant concedes, as he must, that application of the required evidence test shows conspiracy to rob and attempted armed robbery to be separate offenses. Hence, appellant relies on the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">This rule is based on the concept that in certain circumstances the Legislature may not have intended that two separate sentences be imposed for two offenses growing out of the same transaction, even though application of the required evidence indicates that the two crimes are distinct. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 205, 212, 467 A.2d 544 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 136, 472 A.2d 999 (1984). In <em>Walker v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 171, 201, 452 A.2d 1234 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>296 Md. 63 (1983), we pointed out that application of the rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\u201cis purely a question of reading legislative intent. If the Legislature intended two crimes arising out of a single act to be punished separately, we defer to that legislated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>choice. If the Legislature intended but a single punishment, we defer to that legislated choice. If we are uncertain as to what the Legislature intended, we turn to the so-called \u2018Rule of Lenity,\u2019 by which we give the defendant the benefit of the doubt.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvU\">Thus, where the legislative intention is not clear from the statute itself and reasonable minds might differ as to its intention, the Court will adopt the less harsh meaning. We are unpersuaded that the rule should be applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">In the instant case, the relevant legislative intent is expressed in Md.Code Ann. Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 38 &amp; 488 (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.). Section 38 provides that punishment for a person convicted of conspiracy shall not exceed the punishment of the crime he or she conspired to commit. The gist of the common law crime of conspiracy is the unlawful combination to commit a criminal act\u2014no overt act is required. <em>Quaglione v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 571, 583-84, 292 A.2d 785 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Section 488 provides that a person convicted of an attempt to rob with a dangerous or deadly weapon shall be sentenced to not more than 20 years. Robbery with a deadly weapon is not a new substantive crime but is the offense of common law robbery aggravated by use of a weapon. The proscribed behavior under \u00a7 488 consists of intimidation produced by use of a weapon, coupled with the apparent ability to execute the implied threat if the victim resists. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>231 Md. 591, 594, 191 A.2d 432 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">We thus have two separate criminal acts for which the Legislature has provided distinct punishments. Appellant presents us with no case law or legislative history suggesting that the Legislature did not intend to punish both of these criminal acts, nor can it be seriously argued that an ambiguity exists when the statutes are applied in tandem. It makes sense that, because the two crimes and penalties address different criminal behavior, separate sentences be imposed. In the instant case, appellant received the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>10-year sentence for <em>planning </em>the robbery. The second sentence imposed for the attempt was for the steps appellant took toward <em>consummating </em>that plan. We therefore hold that the rule of lenity will not apply and affirm the two sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-12\">. This was Wooten-Bey\u2019s second trial. The previous trial, arising from the same incident, resulted in Wooten-Bey\u2019s acquittal of premeditated murder and a conviction of conspiracy to commit robbery. The jury at the first trial was deadlocked on the felony murder charge and a mistrial as to this charge resulted. In <em>Wooten-Bey v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 606, 508 A.2d 1010 (1986), we held that Wooten-Bey\u2019s acquittal of premeditated murder did not bar his retrial for felony murder. This decision was affirmed in <em>Wooten-Bey </em>v. <em>State, </em>308 Md. 534, 520 A.2d 1090, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 , 107 S.Ct. 2199, 95 L.Ed.2d 853 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b634-15\">.

This was the trial judge\u2019s later recollection of what he had told defense counsel. \"I told them they could confer, but they couldn\u2019t talk about testimony.\" This statement was not recorded by the court reporter because recording stopped during the bailiffs cry of \"all rise.\u201d The trial judge offered this addition to the record at the January 12, 1988 hearing on defense counsel\u2019s motion for a new trial. Appellant\u2019s counsel stated that he had a different recollection of what was said.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\">. Counsel asked appellant the date of his arrest (October 4, 1983) and whether appellant had been incarcerated since that time, to which appellant responded affirmatively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\"><em>. </em>The Supreme Court recently granted certiorari, 485 U.S. \u2014, 108 S.Ct. 1269, 99 L.Ed.2d 480 (1988), and will hear oral arguments on Tuesday, November 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\">. During the interim between the trial and before the January 12, 1988 hearing on the defense\u2019s motion for a new trial, the prosecutor and defense counsel had a telephone conversation. In this conversation, defense counsel stated that he had asked for a luncheon recess hoping that the trial judge would instruct his client as he had done all the other witnesses. At the January new trial hearing, defense counsel acknowledged that the conversation had taken place. He asserted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>however, that his statements should be placed in context, <em>i.e., </em>that appellant at the time had been facing the death penalty. Additionally, appellant\u2019s attorney stated that he made the statements during one of many informal conversations in which he and the State\u2019s Attorney discussed the \"personalities involved.\u201d Though defense counsel admittedly engineered the deprivation in the instant case, we make no comment on the ethics of his actions as that issue was neither raised nor briefed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\">. It is clear from the record that appellant\u2019s attorney strongly disapproved of appellant\u2019s rejection of the State\u2019s offer to withdraw its request for the death penalty in exchange for appellant\u2019s plea of guilty to the felony murder charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"><em>. </em>In <em>Witherspoon, </em>nearly half of the venire persons were excused for cause because they expressed qualms about capital punishment. <em>Witherspoon, </em>391 U.S. at 513, 88 S.Ct. at 1772.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b654-11\"><em>. </em>Appellant does not contend that his defense was prejudiced by a lack of access to these notes. Detective San Felice was also called during appellant\u2019s defense, at which time the notes were in the possession of appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\">. Appellant\u2019s conviction of attempted robbery formed the predicate felony underlying his felony murder conviction. The trial judge merged the attempted robbery with the felony murder conviction and imposed a life sentence on appellant for felony murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
