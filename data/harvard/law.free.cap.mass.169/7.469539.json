One of the makers of the notes demanded the return of his note by the pledgor before it had been pledged, and refused to pay it to the pledgee. <em>Held, </em>on a bill in equity for contribution, brought by one of the makers of the notes against the pledgor, the pledgee, and the other makers, that, all the notes being pledged as security for the same debt, the whole loss should be borne by all the makers in proportion to the amounts of the notes so pledged; that the demand for the return of his note by one of the makers was immaterial, and that the assignees in insolvency of the pledgor had no interest or duty in the case.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-11\">Bill in equity, filed September 4, 1890, against the PotterLovell Company, the Second National Bank of Boston, and, by amendment, against John Brooks and George S.

The Potter-Lovell Company also held notes of others of the defendants, which it had received from them for sale. Instead of selling the above mentioned notes for the benefit of the several makers, the company at different times wrongfully and fraudulently pledged all of them to the Second National Bank as security for its own debts to said bank, all the notes being pledged for the same debts. The bank, being a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value without notice, collected enough of these notes from time to time as they fell due, including the notes of the plaintiffs and some others, to satisfy its claims against the PotterLovell Company. All of the various parties whose notes were thus fraudulently pledged stood on the same footing, except that the notes were pledged at different times, and fell due and were collected at different times; and except that one of the parties, the North Star Boot and Shoe Company, demanded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>return of its note from the Potter-Lovell Company before the same was pledged, and has never paid the same in whole or in part to the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">These differences do not vary the equitable rights and liabilities of the parties as amongst themselves. The liability to contribute does not depend on a contract between the parties who are held liable to contribute, and is not affected by the fact that notes were pledged and fell due and were paid at different times, or that some of them were paid only in part, or not at all. The notes were all pledged to secure the same indebtedness. The fact that some of them fell due at earlier dates than others creates no equity in favor of those which fell due last. See <em>American Loan &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Northwestern Guaranty Loan Co. </em>166 Mass. 337. The various parties selected a common agent, and this agent used its power to place them all under a common liability, thus virtually making them all sureties for itself. It might be that under such circumstances the pledgee would prefer to hold one and exonerate another, and it would have power to do so in the first instance by proceeding to collect of one, but not of another. But where several different parties have thus been exposed to loss by the fraud of their common agent, it is more equitable that the burden of the loss should be shared <em>pro rata. </em>, Under such circumstances equality is equity, without respect to the time of the maturity of the notes. The demand by the North Star Boot and Shoe Company for the return of its note was also immaterial. It was no more fraudulent to pledge this note after such demand than it would have been to pledge It before a demand. All the notes being pledged as security for the same indebtedness, the whole loss in consequence thereof is to be borne by all the makers in proportion to the amounts of the notes so pledged. <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Central Trust Co. </em>6 Abb.
