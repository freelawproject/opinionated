My experience in 2nd mortgages has taught me that it is necessary to mention that the taxes are to be paid punctual, and also the interest on the first mortgage to be paid when it is due. . . . Don\u2019t forget to mention in the mortgage the right of way over the new property you spoke of\u201d; \u2014 that the defendant further, on May 27, made, signed, and delivered to the plaintiff another writing, containing the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ing: \u201c Do not go on with papers until the man that furnishes the money looks over the property. ... I wrote last night about the driveway you said would go with the mortgage, and some other things that I suggested \u201d; \u2014 that the above writings contained all the undertakings, promises, and agreements of the contract which, on the part of the defendant, were to be done and performed; that, in consideration of the undertakings, promises, and agreements of the defendant, the plaintiff, upon its part, made and entered into certain promises, undertakings, and agreements, which were fully set forth in the original declaration, and in a certain writing it gave the defendant on May 26, a copy of which it was unable to set forth, as such writing was on that day delivered to the defendant, and had never been seen since by the plaintiff, but which was, as the plaintiff believed, in substance as follows: \u201cWe hereby agree to accept loan of $3,000 secured by second mortgage for one year at 10% interest with privilege of reducing loan one half in six months, provided one month\u2019s notice is given of intention of reducing loan \u201d; \u2014 that the plaintiff had fully informed the defendant prior to May 26 of all the above named facts, as to the purchase of the adjoining estate and the way belonging to it, and as to the advantages to be gained by the plaintiff by the securing of the way, and on May 26, when the writings were made, it was fully understood, agreed, and contracted between the plaintiff and the defendant, as a part of their contract, though not put into the writings, that the plaintiff should and would complete the contract for the purchase of the adjoining estate and way, and should use from the $3,000 which the defendant agreed so to loan to him the sum of $500 towards the purchase, and that the plaintiff should include in its second mortgage to the defendant, to secure the loan of $3,000, the right of way to Southbridge Street, which, by the purchase of such adjoining estate and way, would become the property of the plaintiff; that it was further clearly understood and agreed by and between the plaintiff and the defendant on May 26, and as a part of their contract, though not put into the writings, that the plaintiff should use some of the $3,000 to pay off any encumbrances against the plaintiff\u2019s lot and building other than the first mortgage, especially the mechanic\u2019s lien, and that it should use some of the $3,000 to complete the building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>and fit it for use and occupancy, and should use the remainder, if any, of the $3,000 as capital with which to carry on its manufacturing business; and that, relying upon such contract with the defendant, the plaintiff was doing and performing all that it was required on its part to do under the contract, and was ready, willing, and able to fulfil its part thereof when the defendant, on June 3, 1896, notified the plaintiff that he would not fulfil his part of the contract, and absolutely refused to perform the contract and broke the same, to the great damage of the plaintiff; and set out in detail the consequential damages relied on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-3\">The defendant demurred to the declaration, on the ground, among others, that the writings set out did not contain a sufficient description of the land, or the interest therein to be conveyed, to satisfy the requirements of Pub. Sts. c. 78.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-4\">In the Superior Court the demurrer was sustained, and judgment ordered for the defendant; and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b616-5\"><em>M.

Pub. Sts. c. 78, \u00a7 1, cl. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">These writings are three in number, and the first indicates that the defendant agreed to lend the plaintiff three thousand dollars upon a second mortgage above a twelve thousand dollar mortgage referred to in the first writing. Assuming that the twelve thousand dollar mortgage could be identified by parol, and that the fair construction of this writing is that the land to be mortgaged is that covered by the first mortgage, the declaration shows that the mortgage to the defendant was to cover in addition a right of way to be acquired by the plaintiff; and in none of the writings are there any words sufficient to identify this right of way. It appears from the declaration that this was a material element in the contract, and if the writings signed by the defendant do not identify it, either by themselves or by the contents of other writings referred to therein, when taken in connection with the circumstances under which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the writings were made, they are not a sufficient memorandum under the statute. The writings signed by the defendant say, \u201c Don\u2019t forget to mention in the mortgage the right of way over the new property you spoke of,\u201d and \u201c I wrote last night about the driveway you said would go with the mortgage, and some other things that I suggested.\u201d They refer to no writing describing or defining this right of way or driveway. It appears from the declaration that it was not a way then appurtenant to the land covered by the twelve thousand dollar mortgage, and so not made certain or described by the reference to that mortgage. No other writings are referred to in those signed by the defendant. The only reference, therefore, through which a description of the right of way or driveway can be arrived at is to oral statements of some person representing the plaintiff, and who upon, some occasion spoke of the right of way, and said that the driveway would go with the mortgage. There are no allegations im the declaration upon which it could be found that some definite-right of way or driveway was meant, and that only that right of' way or driveway could, under the situation of the parties, have-been referred to. On the other hand, it is evident that the right to be put into the mortgage did not then exist, and that to be put into the mortgage it must be created by grant of some third person, who could be identified only by parol evidence. The reference to oral statements as in themselves a description of the property is of course of no avail, and it cannot be found from the position of the parties and their relation to the property that some specific way only must have been intended. See <em>Ryder </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>161 Mass. 161; <em>Freeland </em>v. <em>Ritz, </em>154 Mass. 257; <em>Sherer </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>135 Mass. 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Nor is the general allegation sufficient that the plaintiff, relying on the contract, was doing and performing all that he was required to do on his part under it. <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Goldthwait, </em>153 Mass. 268, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In placing our decision upon this point we do not consider whether the writings were also insufficient because they did not state the purposes to which, by the agreement set out in the declaration, the money to be lent was to be in part applied. Nor do we intimate that a way belonging to one parcel of land can be made to attach to another distinct parcel by the purchase by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>owner of the latter of the land to which the way belongs; nor that consequential damages, such as those alleged in the declaration, can be recovered for breach of a contract to lend money.</p>\n<p id=\"AlD\">\n<em>Demurrer sustained, and judgment for the defendant affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
