The only entrance to these premises from the street was by a doorway numbered 82 on W. Street. In an action by A. upon the policy, the evidence showed that his rooms were part of a large brick block on W. Street, all of which belonged to one owner, and which, by means of alterations made by him long before the policy was written, had become one building commonly known as \u201c W.

Street were not covered by the policy; and it appeared that the only entrance to the premises from the street was by a doorway numbered 82 on W. Street. A witness was asked whether there was a general custom among insurance agents in that city as to \u201c distinguishing in insurance policies by numbers all lofts and tenements that are up stairs,\u201d and, upon answering in the affirmative, was asked what the custom was, to which he replied, \u201c Generally go by the entrance number, those up stairs.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the question was competent, and, in the absence of any special request as to the answer, its meaning and weight were for the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-7\">Six actions of contract, upon policies of insurance against loss by fire- on property of the plaintiff in Springfield.

It was therefore, under the former decision, a question for the jury whether the goods in the warehouse room were covered, and the ruling requested by the defendants, that, upon the whole evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover more than the amount tendered, which did not include the loss on goods in the warehouse room, was rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The exception to the refusal to rule that Warriner, the agent of one of the defendants, and who acted as a broker in procuring the policies written by the other defendants, was the agent of the plaintiff in obtaining the insurance, is not argued upon the defendants\u2019 brief. The instruction given made him the plaintiff\u2019s agent as to all the companies, except the company of which he was agent, and this exception must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The special request in the case of the Cheshire County Company, that the plaintiff could not recover against it because the terms of that part of its policy called \u201c reference clause \u201d had not been complied with, is not argued upon the defendants\u2019 brief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The bill of exceptions shows that, without referring to the clause named, the company, after receiving the proof of the loss, admitted its liability for the loss upon all the goods except those in the warehouse room, and denied its further liability solely because its policy did not cover the goods in that room. This exception is overruled. See <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Washington Ins. Co. </em>138 Mass. 572; <em>Badenfeld </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Association, </em>154 Mass. 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">The remaining exceptions are to the admission of evidence introduced by the plaintiff to show that his rooms were merely part of a single brick block, and that the warehouse room was officially numbered 82, and that it was known under that number-in plans and rate-books used by the companies in writing risks.. We find no error in the admission of this evidence. Whether-the whole structure was in fact one brick block, and but one-, building, depended in part upon its construction, its ownership;, its appearance, and its use; and it was competent to show all. these circumstances, as well as the fact that it bore one name,, and was commonly designated by that name. That some of the questions may be open to nice criticism as to form, is not a ground for sustaining an exception to the evidence, because the objection was not put upon that technical ground at the trial. If it had been put upon that ground, the questions would, of course, have been so changed as to avoid any sound objection upon that score. The same reason applies to the exception to the question to the owner of the block, as to whether he owned the building which had been spoken of as the Wight Block. Title by deed must ordinarily be proved otherwise than by the oral testimony of the owner. But when the witness was asked, in a case where his title was only incidentally in question, whether he was owner, if the defendants\u2019 objection was founded upon the fact that his deed and not his oral statement was the proper evidence of ownership, the ground of the objection to be now available should have been stated. Besides this, the deed itself was afterwards put in. The city ordinance as to street numbers was competent upon the question whether the true official number of that part of the block in which was the warehouse room was 82. The ordinance tended to show that there was an official numbering by the city authorities. The testimony of the city engineer as to the official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>numbering under' the ordinance with the office maps or plans from which the original numbers and any changes officially made could be ascertained by inference was so far as appears the only evidence obtainable, as it is not shown that any distinct record of numbers was kept, and the ordinance requires no such record, but only that the city engineer should assign the numbers. There being evidence tending to show that the numbers officially assigned had been changed, it was of course competent to show by whom the substitution had been made, and that it had not been done by the city engineer or under his sanction. The city engineer being in charge of the office, and having the custody of the plans which showed the action of his predecessor in assigning numbers, could properly testify as to that action, the plans being produced and explained in connection with his testimony. More can hardly be required as to matters of which no formal record is required or kept.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\">The question as to a custom was competent, and in the absence of any special, request as to the answer, its meaning and weight were for the jury.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">l\u00edo question of the competency of the rate-books and insurance plans is raised.
