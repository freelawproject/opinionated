And all exceptions to any charge to the jury shall, unless previously saved, be alleged before the jury are sent out; and if not so alleged, the same shall not be allowed. All requests for instructions shall be made in wilting.\u201d It appeared that it was understood, from the beginning to the end of the trial, that the defendant wished to have the construction of the statute determined by the full <em>court; </em>that the judge expressed the idea in\" his charge to the jury that his ruling was made with the expectation of having it reviewed by the Supreme Court; that at the moment of the conclusion of the charge, without waiting at all, the judge left the bench and went to the judges\u2019 room quickly; and that when the jury went out the judge was not in the court room. Immediately upon the judge\u2019s return, the grounds of the exception were stated by the counsel for the defendant in a brief memorandum, which the stenographer took and which is embodied in the exceptions written out, and which the judge accepted and received as the form of the exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The following sentences are from the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury: \u201c I am not clear in my own mind about it, and if not clear I suppose it will be made clear by the Supreme Court \u201d ; ^and \u201c I do not know, and I am free to say I do not know, whether that law as thus stated by the Supreme Court applies under this new statute of 1896 or not, but, until otherwise informed by the Supreme Court, I take it we have got to have some standard and some test of safety known, as we have had heretofore.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b536-5\"><em>A. P. Rugg W. S. B. Hopkins, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b536-6\"><em>C. C. Milton, </em>(C. <em>W. Saunders </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b536-7\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHc\">We think a somewhat broader construction should be given to the language of St. 1896, c. 540, than was given to it by the presiding justice. The Legislature obviously thought that too heavy a burden rested upon cities and towns under the previous statutes, and the statute was probably designed to exempt them from liability under such circumstances as were found to exist in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>147 Mass. 440, and <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>160 Mass. 474. Accordingly, it is now provided that \u201c No city or town shall be liable for any injury or damage to person or property hereafter received or suffered in or upon any part of a highway, town way, causeway, or bridge, by reason or in consequence of snow or ice thereon, if the place at which the injury or damage was received or suffered was at the time of the accident otherwise reasonably safe and convenient for travellers.\u201d This must mean, we think, that a way shall not be deemed unsafe by reason of snow or ice thereon, if it would be reasonably safe and convenient for travellers but for the presence of snow or ice thereon. The second request for instructions therefore should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The plaintiff contends that the defendant did not properly save an exception upon the above point. But it appears to have been well understood, on all hands, that the defendant wished to have the construction of the statute determined by this court, in case the ruling of the presiding justice should be adverse to its contention. Under these circumstances, it was quite right to allow the exceptions, even though no statement was made in express terms that an exception was taken. The allowance of the exceptions was merely carrying out the understanding which obviously existed between the court and the counsel on both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>sides; and this might be done, according to the construction which has heretofore been put upon the rule of the Superior Court. <em>Leyland </em>v. <em>Pingree, </em>134 Mass. 367. <em>Thwing </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>136 Mass. 482. <em>Sxeeptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
