McMullen, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We granted this interlocutory appeal to review the trial court's suppression of the results of a mandatory blood draw from the Defendant, Chad E. Henry, conducted pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 55-10-406(d)(5) (Supp. 2014) (also referred to herein as the mandatory blood draw provision for individuals with a prior conviction for driving under the influence) of the implied consent statute. Henry was arrested and a mandatory blood draw was conducted without a warrant after his car struck the rear of another car. Henry was subsequently indicted by the Chester County Circuit Court for one count of driving under the influence (DUI), one count of third offense DUI, one count of violating the financial responsibility law, and one\n   count of aggravated assault. Following his indictment, Henry moved to suppress the results from the mandatory blood draw, asserting that the warrantless blood test violated his constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. After a hearing, the trial court granted the motion to suppress, holding that the blood draw was illegal because the officers failed to advise Henry, pursuant to Code section 55-10-406(c) (Supp. 2014), that his refusal to submit to the test would result in the suspension of his driver's license. The State filed a motion for an interlocutory appeal challenging the suppression of the evidence, which the trial court granted, and this court granted the State's application for a Rule 9 appeal. In this appeal, the State argues (1) Henry's implied consent to blood testing, by virtue of Tennessee's implied consent statute, operates as an exception to the warrant requirement, (2) the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, as outlined in\n   <em>\n    State v. Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12132819\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/504/283/\">\n    504 S.W.3d 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. 2016), applies in this case because the officers acted pursuant to the binding authority of\n   <em>\n    State v. Humphreys\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509427\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/70/752/\">\n    70 S.W.3d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. Crim. App.2001), and the implied consent statute when they required Henry to submit to a warrantless blood test, and (3) motorists with prior DUI convictions, like Henry, have a reduced expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment when arrested for a subsequent DUI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because no exception to the warrant requirement justifies the warrantless blood draw in this case and because the good-faith exception does not apply, we affirm the trial court's suppression of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 18, 2015, Henry was traveling west on Main Street in Henderson, Tennessee, when his car struck the rear of another car. The responding officers, after noting that Henry had signs of impairment, required him to perform several field sobriety tests. The officers also determined that Henry had prior convictions for DUI after dispatch checked his driver's license. Following Henry's unsatisfactory performance on the field sobriety tests, the officers determined that there was probable cause to believe that Henry had been driving under the influence of an intoxicant, and they arrested him. At that point, one of the officers informed Henry that his prior DUI convictions made a blood test mandatory and transported him to a nearby medical clinic for a mandatory blood draw. Later, Henry moved to suppress the results of the blood test, arguing that it violated his rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. The State responded, asserting that the officers informed Henry he was subject to a mandatory blood draw because of his prior DUI convictions, that Henry had consented, by virtue of the implied consent statute, to the mandatory blood draw by exercising the privilege of operating a motor vehicle on the roadways in Tennessee, and that Henry had never withdrawn or revoked his implied consent after being informed of the mandatory blood draw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the suppression hearing, Sergeant Jason Rhodes of the Henderson Police Department testified that on March 18, 2015, he was sent to the scene of a car accident involving injuries on East Main Street. He said that he traveled in a marked patrol car to the accident and that the other two officers at the scene, Officer Kyle Carter and Officer Michael Rhodes, arrived in separate patrol car. Upon arriving at the scene, Sergeant Rhodes determined that Henry was at fault for the car accident that resulted in injuries to Audrey Kerr, the driver of the other car. Although he acknowledged stating in his police report that Kerr had not been injured in the accident, Sergeant Rhodes said Kerr told him at the scene that she had been hurt in the accident but did not wish to be transported in an ambulance to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Sergeant Rhodes asked Henry what happened to cause the accident, Henry said that \"he had blacked out and couldn't recall.\" Sergeant Rhodes then asked Henry if he had consumed any alcohol or drugs, and Henry replied that the only thing he had consumed was a prescription painkiller. After noticing that Henry was unsteady on his feet, was restless, and had slurred speech, Sergeant Rhodes had Henry perform several field sobriety tests. These tests included asking Henry to \"say his alphabet,\" requiring him to complete \"the fingertip to the tip of the nose\" test, and asking Henry \"to count backwards from 68 to 52.\" Sergeant Rhodes said Officer Kyle Carter gave the horizontal gaze nystagmus test to Henry. When Henry performed unsatisfactorily on each of these tests, Sergeant Rhodes arrested him. A short time later, Sergeant Rhodes heard Officer Michael Rhodes\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   inform Henry that he was going to take him to get his blood drawn because it was mandatory. Although Sergeant Rhodes could not remember whether Henry made a statement in response, he stated that Henry was \"calm\" and \"matter of fact\" about the blood draw and was \"okay with it.\" He added, \"[Henry] never said no, yes [to the blood draw], that I can recall.\" Sergeant Rhodes said Henry never told him or Officer Rhodes that he would not give his blood or that they were not going to take his blood. He also said Henry never expressly withdrew or revoked any implied consent to take his blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sergeant Rhodes said it was his opinion that this was a mandatory blood draw situation because: (1) Henry appeared to be under the influence of an intoxicant and had previously been convicted of a DUI, and (2) Henry appeared to be under the influence of an intoxicant and had just been involved in an accident resulting in injuries to another party. Sergeant Rhodes said he determined that the instant offense was a multiple offense DUI after he had dispatch check Henry's driver's license. He recalled that at the time of the accident, Henry had been convicted of at least one DUI in Pennsylvania in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sergeant Rhodes did not tell Henry that he had the right to refuse the blood draw, and he did not hear any other officer tell Henry that he had a right to refuse the blood draw. He also said that neither he nor any other officer advised Henry that his refusal to submit to the test would result in the suspension of his driver's license. Sergeant Rhodes said that his police department regularly used an Implied Consent Form, which is read to the suspect and gives the suspect the opportunity \"to decline or affirm with a blood draw or a breathalyzer test.\" He stated that the\n   Implied Consent Form was not used in Henry's case because of a \"miscommunication.\" Sergeant Rhodes said he believed Officer Rhodes had read and completed the form with Henry while Officer Rhodes believed that Sergeant Rhodes had read and completed the form with Henry, but neither officer actually did so. Sergeant Rhodes also stated that neither he nor the other officers obtained a search warrant to take Henry's blood. When asked when a search warrant is required in this situation, Sergeant Rhodes replied,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Henry would be read the implied consent [form]. If Mr. Henry had consented to the-consented to the blood draw, his blood would have been drawn.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   If he had declined [the blood draw,] I would have drawn an affidavit ... and a warrant for his blood and ... continued to a judge ... to ask for that to be signed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sergeant Rhodes admitted that this procedure was not followed in Henry's case. Nevertheless, he said that if Henry had refused the blood draw, he would have sought a warrant to obtain Henry's blood. Sergeant Rhodes said he understood the law to be that even in the case of a mandatory blood draw pursuant to the statute, Henry had the right to be asked if he was consenting to the blood test. He also said Henry had the right to refuse the blood test, and if he refused it, then the officer was supposed to get a warrant for the blood draw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Michael Rhodes of the Henderson Police Department testified that on March 18, 2015, at around 4:00 p.m., he responded to a call involving a two-car accident with possible injuries in the area of East Main Street. Officer Rhodes arrived at the scene in a marked patrol car, and the other two officers at the scene, Officer Kyle Carter and Sergeant Jason Rhodes, arrived in their own cars. Officer Rhodes stated that he assisted Sergeant Rhodes with the accident, and when he made contact with Henry, he noticed that Henry \"seemed unsteady on his feet\" and \"jittery.\" Officer Rhodes stated that although he was in the vicinity when Sergeant Rhodes was giving Henry the field sobriety tests, he did not closely observe these tests because he was obtaining the information from Henry's car. He acknowledged that Henry was arrested after Sergeant Rhodes gave him the field sobriety tests. Officer Rhodes said that Sergeant Rhodes asked dispatch to check Henry's driver's license, and once they realized that Henry had prior DUI convictions, they discussed the fact that this qualified as a mandatory blood draw under the statute. Officer Rhodes said he and Sergeant Rhodes also believed that Kerr, the driver of the other car, was injured, even though she was not transported to the hospital by ambulance, because Kerr told them at the scene that she had injured her neck or back in the accident. He maintained that he and Sergeant Rhodes never based the mandatory blood draw solely on Henry's prior DUI convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After Henry was arrested, Officer Rhodes informed him that he was going to transport him to a nearby clinic, just a quarter of the mile up the street from the accident, \"for a mandatory blood draw\" because Henry had been convicted of \"prior DUI[']s.\" He said Henry responded, \"Okay,\" and had a calm demeanor. When asked if he believed Henry's \"okay\" response was consent to the blood draw, Officer Rhodes replied, \"I don't know if he was consenting or if he was just letting me know, \"Okay. I understand what you're saying.\" Officer Rhodes admitted that Henry never specifically consented to having his blood tested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Officer Rhodes acknowledged that he never read the Tennessee Implied Consent\n   Form to Henry because he and the other officers did not have one with them at the time. When asked if he normally reads the Implied Consent Form when he arrests an individual for DUI and is going to give a test to determine if the person is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, Officer Rhodes responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   We normally try to read the Implied Consent Form. We [were] very busy that day and I guess we assumed one of-There [were] three of us working the case and I guess we all assumed that the other one was going to do it. I-I can't answer that. I don't know. It was just overlooked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Officer Rhodes stated that Henry never told him that he did not want to give his blood or that the officers were not going to take his blood. He added that Henry \"never tried to refuse\" the blood draw and never expressly withdrew any implied consent to take his blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Officer Rhodes also stated that as he was transporting Henry to the clinic and while they were at the clinic, Henry never expressly told him that he did not want to consent to give his blood. He said that as the nurse was drawing his blood, Henry remained calm and never said he did not want his blood taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Officer Rhodes said he did not tell Henry he had the right to refuse the test and did not hear any other officer advise him of this right of refusal. In addition, Officer Rhodes said he did not inform Henry that his refusal to submit to the blood draw would result in the suspension of his driver's license, and he did not hear any other officer advise Henry of this consequence of refusal. Officer Rhodes agreed that no warrant was ever obtained to draw Henry's blood. He claimed that if Henry had refused the blood draw, he would have sought a warrant to draw his blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the conclusion of the proof, the State argued that the court should deny the motion to suppress on the basis that (1) Henry impliedly consented to the blood draw the moment he operated a vehicle on a Tennessee roadway,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Humphreys\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509427\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/70/752/\">\n    70 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   761 ; (2) Henry never expressly revoked or withdrew this implied consent to give blood,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; (3) the officer did not make a baseless threat when he informed Henry that the blood draw was mandatory, even if the officer had to obtain a warrant if Henry had refused,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Patrick Lee Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , No. M2014-01129-CCA-R3-CD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202453095\">\n    2015 WL 2453095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 22, 2015) ; and (4) it was unnecessary to have the Implied Consent Form read or signed by Henry if he never expressly revoked or withdrew his implied consent because the State was not prosecuting him for a violation of the implied consent law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Shirley Larhonda Gagne\n   </em>\n   , No. E2009-02412-CCA-R3-CD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202135105\">\n    2011 WL 2135105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 31, 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defense counsel responded that the real issue was whether the officers had properly advised Henry, although he also sought to preserve the issue of whether the implied consent statute is an exception to the warrant requirement. He noted that Code sections 55-10-406(d)(5)(A), (B), which govern mandatory blood draws for individuals with prior DUI convictions and for drivers involved in accidents involving injury or death of another, require that \"[t]he test shall be performed in accordance with the procedure set forth in this section [.]\" Moreover, he said that Code section 55-10-406(c) states that an officer, \"shall, prior to conducting either test or tests, advise the driver that refusal to submit to the test or tests will result in the suspension by the court of the driver's operator's license.\" Defense counsel, noting the State had conceded that Henry was told only that the blood test was mandatory,\n   then asserted, \"Our position under this statute is ... that whether or not you use the exact language of the Implied Consent Form, whether or not you have [the motorist] sign an Implied Consent Form, whatever means are used to convey that information to the Defendant, to the driver, you've got to say: 'If you refuse the test, you're going to lose your driver's license' \" because this \"put[s] the driver on notice that [he] can refuse the test.\" While defense counsel admitted that he had not presented any proof that Henry withdrew or revoked his consent, he asserted that the officers in this case had failed to comply with the statute, which rendered the blood draw invalid and required the suppression of the test results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After hearing arguments from the parties, the trial court said it found Sergeant Rhodes and Officer Rhodes to be \"credible witnesses\" who had been \"very candid\" about what occurred in the case. The court then granted the suppression motion, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   If you look at 55-10-406, it does say that a driver of a motor vehicle in this state is deemed to have given consent to test or tests for determining drug and alcohol content.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   But I think you then have to go look at Section ( [55-10-406(c) ] ), which says that prior to conducting either test the law enforcement officer shall advise the driver that he has the right to refuse the test. And that, I think, is critical. And that candidly both officers indicated they didn't tell him that, that they told him that it was a mandatory test.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I think that's a distinction from the [\n   <em>\n    State v. A.D.] Smith\n   </em>\n   [, No. W2015-00133-CCA-R9-CD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209177646\">\n    2015 WL 9177646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 15, 2015)\n   <em>\n    perm. app. denied\n   </em>\n   (Tenn. Nov. 22, 2016),] case. In the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   case the officer testified that he went over the Implied Consent Form with him and that he just had a clerical error in forgetting to get him to sign it and mark in the correct box.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   But at the end of the day it's an invasion of a person under the Fourth Amendment without a warrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   So because of that, I'm going to ... grant the Motion to Suppress the testing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On May 2, 2016, the trial court entered an order suppressing the results of Henry's blood alcohol test, which stated in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1. The Court makes the following findings of fact: [Henry] was arrested by officers of the Henderson, Tennessee Police Department for DUI on March 18, 2015. At the hearing the officers testified that they believed that a mandatory blood draw was required under TCA \u00a7 55-10-406(d)(5)(B). The evidence presented at the hearing established that the officers did not obtain a search warrant for the blood draw. At the hearing the arresting officers admitted that they did not have [Henry] sign the Implied Consent Form that they usually use when administering blood tests to individuals suspected of DUI, nor did they read it to him. The officers admitted that they did not advise [Henry] he could refuse to have his blood drawn or that refusal to submit to the test would result in the suspension by the court of his operator's license. The officers caused [Henry's] blood to be drawn.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   2. The Court finds that TCA \u00a7 55-10-406(d)(5)(B) required the officers to comply with procedures set for[th] in TCA \u00a7 55-10-406(c) and that the officers' failure to advise [Henry] that \"refusal to submit to the test or test [s] will result in the suspension by the court of the driver's operator's license\" as required by the statute, rendered the blood test illegal under the statute. Accordingly,\n   this court grants [Henry's] Motion to Suppress any evidence related to the results of the blood tests performed on the Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   It is therefore, Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that any evidence related to the results of the blood tests performed on [Henry] is hereby suppressed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The State subsequently filed a motion for permission to file an interlocutory appeal from the trial court's order and to stay further proceedings in this case, which the trial court granted. The State then filed a timely application for an interlocutory appeal, which this court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The State argues that the trial court erred in granting the motion to suppress because the officers' failure to advise Henry of the implied consent statute's refusal provision does not affect the constitutional and statutory bases for performing a warrantless blood draw. First, the State contends that because Henry consented to the blood draw, by virtue of the implied consent statute, and never withdrew or revoked his consent, a warrant was unnecessary. Second, the State argues that even if Henry's implied consent did not justify the search, the trial court should not have suppressed the proof from the blood draw because the officers acted in \"objectively reasonable good faith reliance\" on\n   <em>\n    State v. Humphreys\n   </em>\n   and Tennessee's implied consent law. Third, the State contends that motorists with prior DUI convictions, like Henry, have a reduced expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment when arrested for a subsequent DUI, making a warrantless blood draw reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Henry responds that the trial court properly granted his motion to suppress the results of the blood alcohol test. He asserts he was never advised that his refusal to submit to the test or tests would result in the suspension of his driver's license, as required by the implied consent law. Henry also claims that \"consent\" pursuant to the implied consent statute is \"not constitutionally-valid consent to search, but rather consent to certain consequences should permission to search be withheld\" and that interpreting the implied consent statute as authorizing a warrantless blood draw in the absence of voluntary consent violates the state and federal constitutions. Finally, he maintains that the good-faith exception adopted in Reynolds is inapplicable because the law regarding the implied consent law was unsettled at the time of his mandatory blood draw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Initially, we note that a trial court's findings of fact at a suppression hearing are binding on an appellate court unless the evidence preponderates against them.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Significantly, the Court did not mention the possibility of obtaining an individual's voluntary consent to a blood test, which reveals both a preference for a warrant or legitimate exigent circumstances in these situations and a recognition that individuals who drive while impaired are unlikely to have the capacity to voluntarily consent to a blood test. Moreover, when considering whether to affirm or reverse the judgment upholding petitioner Birchfield's criminal conviction for refusing a warrantless blood draw, the Court made it abundantly clear that \"the search [Birchfield] refused\n   <em>\n    cannot be justified as a search incident to this arrest or on the basis of implied consent.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172008\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172008\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/218/\">\n    at 2186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

After noting that the North Dakota Supreme Court held that Beylund's consent was voluntary after it erroneously assumed that \"the State could permissibly compel both blood and breath tests,\" the Court reiterated that \"voluntariness of consent to a search must be 'determined from the totality of all the circumstances' \" and remanded the case \"to reevaluate Beylund's consent given the partial inaccuracy of the officer's advisory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172008\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Given the Court's reasoning in Birchfield, we can confidently conclude that Henry's warrantless blood draw pursuant to the mandatory blood draw section of the statute was not justified based on his legally implied consent. Moreover, because a breath test may now be given every time an individual is arrested for a drunk driving offense, the need for a constitutionally infirm \"implied consent\" justification for warrantless breath tests becomes unnecessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Implied Consent As An Exception to the Warrant Requirement.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The State argues that because Henry impliedly consented to the blood draw pursuant to Tennessee's implied consent statute and never withdrew or revoked it, his consent satisfies the consent exception to the warrant requirement. While the State concedes that Henry was not informed of his ability to refuse the blood test, it asserts that this omission does not affect the admissibility of the results from the blood draw. The State also maintains that because Henry had prior DUI convictions, he relinquished his right to refuse a mandatory blood test unless he withdrew or revoked his implied consent.

He argues that \"[n]o part of this statute should be read as purporting to require, or to independently authorize, a warrantless search.\" As support for the its interpretation of \"implied consent,\" Henry asserts that the \"deemed to have given consent\" language found in most implied consent laws was not meant to provide justification for the test itself but was for the purpose of encouraging a motorist's cooperation with breath or blood testing by providing a penalty for refusal to submit to the test.

This conclusion, naturally, means that\n   <em>\n    Humphreys\n   </em>\n   should be abrogated. In reaching this decision, we recognize that any analysis of whether a motorist withdrew or revoked his implied consent is immaterial because implied consent does not qualify as consent under the United States and Tennessee Constitutions. Instead, the pertinent question is whether Henry voluntarily consented to the blood test in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Therefore, we must next consider whether the totality of the circumstances establishes that Henry voluntarily consented to the warrantless blood test in this case. Although the trial court relied on a procedural reason, namely the officers' failure to comply with Code section 55-10-406(c), in concluding that the blood draw was illegal, we conclude that this issue is better addressed by determining whether Henry voluntarily consented to the warrantless blood draw in this case. As we previously recognized, Henry was informed only that the blood draw was mandatory in light of his prior DUI convictions and was never informed by any officer that refusal to submit to the blood test would result in the suspension of his driver's license. The officers never read an implied consent form to Henry or had Henry read the form and never had Henry sign the form. Even if we assume that the version of the implied consent law in effect at the time of Henry's offense is not unconstitutional, the proof regarding whether a motorist received the implied consent advisory is but one circumstance among many that this court must consider in determining whether the motorist voluntarily consented to a breath or blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   At the time of his arrest, Henry told Sergeant Rhodes that he had \"blacked out\" as he was driving and had recently taken prescription pain medication, which are facts that raise substantial concerns as to whether he had the capacity to voluntarily consent to a blood test at that time.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12132819\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/504/283/\">\n    504 S.W.3d at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Given the lower courts' conclusion that the defendant\n   did not actually consent to the blood draw and the trial court's factual findings based upon medical proof in the record regarding the defendant's physical condition and the adverse [e]ffects the medications had on her judgment and reasoning, the record does not establish that the defendant had the capacity to revoke her statutory implied consent.\").

Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the trial court suppressing the results from the blood draw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The State claims that although the trial court suppressed the results from the blood draw based on the officers' failure to read the Implied Consent Form to Henry, as required by Code section 55-10-406(c), this court expressly rejected such an argument in\n   <em>\n    Shirley Larhonda Gagne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202135105\">\n    2011 WL 2135105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As we previously held, implied consent under the statute is not a per se exception to the warrant requirement for blood or breath tests and does not qualify as voluntary consent under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The State also asserts that\n   <em>\n    Missouri v.

While acknowledging that McNeely dealt with the exigent circumstances exception and failed to apply the consent exception to the warrant requirement, the State claims that the four-justice plurality in\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   correctly noted that \"all 50 states have adopted implied consent laws that require motorists, as a condition of operating a motor vehicle within the State, to consent to [blood alcohol content] testing if they are arrested or otherwise detained on suspicion of a drunk-driving offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1566. Moreover, the plurality stated that implied consent laws were an example of the \"broad range of legal tools\" the states can use \"to enforce their drunk-driving laws and to secure BAC evidence without undertaking warrantless nonconsensual blood draws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the plurality recognized that implied consent laws \"impose significant consequences when a motorist withdraws consent; typically the motorist's driver's license is immediately suspended or revoked, and most States allow the motorist's refusal to take a BAC test to be used as evidence against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the State claims McNeely indicates that implied consent laws survive Fourth Amendment scrutiny, at least as long as the motorist does not withdraw or revoke consent. Again, we have already held that \"consent\" under the implied consent statute is not voluntary consent to search but consent to certain consequences should permission to search be withheld. When interpreted this way, Tennessee's implied consent statute survives Fourth Amendment scrutiny, as indicated in\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   ; however, it also precludes any conclusion that implied consent qualifies as voluntary consent under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, the State asserts that\n   <em>\n    Darryl Alan Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203888250\">\n    2014 WL 3888250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , supports its argument that Tennessee's implied consent statute satisfies the consent exception to the warrant requirement so long as that consent is not revoked or withdrawn. In that case, the officer testified that he had to stay at the scene of the accident for a period of time before traveling to the hospital, and once there, his investigation was further delayed because he had to wait for the defendant to have his wound closed before interviewing him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Based on this evidence, this court held that exigent circumstances made obtaining a warrant impractical under McNeely.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court also held, \"Because there is no proof that the Defendant refused to submit to the test, his implied consent remained valid, and his contention that his consent was involuntary is without merit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. As we previously concluded, any analysis of whether a motorist withdrew or revoked his implied consent is immaterial because implied consent does not qualify as consent under the United States and Tennessee Constitutions. Because the only relevant question is whether the motorist voluntarily consented to a blood or breath test,\n   <em>\n    Darryl Alan Walker\n   </em>\n   has no impact on our decision in this case. For all the reasons articulated in this section, we conclude that statutory implied consent is not an exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Applicability of Good-Faith Exception.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The State also argues that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, as outlined in\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12132819\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/504/283/\">\n    504 S.W.3d 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. 2016), applies to Henry's case because the officers conducted the warrantless blood draw pursuant to the binding authority of\n   <em>\n    State v. Humphreys\n   </em>\n   and the implied consent statute. While the State recognizes that it did not specifically argue a good-faith exception in the trial court, it asserts that it did \"emphasize through its proof the belief and mindset of the officers, thus providing evidence upon which this Court could review the actions of the officers for good faith.\" As support for the application of the good-faith exception, the State asserts that\n   <em>\n    Humphreys\n   </em>\n   continues to be binding authority and that the implied consent statute has never been struck down as unconstitutional. It also claims that the exclusion of test results in this case would not deter police conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   We conclude that the State has waived our consideration of this issue by failing to present it at the trial court level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn.

The record shows that because the State did not present this issue at the suppression hearing, the trial court did not have the opportunity to pass on it, which would generally mean that we would not consider it. However, because this is an issue of great significance, not only to Henry, but to all the citizens of Tennessee, we will address this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The State argues that the proof at the suppression hearing established that the officers acted under a good faith belief that Henry's prior DUI conviction made a blood draw mandatory. It notes that the officers had probable cause to believe that Henry was driving under the influence, based on his signs of impairment and his poor performance on several field sobriety tests, and had probable cause to believe that Henry had previously been convicted of a DUI after dispatch checked his license. Consequently, the State argues it was reasonable for the officers to believe that Code section 55-10-406(d)(5)(B) made the blood draw mandatory for Henry, with or without his consent. As support for his claim that they acted in good faith, the State asserts that both officers testified they believed a search warrant was required upon refusal of the test and that both claimed they would have obtained a warrant had Henry refused the blood draw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In order to address this issue, we must carefully evaluate the good-faith exception adopted by the Tennessee Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, in the interests of fully exploring this issue, we will briefly address it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The State, in suggesting that a reduced expectation of privacy exists, compares motorists with prior DUI convictions to probationers and parolees, who forego a certain expectation of privacy in exchange for the privilege of being placed on probation or parole. The State also claims that motorists, who have a prior conviction for DUI have clearly abused the privilege of driving and, therefore, have a reduced expectation of privacy. In addressing these claims, we note that based on our research, neither the United States Supreme Court nor the Tennessee Supreme Court has ever indicated that individuals with a prior conviction for DUI do not have the same protections against unreasonable searches and seizures as other individuals suspected of driving while impaired. We agree with Henry that a State may not impose a condition on a privilege that would require the relinquishment of a constitutional right:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   It would be a palpable incongruity to strike down an act of state legislation which, by words of express divestment, seeks to strip the citizen of rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution, but to uphold an act by which the same result is accomplished under the guise of a surrender of a right in exchange for a valuable privilege which the state threatens otherwise to withhold. It is not necessary to challenge the proposition that, as a general rule, the state, having power to deny a privilege altogether, may grant it upon such conditions as it sees fit to impose. But the power of the state in that respect is not unlimited, and one of the limitations is that it may not impose conditions which require the relinquishment of constitutional rights. If the state may compel the surrender of one constitutional right as a condition of its favor, it may, in like manner, compel a surrender of all. It is inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the United States may thus be manipulated out of existence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    Frost v.
