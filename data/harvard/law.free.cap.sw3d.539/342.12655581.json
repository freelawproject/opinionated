The issues on appeal are: (1) whether the Plaintiff borrowing parties' alleged causes of action fall within the scope of the arbitration provision contained within the loan documents, and if so, (2) whether Cash Biz waived the right to enforce the arbitration provision because it substantially invoked the judicial process by filing criminal complaints against the borrowing parties. Dependent upon whether the arbitration provision applies, the parties also dispute whether the Plaintiff borrowing parties waived the ability to proceed through a class action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We conclude the Plaintiff borrowing parties' causes of action fall within the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement, and Cash Biz's filing of a criminal complaint was not an act that substantially invoked the judicial process to constitute waiver of this agreement. We conclude the Plaintiff borrowing parties waived the right to bring a class action. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's order denying Cash Biz's motion to compel arbitration and denying Cash Biz's motion to enforce the class action waiver provision. We render an order granting Cash Biz's motion. We remand for arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Cash Biz, LP, Redwood Financial, LLC, and Cash Zone, LLC d/b/a Cash Biz (collectively referred to as \"Cash Biz\") provide short-term consumer loans, also known as \"payday loans.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. FIN. CODE ANN. \u00a7 393.221 (defining a payday loan). As is normal practice with \"payday loans\", Cash Biz required all borrowers to provide a post-dated personal check in the amount of the loan plus the finance charge. As a general practice, if a borrower defaulted, Cash Biz deposited the post-dated check on the loan's due date in satisfaction of the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Also as part of the process of obtaining the loan, borrowers signed written credit service agreements along with disclosure statements, promissory notes, and security agreements (collectively, \"Loan Contracts\"). Each written credit service agreement contained a provision entitled \"Waiver of Jury Trial and Arbitration Provision\" (hereinafter referred to as \"arbitration provision\"). This arbitration provision requires arbitration of any of the following \"disputes\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   the words \"dispute and \"disputes\" are given the broadest possible meaning and include, without limitation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 (a) claims, disputes, or controversies arising from or relating directly or indirectly to the signing of this Arbitration Provision, the validity and scope of this Arbitration Provision and any claim or attempt to set aside this Arbitration Provision;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 (b) all federal or state law claims ... arising from or relating directly or indirectly to this Agreement ..., any past and/or future claims or disputes between you and us and/or any Lender who provides you with a loan as a result of our services; ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 (d) all common law claims, based upon contract, tort, fraud, or other intentional torts;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 (e) all claims based upon a violation of any state or federal constitution, statute, or regulation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 (f) all claims asserted by us against you, including claims for money damages to collect any sum we claim you owe us; ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 (g) all claims asserted by you individually against us ... including claims for money damages and/or equitable or injunctive relief; ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 (i) all claims asserted by you as a private attorney general, as a representative and member of a class ... against us ...; and/or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 (j) all claims arising from or relating directly or indirectly to the disclosure by us ... of any non-public personal information about you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition, relevant to this appeal, the arbitration provision states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   You acknowledge and agree that by entering into this Arbitration Provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE ALLEGED AGAINST US, THE LENDER AND/OR OUR/ITS RELATED THIRD PARTIES; ... and\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE ... OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST US....\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, the arbitration provision contains a waiver of class action in arbitration provision, which states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   all disputes ...\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be resolved by binding arbitration\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on an individual\n   basis with you.\n   <strong>\n    THEREFORE, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT CONDUCT CLASS ARBITRATION\n   </strong>\n   .... Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, the validity, effect, enforceability of this waiver of class action lawsuit and class-wide arbitration shall be determined solely by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by the arbitrator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Hiawatha Henry, Addie Harris, Montray Norris, and Roosevelt Coleman, Jr. (the Borrowing Parties) obtained loans from Cash Biz and subsequently defaulted on their repayment obligations. Cash Biz attempted to deposit the post-dated checks written upon execution of the loan documents; however, the checks were declined based upon insufficient funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Cash Biz contacted the applicable local district attorneys and submitted information necessary to make a criminal complaint, stating these borrowers \"engaged in criminal conduct during the formation and performance of the loan transactions, including the issuance of bad checks and check fraud.\" The district attorneys then filed criminal charges against each of the Borrowing Parties for violation of Texas Penal Code Section 32.41, which prohibits issuance of \"bad checks\".\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 32.41 (West Supp. 2015) (offense requires issuer's knowledge of insufficient funds at the time of issuance; knowledge may be presumed\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     except for postdated check\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The criminal charges against each of the Borrowing Parties were eventually dismissed; however, several of the Borrowing Parties were arrested and detained. In addition, other Cash Biz borrowers within the purported class faced criminal convictions for theft by check and were assessed jail time, restitution, and fines as punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On January 30, 2015, the Borrowing Parties filed a class action petition on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated in Texas,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging Cash Biz: (1) illegally and wrongfully used the criminal justice system to collect payday loans through the wrongful filing of criminal charges; (2) illegally and wrongfully threatened its customers with criminal prosecution for failure to repay payday loans in violation of the Texas Finance Code, Texas Penal Code, and Texas Constitution; and (3) illegally and wrongfully classified post-dated checks as bad checks and pursued criminal charges against its customers in violation of the Finance Code and Penal Code. The Borrowing Parties alleged Cash Biz engaged in the described conduct knowing it was in violation of the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Based upon these allegations, the Borrowing Parties pled specific causes of action\n   of malicious prosecution, fraud, violation of the DTPA, and violation of Finance Code Section 393.301. Cash Biz filed a motion to compel arbitration under the Loan Contracts and to enforce the class action waiver provision within the arbitration provision. Cash Biz requested that the trial court compel individual arbitration with each Plaintiff and stay the action pending completion of the individual arbitrations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing on the motion, the trial court denied Cash Biz's motion to compel and enforce the arbitration and class action waiver provisions and signed a written order finding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (1) the plaintiffs' claims \"relate solely to Cash Biz's illegal use of the criminal justice system to enforce a civil debt\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (2) the challenged conduct occurred after the expiration of any contracts entered into by the Borrowing Parties; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (3) all of the damages are \"solely related to criminal fines, jail time, and loss of reputation related to plaintiffs' criminal convictions.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based on these findings, the trial court concluded the arbitration provision and class action waiver within the Loan Contracts are \"not applicable\" to the type of action brought by the Borrowing Parties. In addition, the trial court concluded Cash Biz waived its right to arbitration by substantially invoking the judicial process when it \"filed criminal charges against Plaintiffs, participated in criminal trials, obtained criminal judgments, and attempted to collect from Plaintiffs.\" Cash Biz perfected this interlocutory appeal pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Sections 51.016 and 171.098.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Burden of Proof to Compel Arbitration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A party seeking to compel arbitration bears the burden to establish (1) the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate; and (2) the claims in dispute fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    In re Rubiola\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7320466\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/334/220/#p223\">\n    334 S.W.3d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223 (Tex. 2011) ;\n   <em>\n    J.M.

For this reason, the facts alleged in support of the asserted causes of action have a significant relationship to and are factually intertwined with the underlying Loan Contracts.

The borrowing Parties do not present argument that Cash Biz engaged in any conduct beyond the filing of criminal complaints. The evidence that pertains to this limited issue is not disputed, that is, Cash Biz provided information and filed criminal complaints against the Borrowing Parties. Therefore, this court's determination of waiver need only focus on this undisputed evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Cash Biz's filing of a criminal complaint does not rise to the extent of active engagement in litigation that Texas courts have consistently held to be specific and deliberate actions inconsistent with a right to arbitrate or that display an intent to resolve a dispute through litigation.

Further, under these facts, Cash Biz was not a party to the criminal prosecutions and did not serve as a witness or provide any interviews to facilitate prosecution. Cash Biz's actions, though presumably vindictive, do not evince a desire to achieve repayment of any loans through the criminal process. Thus, Cash Biz's actions were not sufficiently active or deliberate to constitute substantial invocation of the judicial process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    G.T.

Finally, Cash Biz's actions, even if wrong, were insufficient to rise to the level of \"substantial invocation\" of a litigation process. In Texas, the filing of criminal charges and initiation of criminal process is the discretion of the prosecuting attorney. Even if this court were to construe Cash Biz's preliminary act as an initiation of litigation to \"achieve a satisfactory result,\" the filing of suit or initiation of litigation is not \"substantial invocation of judicial process\".\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    G.T.

Consequently, the Borrowing Parties failed to satisfy their burden of proof to establish Cash Biz waived its right to arbitration as a matter of law.

Martinez, Justice, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   While I agree that the Borrowing Parties' claims against Cash Biz in the underlying\n   suit are factually intertwined with the Loan Contracts, and thus fall within the broad scope of the Loan Contracts' arbitration agreement, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that Cash Biz did not \"substantially invoke the judicial process\" and thus did not waive its right to enforce the arbitration agreement. In my view, the Borrowing Parties met their burden to prove that Cash Biz waived its right to enforce arbitration by showing that Cash Biz filed criminal \"bad check\" complaints against the Borrowing Parties in an effort to collect restitution on the debts created by the Loan Contracts, thereby substantially invoking the judicial process to obtain a satisfactory result and causing the Borrowing Parties actual prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perry Homes v.

I therefore dissent to the portion of the majority opinion holding that the Borrowing Parties failed to prove that Cash Biz waived its right to enforce the arbitration agreement by substantially invoking the judicial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As the majority notes, the relevant issue presented on appeal is whether Cash Biz's action in filing criminal bad check complaints against the Borrowing Parties was sufficient to constitute substantial invocation of the judicial process, waiving its contractual right to arbitrate the Borrowing Parties' malicious prosecution and other claims against it. The majority concedes that the evidence is undisputed that Cash Biz \"provided information and filed criminal complaints against the Borrowing Parties,\" and that \"absent Cash Biz's complaint, no criminal prosecution would have occurred.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority holds that such evidence is insufficient, however, because it does not show that Cash Biz engaged in \"deliberate conduct inconsistent with the right to arbitrate, that is, an active attempt to achieve a satisfactory result through means other than arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at p. 352. The majority reasons that Cash Biz's filing of a criminal complaint does not rise to the level of \"active engagement in litigation\" through \"specific and deliberate actions\" that are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate, or that reveal an intent to resolve the dispute through litigation rather than arbitration, because: (1) the criminal complaints were filed before the Borrowing Parties filed suit; (2) Cash Biz was not a party to, and did not participate as a witness in, the separate criminal prosecution; and (3) Cash Biz's actions do not show its desire to obtain repayment of the loans through the criminal process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at p. 353-54. The majority stresses that, even assuming Cash Biz's action in filing the complaints \"initiated\" the criminal prosecution, the mere filing of suit or initiation of litigation does not, by itself, constitute substantial invocation of the judicial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   I disagree with the majority's analysis for several reasons. First, the traditional waiver requirement that the judicial process have been substantially invoked\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the filing of the underlying lawsuit is based on the usual situation where there is only one legal proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Perry Homes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8178370\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/258/580/#p584\">\n    258 S.W.3d at 585, 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, we are presented with the unique situation of\n   a civil lawsuit and a criminal proceeding, both of which arise out of the same civil debt. Second, while the formal parties in a criminal proceeding are the defendant and the State of Texas,\n   <em>\n    In re Amos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093336\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/397/309/#p314\">\n    397 S.W.3d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 314 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2013, orig. proceeding), the victim or complainant has a personal interest in the prosecution and thus plays a unique role in criminal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Ligon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092044\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/408/888/#p896\">\n    408 S.W.3d 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 896 (Tex. App.-Beaumont 2013, orig. proceeding).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Third, I disagree with the majority that Cash Biz's actions in \"merely\" filing the criminal complaints do not show its desire to obtain repayment of the loans, or otherwise obtain a satisfactory result, through the criminal process. As Flanagan's supplemental affidavit indicates, Cash Biz has staunchly maintained that it acted with no self-interest, but \"simply left the information [of potential criminal conduct] to the discretion of the district attorney, and any action taken by the district attorney thereafter was made completely on his/her own.\" To the contrary, the evidence in this case shows a pattern of specific, deliberate, and affirmative conduct by Cash Biz in filing sworn complaints (accompanied by documentation) with the district attorneys' offices as an immediate and direct reaction to its borrowers' defaults on their payday loans. The 13-page list of criminal cases in the Justice of the Peace Courts for Harris County, Texas, where the bad check cases against the Borrowing Parties were filed, shows that Cash Biz was the complainant in more than 400 bad check cases filed during the relevant time period from May 2011 through July 2012. The appellees represent that Cash Biz repeated this conduct in other Texas counties as well. Given the sheer number and geographic scope of the complaints, it is disingenuous to assert, as Cash Biz does, that it was simply acting as a concerned citizen who was aware of potentially criminal conduct, without any desire for restitution from any of its borrowers. Moreover, at the hearing, counsel for Cash Biz ultimately conceded that Cash Biz would provide the \"bad check\" information to the prosecutors, and the prosecutors' office would send out letters \"to collect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In addition, in its appellate brief and at oral argument, Cash Biz conceded that it was \"mistaken\" in believing that it was a crime for its borrowers to give it a post-dated check as security for the loan (as it required).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 32.41 (West Supp. 2015) (defining the offense of issuance of a bad check). Indeed, the criminal charges against the four named Borrowing Parties were ultimately dismissed. This does not change the fact that they suffered prejudice as a result of the charges, arrests, and defense costs, as well as the mental, emotional, and reputational damages. Other defaulting borrowers against whom Cash Biz filed complaints suffered convictions and punishment, including restitution. Ultimately, Cash Biz invoked the collection authority of the district attorney's office with the expectation to obtain restitution, i.e., repayment of the loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   While it may be technically correct that the district attorney made the ultimate decision whether to file bad check charges based on the information contained in Cash Biz's sworn complaints, it is also true that no criminal prosecution would ever have been initiated without Cash Biz alerting the district attorney's office and supplying the information stated in, and attached to, its complaints.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. v.

By submitting the sworn complaints, Cash Biz not only procured the prosecution, it became a \"witness\" in the criminal prosecution, i.e., a person who presented personal knowledge of the borrowers' purported criminal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

Whether Cash Biz was attempting to obtain repayment of the loans through restitution as its conduct suggests, or to obtain some other form of punishment against its defaulting borrowers, it deliberately and repeatedly invoked the criminal justice system in an attempt to achieve some form of satisfactory result based on the civil debt. In doing so, Cash Biz ignored its own right and obligation under the arbitration agreement contained in the Loan Contracts to seek collection of the debts through arbitration rather than judicially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   While the instant facts involving Cash Biz's actions in a separate criminal proceeding do not fit within the traditional waiver analysis applied to a single civil lawsuit, the parties have presented us with some cases that are instructive on the application of waiver law to similar fact scenarios. Only one Texas case discusses the interplay between civil and criminal litigation in a waiver-of-arbitration context. In\n   <em>\n    In re Christus Spohn Health Sys.

Cash Biz invoked the criminal judicial process to litigate a \"specific claim [it] subsequently wants to arbitrate,\" to wit: the specific issue of non-payment from which all of the Borrowing Parties' causes of action derive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   I believe the record here shows that Cash Biz substantially invoked the judicial process by deliberately engaging in a series of overt acts in court that evidence a desire to resolve the same arbitrable dispute through litigation rather than arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tuscan Builders, LP v. 1437 SH6 L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6918577\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/438/717/#p721\">\n    438 S.W.3d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 721 (Tex.

Therefore, I would hold that, by filing the criminal \"bad check\" complaints against the Borrowing Parties, seeking repayment or some other form of satisfaction, Cash Biz waived its contractual right to arbitrate the malicious prosecution claims arising out of the criminal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As to the class-action prohibition, it is not an independent agreement, but is included within the arbitration agreement in the Loan Contracts. Therefore its applicability depends on the applicability of the arbitration agreement. I would therefore hold that the class-action prohibition was similarly waived by Cash Biz's invocation of the judicial process.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Because the majority opinion does not reach the second-prong issue of prejudice, I also omit that analysis; however, I believe the Borrowing Parties proved that they suffered actual prejudice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The majority agrees that the list of criminal cases in the Harris County Justice of the Peace Court showing Cash Biz as \"complainant\" in all the cases against the Borrowing Parties, as well as multiple other borrowers, \"impliedly reveals\" that no criminal prosecution would have been initiated without Cash Biz's complaints.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    The elements of a malicious prosecution claim are: (1) the commencement of a criminal prosecution against the plaintiff; (2) causation (initiation or procurement) of the action by the defendant; (3) termination of the prosecution in the plaintiff's favor; (4) the plaintiff's innocence; (5) the absence of probable cause for the proceedings; (6) malice in filing the charge; and (7) damage to the plaintiff.\n    <em>\n     Richey v.
