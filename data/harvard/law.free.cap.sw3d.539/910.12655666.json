(Appellant) appeals from the trial court's summary judgments in favor of S.W. and W.M. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant and S.W. were married on August 17, 1991. In 2000, S.W. gave birth to twins of which Appellant is the biological father. In 2001, S.W. gave birth to a second set of twins of which Appellant is not the biological father. Appellant only discovered he was not the father of the second set of twins approximately ten years after their birth, after a series of events beginning with W.M. leaving a letter in Appellant's mailbox confessing to a lengthy affair with S.W. and his suspicions the second set of twins were his. Appellant confronted S.W., who admitted to the affair. At this point, no one knew for certain who the biological father of the twins was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In early 2011, after receipt of W.M.'s letter, Appellant ordered a paternity test on the second set of twins, which determined he was not their biological father. A test determined W.M. was their biological father. Appellant and S.W. filed a petition for adoption of the twins, in which W.M. intervened and consented. On July 12, 2011, the judgment of adoption of the twins by Appellant and S.W. was entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 14, 2012, S.W., as petitioner, filed a petition for dissolution of marriage against Appellant, as respondent, in St. Charles County Circuit Court. Appellant filed a six-count petition for damages in the pending dissolution proceeding, Count I alleging fraud against S.W.; Count II alleging conspiracy to commit fraud against S.W. and W.M., jointly and severally; Count III alleging negligence against S.W.; Count IV alleging unjust enrichment/constructive trust against the Law Offices of [S.W.], LLC; Count V alleging deceptive practices/violation of Missouri Merchandising Practices Act (MMPA) against the Law Offices of [S.W.], LLC; and Count VI alleging violation of Alienation of Affections Act against W.M.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   St. Charles County Circuit Court Judge Terry Cundiff stated he would not entertain any claims based on marital misconduct, so Appellant withdrew his petition and filed it in St. Louis County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant's six-count petition for damages against S.W., Law Offices of [S.W.], and W.M. filed in St. Louis County Circuit Court, 13SL-CC03151, alleged fraud; conspiracy; negligence; unjust enrichment/constructive trust; and deceptive practices/violation of MMPA, as in his original withdrawn petition; but in Count VI alleged a claim for restitution of necessities against W.M. instead of alienation of\n   affections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The bifurcated dissolution proceeding in St. Charles County Circuit Court took place on January 3, 2014, and December 10, 2014. Appellant dismissed his case No. 13SL-CC03151 in St. Louis County petition voluntarily without prejudice on February 24, 2015; said dismissal was signed \"So Ordered\" by the Honorable Colleen Dolan. On February 5, 2016, Appellant filed the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   No. 16SL-CC00394 in St. Louis County Circuit Court. This five-count petition for damages alleges fraud in Count I against S.W.; conspiracy to commit fraud in Count II against S.W. and W.M., jointly and severally; negligence in Count III against S.W.; restitution of necessities in Count IV against W.M.; and spoliation of evidence against S.W. and W.M. in Count V. S.W. and W.M. filed separate answers to the respective claims asserted by Appellant against each of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   W.M. filed a motion for summary judgment on the claims against him, accompanied by a 19-paragraph statement of uncontroverted facts and one exhibit, the deposition of Appellant. Appellant responded to W.M.'s statement of uncontroverted facts and filed a memorandum in opposition, 10 exhibits, and a statement of additional uncontroverted facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   S.W. filed a motion for summary judgment on the claims against her, along with four exhibits, her statement of uncontroverted facts, and a memorandum in support. Appellant filed a memo in opposition to S.W.'s motion, alleging the claims within were affirmative defenses she had not asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court heard and granted W.M.'s motion for summary judgment without specifying grounds therefor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With leave of court, S.W. filed an amended answer to include the affirmative defenses outlined in Appellant's response and an amended 20-paragraph statement of uncontroverted facts along with eight exhibits in support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court granted S.W.'s motion for summary judgment without specifying grounds therefor. This appeal follows. Further facts will be offered as necessary to the resolution of the points on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Points on Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In his first point, Appellant contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his claims of conspiracy to commit fraud and restitution of necessities against W.M. for insufficient evidence because W.M. did not respond to Appellant's additional statement of uncontroverted material facts, thus admitting them and thereby establishing the missing factual basis for Appellant's claims. Appellant also suggests the doctrine of spoliation of evidence further precludes summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In his second point, Appellant asserts the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his claims against S.W. as barred for being brought and voluntarily dismissed twice without stipulation or judicial approval under Rules 67.01 and 67.02 because Appellant obtained leave of court for the second dismissal. Appellant further argues his tort claims against S.W. are not barred by merger into the dissolution action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal, an appellate court reviews summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    ITT Commer cial Fin.

With regard to conspiracy to commit fraud, Appellant alleges W.M. and S.W. reached a mutual agreement to conceal the paternity of the twins; concealed the paternity of the children from 2002 until 2010; agreed to conceal the paternity to injure Appellant and avoid liability; and as a result Appellant was damaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The elements that must be established under a claim of conspiracy are: 1) two or more persons; 2) with an unlawful objective; 3) after a meeting of the minds; 4) committed at least one act in furtherance of the conspiracy; and 5) plaintiff was thereby damaged.\n   <em>\n    Misischia v.

App. E.D. 2001). Appellant alleges concealment of paternity as the fraud in which W.M. conspired. However, W.M. never made any false representations to Appellant about the twins' parentage nor did he know of their parentage until the paternity testing was done. Appellant cannot sustain a claim against W.M. for conspiracy to commit fraud against him by concealing the twins' parentage from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Appellant alleges that from the time of the twins' birth until the date he\n   adopted them, he provided their necessities in the amount of $100,000 per child; W.M. as the twins' biological father was obligated to provide these necessities, but did not; and Appellant was damaged in said amount.

Here, Appellant furnished the twins' necessities gratuitously as supported by his sworn testimony in the record that he would have adopted the minor children at the time of their birth even if he had known he was not the biological father. In his deposition, Appellant stated as follows when being questioned by W.M.'s counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q. When they were born in 2001, even had you known that [W.M.] was the biological father, you would have adopted them and made them your own even at that point even though maybe you might not have stayed married to your wife?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A.

Spoliation is a doctrine of evidence whereby Appellant must show W.M. intentionally or fraudulently destroyed or discarded evidence. The doctrine of spoliation is a harsh rule of evidence.\n   <em>\n    Schneider v. G.

Appellant contends merely that \"a lot of evidence has been destroyed ... W.M. ... was an equal destroyer of evidence.\" Appellant fails to state what evidence he asserts was destroyed by W.M. and what this evidence would prove. The party seeking to invoke the doctrine bears the burden of making a prima facie showing of the spoliator's fraudulent intent.\n   <em>\n    Pisoni v.

Appellant only offers up mere speculation that evidence was destroyed. Such speculation does not constitute evidence with a sufficient foundation to substantiate any of Appellant's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Based on the foregoing, W.M. is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the merits of Appellant's claims against him. Summary judgment in his favor was proper. Point I is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Summary Judgment on Claims Against S.W.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The claims asserted against S.W. are fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, negligence, and spoliation of evidence. In her motion for summary judgment, S.W. argues Appellant's claims against her are barred by Rule 67.02 because he filed then dismissed them voluntarily and without prejudice twice, the second time without order of the court, and thus this third time (the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   ) is barred. S.W. also argues Appellant's claims against her are barred by\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   because he should have brought them in their dissolution proceeding or other prior proceeding but did not. We disagree with both of S.W.'s bases for summary judgment, for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Rule 67.02 provides for a voluntary dismissal, \"Voluntary Dismissal-Effect of\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (a) Except as provided in Rule 52, a civil action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of the court anytime:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (1) Prior to the swearing of the jury panel for the voir dire examination, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (2) In cases tried without a jury, prior to the introduction of evidence at the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A party who once so dismisses a civil action and thereafter files another civil action upon the same claim shall be allowed to dismiss the same without prejudice only:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (1) Upon filing a stipulation to that effect signed by the opposing party, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) On order of the court made on motion in which the ground for dismissal shall be set forth.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   S.W. claims Appellant first asserted his claims against her as \"Count II of his Amended Counter-Petition for Dissolution of Marriage in late 2012\" and then filed a voluntary dismissal of them. However, the documents she refers to in support of these allegations are Appellant's \"Petition for Damages\" filed by Appellant on August 16, 2013; and withdrawn by his memorandum titled \"Respondent's Memorandum Withdrawing the Proposed Petition for Damages which was Filed on August 26, 2013\" and stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   COMES NOW, Respondent, by and through counsel, and hereby withdraws the proposed Petition for Damages which was filed on August 16, 2013. Respondent's Motion to Transfer Venue is moot as a result of withdrawing the petition for damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In his response to her motion for summary judgment, Appellant supplies the affidavit of his attorney which states, in pertinent part, \"The Honorable Terry Cundiff was the judge assigned to the dissolution case. Judge Cundiff indicated that he was not going to consider marital misconduct in the dissolution action in the division of property, so it was irrelevant which claims went first, the dissolution action or the tort claims.\" He goes on to state, \"On September 11, 2013, I withdrew the proposed Petition for Damages because the Petition had been filed in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County on September 10, 2013, in case number 13SL-CC03151.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The documentation S.W. cites does not lend support to her allegations in her summary judgment motion.

Appellant supported this allegation and statement of fact via his attorney's affidavit, which was uncontradicted by S.W. Because Judge Cundiff did not want to hear the claims in Appellant's petition, Appellant withdrew the proposed petition from the court's consideration on September 11, 2013. As documentary support for his response to S.W.'s allegations, Appellant supplied the Petition for Damages; the memorandum of withdrawal; and his attorney's affidavit based on personal knowledge of wherein and why he submitted and withdrew the Petition for Damages. S.W. did not attach or reference a voluntary dismissal as supporting documentation for her allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Appellant gave a sworn statement he did not serve the proposed Petition for Damages on the other parties as a pleading and S.W. provided no evidence to dispute that fact. Appellant also maintains there was no voluntary dismissal of the proposed Petition for Damages, and S.W. provided no contradictory evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   After withdrawing his petition in St. Charles County, Appellant filed his six-count Petition for Damages in St. Louis County Circuit Court on September 10, 2013, case No. 13SL-CC03151. The claims remained pending in St. Louis County Circuit Court through the duration of the St. Charles Circuit Court bifurcated dissolution of marriage proceedings, surviving a motion by S.W. for a judgment on the pleadings, which was denied by Judge Colleen Dolan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   After the dissolution proceedings concluded and finalized in St. Charles County, Appellant moved to voluntarily dismiss his claims without prejudice in case No. 13SL-CC03151 in St. Louis County. Appellant's dismissal memorandum in this action specifically stated the dismissal was \"without prejudice\" and was approved and ordered by St. Louis County Circuit Judge Dolan. Appellant set this forth as an undisputed fact and cited to it and made it part of the summary judgment record.

Here, Judge Dolan's judgment on its face provided the dismissal was without prejudice.

Appellant's claims against S.W. are not barred by\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   due to successive dismissals because the second one specified on its face it was without prejudice by order of the court.
