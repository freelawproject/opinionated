The Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the convictions and remanded for a new trial, holding that the trial court erred in denying Harbison's request for a separate trial, that his multiple convictions for employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony violated the prohibition against double jeopardy, and that the evidence was insufficient to support one of the counts of attempted voluntary manslaughter and employment of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony. We granted the State's application for permission to appeal to determine whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion by\n   denying Harbison's motion for severance; whether Harbison waived the double jeopardy issue; and if not, whether Harbison's convictions for employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony violate the prohibition against double jeopardy where he used one firearm but was convicted of multiple dangerous felonies against different victims. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Harbison's request for a separate trial; Harbison did not waive the double jeopardy issue; and his multiple convictions for employment of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony do not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals, reinstate Harbison's three convictions for attempted voluntary manslaughter and three convictions for employment of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony, and remand to the trial court for resentencing and corrected judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A Knox County grand jury indicted LaJuan Harbison on four counts of attempted first-degree murder and four counts of employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony. These charges arose out of a shooting on September 7, 2012, near Austin-East High School in Knoxville. In the same indictment, the grand jury charged Arterious North with four counts of attempted first-degree murder and four counts of employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony; and Laquinton Brown and Carlos Campbell with three counts of attempted first-degree murder, three counts of employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony, two counts of attempted especially aggravated robbery, and two counts of attempted aggravated robbery. Before trial, the State dismissed one count of attempted first-degree murder and one count of employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony against Brown and Campbell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Harbison and his co-defendants were tried by a jury on January 27, 28, 30, 31, and February 1, 2014. The State's proof showed that on September 7, 2012, around 4:30 p.m., Campbell was driving a vehicle on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue near Austin-East High School with Brown in the front passenger's seat and M.W.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and another person in the back seat. Around this same time, Harbison was driving a vehicle in the opposite direction on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue toward Austin-East High School with North in the front passenger's seat and Montiere King and \"Little Paul\" in the back seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At this same time, a group of students, including L.P. and Q.T., was standing on a sidewalk near Austin-East High School. As Campbell drove by, L.P. saw four people including M.W. in the vehicle. Q.T. signaled to the vehicle because he thought he saw his brother in the back seat. After driving past the students a couple of times, Campbell stopped the vehicle, and Brown got out of the front passenger's seat and approached L.P. and Q.T. to speak with them. Brown, with the handle of a gun sticking out of his waistband, asked L.P. and Q.T. which one of them had thrown up a gang sign. Q.T. responded that \"[w]e don't bang.\" Brown directed them to empty their pockets. As Q.T. pulled out his pockets, L.P. saw an approaching vehicle (Harbison's vehicle) stop and its occupants start shooting. At that point, Brown pulled out his gun and fired it. Q.T. said he heard shots coming from somewhere behind Brown and saw Brown pull out his gun, start shooting, and run away. L.P. and\n   Q.T. tried to flee, but a bullet, consistent with one fired from a gun used by a passenger in Harbison's vehicle, struck and seriously wounded L.P. In a subsequent police lineup and at trial, L.P. identified Brown as the man who got out of Campbell's vehicle and fired a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Malika Guthrie, a teacher at Austin-East High School and Vine Middle School, was driving her vehicle behind Campbell. She saw Campbell's vehicle stop, for no apparent reason, in the middle of Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue. A passenger, later identified as Brown, jumped out and approached L.P. and Q.T. in an aggressive, confrontational manner. Guthrie saw L.P. and Q.T. pulling their pockets out and holding up their hands indicating they had nothing. She believed Brown was robbing L.P. and Q.T. As Brown turned back to the Campbell vehicle, Guthrie heard shots being fired. Guthrie's daughter, a passenger in her mother's vehicle, also saw Brown confronting L.P. and Q.T. and observed another vehicle approach. She heard gunshots, saw the occupants of Campbell's vehicle shoot back, and then observed both vehicles drive away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The driver of a Knoxville Area Transit bus behind the Guthrie vehicle saw Brown get out of the Campbell vehicle and direct L.P. and Q.T. to empty their pockets. Like Guthrie, she thought Brown was robbing them. After they pulled out their pockets, she saw Brown turn back to the vehicle, get a gun, and start firing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   S.W. was with her cousin, L.P., and Q.T. on the sidewalk just before the shooting. She saw the Campbell vehicle, with M.W. in the back seat, drive by a few times with loud music playing. On the vehicle's second pass, she saw the occupants of the vehicle, including Brown, hanging out of the window making gang signs, and L.P. and Q.T. responding with hand signs. The third time the vehicle came by, it stopped, and Brown got out and \"tried to rob\" L.P. and Q.T. She saw Brown step back, pull a gun, and start shooting. She also saw a backseat passenger in Campbell's car get out and start shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following the shooting, Knoxville City Police Department officers interviewed Harbison, North, Brown, and Campbell. Harbison initially denied any involvement in the September 7 shooting but later in the interview admitted he drove his vehicle and shot a gun during the episode. Harbison told police he got rid of the gun after the shooting. North admitted he was the front seat passenger in Harbison's vehicle and shot a .357 caliber gun. According to North, Harbison used a \"little nine,\" one of the backseat passengers (King or \"Little Paul\") had a Glock handgun, and the other one had a Hi-Point handgun. Campbell admitted he drove the other vehicle and that Brown was in the front passenger's seat and M.W. in the back seat. Campbell claimed that after stopping his vehicle near a group of students, another vehicle pulled up beside him, and shots were fired from that vehicle. Brown said that after L.P. and Q.T. made gang signs at them, Campbell stopped so Brown could get out and talk to L.P. and Q.T. After the Harbison vehicle arrived on the scene and its occupants began firing, Brown hit the ground. He denied having a gun or firing a gun during the September 7 shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on evidence found at the crime scene and in Harbison's and Campbell's vehicles, a Knoxville Police Department firearms examiner determined that multiple guns were fired from both vehicles. Police investigators observed that both vehicles had numerous exterior defects consistent with bullet holes, but it was not known how many of the bullet holes predated the September 7 shooting. At the crime scene on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, police found bullet fragments and\n   two .38 caliber shell casings and a .45 caliber shell casing. In Campbell's vehicle, investigators found a bullet fragment under the right front passenger's floor mat, a fired bullet core in the right rear passenger's door, a bullet jacket from a .38, .357, or 9-millimeter firearm under the driver's front mat, and a fired .45 caliber bullet in the left rear passenger's seat. The fired .45 caliber bullet found in the left rear passenger's seat was similar to the .45 caliber bullet removed from L.P. at the hospital. These bullets were consistent with a bullet fired from a Hi-Point semi-automatic revolver, which North told police was used by one of the backseat passengers in Harbison's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A search of Harbison's vehicle revealed wallets in the glove compartment belonging to Harbison and King. Investigators also found a fired bullet in the driver's floorboard and a 9-millimeter shell casing on the floorboard behind the front passenger's seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the State rested, the trial court granted Campbell's and Brown's motions for acquittal on two counts of attempted especially aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated robbery and reduced the remaining two robbery counts to two counts of aggravated assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Harbison and Brown each testified in his own defense. Harbison, eighteen years old at the time of the offense, previously attended Austin-East High School. He knew Q.T. from when Harbison taught drums to Vine Middle School students. Harbison knew L.P. through his sister who had gone to Austin-East High School with Harbison. On the day of the shooting, Harbison was carrying a 9-millimeter handgun because he feared Campbell and Brown, whom he suspected of being involved in an incident at Harbison's mother's house. Just before the shooting started, Harbison stopped his vehicle near Austin-East High School after seeing an approaching school bus in the opposite lane extend its stop sign. Harbison then saw Brown get out of Campbell's vehicle and approach L.P. and Q.T. Harbison recognized Brown and Campbell and was surprised to see them in that part of Knoxville. When Harbison saw L.P. and Q.T. hold up their hands, Harbison believed Brown was robbing them. As Brown stepped back towards Campbell's vehicle, Harbison saw Brown draw a handgun and fire a shot. Harbison pulled his gun and fired it twice into the air. Harbison claimed he fired his gun only to protect L.P. and Q.T. and to prevent Brown from robbing them. He said he did not intend to harm anyone. After Harbison fired into the air, he heard \"shots coming up out of-from everywhere.\" Harbison, North, King and \"Little Paul\" began firing their weapons. As Harbison drove away, he continued to hear gunfire coming from behind him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to Brown, on the afternoon of September 7, he was riding in the front seat of Campbell's vehicle. As the vehicle passed a group of students standing near Austin-East High School, Brown saw Q.T. signal to him. Campbell stopped the vehicle so that Brown could get out and talk to L.P. and Q.T. After a brief conversation, Brown realized that he did not know them\n   and went into \"safety mode.\" He directed Q.T. and L.P. to empty their pockets to see if they were armed. As Brown was backing away toward Campbell's vehicle, Brown heard a gunshot. He fell to the ground and heard more shots, although he could not determine their source. Campbell's vehicle left, and Brown ran away. Brown denied attempting to rob L.P. and Q.T. or having a gun that day. Brown also denied that he had ever previously possessed a weapon. Brown had no recollection of a video of him and his cousin, Cuben Lagrone, riding around while brandishing weapons. To refresh his recollection, the State played Brown the video, but Brown claimed he did not recognize the voices or the faces. On rebuttal, a Knoxville Police Department officer explained that he had obtained Lagrone's cell phone while investigating an August 2012 shooting at Harbison's mother's house. The cell phone contained multiple videos of Lagrone and Brown, including the one shown to Brown. The officer identified Lagrone and Brown in the video, which showed the men driving around Knoxville at night and listening to music. Lagrone was holding a Smith and Wesson handgun, while Brown brandished a firearm with an extended magazine. One man can be heard saying, \"[expletive deleted] the police.\" After passing multiple police cars, one man says, \"there go the boys. Get ready.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The jury found Harbison guilty of four counts of the attempted voluntary manslaughter of L.P., Brown, Campbell, and M.W. and four counts of employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony. The jury convicted North of four counts of the attempted voluntary manslaughter of L.P., Brown, Campbell, and M.W. and four counts of employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony; convicted Brown of two counts of the attempted voluntary manslaughter of Harbison and North, two counts of employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony, and two counts of aggravated assault of L.P. and Q.T.; and convicted Campbell of two counts of aggravated assault of L.P. and Q.T. and acquitted him of remaining charges. The trial court sentenced Harbison to an effective sentence of twenty-two years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Harbison's amended motions for new trial challenged the denial of his motion for severance; the sufficiency of the evidence, which included a challenge to the multiple convictions for employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony; and the excessiveness of his sentence. The trial court denied Harbison's motions for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Harbison appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court of Criminal Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial, finding that the trial court erred in denying the motion for severance; that the convictions for employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony violated the prohibition against double jeopardy; that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for the attempted voluntary manslaughter of L.P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   and the accompanying firearm conviction; and that the trial court did not err in determining Harbison's sentence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Harbison contends that the Court of Criminal Appeals properly concluded that the trial court erred in denying his motion for severance and that he was clearly prejudiced by the ruling. In particular, Harbison asserts that the evidence established \"overt hostility\" among the co-defendants, hostility from courtroom spectators, mutually antagonistic defenses among the co-defendants, and Harbison's limited control over his defense. Similarly, Harbison claims the jury heard \"lurid testimony and videos about guns, unindicted bad actors, and other crimes\" unrelated and irrelevant to the charges against him. Next, Harbison contends that the trial court's decision at the close of the State's proof to dismiss two of the robbery charges and reduce the two remaining robbery charges against Brown and Campbell to two charges of aggravated assault undercut Harbison's defense that he acted to protect Q.T. and L.P. from Brown. Finally, Harbison submits that the evidence regarding multiple offenses and multiple co-defendants impaired the jury's ability to make an individualized determination about each co-defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Joint trials of defendants charged in the same indictment are favored because they promote efficiency and reduce the possibility of inconsistent verdicts.\n   <em>\n    Zafiro v.

One co-defendant was also charged with making false declarations to a grand jury. The joint trial for Sampol and two other defendants lasted over a month. The jury found each defendant guilty of the charged offenses.

In reaching this decision, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. The offenses in the indictment against Harbison, North, Brown, and Campbell all arose at the same time and place. The charged offenses were \"closely connected in time, place, and occasion,\" and \"it would [have been] difficult to separate proof of one charge from proof of the others.\" Tenn. R. Crim. P. 8(c)(3)(B). The trial court carefully considered Harbison's requests for severance before the trial, on the morning of the first day of trial, and at the hearing on the motion for new trial. The trial court based its decision on the correct legal standard, and its decision was reasonable under the circumstances. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Harbison's motion for severance based on the number of defendants charged, the number of counts considered by the jury, the non-complex nature of the indictment, the length of the trial, the non-disparate evidence at trial against the defendants, the similar degrees of involvement by the defendants, and because Harbison was not hampered in presenting his defense at the joint trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To support his argument that he was clearly prejudiced by the trial court's abuse of discretion, Harbison offers only conclusory statements about hostility from courtroom spectators, hostility among the co-defendants, mutually antagonistic defenses, and admission of evidence about acts unrelated to Harbison. We will review each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, Harbison contends that the trial court should have granted a severance because of the overt hostility between him and two of his co-defendants and courtroom spectators, the mutually antagonistic defenses, and his inability to present his defense. Hostility between defendants, attempt to cast blame on each other, finger-pointing, and tattling do not necessarily require a severance.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Mutually antagonistic defenses among co-defendants may be the basis for granting a severance in some circumstances but are not per se prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    Zafiro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925396\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/534/#p537\">\n    506 U.S. at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925396\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/534/#p537\">\n    113 S.Ct. 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Here, Harbison's defense was not necessarily mutually antagonistic with the defenses of his co-defendants, and he was not\n   hindered in presenting his defense. Harbison maintained he never meant to harm anyone and fired his gun into the air only to prevent Brown from robbing L.P. and Q.T. Although Brown denied attempting to rob L.P. and Q.T., he admitted that he got out of Campbell's vehicle, approached L.P. and Q.T., and had them empty their pockets. Other witnesses who saw the incident also thought Brown was trying to rob them. The evidence established that Harbison and North exchanged gunfire with Brown and the occupants of Campbell's vehicle, but neither Brown nor Campbell offered any proof that Harbison fired any shots at them or intended to kill anyone. Although Brown denied that he fired a gun, numerous witnesses testified otherwise. Harbison claimed he was carrying a 9-millimeter handgun for protection on the day of the incident because he feared Brown and Campbell based on Harbison's suspicion that they had been involved in shooting into his mother's house. Harbison, however, failed to show that any antagonism or fear of Brown and Campbell necessitated a separate trial. Finally, the record contains no evidence that the jury was exposed to any courtroom hostility among the co-defendants or courtroom spectators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, Harbison argues that the trial court's denial of a severance resulted in the admission of \"lurid testimony and videos about guns, unindicted bad actors, and other crimes unrelated to Harbison and irrelevant to his charges.\" A severance should not be granted simply because there is a \"[d]isparity in the evidence against the defendants,\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Howell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11162387\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/34/484/#p491\">\n    34 S.W.3d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 491 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000), or a \"speculative risk of a spill-over effect\" from a co-defendant's prior bad acts.\n   <em>\n    Meeks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10003523\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/867/361/#p369\">\n    867 S.W.2d at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Harbison cites to testimony from Knoxville Police Department officers regarding the investigation into Lagrone's role in a drive-by shooting of Harbison's mother's house; police interviews of Brown, Campbell, North, and Harbison; and the video introduced to impeach Brown's testimony that he had never possessed a weapon. This evidence, however, does not incriminate Harbison and potentially places only Brown in a negative light. Although the Court of Criminal Appeals indicated that the evidence adduced during the joint trial caused the jury to treat the case as a \"gang shooting\" in which the participants were equally guilty, this is speculative; indeed, the trial court recognized this concern and limited the evidence of gang involvement to a few brief references. Also, the verdicts reveal that the jury's careful assessment of the evidence against each defendant resulted in Harbison's convictions on reduced charges of attempted voluntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Third, Harbison argues that the trial court's acquittal of Brown and Campbell at the close of the State's proof of two robbery counts and that the trial court \"relayed this to the jury prior to Harbison testifying\" impeached and undercut his ability to present his defense. The record does not support Harbison's argument. The trial court, outside the presence of the jury, granted Brown's and Campbell's motions for acquittal on two of the robbery charges and reduced the two remaining robbery charges to aggravated assault. This decision was not \"relayed\" to the jury before Harbison took the stand. In any event, Harbison effectively presented his defense that he fired his gun because he believed Brown was robbing L.P. and Q.T. The State's proof confirmed that other witnesses also thought Brown was robbing them. Harbison's defense was partially successful; the jury found Harbison guilty of the lesser included charges of attempted voluntary manslaughter, presumably finding that he acted in a state of passion\n   produced by adequate provocation by the hostility of Campbell and Brown and Harbison's belief that Brown was robbing L.P. and Q.T.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Next, Harbison argues that a severance was necessary to avoid prejudice from evidence that would not have been admitted had Harbison's trial been severed from his co-defendants. A trial court need not grant a severance when the evidence introduced at the joint trial would have been admissible against the defendant in a separate trial.\n   <em>\n    State v. Dellinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9406733\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/79/458/#p468\">\n    79 S.W.3d 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468 (Tenn. 2002) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 1987). Harbison does not point to any specific evidence that would have been inadmissible in a separate trial but instead references \"lurid testimony and videos about guns,\" \"unindicted bad actors,\" and \"other crimes unrelated to Harbison.\" Harbison appears to be primarily referring to the cell phone video that showed Brown and Legrone riding in a vehicle holding guns. This video, admitted into evidence solely to impeach Brown's testimony that he had never possessed a weapon, did not clearly prejudice Harbison. The jury may have concluded from the video that Brown's testimony was not credible, but this would not have hindered Harbison's defense. The trial court properly instructed the jury that \"[a]ny evidence which was limited to a particular defendant should not be considered by you as to any other defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, Harbison argues that the evidence pertaining to multiple offenses and multiple co-defendants impaired the jury's ability to make an individual determination about each co-defendant. However, the trial court instructed the jury on its consideration of multiple defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   You should give separate consideration to each defendant. Each is entitled to have his case decided on the evidence and the law which is applicable to that particular defendant. Any evidence which was limited to a particular defendant should not be considered by you as to any other defendant. You can acquit all or convict all, or you can acquit one or more and convict the others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The trial court also instructed the jury on self-defense, defense of a third person, and criminal responsibility. We presume that the jury follows all instructions given by the trial court, \"with commonsense understanding of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the trial [that is] likely to prevail over technical hairsplitting.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Harbison's second amended motion asserted that \"[i]t was error to allow the conviction of four counts of the use of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony. [ Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7] 39-17-1324. Only one conviction should have been allowed. There was only one weapon being used during the incident [.]\" At the hearing on the motion for new trial, Harbison argued that the State overcharged the offenses in the indictment and that it was error to allow four convictions for employment of a single firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony. Harbison contended there should only be one conviction under Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-17-1324 based on his use of one weapon during one brief incident. The State responded that four firearm convictions were appropriate because Harbison used a firearm to commit four dangerous felonies involving four victims. The trial court overruled Harbison's motion, concluding that four firearm convictions were appropriate based on his conviction of four dangerous felonies with four distinct victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Although Harbison should have more clearly stated his assertion of error in the motion for new trial, we interpret the second amended motion for new trial and the\n   argument on the motion for new trial to mean that Harbison was claiming that he was overcharged and convicted of multiple violations of Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-17-1324 based on a single act of employing one firearm. Although not well-stated, the disputed issue was whether the proper unit of prosecution was the act of employing the firearm or the act of committing the underlying dangerous felony. Harbison focused on his use of a single weapon, while the State emphasized the multiple underlying dangerous felonies. Whether Harbison waived the issue of double jeopardy is a close question given his failure to use the phrase \"double jeopardy\" or \"unit of prosecution\" in the trial court. Although Harbison's constitutional argument was not a model of precision or clarity, we conclude that his amended motion for new trial was sufficient to direct the trial court's and the State's attention to his challenge to multiple convictions for employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony when he fired a single weapon. Harbison's motions for new trial allowed the trial court to consider the issue and make an appropriate ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fahey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11088795\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/46/138/#p142\">\n    46 S.W.3d at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    McCormic\n   </em>\n   , 659 S.W.2d at 806 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Harbison argued in the Court of Criminal Appeals that the trial court erred by not granting a new trial \"where there was insufficient evidence to support conviction on more than one count of possessing a firearm during a dangerous felony, and where the Defendant possessed only one firearm during the shooting event.\" He further argued that the proper unit of prosecution was the number of firearms employed in the commission of a dangerous felony, and there was no proof he used more than one firearm during the single shooting event involving several individuals.
