The court of appeals conflated Labor Code \"issues\" with appellate \"issues\" and consequently defined the word too narrowly. On that point, we reverse and remand to the court of appeals for further proceedings.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In her cross-petition, Edna Martinez asserts that the factual findings a hearing officer relied on in coming to a decision actually establish the decision's opposite. She also argues that error preservation requires a plaintiff to appeal adverse findings from an ultimately favorable administrative ruling. The court of appeals disagreed with her on both. So do we. On these points, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   employed Edna Martinez as a caseworker. On Saturday, June 9, 2001, Martinez was working from home at her kitchen table in preparation for the next week's hearings when she got up, slipped in her kitchen, and fell. She broke her shoulder and hit her head in the fall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Martinez submitted a workers' compensation claim to the State Office of Risk Management (SORM), the claim administrator for state-agency employees. SORM denied her claim on the grounds that she was not injured in the course and scope of her employment, was not engaged in the furtherance of her employer's business at the time of the injury, and did not establish a causal connection between her injuries and her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Martinez requested a benefit review conference, a mediation process by which an employee may dispute coverage denials. The Texas Workers' Compensation Commission conducted the conference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the conference, SORM argued that Martinez's injuries were not compensable because Martinez did not obtain permission to work at home-a violation of a DFPS policy \"requiring advance approval for overtime.\" Martinez responded that caseworkers like her often worked from home without prior approval. The benefit review officer's report listed two \"disputed issue[s]\" that remained unresolved when the conference concluded: \"Did [Martinez] sustain a compensable injury on June 9, 2001?\" and \"Did [Martinez] sustain disability as the result of the June 9, 2001, claimed injury, and if so, for what period(s)?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties proceeded to a contested case hearing. SORM reasserted its argument\n   that Martinez violated agency policy by working from home without prior approval. This argument did not persuade the hearing officer, who ruled that Martinez was \"furthering the business and affairs\" of her employer when the fall occurred. But the officer also found that Martinez's injury \"did not involve any instrumentality of the [e]mployer.\" As a result, the officer concluded, Martinez's injury \"did not arise out of nor [occur] in the course and scope of her employment\" and thus Martinez \"did not sustain a compensable injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Martinez then appealed to the Texas Workers' Compensation Commission's Appeals Panel. The panel reversed the hearing officer's decision and rendered a decision that Martinez \"sustained a compensable injury.\" Citing\n   <em>\n    Garcia v. Texas Indemnity Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8716652\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tex/146/413/\">\n    146 Tex. 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8716652,10194030\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/209/333/\">\n    209 S.W.2d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1948), the panel stated that \"[Martinez's] injuries arose out of her employment because the employment had a causal connection with her injuries.\" The appeals panel also noted that evidence existed to support the hearing officer's finding that Martinez \"had authority to work from home\"-the DFPS's alleged overtime policy notwithstanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   SORM appealed to the district court, arguing that the panel's decision was \"contrary to the law and facts.\" Both parties moved for summary judgment. In its motion, SORM did not reassert the ground it had argued throughout the administrative phase-that Martinez violated agency policy by working from home and that therefore her injury was not compensable. Instead, as a new ground for precluding compensability, SORM argued that Martinez violated a statute by working from home. The trial court denied Martinez's motions for summary judgment and granted SORM's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Martinez appealed the trial court's ruling that she did not suffer a compensable injury. The court of appeals held that SORM moved for summary judgment in the trial court on a ground never presented in the administrative review process-that Martinez violated a statute by working from home. --- S.W.3d ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20548115\">\n    2016 WL 548115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

CODE \u00a7 410.302(b). Because SORM never presented the statutory-violation ground to the appeals panel, the court of appeals reasoned that the panel necessarily could not have \"decided\" that \"issue.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20548115\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Since SORM's motion for summary judgment asserted only the statutory-violation ground, the court of appeals held that the Labor Code barred the trial court from exercising jurisdiction over SORM's motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   --- S.W.3d at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20548115\">\n    2016 WL 548115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Martinez had moved on the ground that SORM waived judicial review of the compensability of her injuries by failing to bring before the appeals panel all of the factual findings that the hearing officer made during the contested case hearing. The court of appeals noted that \"using the hearing officer's findings to argue the hearing officer determined that Martinez sustained a compensable injury is contrary to the hearing officer's finding that [her injury] 'did not arise out of nor [occur] in the course and scope of her employment' and its conclusion that Martinez 'did not sustain a compensable injury.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20548115\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court of appeals reversed the grant of\n   summary judgment for SORM, affirmed the denial of Martinez's motion for summary judgment, and remanded to the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20548115\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20548115\">\n    2016 WL 548115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   SORM and Martinez both filed petitions for review in this Court.

Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   SORM argues that within the Labor Code, \"issue\" means a disputed matter specifically defined at the initial benefit review conference and upon which the hearing officer makes a determination. Here, those \"issues\" were \"whether Martinez sustained a compensable injury[ ] and whether she had a disability as a result of the claimed injury.\" Thus, in SORM's view, both the policy ground it asserted in the administrative phase and the statutory ground it asserted in its motion for summary judgment are \"arguments\" relating to the \"issue\" of compensability. In particular, SORM contends these arguments preclude compensability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To support its definition, SORM directs our attention to the Labor Code's structure, case law, and Justice Pulliam's dissent in the court of appeals in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   --- S.W.3d at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20548115\">\n    2016 WL 548115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pulliam, J., dissenting) (\"I would hold that 'issue,' as used in Section 410.301 and .302, refers to the disputed matters enumerated therein, that is, compensability, income, or death benefits.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tex.

App.-Austin 2003, pet. denied) (\"Throughout the workers' compensation act, 'issue' is never used to refer to legal arguments or doctrines; rather, 'issue' is used to refer to disputed matters related to the underlying workers' compensation claim.\"). SORM argues the\n   court of appeals erred by construing Labor Code \"issues\" the same way that courts construe legal \"issues\" in appellate practice (i.e., as points of error).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Martinez argues that \"issue\" means \"the specific grounds for denial or recovery raised in the administrative [process].\" In this case, SORM raised the policy as a ground for denial during the administrative process, but it never raised the statutory ground. Thus, on Martinez's definition, whether the statute applied and whether Martinez violated it are separate issues-neither of which SORM could have raised in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To support her argument, Martinez points to subchapter G and section 410.301, both of which bear the title \"Judicial Review of\n   <em>\n    Issues Regarding Compensability\n   </em>\n   or Income or Death Benefits.\" TEX. LAB. CODE \u00a7 410.301 (emphasis added). She argues the Labor Code's use of \"regarding\" implies that the \"issues\" are the arguments for or against compensability, not compensability itself. Moreover, Martinez argues that a broad definition of \"issue\" would frustrate the legislative intent that a party exhaust its administrative remedies.

At the hearing, Martinez's representative stated Martinez \"intend[ed] to show today by her testimony that ... she was injured in the course and scope of her employment\" because Martinez's injury occurred during an activity \"that has to do and originates with work.\" SORM argued that it was \"not aware\" that Martinez was working from home and that she did not have \"prior approval\" to do so.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    \u2022 The hearing officer found that Martinez's injuries did not \"arise out of her employment\" because neither a \"hazard ... inherent in the employment\" nor an \"instrumentality of the [e]mployer\" was present.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    \u2022 The appeals panel decided Martinez was in the course and scope of her employment because she was \"furthering the business affairs of her employer.\" And her injuries \"arose out of her employment because the employment had a causal connection with\" her fall.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    In this case, the \"disputed issue\" and the issue \"decided by the appeals panel and on which judicial review is sought\" are the same-whether Martinez was in the course and scope of her employment at the time of her accident.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7\u00a7 410.021, 410.302(b).

For clarity, we use the same terms that the court of appeals did.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Martinez argues that the contested-case hearing's findings conclusively established both elements. Before determining whether the findings were conclusive, we must explore what they established. She relies on two findings of fact from the hearing officer's report: that she was \"furthering the business and affairs of\" her employer and that she was in \"the course of her work\" when she fell. The first finding explicitly refers to \"furtherance,\" which is the traditional way in which courts state the requirement's second element.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Seabright\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6859247\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/465/637/#p642\">\n     465 S.W.3d at 642\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Similarly, the second finding mentions \"course.\" We agree with the court of appeals that both findings relate to the \"course and scope\" (i.e., \"furtherance\") element of the compensability test.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    --- S.W.3d at ----,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20548115\">\n     2016 WL 548115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Our conclusion finds support in the finding of fact that immediately follows those on which Martinez relies. Namely, the hearing officer also concluded that Martinez's injury \"did not involve any instrumentality\" of her employer. Injuries that involve an employer's instrumentality are more likely to arise out of employment than to arise by chance. Thus, it appears this finding relates to the \"arises out of\" element. The hearing officer's next finding\n    offers further support. It states that Martinez's injury \"did not arise out of nor [occur] in the course and scope of her employment.\" The officer's use of \"nor\" demonstrates that the report contemplated the distinction between the two elements. And the finding itself explicitly states the opposite of what Martinez urges that the report establishes. The report's conclusion of law undercuts Martinez's argument even further: Martinez \"did not sustain a compensable injury.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    We agree with the court of appeals that Martinez is not free to pick and choose among the hearing officer's findings of fact.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20548115\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    This is especially true when the conclusion she asks us to draw is contrary to some of the report's findings of fact, to its main conclusion of law, and to the very decision that the hearing officer used the findings to support. Since Martinez's argument-at most-established only the \"course and scope\" element, SORM certainly remained free to argue that the \"arises out of\" element precluded compensability. Thus, the court of appeals properly affirmed the trial court's denial of Martinez's motion for summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20548115\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    <strong>\n     B.

TEX. LAB. CODE \u00a7 410.168(a). To appeal the officer's decision to the appeals panel, the appealing party must rebut \"the decision of the [hearing officer] on each issue on which review is sought.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8401589\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/229/775/#p778\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 410.202(c). The appeals panel's decision may include a discussion of \"errors at the contested case hearing\" including \"findings of fact for which insufficient evidence exists\" and \"findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding matters that were not properly before the [hearing officer].\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8401589\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/229/775/#p778\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 410.204(a-1)(3)(a), (c). Then, on judicial review, the Labor Code limits the de novo trial to \"issues decided by the appeals panel.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8401589\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/229/775/#p778\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 410.302(b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The Labor Code makes clear that a hearing officer's incorrect findings of fact are \"errors\" but not \"issues.\" While issues require individual appeal, errors do not.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8401589\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/229/775/#p778\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 410.202(c). Accordingly, a party need not appeal every finding related to an issue in order to preserve the issue for judicial review. Because the trial court conducts review under the modified de novo standard, there is no requirement that it defer to the hearing officer's factual findings. Thus, a party's failure to challenge a factual finding does not preclude a trial court from reviewing the issue that the finding purportedly supports.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Consequently, even if the hearing officer's report did establish that Martinez was in the \"course and scope of employment\" when she fell, the officer's ultimate conclusions that Martinez \"did not sustain a compensable injury\" and \"did not have [a] disability\" are the only issues either party could have appealed. The officer resolved these issues in SORM's favor. As a result, on judicial review, SORM remained free to present arguments relating to both elements of compensability (i.e., that an injury must \"arise\" out of the \"course and scope\" of employment).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8401589\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/229/775/#p778\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 401.011(10).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    <strong>\n     IV\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The line between issues and arguments may not always be easy to articulate, but the parties' actions usually point to where it lies. Edna Martinez injured herself while working from home. The foremost issue is whether her home is a location that can give rise to a workers' compensation claim. We remand to the court of appeals to consider all of SORM's arguments on this issue. By contrast, we agree with the court of appeals that the hearing officer's report establishes a line between the findings of origination and furtherance. And even if that were not so, the Labor Code requires parties to appeal \"issues,\" not findings-especially not findings that purportedly \"support\" an outcome contrary to the decision that the hearing officer renders. We affirm the court of appeals' decision upholding the trial court's denial of Martinez's motion for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Justice Boyd did not participate in the decision.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"8\">\n    <p id=\"p-84\">\n     There are two ways to parse the phrase \"arises out of and in the course and scope of employment.\" Both versions comprise the same two elements.
