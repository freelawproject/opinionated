TWC alleges error in the use of three verdict directing instructions and in the admission of expert testimony. JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building cross-appeal alleging error in the reduction of their judgments by the amount of earlier settlements payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Finding no reversible error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   TWC is a video services provider authorized to install fiber optic cable in public rights-of-way by the Missouri Public Service Commission (\"PSC\"). In early 2013, TWC undertook to install underground fiber optic cable to service the Plaza Vista project at 900 W. 48th Place on the west side of the Country Club Plaza (the \"Polsinelli Offices\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   JJ's Restaurant operated a restaurant (\"JJ's\") in a building owned by JJ's Building. JJ's was located on the north side of 48th Street, across the street from the Polsinelli Offices. TWC's fiber optic cable was to be installed running south under an alley on the east side of JJ's and then under 48th Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   TWC entered into an agreement with Heartland Midwest, LLC (\"Heartland\") to install the underground fiber optic cable. TWC was aware that Heartland intended to use a trenchless technology known as horizontal directional drilling (\"HDD\") to install the fiber optic cable. HDD technology utilizes a drill to bore a hole underground through which utilities can be pulled, without excavating the surface.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Heartland notified Missouri One Call\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of its intent to install the underground cable. USIC, a utility locating service, marked\n   buried utilities near the location of the planned installation, including those of Missouri Gas Energy (\"MGE\"), Kansas City Power &amp; Light (\"KCP&amp;L\"), and the City of Kansas City streetlights. USIC uses color-coded lines of paint to mark underground utilities. USIC placed a single yellow line (signifying an underground natural gas line) and a single red line (signifying an underground electric line) on the paved surface near the intersection of the alley on the east side of JJ's and 48th Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Heartland dug a pothole where the painted locator lines were placed. At a depth of approximately 22-24 inches, Heartland found two adjacent black conduits. Heartland concluded that one of the black conduits was the located electric line, and that the other was the located gas line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Heartland then began drilling to install TWC's fiber optic cable. Heartland sat its drill to bore at a depth of approximately 37 inches. Heartland did not dig the pothole to the depth of the anticipated bore path. Heartland thus did not observe the bore head cross under the two black conduits exposed by its pothole. As Heartland bored beneath the two black conduits, the boring drill struck a 2 inch high pressure natural gas line owned by MGE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The damage to the gas line caused natural gas to escape. Natural gas migrated under the asphalt alley and into JJ's, where it accumulated, ignited, and exploded. One JJ's employee was killed. Several persons were injured. JJ's and the building it occupied were destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 3, 2013, JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building filed suit against MGE, USIC, Heartland, and TWC. JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building subsequently settled with MGE and Heartland. On July 15, 2015, JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building filed a second amended petition against TWC and USIC. The claims asserted against TWC were for negligence involving an inherently dangerous activity; negligence involving work that is dangerous in the absence of special precautions; negligence involving work performed in a public place; and negligence per se.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following a six week trial, JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building tendered proposed verdict directors for their claims against TWC for negligence involving an inherently dangerous activity requiring special precautions (Instruction No. 5); for negligence involving work performed in a public place (Instruction No. 6); and for negligence per se (Instruction No. 7). The verdict directors were submitted to the jury over TWC's objections, as discussed in greater detail,\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The jury returned a verdict on August 27, 2015 assigning 98% fault to TWC, 0% fault to USIC, and 2% fault to JJ's Restaurant. The jury awarded compensatory damages to JJ's Restaurant in the amount of $3,500,000, and to JJ's Building in the amount of $2,400,000. After applying the comparative fault allocation, the trial court entered judgment on September 9, 2015 in favor of JJ's Restaurant in the amount of $3,430,000, and in favor of JJ's Building in the amount of $2,352,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judgment was entered \"subject to offsets or credits that this court deems appropriate pursuant to any and all post-trial motions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 16, 2015, TWC filed a motion to amend the judgment pursuant to section 537.060\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to reflect reductions for settlements reached with MGE and Heartland. On October 9, 2015, TWC also filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or in the alternative for new trial, which was never ruled on by the trial court. Over JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building's objections, the trial court granted TWC's motion to amend the judgment, in part, to reflect reduction for settlement payments made by MGE and Heartland to JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building. The trial court denied the motion to amend to the extent it sought reduction for a settlement payment made to Jimmy Frantze. The trial court entered an amended judgment on November 17, 2015, reducing the damages awarded to JJ's Restaurant to the amount of $1,492,000, and to JJ's Building to the amount of $1,514,000 (\"Judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 30, 2015, TWC filed a second motion to amend the judgment that was never ruled on by the trial court. TWC filed a notice of appeal on January 15, 2016, and a second notice of appeal on March 17, 2016. JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building filed a notice of cross-appeal on January 20, 2016, and a second notice of cross-appeal on March 18, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   TWC raises four points on appeal. Points One, Two and Three claim error in the submission of Instructions 5, 6, and 7, the verdict directors for negligence involving an inherently dangerous activity requiring special precautions, for negligence involving work performed in a public place, and for negligence per se. Point Four claims error in denying TWC's motion to strike JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building's expert witness because the expert intended to testify about legal conclusions and legal duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building assert a single point in their cross-appeal. They claim error in the reduction of judgments entered in their favor by settlement payments made to them by MGE and Heartland because the settlement payments were disputed, requiring TWC to prove the affirmative defense of reduction before the jury was discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Points One, Two and Three\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   TWC's first, second, and third points on appeal challenge verdict directors. \"Whether a jury was properly instructed is a question of law that this Court reviews\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Edgerton v.

Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6916869\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/439/189/#p200\">\n    439 S.W.3d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200 (Mo. banc 2014) (explaining the no substantial-evidence challenge). TWC cannot sustain this burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   MAI 16.08 defines \"inherently dangerous activity\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [A]n activity that necessarily presents a substantial risk of harm unless adequate precautions are taken. [, but does not include a risk of harm that is not inherent in or a normal part of the work to be performed and that is negligently created solely as a result of the improper manner in which the work under the contract was performed.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The evidence established that HDD trenchless technology is a less intrusive means of burying underground cables, as the technology avoids open trenches and street cuts. As a result, however, HDD trenchless technology involves \"blind drilling,\" as a drill bores underground to create an unexposed path through which cable can be pulled. By its nature, HDD trenchless technology thus carries with it the inherent risk that the drill bore will encounter a buried object that cannot be seen. It is not the improper manner of doing HDD work which creates this risk. Rather, it is the work itself, normally performed, which creates this risk. The risk exists\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   adequate precautions are taken to insure that pre-existing utility lines and cables are located and avoided by the drill bore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Based on the evidence, this risk is heightened when HDD work is performed in an urban area. There is an increased prevalence of underground utilities and cables in urban areas. And when HDD work is performed in an area covered by a hard surface (such as asphalt or concrete), escaping gas has nowhere to disperse should a natural gas line be struck, causing gas to migrate along the underground line and into buildings serviced by the line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   TWC counters that \"the mere performance of HDD in and of itself does not inevitably lead to harm or injury in the absence of 'special precautions.' \" [TWC's Brief, p. 23] TWC argues that \"even if a\n   contractor fails to take the routine precaution of having utilities marked before performing HDD, hitting a facility is not certain, and some utilities that could be hit present no immediate danger at all, such as sewer, water or a fiber optic cable.\" [TWC's Brief, p. 23-24] This argument is unpersuasive for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, it is irrelevant that HDD technology can be performed without encountering an underground utility even in the absence of special precautions. \"The essence of inherent danger ... is the need for special precaution. It is not sufficient for [a] defendant to show that the work can be done safely.\"\n   <em>\n    Ballinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10000177\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/788/506/#p511\">\n    788 S.W.2d at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . TWC's argument underscores, in fact, that the risk of encountering underground utilities is inherent to HDD technology, and is not a risk created by negligence performance of the work, and is a risk that cannot be avoided\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   adequate precautions are taken.\n   <em>\n    Hatch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11616340\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/990/126/#p134\">\n    990 S.W.2d at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that trial court properly instructed jury to determine whether bungee jumping is inherently dangerous because a \"risk of injury from a fall is a risk that inheres in bungee jumping itself in the absence of adequate precautions and ... the risk was not negligently created solely as a result of the improper manner [of performing] the work\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Second, TWC's argument improperly suggests that because an accidental encounter with underground utilities is only rarely catastrophic, HDD work is not inherently dangerous.

We conclude they were not. The disjunctive submissions in Paragraph Second each involved normal, contemplated risks of performing HDD work: failing to assess the presence of underground utility lines or cables; failing to avoid underground utility lines or cables; and failing to take action to avoid injury to others if an underground utility line or cable was encountered by the boring drill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Our conclusion is consistent with the Restatement's guidance as to what an employer is and is not expected to contemplate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"[A]n employer may hire a contractor to make an excavation, reasonably expecting that the contractor will proceed in the normal and usual manner with bulldozer or with pick and shovel.

Analogously, TWC knew that Heartland would be using HDD trenchless technology to install TWC's underground fiber optic cable. The risk of encountering pre-existing underground utility lines or cables unless adequate precautions are taken is a contemplated risk of HDD trenchless technology. The disjunctive submissions in Paragraph Second of Instruction No. 5 each involve alleged negligence in the course of performing the HDD work within the risk contemplated-that blind\n   boring may encounter an underground utility or cable. The disjunctive submissions in Paragraph Second were not allegations of \"collateral\" negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   MAI 31.15, the model instruction for submitting vicarious liability for an independent contractor's negligent performance of an inherently dangerous activity, is consistent with this conclusion. Paragraph Second of MAI 31.15 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, during such activity, (\n   <em>\n    state the name of independent contractor\n   </em>\n   )\n   <strong>\n    either\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   failed to (\n   <em>\n    here state the special precaution the independent contractor failed to take\n   </em>\n   ), or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   failed to (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     here insert alternative failure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ), ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (Emphasis in bold added.) Certainly, MAI 31.15 anticipates that an independent contractor's failure to take a special precaution is a submissible act of negligence in an inherently dangerous activity case. However, MAI 31.15 anticipates that other acts of negligence can also be submitted. The improper imposition of vicarious liability on an employer for \"collateral\" negligence is avoided by the collective operation of Paragraphs, Second, Third and Fourth of MAI 31.15, which require, respectively, that in one or more of the respects submitted in Paragraph Second, the independent contractor was negligent (Paragraph Third),\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   that \"such\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     negligence and the danger inherent in such activity combined\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to directly cause damage to plaintiff\" (Paragraph Fourth).

TWC's point on appeal hinges entirely on this preliminary inquiry, as TWC argues that the legislature did not intend section 67.1844 to create a statutory exception to the long-standing common law doctrine that employers are not vicariously liable for injuries caused by the negligent conduct of an independent contractor. [TWC's Brief, p. 41]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \"The test to determine whether a violation of a statute may constitute negligence per se depends on legislative intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Lowdermilk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9382527\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/91/617/#p628\">\n    91 S.W.3d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). We conclude that section 67.1844 was intended to define the standard of care in a negligence action involving a contractor's excavation work in a public right-of-way on behalf of a public utility right-of way user. The plain language of section 67.1844 imposes an obligation to perform all excavation work in the public right-of-way in accordance with applicable safety and construction codes. Section 67.1884.1. It is fair to assume that this legislation was directed to the safety of persons or property. In fact, we can fathom no other purpose for the legislation. \"[C]ases will be relatively infrequent in which legislation directed to the safety of persons or property will be so obsolete, or so unreasonable, or for some other reason inapplicable to the case, that the court will take [the] position\" that the legislation is \"inapplicable for the purposes of defining negligence\" in a suit based on its violation. Restatement (Second) of Torts sec. 286 cmt. d (1965). Section 67.1844 provides that a public utility is responsible to ensure that the work of contractors is performed consistent with applicable safety and construction codes, and thus expresses the intent that a public utility will not be insulated from responsibility for performing excavating work in a public right-of-way by delegating the work to a contractor. In effect, section 67.1844 expresses the legislative intent that excavation work in a public right-of-way involves a non-delegable duty to perform that work as required by applicable safety and construction codes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   We therefore conclude that section 67.1844 establishes a standard of care that supports the submission of a negligence per se claim. A public utility who retains a contractor to excavate in a public right-of-way must ensure that all applicable safety and construction codes regarding the excavation work are followed, because the work involves a non-delegable duty that would apply evenly to the utility if it performed the work itself. As such, we are obliged to \"adopt[ ] the statutory standard of care to define the standard of conduct of [a] reasonable [public utility right-of-way user].\"\n   <em>\n    Lowdermilk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9382527\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/91/617/#p628\">\n    91 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   628 (citing\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts secs. 286, 288 (1965) ). Paragraph First of Instruction No. 7 did precisely that.

Section 67.1844 simply codifies the common law insofar as vicarious liability for the negligent performance of work that is subject to a non-delegable duty of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   TWC complains that construing section 67.1844 to impose a statutory standard of care permitting submission of vicarious liability for independent contractor negligence on a theory of negligence per se will have the effect of imposing strict liability on public utilities for every imaginable act of negligence by a contractor. We disagree for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   First, a public utility's responsibility for a contractor's acts under section 67.1844 is limited to ensuring the performance of \"safety and construction codes\" that are applicable to excavation work in a public right-of-way. A negligence per se submission alleging a public utility is vicariously liable pursuant to section 67.1884 will necessarily be limited in scope to a contractor's acts or omissions which violate a safety or construction code applicable to the manner in which excavation work should be performed. Here, TWC does not dispute that section 319.037 and section 64-116(f)(5) of the Kansas City Ordinances, (from which the submissions in subsections (i) through (iii) of Paragraph Second were drawn), are \"safety and construction codes\" applicable to the performance of excavation work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Second, relying on a violation of section 67.1844 to impose vicarious liability on a public utility on a theory of negligence per se will expose the public utility to no greater liability than had it performed the excavation work itself. Section 67.1844 states that a contractor performing excavation work in a public right-of-way for a public utility \"shall have the same obligations with respect to its work as a public utility right-of-way user would have.\" Section 67.1844.2. Here, the disjunctive submissions in Paragraph Second of Instruction No. 7 involving Heartland were framed as negligence per se submissions, as the jury was asked only to find whether the failures to perform specified in subsections (i) through (iii) occurred, and not whether those failures constituted negligence. TWC has not challenged whether Heartland's negligence should have been submitted on\n   a theory of negligence per se. We thus express no opinion whether a violation of section 319.037 or section 64-116(f)(5) of the Kansas City Ordinances supports submission on a theory of negligence per se, or instead requires the additional finding of negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts sec. 424 cmt. b (1965) (observing that whether the duty to perform as required by a safety statute or regulation is absolute or subject to a duty of reasonable care is a matter of construction). For our purposes, it is sufficient to note that a public utility cannot be vicariously liable pursuant to section 67.1844 for a contractor's failure to perform in accordance with applicable safety and construction codes beyond the liability the public utility would have if it performed the excavation work for itself. There is no merit to TWC's contention that strict liability will be imposed if vicarious liability based on a theory of negligence per se is recognized for a public utility's violation of section 67.1844.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Beyond TWC's argument that section 67.1844 is not a statute on which negligence per se can be premised, TWC does not otherwise challenge that the four requirements of a negligence per se claim were established in this case. The trial court did not err in submitting Instruction No. 7 to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Point Three on appeal is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    Point Four\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   TWC's fourth point on appeal challenges the trial court's denial of its motion to strike expert witness testimony because the expert \"testified on legal conclusions and legal duties thereby misleading and confusing the jury.\" [TWC's Brief, p. 55] Specifically, TWC complains that the trial court erred when it denied TWC's motion to strike the expert testimony of Steve Gaw (\"Gaw\"), a former member of the PSC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   TWC neglects to cite to the motion to strike in the record on appeal, or to the transcript location where the motion to strike was argued. We assume from TWC's point relied on that the motion to strike sought to preclude Gaw from testifying at all. Our independent review of the trial transcript confirms that just before Gaw was called to the stand to testify, TWC's counsel advised the trial court that \"[w]e filed a motion to strike him\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     because all of his opinions are just legal opinions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" [Tr. 2702]; (emphasis added). After argument on the record, including voir dire of Gaw in aid of the motion to strike, the trial court denied the motion, and permitted Gaw to testify. Our inquiry is thus limited to determining whether it was error to deny TWC's motion to strike Gaw's expert testimony in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \"The standard for the admission of expert testimony in civil cases is set forth by section 490.065.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitnell v.

The testimony was also relevant to permit the trial court to legally determine whether TWC was a \"public utility right-of-way user\" subject to section 67.1844,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   a predicate to submission of the negligence per se verdict director (Instruction No. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Standing alone, the lack of an objection to this portion of Gaw's expert testimony is fatal to TWC's point on appeal. The trial court did not err in denying a pre-testimony motion to strike which sought to prevent Gaw from testifying at all when Gaw later offered admissible expert testimony as to which no objection was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   As Gaw's testimony continued, TWC did object, specifically when Gaw began offering his opinion about the meaning of various provisions in chapter 67. TWC objected that Gaw \"was now getting into the area of legal duty, which is not proper for expert opinion.\" [Tr. 2739] The trial court denied the objection, and permitted TWC to have \"a continuing objection during the whole course of [Gaw's] testimony.\" [Tr. 2739-40]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Thereafter, and loosely summarized, Gaw: (i) testified that all public utilities are required to comply with statutory provisions relating to use of the public right-of-way; (ii) identified the video services authorization issued by the PSC to TWC; (iii) pointed out the provision in TWC's video services authorization that gives TWC the\n   authority to install video services along, across or on public rights-of-way; (iv) explained that he had reviewed the written contract between Heartland and TWC, and discussed Heartland's legal obligations in excavating on TWC's behalf; (v) identified a copy of the Right-Of-Way Statutes, sections 67.1830 to 67.1844, and generally explained that the Right-Of-Way Statutes address the use of public rights-of-way by public utilities; (vi) noted the provision in the Right-Of-Way Statutes that defines \"public right-of-way;\" (vii) noted that the Right-Of-Way Statutes require excavation work to be done in accordance with applicable laws; (viii) identified a copy of the Video Services Providers Act of 2007 which authorizes the issuance of a franchise to video service providers; (ix) explained that the Video Services Providers Act specifies other provisions in the law which video service providers are obligated to follow, including Chapter 67, the National Electrical Code, and Chapter 319; (x) opined that installing a fiber optic cable underneath the public rights-of-way near JJ's qualified as an excavation activity controlled by the Right-Of-Way Statutes; (xi) opined that section 67.1844 is a part of the Right-Of-Way Statutes; (xii) opined that the provisions of section 67.1844 are mandates and not guidelines; (xiii) opined about the meaning of the provision in section 67.1844 addressing a contractor's obligation to perform excavation work in a public right-of-way pursuant to the same laws that would be applicable to the public utility; (xiv) opined that section 67.1844 prohibited TWC from relieving itself of the obligation to comply with laws applicable to excavation work by delegating that work to a contractor; (xv) identified a copy of the Underground Facility Safety and Damage Prevention Act [chapter 319], and explained how the Act governs excavation work in Missouri and is referred to as the \"One Call Act;\" (xvi) described the general thrust of the One Call Act; (xvii) opined that the One Call Act includes provisions regarding safety precautions which must be taken with respect to HDD trenchless technology; (xviii) identified a copy of a section of the National Electric Code; (xix) identified a copy of the Kansas City Ordinance relating to excavation work in a public right-of-way; and (xx) opined that authorized video service providers are required to follow the National Electric Code and ordinances related to excavation work adopted by political subdivisions like Kansas City. At the conclusion of his direct testimony, Gaw testified that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   [A] video services provider, Time Warner in this case, must follow the laws regarding excavation work. They have to follow the laws of the State of Missouri, they have to follow the national electric code, they have to follow the Kansas City ordinances. And if they have someone else do work for them, which the law provides them the ability to do, they have to ensure that that law is followed and they are responsible just as though they were doing the work for that activity. That's basically it, I would say, in a nutshell.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   [Tr. 2762-63]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Some of the aforesaid topics about which Gaw testified subject to TWC's continuing objection were not \"legal conclusions or opinions.\" However, some of Gaw's testimony provided over TWC's continuing objection plainly involved legal opinions and conclusions, including opinions on the subject of TWC's legal duties, and the extent to which those duties made TWC vicariously liable for the negligence of Heartland. Although an expert witness is permitted to opine on \"ultimate facts\" that\n   will be submitted to a jury for determination, Gaw's opinions about the meaning of statutes or regulations, about whether those statutes or regulations impose legal duties on public utilities or contractors, and about the legal effect of those duties, did not involve \"facts,\" ultimate or otherwise. Rather, those opinions involved pure issues of law. \"Generally, expert testimony on issues of law is inadmissible because this testimony 'encroaches upon the duty of the court to instruct on the law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

Aware of the settlements and of TWC's affirmative defense seeking reduction, the trial court's initial judgment expressly indicated that it was entered \"subject to offsets or credits that this court deems appropriate pursuant to any and all post-trial motions.\" TWC's post-trial motion to amend the judgment attached the MGE and Heartland settlement agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The settlement agreements identify several discrete settlement payments, the amount of each settlement payment, and to whom each settlement payment was made. One joint tort-feasor made discrete settlement payments to JJ's Restaurant, to JJ's Building, and to Jimmy Frantze. The other joint tort-feasor made discrete settlement payments to JJ's Restaurant and to JJ's Building.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   It is thus undisputed that settlement payments were made. The amount and recipient of each settlement payment is also undisputed. As a result, the amounts paid to JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building that must reduce their respective judgments as a matter of law is not in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   However, TWC's motion to amend also argued that the judgments should be reduced by the settlement payment to Jimmy Frantze, which TWC characterized as a \"hidden\" payment to one or both of the JJ's entities. Whether the settlement payment to Jimmy Frantze should be attributable to JJ's Restaurant or JJ's Building involves a dispute \"as to whether a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     certain\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   payment was attributable to a settlement.\" MAI 1.06 [2012 Revision] Comment I (emphasis added). TWC was obligated to submit this disputed issue \"to the jury by modifying the damage instruction as required by ... MAI 7.02 and using Form of Verdict MAI 36.19.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7122035\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/375/157/#p179\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consistent with this fact, the trial court did not grant TWC's post-trial motion to amend insofar as it sought to reduce the judgments in favor of JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building by the disputed settlement payment to Jimmy Frantze. The trial court only reduced the judgments by the undisputed settlement payments to JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building contend that TWC's insistence of a reduction for the disputed settlement payment to Jimmy Frantze rendered all of the settlement payments made by MGE and Heartland disputed, requiring the issue of reduction to be submitted to the jury. We cannot fault JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building for attempting to exploit the position taken by TWC in its post-trial motion to amend. However, there is no authority for the proposition that a dispute involving one settlement payment automatically renders all other settlement payments disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Rather, in a case involving multiple settlement payments, a trial court is required to submit any disputed settlement payments to the jury, while it is at the same time prohibited from submitting any undisputed settlement payments to the jury. MAI 1.06 [2012 Revision] (prohibiting the submission of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   undisputed settlement payments to the jury); MAI 1.06 [2012 Revision] Comment B (providing that \"[h]andling of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    undisputed\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     payment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to be credited against plaintiff's claim is a matter of procedure\") (emphasis added); MAI 1.06 [2012 Revision] Comment H (providing that a trial judge shall, as a matter of law, credit \"\n   <em>\n    undisputed\n   </em>\n   prior settlement\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     payments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" on \"the damages assessed by the jury's verdict\") (emphasis added); MAI 1.06 [2012 Revision] Comment I (requiring submission to the jury if there is a disputed issue \"as to whether a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     certain\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   payment was attributable to a settlement\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Here, had the disputed settlement payment to Jimmy Frantze been submitted to the jury as required, the jury's resolution of whether that \"certain payment\" should be attributed to a settlement with JJ's Restaurant or JJ's Building would not have altered the undisputed settlement payments plainly made by MGE and Heartland to JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building. At most, the jury's resolution of the disputed settlement payment to Jimmy Frantze would have required reduction of one or both of the JJ's entities' judgments by an\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     additional\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   settlement payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   We conclude that the trial court correctly refused to reduce the judgments in favor of JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building by the disputed settlement payment to Jimmy Frantze, as the disputed settlement payment was not eligible for post-trial reduction. However, the disputed settlement payment to Jimmy Frantze did not convert the undisputed payments to JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Buildings into disputed settlement payments. The trial court did not err in reducing the judgments post-trial by the undisputed settlement payments made by MGE and Heartland to JJ's Restaurant and JJ's Building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Cross-appeal point denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The trial court's Judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   All concur\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    We view the evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict.\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.
