(VanMeter), suffered a disabling injury in a workplace accident. Groce alleged that the accident was due, in part, to VanMeter's violations of workplace safety regulations, which if true, would entitle her to a 30% increase in benefits pursuant to KRS 342.165(1). The ALJ rejected her claim for enhanced benefits, but the Workers' Compensation Board (Board) reversed the ALJ. The Court of Appeals\n   reversed the Board's decision and reinstated the judgment of the ALJ. Groce now appeals and, upon review, we affirm the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Groce and two other employees of VanMeter were injured during the construction of a large concrete retaining wall when the forms holding the wet concrete collapsed. Another employee was killed. Groce suffered critical injuries which required extensive hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and long-term rehabilitation treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health Administration (KOSHA) investigated the accident and provided the following description:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Four (4) employees were engaged in pouring concrete into a retaining wall form. The employees were working from a Form Scaffold, twenty-four (24) inches wide by twenty-four (24) foot long mounted to a Plate Girder Forming System retaining wall form 12.5 feet above the ground below. The retaining wall form was eight (8) foot wide at the base narrowing to one (1) foot wide at the top, 12.5-foot-tall and twenty-four (24) foot in length. The employees were pouring concrete into the form using a bucket and crane system and a vibrator machine to settle the concrete. The form was over 95% filled with approximately fifty-four (54) yards of concrete. As the employees were topping off the fill, they heard a loud pop and the entire form raised and toppled to the east toward the crane. Three (3) employees were thrown toward the crane and one (1) employee fell backwards into the concrete surging out from under the toppled form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As a result of its investigation, KOSHA issued three citations against VanMeter but only one is relevant to our review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Citation 01 Item 003 charged VanMeter with violating 29 CFR 1926.703(a)(1), titled \"General requirements for formwork,\" which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Formwork shall be designed, fabricated, erected, supported, braced and maintained so that it will be capable of supporting without failure all vertical and lateral loads that may reasonably be anticipated to be applied to the formwork. Formwork which is designed, fabricated, erected, supported, braced and maintained in conformance with the appendix to this section will be deemed to meet the requirements of this paragraph.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Specifically, KOSHA alleged that VanMeter violated the regulation by constructing the concrete wall with forms unsupported by a telescoping push-pull pipe brace, and that the anchor bolts holding the forms were spaced too far apart and at irregular intervals. In due course, VanMeter and KOSHA resolved the citation with a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement in which VanMeter \"accepted responsibility\" for all three citations, agreed that all of the violations were serious, and paid a fine of $14,000.00. Of particular significance to this appeal is, the following provision of the Settlement Agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [VanMeter's] agreement as set forth hereinabove and its execution of this Settlement Agreement are not admissions by [VanMeter] of any violations of the Act or the standards or regulations promulgated thereunder nor admissions of [VanMeter] of the truth of any of the\n   allegations or conclusions contained in the Citations or Complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Groce filed her claim for workers' compensation benefits and, as noted above, asserted a claim for the 30% benefit enhancement provided by KRS 342.165(1) for a workplace injury \"caused in any degree by the intentional failure of the employer to comply with any specific statute or lawful administrative regulation made thereunder, communicated to the employer and relative to installation or maintenance of safety appliances or methods.\" The award enhancement of KRS 342.165(1) exists to provide a financial penalty to discourage employers from taking shortcuts that violate employee safety regulations, and correspondingly, the statute also provides a financial incentive for both employers and employees to comply with relevant safety regulations.\n   <em>\n    Chaney v. Dags Branch Coal Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8390168\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/244/95/#p101\">\n    244 S.W.3d 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 101 (Ky. 2008). Although inapplicable here, the statute also imposes a 15% reduction of benefits awarded to injured workers whose violation of safety regulations contributed to their injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Groce alleged the same regulatory violations asserted by KOSHA and a violation of the general workplace safety duty of KRS 338.031(l)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ALJ concluded that Groce had not presented sufficient evidence to prove the intentional violation of any safety statute or regulation, including 29 CFR 1926.703(a)(1) or the general duty statute, KRS 338.031(1)(a). Consequently, the ALJ declined to grant the 30% enhancement. Upon review, the Board, by a 2-1 vote, reversed the ALJ's decision with respect to the safety violation enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Board concluded that, \"regardless of the language contained in the settlement agreement,\" VanMeter's execution of the settlement agreement withdrawing its contest of KOSHA Citation 01 Item 003 and paying a fine was, in effect, a conclusive judicial admission to the intentional violation of 29 CFR 1926.703(a)(1). In so holding, the Board gave no weight to the agreement's plainly-stated disclaimer of any admissions. Contrary to the ALJ's findings, the Board concluded that, not only was the evidence sufficient to justify the award of enhanced benefits, but that the evidence of the settlement agreement compelled the award of enhanced benefits, provided the violation was shown to have contributed to causing the accident. Consequently, the Board remanded the claim to the ALJ with instructions to determine whether VanMeter's violation of 29 CFR 1926.703(a)(1) in any degree caused Groce's work-related accident, and to then enter an award accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Upon VanMeter's appeal, the Court of Appeals rejected the Board's analysis and reversed. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In construing the settlement agreement as a conclusive admission to a safety violation, the Board totally disregarded a crucial element of the settlement agreement: the explicit provision in which KOSHA and VanMeter disclaim its effect as an admission to the alleged violation. This provision precludes the use of the agreement as a conclusive judicial admission of a safety violation.

That principle is not challenged in this case. Significantly, the ALJ in\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   found that the employer had in fact violated the asserted safety regulations, and therefore, presumptively did so knowingly. To the contrary, and as stated below, the ALJ expressly determined that the employer, VanMeter,\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   violate the safety regulation in question.\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   does not state or imply that the agreed resolution of a regulatory citation constitutes the employer's judicial admission of the violation.\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   is not determinative of the issue before us in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The ALJ determined from the evidence that the employer did not violate employee safety regulations.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, although KOSHA's citations and investigative report, and the terms of the settlement agreement may be considered as some evidence of the alleged regulatory violations, it remains for the ALJ in the workers' compensation action to determine whether, as a matter of fact, the violations occurred and, if so, whether they were intentional and a contributing cause of the injury-producing accident. \"The fact that the employer settled the KOSHA citation without admitting a violation is immaterial. In the context of a workers' compensation claim, it is the responsibility of the ALJ to determine whether a violation of a statute or administrative regulation has occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Brusman v. Newport Steel Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11513181\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/17/514/#p520\">\n    17 S.W.3d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 520 (Ky. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this instance, the ALJ did not merely conclude that Groce had failed to meet her evidentiary burden of proving that VanMeter violated 29 CFR 1926.703(a)(1) by failing to use the required push-pull pipe bracing and by failing to properly space the anchor bolts on the concrete forms; rather, the ALJ found from the evidence that VanMeter\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   used push-pull pipe bracing and\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   spaced its bolts within four-foot intervals. Thus, the ALJ affirmatively found that these alleged violations did not occur. Groce directs us to no evidence\n   that compels a finding in opposition to the ALJ's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The ALJ also expressly rejected the safety deficiencies identified by Groce's co-worker, Steve Nelson, relating to the anchor bolt spacing and the use of tie-downs. The ALJ found that Nelson, while an experienced laborer in building concrete structures, was not qualified to give an opinion establishing safety requirements. The ALJ also found that Groce had failed to establish VanMeter's violation of the general safety duty of KRS 338.031(1)(a) under the standards provided in\n   <em>\n    Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government v. Offutt,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11478718\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/11/598/\">\n    11 S.W.3d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. App. 2000).

Upon review, we are unable to conclude that the evidence in Groce's favor was so overwhelming as to compel a reversal of the ALJ's findings. If the party with the burden of proof fails to convince the ALJ of the safety violation, that party must then establish on appeal that the evidence in their favor was so overwhelming as to compel a favorable finding.\n   <em>\n    Hanik v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   When reviewing a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board, the Court of Appeals will affirm unless the Board has misconstrued or overlooked controlling law, or has so flagrantly erred in evaluating the evidence that a gross injustice has occurred.\n   <em>\n    Western Baptist Hospital v.

We agree with the Court of Appeal's' conclusion that the Board misconstrued or overlooked controlling law when, in contradiction of the ALJ's findings, it accorded conclusive weight to the KOSHA settlement agreement. Therefore, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   All sitting.

As an illustration, suppose a KOSHA investigation erroneously concluded an employee failed to use available safety equipment, thus implicating the 15% reduction in benefits provision of KRS 342.165(1). We do not apply res judicata in a related workers' compensation claim because the exclusion of evidence that the worker did in fact use the safety equipment would frustrate the objective of KRS Chapter 342 to ensure that injured workers are fairly compensated for their workplace injuries, even though administrative proceedings in another forum may have reached a different, though erroneous, position concerning the facts of the accident. That is, the workers' compensation system, and the appellate courts who may later review a claim, should not be bound by an erroneous decision made by KOSHA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Citing\n    <em>\n     Nelson Tree Services, Inc. v.
