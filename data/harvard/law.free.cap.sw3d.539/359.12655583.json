Williams, M.D., and Richard M. Williams, M.D., P.L.L.C. filed motions to dismiss pursuant to chapter 74 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code based on the expert reports filed by appellee Karen Miller, individually and as representative of the Estate of Betty Ruth Hathcock and Betty Crockett, individually (collectively Miller). The trial court denied the motions. On appeal, all four appellants argue the trial court abused its discretion by denying their motions to dismiss because none of the expert reports sufficiently identify causation. JSC further argues Miller's expert reports fail to adequately state the standard of care. Because we conclude the trial court should have granted the motions to dismiss as to all three appellants, we reverse and remand this cause to the trial court for rendition of judgment dismissing with prejudice Miller's claims and for a determination of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2013, Betty Ruth Hathcock was discharged from Presbyterian Hospital and admitted to JSC for rehabilitation. On March 22, 2013, around 11:45 a.m., Hathcock received a phone call from her daughter, Betty Crockett. Hathcock was slow to answer the phone, and Crockett thought Hathcock's voice sounded strange. Around 5 p.m. that same day, Hathcock told the nursing staff at JSC her dental bridge was missing. Staff searched her room but did not locate the bridge. They also told laundry staff to be on the lookout for it. JSC called Karen Miller, also Hathcock's daughter, and told her Hathcock was upset over the loss of the bridge. Miller sent her husband to JSC to look for the bridge; however, his search was unsuccessful. Miller talked to her husband and\n   Hathcock around 7 p.m. Miller thought Hathcock's voice sounded \"raspy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By 8 p.m., Hathcock started coughing and exhibited signs of chest congestion. Dr. LeJeune ordered Robitussin and a \"stat\" chest x-ray. The staff did not inform him that Hathcock's bridge was missing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Metrostat provided portable, onsite x-ray services to JSC. Casey Oaks, a radiologic technologist, took a chest x-ray of Hathcock between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. on March 22. He forwarded the images to Dr. Richard M. Williams for review. Dr. Williams's report noted that Dr. LeJeune ordered the chest exam because of a cough. Dr. Williams's findings stated, \"The heart is normal in size and configuration. The aorta and other mediastinal structures are in the midline. There is bilateral lower lobe infiltrate.\" His report did not mention any foreign object in the proximal trachea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The record does not indicate when Dr. Williams sent his final report to JSC, but the first mention of the chest x-ray in nursing notes was around 6:30 a.m. on March 23. It states the doctor was notified of the results and ordered 500 mg of Levoquin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   JSC staff found Hathcock unresponsive in her room at approximately 7:10 a.m. Hathcock was transported to the hospital and upon her arrival, she was unresponsive, hypotensive, and having seizure-like movements. When ER doctors tried to intubate, they discovered the missing bridge lodged in her throat. After the bridge was extracted, Hathcock was transferred to ICU. Despite aggressive treatment and support, Hathcock did not improve and her family requested removal of life support. Hathcock died at approximately 2 p.m. Her death certificate listed pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, and aspiration as the causes of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Miller filed suit under the Texas Medical Liability Act against JSC, Metrostat, and Dr. Williams and his professional corporation alleging various breaches of the applicable standards of care, which proximately caused her mother's death. Miller argued the delay in discovering Hathcock's bridge led to her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Miller filed four expert reports in support of her claims: (1) Dr. Teresa Albright opined on JSC's conduct; (2) Dr. David Naeger opined on Dr. Williams's conduct; (3) Dr. Ravi Patel's opinion did not reference any specific individual's conduct but discussed causation; and (4) Christi Carter, M.S.R.S., RT(S), CIIP opined on Metrostat's conduct. Appellants filed objections and moved to dismiss the suit for failure to serve adequate expert reports under section 74.351 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. After a hearing, the trial court sustained the objections and granted Miller a thirty-day extension to cure the deficient reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Miller served amended reports, and appellants again moved to dismiss for failing to satisfy the requirements of section 74.351. The trial court held a hearing and denied appellants' motions to dismiss. This interlocutory appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review a trial court's decision on a motion to dismiss under section 74.351 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Kelly v.

During that hearing the trial court made it clear that it was not concerned with Dr. Patel's report, but believed that the remaining physicians' expert reports were sufficient standing alone or that Dr. Albright's causation opinion was sufficient to \"fill the gaps\" between the defendants. Thus, although it does not appear the trial court relied on Dr. Patel's expert report, to the extent it may have, we conclude the trial court abused its discretion.

Thus, Miller did not file any expert report sufficiently linking the alleged breaches of the standard of care to any conduct by Metrostat that proximately caused Hathcock's injuries. Accordingly, Miller failed to comply with the expert report requirements of Chapter 74. Because Miller failed to comply with the expert report requirements of chapter 74, the trial court abused its discretion by denying Metrostat's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful of the fact the record indicates the trial court read Dr. Albright's opinion in conjunction with Carter's opinion to establish causation as to Metrostat. However, Miller has not argued in response on appeal that Dr. Albright's opinion is sufficient to establish causation as to Metrostat. Moreover, Dr. Albright's expert report analyzed the \"care and treatment provided by [JSC],\" and made no mention of Metrostrat. As such, we shall not consider Dr. Albright's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We sustain Metrostat's issue.

Thus, receiving the report earlier would not have resulted in Hathcock \"most certainly\" being transported to the emergency room and receiving \"immediate medical treatment, preventing her decline and death which occurred.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Dr. Albright also states JSC breached the standard of care by failing to check Hathcock's throat for the bridge and failing to notify Dr. LeJeune that it was missing \"so he had a complete picture of Ms. Hathcock's situation,\" and these failures contributed to the delay ultimately leading to her death. However, Dr. Albright's report states a JSC nurse sent a note to Dr. LeJeune at 8 p.m. explaining Hathcock had \"cough and congestion, 96% O2 saturation on room air, normal respiratory rate, blood pressure, and pulse.\" The nurse then received orders from Dr. LeJeune for Robitussin DM and a \"stat\" chest x-ray.

She fails to explain how monitoring Hathcock's condition or keeping accurate records would have resulted in earlier extraction of the bridge and prevented aspiration, pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax. We acknowledge her report indicates Hathcock's condition went from \"cough and congestion, 96% O2 saturation on room air, normal respiratory rate, blood pressure, and pulse\" to \"coughing and had wet lung sounds, with 75% O2 saturation\" during the alleged eight hours she was unmonitored. However, the report neither explains the significance of the drop in oxygen levels during that time and how it relates to aspiration, pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax-the ultimate cause of death-nor provides a temporal insight into when earlier monitoring could have changed the outcome.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203765771\">\n    2015 WL 3765771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (expert report failed to establish causation when it did not provide a \"temporal insight\" as to when transfer of patient to an ICU setting was needed in order for conditions to remain treatable and reversible).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Lastly, Dr. Albright opines, \"It was below the standard of care for the staff at [JSC] to ignore the [family] request and choose not to transport Ms. Hathcock to the ER, but instead wait on the X-ray result.\" She then concludes, \"The failure to comply with this request caused a delay in Ms. Hathcock's receiving lifesaving care which was a proximate case of her untimely death.\" First, we agree with JSC's argument that Dr. Albright fails to provide the specificity required for the standard of care as to this allegation.

Over the course of the day on March 22, 2013, Hathcock developed a raspy voice and a cough. At 8:00 p.m., the nursing home's on-call physician ordered a \"stat\" chest X-ray. A radiology technician from appellant Metrostat Diagnostic Services, Inc. came to the nursing home and took frontal and lateral view chest X-rays shortly after 9:30 p.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The reason given for the procedure was a \"Cough.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The films were forwarded to Williams, and his interpretation of the X-rays was transcribed at 11:51 p.m.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Findings: The heart is normal in size and configuration.

He did not contact Metrostat or JSC Highlands concerning a need for Hathcock to receive urgent treatment to remove the implant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The next morning at approximately 7:00 a.m., more than seven hours after Williams\n   reviewed her X-rays, Hathcock was discovered unresponsive.

He argues the trial court abused its discretion by failing to grant Williams's motion to dismiss because appellees' expert reports were deficient on the issue of causation. The majority agrees with Williams. It concludes the reports of Dr. Ravi Patel and Dr. David Naeger are insufficient standing alone to satisfy chapter 74's causation standard, and it is \"unpersuaded\" that these reports should be read together to fulfill the statute's requirements. I would conclude settled chapter 74 law, applied and evaluated according to our standard of review, calls for a different result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    Patel's Expert Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Patel was Hathcock's treating physician in the emergency room. Patel explains in his expert report that Hathcock's denture implant was found in the back of her mouth when she arrived at the hospital. As the majority sets forth, his report contains the following opinions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Ms. Hathcock expired on March 24, 2013. Her final diagnosis was cardiorespiratory failure second to anoxic brain injury secondary to cardiac arrest. Had the lodged denture implant been timely discovered, and had she received appropriate treatment to remove the denture implant at an earlier stage, it is reasonably medically probable that Ms. Hathcock would have survived.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   It is my medical opinion, based upon my care and treatment of Ms. Hathcock and in all reasonable medical probability, that the denture implant lodged in the throat/trachea area of her airway was the cause of the aspiration, which produced the pulmonary edema and pneumothorax which, collectively, was a proximate cause of her death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The majority addresses Patel's report at the outset of its opinion and concludes that, standing alone, it is \"deficient for causation\" because it does not explain what conduct is attributable to any of the appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The majority goes on to refuse-for the same reason-to read Patel's report in conjunction with any other report in the case. The majority relies on two cases, both of which involve an expert report that fails to identify a defendant responsible for the conduct charged as negligence. Neither case, however, supports dismissing Patel's opinion for all purposes as the majority has done. First, the majority cites\n   <em>\n    Bogar v.

(\"To the extent that the trial court may have reviewed Dr. Garza's report in isolation, the trial court abused its discretion because Section 74.351(i) expressly provides that a claimant may satisfy any requirement of the Act by providing reports of separate experts.\"). This is a critical failing because Patel's report does not attempt to resolve the entirety of the causation issue in this case. It does not focus on\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   caused the injury that led to Hathcock's death. Instead, it reports, perhaps better than any retained expert could,\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the injury caused her death. Patel describes finding the dental implant lodged in Hathcock's trachea. He opines that if the implant had been timely discovered, and if Hathcock had earlier received the appropriate treatment to remove the implant, then she would have survived. Patel traces the damage done by the failure to detect the implant step by step: the implant became lodged in her trachea; this foreign object in her airway caused her aspiration; the aspiration caused fluid to collect in her lungs (pulmonary edema ) and her lung to collapse (pneumothorax ); and those two conditions ultimately caused her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    Naeger's Expert Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The second report directed toward Williams's conduct in this case sets forth Naeger's opinions on the appropriate standard of care, Williams's failure to meet that standard, and the cause of Hathcock's aspiration. Addressing the Metrostat X-ray films, Naeger states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   [I]t is my opinion that it is within the standard of radiologic care to detect and report the high density foreign body which is visualized in the proximal trachea. Further, it is my opinion that such a finding warrants an immediate phone call to the ordering provider given the need for an intervention (foreign object removal) to prevent possible harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Naeger confirms that the death certificate's finding of \"aspiration\" is supported by the Metrostat X-rays, \"in which a foreign object is noted in the airway, consistent with a foreign body aspiration.\" In his conclusion, Naeger opines that Williams failed to meet the minimum standard of radiologic care in:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Failing to detect and report the high density foreign body which is visualized in the proximal trachea and in the frontal and lateral view chest X-rays dated 3/22/13, 9:51 a.m., [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Failing to contact and alert the ordering provider on an immediate basis of the need for an intervention for removal of a foreign object to prevent possible harm. By not identifying the object and calling the provider, this delayed a timely removal of the foreign body. Not removing the foreign body in a timely manner can lead to aspiration, which can be deadly. Aspiration was listed on Ms. Hathcock's death certificate as one of the \"significant conditions contributing to death.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As the majority notes, Williams does not challenge Naeger's standard-of-care opinions. But the majority does challenge the adequacy of Naeger's report as to causation, concluding that Naeger fails to explain how Williams's failure to detect and report the implant resulted in aspiration and, ultimately, in Hathcock's death. The majority concludes Naeger's report is conclusory, and therefore deficient, because it fails to explain the basis of his statements linking his conclusions to the facts and fails to establish that Williams's negligent act was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm that befell Hathcock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   I disagree, in the first instance, that Naeger's opinion fails to link Williams's breach (his failure to detect and warn of the lodged implant) with Hathcock's injury (the aspiration). Indeed, Naeger specifically states that the foreign object in Hathcock's airway was already consistent with such an aspiration at the time the X-rays were taken. Moreover, I would conclude Naeger clearly identifies the causal link between Williams's breach and Hathcock's injury: Williams's breach \"delayed a timely removal of the foreign body.\" And then Naeger links that failure to remove the object with the injury: \"Not removing the foreign body in a timely manner can lead to aspiration, which can be deadly.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Reading the Reports Together\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Regardless of the individual merits of the Patel and Naeger reports, I cannot join the majority's refusal to read them together.

Nevertheless, in this case, the Naeger report explains how Williams's conduct caused an event: a foreign object remained lodged in Hathcock's throat because Williams failed to detect it and to warn her caregivers. Then the Patel report explains how this same event-the undetected foreign object lodged in Hathcock's throat-caused the series of pulmonary issues that eventually caused her death. The two reports are tied together factually by this identification of the unremedied presence of a foreign object, the dental implant, in the patient's trachea. And because the reports merge in their understanding of this factual event, Naeger's identification of Williams as the negligent actor remedies any deficiency in Patel's report, and Patel's report provides sufficient detail as to the progressive steps leading to Hathcock's demise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caviglia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316858\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/365/804/#p809\">\n    365 S.W.3d at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   I discern no abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to dismiss Hathcock's claim against Williams.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11586282\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/988/219/#p222\">\n    988 S.W.2d at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (court abuses its discretion only if it acts in arbitrary or unreasonable manner without reference to guiding rules or principles).

All parties agree the X-rays were taken during the evening of March 22, not the next morning.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    The majority also cites\n    <em>\n     Tenet Hospitals\n    </em>\n    as authority for a purported requirement that Patel review other expert reports with which his would be read. But Patel's opinions were not derivative of or based on anyone else's reports; they were based on his own observation and treatment of Hathcock. On the contrary, in this case, Patel's records were reviewed by the other experts opining concerning Hathcock's treatment in the emergency room and her death.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The majority emphasizes the word \"can\" in each clause of this final sentence and calls the opinion conclusory. The opinion may be equivocal, but it is hardly conclusory.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
