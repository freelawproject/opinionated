Branstetter alleges error in the admission of an anonymous letter over his hearsay objection, and that entry of the full order of protection was against the weight of the evidence, not supported by substantial evidence, and misapplied the law. Finding no error, we affirm. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
