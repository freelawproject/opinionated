SHEFFIELD, P.J.-OPINION AUTHOR\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Sean Comerford and Sherry Mason (\"Relators\") filed a petition for a writ of mandamus requesting that \"this Court enter a preliminary and then permanent order in mandamus commanding Respondent to rescind\" an August 17, 2017 order that dissolved Relators' notice of lis pendens. Relators had filed the lis pendens as to multiple pieces of real property due to their claim in an underlying suit against Janice Comerford and Enterprise Real Estate, LLC, for, among other things, an equitable lien on the real properties. After this Court received suggestions in support and in opposition, we issued our preliminary writ ordering Respondent \"to immediately set aside\" his order of August 17, 2017, \"which shall have the effect of reinstating [R]elators' notice of lis pendens, pending full resolution of this writ proceeding.\" Over a month later, Respondent complied, reinstating the lis pendens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Our preliminary writ also ordered Respondent to file an answer to Relators' writ petition on or before September 5, 2017, but Respondent did not do so. Proceedings in mandamus in the court of appeals \"shall be as prescribed in Rule 84.22 to Rule 84.26, inclusive, and this Rule 94.\" Rule 94.01.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A preliminary order in mandamus \"shall order the respondent to file an answer within the time fixed by the order.\" Rule 94.05. \"If a preliminary writ is issued,\n   an answer to the petition shall be filed within such time as the court specifies by order.\" Rule 84.24(d). Within that same time specified by the court, \"any party in the underlying matter may file an answer to the petition, either individually or jointly with any other person filing an answer.\" Rule 84.24(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Respondent failed to file an answer to Relators' writ petition within the time fixed by this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Accordingly, we find Respondent to be in default and enter judgment making permanent the preliminary order\" in mandamus.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.

Such damages may not be recovered under this section unless and until the respondent makes a false return.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Relators provide no citation to authority, argument, or analysis for their bare conclusion that failure to file an answer should be treated as the equivalent of filing a false return under the statute.

App. S.D. 2006). Moreover, it appears the purpose of the statute would not be served by equating Respondent's failure to file an answer with the affirmative filing of a false return-Relators only argument as to why they should be awarded damages-because Relators do not claim that Respondent has made any spurious factual allegations that have the effect of placing upon Relators the vexation and expense of disproving false issues of fact (which is the reasoning behind awarding damages for filing a false return).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Scherschel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6841226\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/470/391/\">\n    470 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   401 n.3.
