Duncan raises three claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on appeal: (1) his plea was involuntary because his counsel misled him regarding the sentence he would receive; (2) his counsel was ineffective in failing to call Duncan's treating physician at sentencing in mitigation of a lengthy sentence; and (3) Duncan's concurrent sentences of twelve and three years' imprisonment constituted a de facto death sentence in violation of the Eighth Amendment in light of Duncan's significant health issues. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   According to the probable cause statement filed in the underlying criminal matter, on June 24, 2013, Duncan drove to 5650 Norton Avenue in Jackson County, Missouri, to confront Norris Payne. Upon his arrival, Duncan approached Payne and the two argued. When Payne attempted to get back into his vehicle and leave the confrontation, Duncan pulled out a handgun, fatally shot Payne five times, and then fled the scene. Duncan was subsequently charged, as a prior felony offender, with second-degree murder (\u00a7 565.021) and armed criminal action (\u00a7 571.015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the morning of jury selection for Duncan's trial, Duncan decided to withdraw his plea of not guilty and, instead, enter a guilty plea pursuant to an agreement with the State. In exchange for Duncan's guilty pleas, the State agreed to argue for a maximum sentence of twelve years on the second-degree murder charge to run concurrently with the mandatory minimum of three years on the armed criminal action charge. The State further agreed that Duncan would be allowed to argue for a suspended sentence and probation, as well as remain on house arrest pending sentencing. The prosecutor noted that Duncan's case presented \"a very unusual situation\" and that she had obtained special permission for the terms of the agreement \"based on [Duncan's] health.\" The prosecutor advised the court that Duncan \"has some pretty severe health issues. He does dialysis three times a week and that can be done at the Jackson County jail, but it's somewhat problematic.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the plea hearing, Duncan advised the court that he was \"clear headed\" and wished to withdraw his not-guilty plea and enter a guilty plea. The court specifically noted its understanding that Duncan was \"in complete renal failure.\" The court advised Duncan that the range of punishment\n   for the murder charge was ten-to-thirty years or life imprisonment and that it was three years to life for armed criminal action. The court further advised Duncan that both charges contained mandatory minimums for the amount of time he must serve before becoming parole eligible, and Duncan indicated that he understood. The court specifically discussed with Duncan the effect of the plea agreement on sentencing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   THE COURT: And on the date of sentencing, it will be up to me and me alone as the judge-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   DEFENDANT DUNCAN: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE COURT: -to determine what the sentence will be?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   DEFENDANT DUNCAN: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-17\">\n   THE COURT: If-and what we believe right now is that the most the state can ask for in that sentencing hearing is 12 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   DEFENDANT DUNCAN: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: You may also ask for probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    All rule citations are to the Missouri Supreme Court Rules (2017), unless otherwise noted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    Duncan's brief does not denominate these claims as \"Points Relied On,\" as is required by Rule 84.04(d); nor are they identified by either number (as is customary) or by letter.

Duncan advised the court that he was pleading guilty because he was, in fact, guilty, and he further indicated that no one had forced or coerced his pleas. Duncan denied having any complaints or criticisms of counsel before the court returned, once again, to the issue of sentencing.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    THE COURT: Now, there's going to be a Sentencing Assessment Report.

I understand.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The court accepted Duncan's pleas and set the matter for sentencing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    At the sentencing hearing, the court received victim impact evidence and testimony from Duncan. During his testimony, Duncan attempted to justify his conduct by claiming that he shot Payne only because he feared for his own life. Duncan also relayed that he was in renal failure and had been since 2009. He further testified to the effects of his renal failure on his diet and medications. Duncan's Counsel offered various medical records into evidence to support Duncan's assertions regarding his renal failure.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The court permitted the parties to argue for appropriate punishment, and the State offered the following argument:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    MS. LUNDAK: Yes, Your Honor. The first thing I would like to say to the Court is that the defendant's health is not a mitigating factor. He was healthy enough to go over to start a confrontation with Norris Payne. He was healthy enough to go over there with a loaded gun, and he was healthy enough to shoot him five times in front of a parking lot full of people; adults and children.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    This is an aggravated case. There were five shots fired. Norris Payne was not armed. He was shot as he was trying to get away. The defendant went over there, walked up to the victim's car and confronted him and as he was trying to leave he shot him five times.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    This affects the family greatly, but it also affects the community there in that apartment complex. There was a thirteen-year-old\n    boy who knew the defendant, was friends with his son that made the 911 call. A thirteen[-]year [-]old had to sit there and watch this man shoot somebody five times and he was there on the phone as Norris Payne was dying.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    That entire community was affected so much so that the one and only reason we offered a lid of 12 years in this case is because people are afraid. When they see somebody who comes up and shoots somebody in cold blood five times in front of a crowd of people they are afraid to come to court. There were people that made statements at the time that the state worked diligently to locate. Everybody was afraid. People lied in depositions and came back and then told the truth. And the reason they did is because they were afraid of this man.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    And part of the reason was he was out on bond. And I'm not saying I have evidence that there [were] direct threats from the defendant in this case. But when you see that kind of behavior in this kind of a circumstance an unarmed helpless man trying to leave shot 5 times people are afraid. They don't want to come to the court. They don't want to be labeled as snitches. They know he has family members in the community.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    So this is an aggravated case and the health of the defendant is no defense whatsoever. And the fact that he comes in here and tries to justify what he did, that he went over there for a conversation is just appalling. Instead of getting up there and taking full responsibility he tries to justify his behavior in front of this family who is suffering the loss of a father, a son, a-I mean, Norris Payne has seven children ages five through nineteen. They're never going to see their father again. I think that Ms. Randle put it most powerfully when she described the thoughts and the feelings those kids must have at different events in their lifetimes. I can't say it any better than she did.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    But I am just appalled at the testimony that the defendant gave today. I think that when you look at the SAR report and what the average sentence for this type of case is 22.9 years, it would be ideal for him to get the 12-year sentence. It was a gift from the state not because he deserves it, because of the evidentiary issues that we had. I'm asking for the 12 years and the 3 years. I think that's merited in this case and particularly after this testimony that we heard from the defendant today.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    We've checked with the Department of Corrections. He can get his treatment there. There is not any issue [of] that. He was healthy enough to kill somebody in cold blood. He's healthy enough to go to prison and pay for it.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Duncan's counsel then argued, in part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n    Now, we're not offering Mr. Duncan's health condition as a complete mitigating factor in this case, but this is not an aggravated case. This is a case where you heard his version of the events and he is not saying that he is [abdicating] responsibility in this case. He's accepted responsibility in this case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n    So I generally agree with the state's position except on those issues. It's a tragic tragic event that happened, and I'm very sorry for their family. But Mr. Duncan also has a family who are present in the courtroom. So Mr. Duncan is not here offering his medical condition as some sort of mitigation for a complete mitigation for his actions, Your Honor. We're apprizing you for his medical condition, which is grave and that he's been on dialysis for five years. It is something that the Court really needs to know\n    about and to consider in the sentencing in this case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The court sentenced Duncan to concurrent terms of twelve and three years' imprisonment, denying the requested probation. The court also addressed the effect of Duncan's health on its sentencing decision:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n    And I hope so sincerely, Mr. Duncan, that your health conditions can be taken care of while you are in the Missouri Department of Corrections. But justice has to be served in this case, and the 12 years is what the Court finds to be appropriate, and I know that means 85 percent. It's not lost on me.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n    I've spent a lot of time thinking about it, Mr. Duncan. It's not lost on me at all the significance of what's happening here. But I'm also looking at your background and your record and that comes into play too. But mostly Norris Payne is gone, and he's not here to take care of his children and for that justice has to be served. It's a tragic day, and I don't sit here and do this lightly, but it's appropriate and that's what we're-that's what is going to happen.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The court then addressed Duncan's rights under Rule 24.035 and questioned him about Counsel's services:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    THE COURT: As it relates to Mr. Powell's services and the services of any attorney that's represented you since you were charged in this case, do you have any complaints of any kind with those services?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n    DEFENDANT DUNCAN: No, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n    THE COURT: Do you believe that they have provided adequate counsel?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    DEFENDANT DUNCAN: Yes, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n    THE COURT: And as it relates to those issues, did he refuse to do anything you wanted to do?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    DEFENDANT DUNCAN: No, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n    THE COURT: Did he do anything that you didn't ask him to do that you didn't want him to do?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    DEFENDANT DUNCAN: No, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    THE COURT: You understand this is the day to bring up any complaints if you have such complaints. Do you have any complaints?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    DEFENDANT DUNCAN: No, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Duncan filed a pro se Rule 24.035 motion, and appointed counsel filed an amended motion. In the amended motion, Duncan raised several claims. First, he argued that Counsel was ineffective for failing \"to adequately investigate and present relevant and admissible evidence of Duncan's 'End-Stage Renal Disease ' to the trial, plea, and sentencing Court\" and failing \"to adequately explain to Duncan's treating physician the sentence which Duncan might face for the Murder 2 conviction, prior to asking Duncan's treating physician to draft an explanatory letter.\" Duncan claimed that, had Counsel \"adequately presented this evidence to the Court and Duncan's treating physician, there is a reasonable probability that ... Duncan would have received a lesser sentence.\" Second, Duncan argued that his plea was involuntary and unknowing because Counsel misled Duncan into believing \"that the plea agreement was for a 3-year ACA sentence and a suspended sentence on the Murder 2 charge and credit for time served while on bond (with house arrest monitoring as terms of the bond).\" Duncan claimed that he \"would not have entered a guilty plea if he had understood the full sentence he faced.\" Finally, Duncan argued that his twelve-year sentence for second-degree murder \"constitute[d] Cruel and Unusual Punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and is an illegal sentence in excess of the maximum possible penalty under\n    Missouri law, in that the sentence results in 'torture or a lingering death.' \"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The motion court held an evidentiary hearing, wherein it received testimony from both Duncan and Counsel. Following the hearing, the motion court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law, overruling Duncan's Rule 24.035 motion. Duncan appeals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <strong>\n     Standard of Review\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    \"This Court's review of the denial of a post-conviction motion under Rule 24.035 is limited to a determination of whether the motion court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are clearly erroneous.\"\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.

He argues that the motion court erred in denying his Rule 24.035 motion because: (1) his guilty pleas were unknowing and involuntary insofar as Counsel misled him regarding the severity of punishment and sentence he would receive; (2) Counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to call Dr. Gerald Reid as a mitigation witness at sentencing to testify to the nature of Duncan's medical issues; and (3) Duncan's sentence violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment insofar as Duncan's medical condition, in combination with his potential parole eligibility date, make it likely that he will die in prison. Because the motion court's findings and conclusions are not clearly erroneous, we affirm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Duncan's claim that his plea was involuntary is refuted by the record.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    In his first claim, Duncan argues that his plea was unknowing and involuntary because Counsel misled him regarding the severity of punishment he faced and the sentence he would receive.

Thus, a sentence of twelve years is on the lower end of the spectrum. Additionally, as noted in the Sentencing Assessment Report, the average sentence for Duncan's crime is 22.9 years, considerably greater than the twelve-year sentence he received.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Duncan argues that, due to the serious nature of his renal failure, he will die in prison as a result of this sentence. The entire basis for this assertion is predicated upon several assumptions: (1) Duncan must have a kidney transplant to survive; (2) he would have received a transplant if required to serve only his three-year ACA sentence; (3) he will not receive a transplant while serving his twelve-year murder sentence. Though Duncan offered evidence to support the first of these assumptions, he provided no evidence to support either the second or third. Attached to his amended motion was a letter from Dr. Reid indicating that \"Bryan has previously been activated on the Kidney Transplant List but in his current situation is unable to get a kidney transplant.\" The letter does not explain what it is about his \"current situation\" that precludes the kidney transplant or how those situational factors would differ under a different sentence for second-degree murder. Duncan did not present any evidence regarding qualifications for remaining on the Kidney Transplant List; thus, it is impossible for us to discern whether a different sentence would have produced a different result. It may very well be that he was removed for some other reason, unrelated to the twelve-year sentence.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    E. Bernadette McKinney, William J. Winslade, &amp; T.

Furthermore, offenders may be released or die before reaching the top of the priority list. They may lose eligibility due to threats to compliance (e.g., drug abuse) or for other medical reasons. Under new regulations, transplant centers will be evaluated based on the number of transplants they perform, the survival rate of the organs transplanted after one year, and the survival rate of the organ recipients after one year.
