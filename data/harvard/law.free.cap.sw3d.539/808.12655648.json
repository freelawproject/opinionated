After we affirmed his convictions on direct appeal, Polk filed a motion for postconviction relief under Supreme Court Rule 29.15. Polk's motion argued that his trial counsel was ineffective in multiple respects, and that he was accordingly entitled to a new trial. The circuit court denied relief following an evidentiary hearing. Polk appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In October 2003, Stephen Nolte and his wife moved out of their residence at 5519 North Troost in Kansas City, and into a new home. The Troost residence needed renovations before being advertised for sale. On the evening of March 7, 2004, Nolte was working at the Troost residence. At 9:45 p.m., he told his wife that he would return to their new home shortly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Around midnight, Polk asked his wife\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to drop him off at the Troost residence so he could speak to Nolte about collecting money that Nolte allegedly owed to Polk. Polk's wife dropped him off in front of the Troost residence and then returned home. At approximately 1:15 a.m., Polk phoned his wife and told her that he and Nolte were going into Kansas to buy beer. Within half an hour, Polk phoned his wife again, and asked her to pick him up in Kansas. On the way home, Polk again asked his wife to drop him off at the Troost residence so that he could talk with Nolte. After dropping Polk off at the Troost residence, his wife returned home. An hour later, Polk phoned his wife and asked for another ride home. Shortly after returning home, Polk once again asked his wife to drive him to the Troost residence so he could get Nolte's truck and sell some of the tools that Nolte kept in the bed of the truck. When Polk's wife suggested that Nolte would probably call the police, Polk responded that Nolte \"wouldn't be saying anything to anybody.\" When the couple arrived back at the Troost residence, Polk put on a pair of gloves, entered Nolte's truck, and told his wife to follow him into Kansas, where he removed the license plates from the truck and abandoned it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Later in the morning of March 8, 2004, Nolte was found dead in the Troost residence. He had a gaping sharp force injury to his neck, consistent with a knife attack; additional injuries around his neck consistent with strangulation; and defensive wounds, scrapes, bruises, abrasions, and contusions on his body. The linings of each of Nolte's jeans pockets were pulled out and were stained with blood. Nolte's truck keys and cell phone were missing. Crime scene investigators collected evidence from the Troost residence, including a human hair found in the lining of Nolte's right pants pocket, and cat hairs found in his left pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 10, 2004, two days after Nolte was murdered, Polk asked his wife to drive him to the location where they had left Nolte's truck. Polk told his wife that he \"had some things that he needed to get rid of.\" When they arrived at the truck, Polk placed a bag of clothing in the middle of the road and set it on fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the police interviewed Polk, he admitted that he had seen Nolte on the night of the murder. Polk claimed that he and Nolte had gone into Kansas, where Nolte abandoned him, and that Polk's wife then came to pick him up. Polk stated that he and his wife went directly home and went to sleep. When an investigator asked Polk about cell phone records showing multiple calls between Polk and his wife after 3:00 a.m. on the morning of March 8, Polk replied that they had called each other from opposite ends of their trailer home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By May 2004, Polk and his wife were no longer living together. In October 2004, Polk showed up at his wife's residence and told her that she \"knew too much and wouldn't be going to work that day or probably any other day.\" Polk tried to force his wife into his car, but she resisted. He finally gave up and grabbed her keys, purse, and wallet. A few days later, a state trooper spotted Polk, who was subject to an outstanding arrest warrant for murder. Polk attempted to flee but was apprehended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Polk was charged with first-degree murder\n   (\u00a7 565.020)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and armed criminal action (\u00a7 571.015) for causing Nolte's death. Polk was charged in a separate case with robbery in the second degree (\u00a7 569.030) and domestic assault in the second degree (\u00a7 565.073) for the October 2004 incident involving his wife. The trial court sustained the State's motion and consolidated the two cases for all purposes, including for trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nolte's wife told the police that, shortly before he died, Nolte had planned on firing a person who worked with him, Aaron Larson, and also planned to evict Larson from property that the Noltes owned. Nolte's wife told police that Nolte \" 'informed her that he thought Aaron [Larson] would become angry and if something bad happened to him, to let the police know about Aaron.' \" Although Larson was the police's initial suspect in Nolte's murder, police eliminated him as a suspect after his girlfriend provided him with an alibi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Polk's trial counsel Anthony Cardarella intended to present evidence concerning Larson, and concerning the police's dismissal of Larson as a suspect, as a significant component of Polk's defense. On the first day of trial, however, the State filed a Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   to prohibit Polk from referring to Larson as a suspect in Nolte's murder. The next day, after hearing argument on the motion, the trial court sustained the State's Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine.\n   </em>\n   The court held that the defense could not lay an adequate foundation for the introduction of evidence identifying Larson as an alternate perpetrator, because Polk lacked evidence directly connecting Larson to Nolte's murder. Trial counsel did take various actions to present a defense at trial following the circuit court's grant of the State's Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   , which we describe in greater detail in \u00a7 I of the Discussion which follows. Cardarella did not, however, make an opening statement, cross-examine any of the State's witnesses, present any evidence on Polk's behalf, or make a closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 12, 2009, the jury returned a verdict finding Polk guilty on each of the charges against him. The circuit court sentenced Polk to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for first-degree murder; 100 years' imprisonment for armed criminal action; fifteen years' imprisonment for second-degree robbery; and five years' imprisonment for domestic assault in the second degree. The circuit court ordered that the sentences run consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Polk appealed. Attorney Cardarella, who represented Polk at trial, also represented him on appeal. On appeal, Polk argued that the circuit court abused its discretion by excluding evidence concerning Aaron Larson's potential responsibility for Nolte's murder. Polk also argued that the circuit court had denied him his right to confront the witnesses again him when it permitted a DNA analyst to testify to the results of testing performed by an absent laboratory technician. We rejected Polk's arguments, and affirmed his convictions and sentences in a\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   order accompanied by an unpublished memorandum.\n   <em>\n    State v.

He first argues that trial counsel Anthony Cardarella completely failed to subject the State's case to meaningful adversarial testing at trial. Polk argues that counsel's ineffective representation entitles Polk to a new trial without any showing of the specific ways in which counsel's deficient performance prejudiced Polk. In his second Point, Polk argues in the alternative that he established that Cardarella's deficient performance at trial prejudiced him, because there is a reasonable probability of a different outcome if Cardarella had been more active. In his third Point, Polk argues that trial counsel had a conflict of interest, entitling Polk to a new trial without a showing of prejudice, because Polk had complained before trial about Cardarella's performance to Cardarella's supervisor and to bar disciplinary authorities, creating a hostile relationship between Polk and Cardarella. In his fourth Point, Polk argues that Cardarella was ineffective for failing to lay an adequate foundation for the admission of evidence concerning Aaron Larson's possible responsibility for Nolte's murder. In his fifth Point, Polk argues that Cardarella was ineffective for failing to object to the admission of evidence from a State expert concerning the DNA match between cat hairs found in Nolte's pocket, and hairs collected from cats in Polk's home. Finally, in Point VI, Polk argues that Cardarella was ineffective for failing to cross-examine Polk's wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In his first Point on appeal, Polk contends that he is entitled to a reversal of his conviction because his trial counsel failed to present any defense at trial. Polk argues that his attorney's inaction resulted in a constructive denial of counsel, which constituted structural error entitling him to a new trial without a specific showing of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As a general rule,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A convicted defendant's claim that counsel's assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction or death sentence has two components. First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \"counsel\" guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that\n   the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Cardarella did not make an opening statement, did not cross-examine any of the State's witnesses, did not put on any defense evidence, and made no closing argument. Although Cardarella's performance during trial was certainly lacking and should not be condoned, however, this is not a case in which he \"fail[ed] to contest\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   portion of the prosecution's case.\"\n   <em>\n    Holman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9384454\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/314/837/\">\n    314 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   839 n. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Cardarella took numerous actions during the trial to represent Polk, and to defend his interests. Thus, Cardarella conducted extensive\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   of the jury panel, including after the circuit court's grant of the Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine.\n   </em>\n   He objected to some of the State's proposed strikes of jurors for cause, and argued for his own for-cause strikes. Cardarella also exercised peremptory strikes on Polk's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Cardarella objected twice during the prosecution's opening statement, and moved for a mistrial after the State in opening statement contended that DNA found on the burned clothing was \"consistent with Stephen Nolte.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Over the course of approximately three days of testimony, Cardarella objected on sixteen occasions to evidence or witness examination. In addition, Cardarella conducted\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   examinations of two of the State's feline DNA experts, arguing that one of the experts was relying on a late-disclosed report to support her testimony, and that the other should be excluded because she had failed to timely disclose her laboratory notes, and that she lacked personal knowledge to support part of her testimony (supporting an objection under the Confrontation Clause).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition to moving for a mistrial during the prosecution's opening statement, Polk's trial counsel also moved for a mistrial on three additional occasions during trial: when the prosecution characterized a fragment of burned fabric recovered by police as a \"jacket\"; when the State elicited testimony that Polk ran when a law enforcement officer attempted to arrest him; and when the circuit court ruled that the State's feline DNA witnesses would be permitted to testify, despite counsel's claim that the State had failed to timely disclose discovery materials relevant to their testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Cardarella was also successful in having two members of the jury panel excused, during trial, based on contacts between the jurors and witnesses or potential witnesses in the case. In both instances, the prosecution argued that the jurors' actions did not require their removal; yet the court ordered them to be excused, based on Cardarella's argument, and his\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   of\n   one of the affected jurors. Cardarella also conducted a\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   examination of a third juror, who had been involved in an automobile accident during a break in the trial, to determine whether she remained capable of serving as a juror. After the juror indicated during Cardarella's examination that she had received no serious injuries and was taking no medication, he did not seek further relief with respect to this juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Perhaps most significantly, Cardarella examined six different witnesses, outside the presence of the jury, to develop an extensive offer of proof concerning the admissibility of testimony implicating Aaron Larson in Stephen Nolte's murder. Through these offers of proof, Cardarella established that prior to his murder Nolte was planning on firing and evicting Larson; that Nolte had told his wife that, if something bad happened to him, she should tell the police about Larson; that police were told that Larson may have threatened Nolte; that Larson's neighbors told police that there was blood in Larson's home, and that this blood was recovered by police in executing a search warrant;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   that an anonymous source called the TIPS hotline and stated that Larson had bragged about committing the crime, and described how he had committed it and where he had left Nolte's truck; and that Larson was the police's initial suspect, but that he was eliminated as a suspect based on an uncorroborated alibi provided by his girlfriend. Although this Court ultimately held that these offers of proof were insufficient to satisfy Missouri's standards for admission of evidence of an alternate perpetrator, Cardarella plainly preserved the issue, and supported his position with an appreciable amount of material information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although we do not condone Cardarella's level of activity during Polk's trial, this cannot fairly be characterized as a case in which trial counsel was essentially\n   <em>\n    absent\n   </em>\n   , or in which trial counsel failed to present\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   defense.

As the motion court found, Polk presented no evidence concerning the specific witnesses trial counsel should have called, and what their testimony would have been; what cross-examination questions trial counsel should have asked, and what the witnesses' answers would have been; what specific challenges trial counsel should have made to the DNA evidence; and what effect trial counsel's opening statement and closing argument would have had on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To show\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice, it was not enough for Polk to show that Cardarella had prepared various lines of defense, which he ultimately did not employ. Instead, Polk was required to show what those lines of defense\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   , and that their exercise would have created a reasonable probability of a favorable outcome. Given Polk's argument and evidence, the circuit court did not clearly err in concluding that his ineffective assistance claim failed to lack of evidence of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Point II is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In his third Point, Polk contends that trial counsel was laboring under \"an irreconcilable and actual conflict of interest.\" According to Polk, this conflict of interest establishes that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, without a showing of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that a presumption of prejudice\n   exists if a defendant's counsel has an actual conflict of interest at the time counsel is representing the defendant. The Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Cuyler v.

In those circumstances, counsel breaches the duty of loyalty, perhaps the most basic of counsel's duties. Moreover, it is difficult to measure the precise effect on the defense of representation corrupted by conflicting interests. Given the obligation of counsel to avoid conflicts of interest and the ability of trial courts to make early inquiry in certain situations likely to give rise to conflicts, it is reasonable for the criminal justice system to maintain a fairly rigid rule of presumed prejudice for conflicts of interest. Even so, ... [p]rejudice is presumed only if the defendant demonstrates that counsel \"actively represented conflicting interests\" and that \"an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer's performance.\"\n   <em>\n    Cuyler v.

As the Ninth Circuit explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   in order to succeed on a claim [of ineffective assistance of counsel] based on an alleged conflict, there must be a showing of an actual conflict, namely that a defendant's attorney is representing conflicting interests. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Obviously, the word \"conflict\" is also used in common parlance to describe a personality conflict, an artistic conflict, a family conflict, and many other sorts of antagonism-even war.

Because Polk has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability of a different outcome if his trial counsel had made a fuller offer of proof concerning the Larson evidence, we deny Point IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In his fifth Point, Polk argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Dr. Joy Halverson's testimony concerning the results of the DNA testing of the cat hairs found in Nolte's pocket, and of cat hair samples taken from Polk's cats. Dr. Halverson testified that certain of the cat hairs recovered from the trailer where Polk lived shared the same mitochondrial DNA sequence as the cat hairs found on Nolte. Polk argues that Dr. Halverson's testimony was inadmissible, because her DNA analysis is not generally accepted in the scientific community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Polk's Point Relied On, and his argument, focus solely on counsel's failure to object to the testimony of Dr. Halverson. At trial, however, Dr. Halverson was not the only witness to testify to a comparison of the mitochondrial DNA of the cat hair found on Nolte, and the mitochondrial DNA of cats found in Polk's trailer. Both Dr. Leslie Lyons, and Elizabeth Wictum, testified that the mitochondrial DNA profile derived from the cat hair recovered from Nolte's pocket matched the profiles of two hairs collected from cats at Polk's home. Both Dr. Lyons and Wictum testified that they compared the mitochondrial DNA profile derived from the hair found on Nolte to the mitochondrial DNA profiles of other cats contained in databases they maintained; both witnesses testified that the mitochondrial DNA profile of the hair collected from Nolte-which matched two hairs collected from cats in Polk's home-was \"unique.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Thus, Dr. Lyons and Wictum provided testimony that duplicates the testimony from Dr. Halverson which Polk argues attorney Cardarella should have challenged. In these circumstances, Polk cannot establish that he was prejudiced, even if Cardarella's performance was deficient in failing to challenge Dr. Halverson's testimony. \"Counsel's failure to object to cumulative evidence, even where the trial court would have sustained the objection, does not result in prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Farr v.

In this case, Polk's wife had acknowledged the inconsistencies in her pretrial statements during her direct examination. She testified that she did not immediately give the police a truthful account of what had happened on the night of Nolte's murder, because she was afraid after Polk told her that she would also be charged if she told the police the truth.
