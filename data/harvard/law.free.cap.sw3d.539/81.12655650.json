Burke appeals from the Judgment of the Circuit Court of Clay County, Missouri, denying his Rule 29.15 amended motion for post-conviction relief, based on ineffective assistance of counsel, after an evidentiary hearing. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum of law has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
