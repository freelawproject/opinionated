Porter appeals from the judgment entered by the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, following a jury trial in which he was found guilty of two counts of first-degree child molestation. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum of law has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
