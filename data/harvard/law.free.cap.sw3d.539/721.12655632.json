Blumer, a defendant at the trial court, made the judgment a nullity. Finding the trial court properly set aside the judgment as to James W. Blumer and only issued a judgment as to the remaining parties, we affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. We have, however, provided the parties a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision. The judgment of the motion court is affirmed under Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
