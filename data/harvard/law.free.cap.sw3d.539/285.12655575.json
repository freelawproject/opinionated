TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 46.04(a)(1) &amp; (e) ; \u00a7 12.34(a). The same prior felony conviction used to establish his status as a felon when he possessed the firearm was also alleged in one of two enhancement paragraphs that served to boost his exposure to that of an habitual offender-25 years to life. TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 42.12(d). He received a forty year sentence. For the first time in this initial application for writ of habeas corpus, he alleges that it was impermissible to use to same prior felony conviction twice, first to establish his status as a felon, which is elemental to the offense, and then to enhance the range of punishment to which he was exposed for that offense. The Court today summarily grants relief on the basis of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In my view, the Court grants relief prematurely. I would not grant relief solely on the basis of the improper enhancement itself-at least not without first addressing the question of whether it is appropriate to grant substantive habeas corpus relief on the basis of such a claim when it could have been raised before. Applicant also alleges that his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to object to the impermissible enhancement. I would certainly be amenable to remanding the cause for further fact development with respect to this alternative allegation of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. But because the Court grants relief on the substantive claim and refuses to remand the cause for exploration of the ineffective counsel claim, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Court long ago held that it was improper in a prosecution for possession of a firearm by a felon to use the same prior felony both to establish that element of the offense and to enhance the punishment under separate enhancement provisions in the Penal Code. We did so both under the former penal code and under the current penal code; and, in both cases, we granted appellate relief even though the claim was apparently brought for the first time on appeal, in the absence of any trial objection.\n   <em>\n    Garcia v.
