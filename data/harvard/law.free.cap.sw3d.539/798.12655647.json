We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 17, 2011, Mr. Schieffer was involved in a motor vehicle collision when an automobile driven by Thomas DeCleene (\"Mr. DeCleene\") struck Mr. Schieffer's vehicle from behind. Following the incident, Mr. Schieffer experienced increasingly severe neck, shoulder, and back pain which, despite physical therapy and other treatment, has failed to improve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 26, 2014, Mr. Schieffer filed suit against Mr. DeCleene asserting one count of negligence, and on January 2, 2015, Mr. Schieffer filed a first amended petition adding a claim of loss of consortium by Dinah Schieffer (\"Mrs. Schieffer\"), his wife.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In both the original and first amended petitions, Mr. Schieffer specifically pleaded for the recovery of $28,760.74 in medical expenses that he incurred due to the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   However, on the morning of trial on November 7, 2016, Mr. Schieffer's counsel sought leave from the trial court to file a second amended petition which merely omitted the claim for recovery of medical expenses. The trial court granted leave to\n   amend\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and thereafter considered whether deletion of that claim foreclosed Mr. DeCleene's counsel from presenting, as he planned to do, any evidence of Mr. Schieffer's medical expenses at trial. While Mr. Schieffer's counsel asserted that such evidence would be beyond the scope of the pleadings since he abandoned the claim for the recovery of medical expenses, the trial court determined that such evidence would be admissible for two reasons. First, the trial court explained that under Section 490.715.5 RSMo 2000,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as it was amended in 2005,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   any party may introduce evidence of the value of medical treatment rendered to a party that was reasonable, necessary, and a proximate result of the negligence of any party. Thus, the trial court noted that so long as Mr. DeCleene's counsel explained to the jury that the expenses were the reasonable, necessary, and proximate result of Mr. DeCleene's negligence, it would permit their entry. Second, the trial court determined that the medical expenses were admissible because they \"may very well shed probative legal and factual evidence that the jury could consider as to the extent and nature of the damages given the amount of expenses.\" Following this ruling, the parties commenced with trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, the jury heard testimony that despite Mr. Schieffer's complaints of pain in his back and neck following the November 2011 collision, his first complaints of pain in those areas preceded that collision and followed a separate automobile accident in 2000. Mr. Schieffer admitted that following that 2000 accident, he suffered from a herniated disk and spinal stenosis in his neck as well as low-back pain. Likewise, Mr. Schieffer's first witness and primary care physician, Dr. Glenn Brothers (\"Dr. Brothers\"), testified via videotaped deposition that Mr. Schieffer first informed him of back pain prior to the November 2011 collision, on December 14, 2009. Dr. Brothers noted that Mr. Schieffer reiterated that complaint on October 19, 2011, at which time Mr. Schieffer reported that the pain was worsening. At the time, Dr. Brothers had concluded that Mr. Schieffer's condition was the result of a degenerative joint disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following the November 2011 collision, Mr. Schieffer returned to Dr. Brothers on December 6, 2011 complaining of back and neck pain. Dr. Brothers explained that since that date, despite multiple subsequent visits, physical and neurological exams, a prescription of oxycodone, physical therapy, and a referral to a pain clinic, Mr. Schieffer's condition continued to worsen. Mr. Schieffer, Mrs. Schieffer, and their son Lee Schieffer testified that due to his increasing pain, Mr. Schieffer's abilities have become very limited such that he now has\n   trouble participating in hobbies such as camping and home-building, he cannot complete household chores such as lawn mowing without taking significantly more time to recover, and his capacity to conduct his duties at work has diminished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Given Mr. Schieffer's worsening condition, Dr. Brothers testified that he believed the 2011 collision \"contributed to the progression of his cervical ... deterioration\" and an \"exacerbation of the symptoms in his low[-]back.\" Following a lack of improvement in Mr. Schieffer's condition in the years after the collision, Dr. Brothers referred Mr. Schieffer to a neurosurgeon, Dr. Paul Santiago (\"Dr. Santiago\"), who met with Mr. Schieffer on April 5, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After examining MRI scans of Mr. Schieffer's cervical spine and lumbar spine, which showed that Mr. Schieffer suffered from degenerative spine disease and cervical spondylosis in his neck, Dr. Santiago began to discuss with Mr. Schieffer the possibility of surgery to his cervical spine to stabilize his condition. While initially, Mr. Schieffer sought to move forward with the operation, scheduling it for December of 2013, he ultimately cancelled it, claiming that he was concerned about the risks associated with it including paralysis, bladder and bowel complications, and diminished sexual function. Mr. Schieffer did not meet with Dr. Santiago again until mid-2016 to reschedule the surgery for August 2016, which he also cancelled, repeating his prior concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During Mr. DeCleene's case in chief, his counsel sought to differentiate Mr. Schieffer's neck injuries, which were exacerbated by the November 2011 collision, from his low-back injuries, which purportedly predated the 2011 collision and followed the unrelated automobile accident in 2000. In doing so, Mr. DeCleene's counsel first questioned Mr. Schieffer about his treatment history following the collision, and Mr. Schieffer agreed that he was charged for multiple treatment sessions specifically targeting his low-back and that the medical records for those sessions did not \"say a word about being sent for the neck.\" Thereafter, Mr. DeCleene's counsel attempted to introduce evidence of Mr. Schieffer's prior medical expenses to differentiate the costs expended upon his back and neck. Mr. Schieffer's counsel objected, stating that the medical bills were \"outside the scope of the pleadings\" such that they were \"highly prejudicial and irrelevant and immaterial in this action.\" The trial court, however, reiterated his ruling that the bills were admissible pursuant to Section 490.715.5 so long as Mr. DeCleene's counsel admitted to the jury that the expenses were the result of Mr. DeCleene's negligence. Following this determination, Mr. DeCleene's counsel stated to the jury that \"the amount necessary to fully satisfy [Mr. Schieffer's medical] bills was $14,743.75,\" and that \"these [expenses] were reasonable, necessary, and a proximate result of the negligence of [Mr. DeCleene].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During closing arguments, Mr. Schieffer's counsel suggested a verdict of $300,000, reflecting awards of \"[$]125,000 for past [pain and suffering], [$]125,000 for future [pain and suffering], and some amount for medical.\" Mr. DeCleene's counsel, however, argued that Mr. Schieffer had been receiving treatment for his \"low[-]back the month before the accident, but almost half of the treatment, and that's why I did all this is to show you, that $15,000 [in medical bills] wasn't for the neck. It was fifty-fifty.\" Mr. Schieffer's counsel objected to this statement, noting that, per the trial court's ruling admitting\n   the medical expenses evidence, \"[h]e had to specifically say [Mr. Schieffer's medical expenses were] proximately caused based upon the statute. Now I think he's equivocating on that.\" In response, the trial court noted, simply, \"The jury will be guided by its recollection of the evidence.\" Mr. DeCleene's counsel then asserted that, should the jury find that Mr. Schieffer was entitled to damages, a more appropriate verdict would be $25,000, noting that \"I had to put the evidence on to tell you what all the bills were and then to show you that a lot of it was for the back,\" not his neck. After deliberating, the jury returned a verdict of $25,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Thereafter, Mr. Schieffer filed a motion for a new trial. In relevant part he argued, first, that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the amount he paid in medical expenses since his second amended petition did not plead for such expenses. Second, he argued that since admission of those expenses was conditioned upon Mr. DeCleene's concession that they resulted from his own negligence, he should not have been permitted to assert to the jury that it could award any amount less than $14,743.75. The trial court denied Mr. Schieffer's motion for a new trial. Mr. Schieffer's appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[W]e review the trial court's rulings on the admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Marmaduke v.

In his first point, he argues that the trial court improperly admitted evidence pertaining to his medical bills because such evidence was beyond the scope of the pleadings as set forth in his second amended petition. In Mr. Schieffer's second point, he argues that should we find evidence of his medical expenses admissible under Section 490.715.5, then we should grant a new trial because the trial court erroneously allowed Mr. DeCleene's counsel to argue that a portion of those expenses was not the reasonable, necessary, and proximate result of Mr. DeCleene's negligence, contrary to Section 490.715.5(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Point I\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In Mr. Schieffer's first point, he argues that the trial court abused its discretion in\n   finding evidence of Mr. Schieffer's medical expenses, which amounted to $14,743.75, admissible at trial. He argues that, in filing his second amended petition, which deleted any claim for the recovery of medical expenses, he abandoned any such claim, rendering any evidence of medical expenses outside of the scope of the pleadings. As such, he claims that the jury was improperly permitted to consider evidence that should have been excluded. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Missouri abides by the \"longstanding rule that trial is limited to the scope of the issues raised by the pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    International Div., Inc. v.

This is because, since Mr. Schieffer sought only general damages for pain and suffering as well as the cost of\n   future surgery, which was pleaded, neither his medical expenses nor what his insurance company paid against those bills was put at issue. In fact, Mr. DeCleene himself provided that the reason for introducing the medical bills was not to show that Mr. DeCleene's insurance company paid for a portion of the expenses, but rather to clarify which parts of Mr. Schieffer's body received treatment and at what time relative to the 2011 collision. Neither Mr. Schieffer's second amended petition nor Mr. DeCleene's reasoning for putting on evidence of the bills implicates Section 490.715.5(1), and the trial court abused its discretion in relying upon that provision to admit evidence of Mr. Schieffer's medical expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the alternative, Mr. DeCleene argues, first, the expenses were admissible in that they were relevant to rebut Mr. Schieffer's claim of mental suffering and anguish. Specifically, he asserts that the bills, which amounted to about $15,000.00, would tend to show that Mr. Schieffer did not \"suffer financial hardships created by the cost for treatment, humiliation for being subjected to financial obligations which [Mr. Schieffer] was unprepared to meet, shame[,] fear[,] anxiety and depression, all reasonably associated with difficulties of managing medical costs.\" This argument fails because Mr. Schieffer never made any claim that his mental anguish stemmed from the stress of financial hardship associated with the costs of his treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"A party may introduce evidence to rebut that of his or her adversary, and for this purpose any competent evidence to explain, repel, counteract, or disprove the adversary's proof is admissible.\"\n   <em>\n    Govreau v.

Our review of the record and the testimony at trial, however, shows that none of that testimony made any claim of or reference to anguish, stress, or suffering stemming from the difficulties of managing medical costs. Rather, the testimony showed that the anguish from which Mr. Schieffer suffered resulted from the increased pain he now experiences, the stress of determining whether to move forward with surgery despite potentially serious risks, the inability to maintain his prior hobbies and lifestyle, and the fear that his family members will be required to significantly alter their lives to provide him greater care. In the absence of any testimony tending to show that Mr. Schieffer suffered mental anguish stemming from the difficulty of managing his medical costs, evidence of Mr. Schieffer's medical bills \"does not explain, repel, counteract, or disprove\" any such claim first opened by him.\n   <em>\n    Govreau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9439992\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/73/737/#p743\">\n    73 S.W.3d at 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, Mr. Schieffer's medical expenses were not admissible as rebuttal evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, Mr. DeCleene asserts that Mr. Schieffer tried the issue of his past medical treatment by implied consent in that he was the first to introduce evidence about his physical therapy, pain management treatment, and treatment with Dr. Brothers and Dr. Santiago without objection from Mr. DeCleene. Mr. DeCleene\n   is correct that \"[w]hen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised by the pleadings.\" Rule 55.33(b). However, \"[a] party cannot be said to have implicitly consented to trying an issue outside the pleadings unless the consented to evidence would have been irrelevant to the issues that\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   contained within the pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Fannie Mae v.

Mr. Schieffer did not estimate the cost of his treatment, and as discussed above, Mr. Schieffer presented his testimony not to recover for the cost of his treatment, but rather, to show the nature and extent of his physical pain and mental anguish.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11718261\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/608/105/#p108\">\n    608 S.W.2d at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that plaintiff's testimony, taken in context, showed he introduced statements regarding possible future surgery to show extent of physical and mental anguish, not as avenue for recovery of future medical expenses). Such testimony was clearly relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings, wherein Mr. Schieffer sought only general damages for his pain and suffering after the November 2011 collision. Since the evidence related to issues contained in the pleadings, Mr. Schieffer did not try the issue of his past medical treatment and those related expenses by implied consent, and Mr. DeCleene's response still fails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.
