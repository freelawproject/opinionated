This is the third appeal in this matter, arising from the July 1995 murder of LeBron Gaither, and marks the parties' second visit to this Court. We granted the motion for discretionary review to consider KSP's contention that the Court of Appeals misconstrued Civil Rule (CR) 54.01 and the statutes (Kentucky Revised Statute (KRS) 350.040, KRS 44.130, and KRS 44.140 ) which govern post-judgment interest on Board of Claims' awards. Agreeing with the Court of Appeals that in the circumstances of this case the Estate is entitled to post-judgment interest from the date of the initial Franklin Circuit Court judgment, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     RELEVANT FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We recounted in detail the series of events that culminated in Gaither's death in\n   <em>\n    Gaither v. Justice &amp; Pub. Safety Cabinet,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905513\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/447/628/\">\n    447 S.W.3d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 2014). To recap briefly, while he was still just eighteen years old, Gaither worked as a confidential informant for KSP officers investigating illegal drug trafficking in Marion and Taylor Counties. Gaither's role was to make controlled buys from suspected drug dealers. After Gaither had made several such buys, the detectives for whom he was\n   working had him testify before grand juries in the two counties. Notwithstanding that obvious compromise of Gaither's confidentiality, soon after the grand jury appearances, the detectives had him attempt to initiate a \"buy/bust\" involving one of the dealers against whom Gaither had testified. Unbeknownst to the detectives, that dealer had been tipped off about Gaither's testimony by a member of the Taylor County Grand Jury. Despite the detectives' precautions, during the \"buy/bust,\" the dealer managed to separate Gaither from the police detectives, drove him to an adjoining county, and brutually murdered him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In February 1998, Gaither's Estate, which is administered by Gaither's grandmother, Virginia Gaither, filed a wrongful-death action against KSP in the Board of Claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KRS 44.073. The Estate alleged that Gaither's July 1996 death was the result of negligently performed ministerial acts by certain KSP officers within the course and scope of their employment. As noted above, that claim has had a lengthy procedural history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Board of Claims originally ruled, in accord with\n   <em>\n    Gray v. Commonwealth, Transp. Cabinet, Dep't of Highways,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703424\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/973/61/\">\n    973 S.W.2d 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. App. 1997), that the claim was untimely because it was not filed within one year of Gaither's death. The Estate appealed, and eventually, in\n   <em>\n    Gaither v. Bd. of Claims,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975108\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/161/345/\">\n    161 S.W.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. App. 2004), the Court of Appeals considered an intervening decision by this Court; overruled\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   in light of that decision; and deemed the Estate's claim timely, because it was filed within one year of the personal representative's appointment and within\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   years of the decedent's death. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Board for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On remand, the Board's new proceedings culminated in a December 2009 Final Order upholding the Estate's negligence claim. In the Board's view, the detectives' responsibilities to a confidential informant, at least those responsibilities at issue in this case, were so well established as to constitute \"a series of ministerial duties,\" the breach of which, under the principles of comparative negligence, rendered KSP liable for thirty percent of Gaither's damages. Finding Gaither's damages to have been \"funeral expenses in the amount of $5,573.08 and the total destruction of the decedent's earning capacity ... amount[ing] to $562,433.00,\" for a sum of $568,006.08, the Board concluded that \"the Respondent [KSP] is liable for $168,729.90 in damages to the Claimant [the Estate].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   KSP appealed from that award to the Franklin Circuit Court, and on January 5, 2011, the circuit court entered its Opinion and Order reversing the decision of the Board. After reiterating that the Board of Claims Act waives the Commonwealth's sovereign immunity for the negligent performance by its employees of ministerial duties, KRS 44.073(2), but not for the negligent performance of discretionary duties, KRS 44.073(13)(a), the court held that \"the acts performed by KSP in this case were discretionary, not ministerial,\" with the result that \"KSP is immune from suit under the Board of Claims Act.\" This second dismissal of the Estate's action rendered other issues moot, including (1) KSP's alternative contention that even if KSP was deemed liable, the Board's award should be reduced to reflect the parties' stipulations about damages and (2) the Estate's cross-appeal seeking an award of interests and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Estate again appealed, and although the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal on immunity grounds, the Estate ultimately prevailed in this Court. In\n   <em>\n    Gaither v. Justice &amp; Pub. Safety Cabinet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , we explained that while much of the Gaither-related police work in this case should be deemed discretionary and so outside the purview of the Board of Claims Act, the use of Gaither in the \"buy/bust\" operation after his confidentiality had been utterly compromised was different. This Court held that the Board reasonably found the detectives' decision to send Gaither to yet another \"buy\" to be contrary to \"a clear and certain imperative within the law enforcement professions,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905513\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/447/628/\">\n    447 S.W.3d at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , an imperative so clear and well established as to have become ministerial. We held \"that the duty compelling the performance of a ministerial act need not spring from a specific statute, administrative regulation, or formal policy statement or protocol[, but] ... may flow from common law duties or professional customs and practices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905513\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/447/628/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, we reversed the dismissal of the Estate's action and reinstated the Board's liability finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We agreed with KSP, however, that the Board's award of damages exceeded the parties' stipulations and found \"nothing in the record to support the additional amount.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905513\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/447/628/\">\n    447 S.W.3d at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, noting \"lost earnings,\" as stipulated, of $490,024.00, and proven funeral expenses of $5,573.08, we added the two, applied the thirty percent of fault the Board apportioned to KSP to arrive at $148,787.12 as KSP's share, and instructed the Board on remand to enter a Final Order reflecting an award in that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Board complied with this mandate by Final Order entered in January 2015, and KSP then promptly paid the Estate $148,787.12. Soon thereafter, the Estate moved the circuit court to \"supplement\" the award by granting post-judgment interest on the award amount from the date of the circuit court's initial, take-nothing judgment in favor of KSP,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the January 5, 2011 \"Opinion and Order,\" in which the circuit court erroneously deemed KSP immune from the Estate's suit. According to the Estate's estimate, the interest from that date until the award was paid in February 2015 is about $85,000.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Thurman v. Commonwealth, Transp. Cabinet, Dep't of Highways,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787385\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/981/140/\">\n    981 S.W.2d 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. App. 1998), the circuit court denied the Estate's motion for interest. The post-judgment interest statute ( KRS 360.040 ), the court noted, does not apply to Board awards as such (\n   <em>\n    Thurman\n   </em>\n   ), but only to the judgment entered after the award has been filed in or appealed to the circuit court pursuant to KRS 44.130 or KRS 44.140, respectively. In the Franklin Circuit Court's view, its January 5, 2011 order vacating the award could not be deemed to satisfy either of those statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the third time, the Estate then appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed. The appellate panel acknowledged, as originally entered, the January 2011 take-nothing judgment did not support an award of interest.

As correctly noted by the Court of Appeals, that question was long ago decided in the Estate's favor. In\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth, Dep't of Highways v. Young,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10159731\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/380/239/\">\n    380 S.W.2d 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 1964), the former Court of Appeals upheld an award of post-judgment interest under the Board of Claims Act. The Court noted that although the Act did not make express provision for interest on Board awards, the Act did [and does] allow appeals from the Board to circuit court, and provided [and provides] that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"The court shall enter its findings on the order book as a judgment of the court, and\n   <em>\n    such judgment shall have the same effect\n   </em>\n   and be\n   <em>\n    enforceable as any other judgment of the court in civil causes.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)

Under that statute, Young, whose award was affirmed by both the circuit court and the former Court of Appeals, was entitled to post-judgment interest for the two years of appellate delay between the initial entry of the circuit court judgment confirming the Board award and payment of the award following affirmance on appeal. The General Assembly's waiver of immunity with respect to post-judgment interest under the Board of Claims Act is thus well established. We turn then to the post-judgment interest recoverable by the Estate in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For the relevant time period, the post-judgment interest statute, KRS 360.040, provided in pertinent part that \"[a] judgment shall bear twelve percent (12%) interest compounded annually from its date.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such statutes are widespread.

The statute has historically been read as referring to the \"judgment\" of the trial court.

A trial court may amend its judgment pursuant to a motion, for\n   example, or in accord with the mandate of an appellate court. A trial court's final judgment might be set aside for some reason, and a new judgment entered, with or without new proceedings. Questions arise in such cases as to which judgment-the original, erroneous one or the subsequent, new or modified one-starts the accrual of post-judgment interest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strunk v.

Thus, in accord with the straightforward meaning of KRS 360.040, if a remand results in a new award of damages, post-judgment interest accrues from the date of the new final judgment, rather than that of the original, but superseded, erroneous judgment.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaiser Aluminum,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5295\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/827/#p835\">\n    494 U.S. at 835-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5295\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/827/#p835\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that, where the trial court granted a new trial as to damages, post-judgment interest began to accrue following the new trial, not as of the first one.

Since separately, however, each type of correction results in post-judgment interest beginning to accrue on the date of the initial erroneous judgment, we are convinced that the Court of Appeals correctly held that the two corrections together also call for post-judgment interest from the date of the initial, albeit erroneous, trial court judgment,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   January 5, 2011,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Against this conclusion, KSP contends that the Board's 2009 award in favor of the Estate was not a \"judgment\" for the purposes of the post-judgment interest statute, and further notes that upon KSP's appeal from the Board award the trial court's January 2011 judgment did not confirm the award in any way or \"enter\" it, as seemingly contemplated by KRS 44.130 and KRS 44.140. Instead, the trial court vacated the award and dismissed the Estate's claim as barred by immunity. KSP then poses a rhetorical question: Can interest accrue on a judgment that was adverse to the claimant? Insisting that the answer is an obvious \"no,\" KSP concludes that the Court of Appeals erred by ruling otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Of course, the real question is not quite the one KSP asks. The real question, rather, is whether interest can accrue on a judgment adverse to the claimant where that judgment is ultimately determined to have been erroneous and, had it been correct, both could and should have been in favor of the claimant? That question is another way of asking which party, the wrongdoer (tortfeasor here) or the victim, is to bear the cost of delay occasioned by the trial court's error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   KSP maintains that, inasmuch as it was neither responsible for the error nor guilty of any sort of bad faith in raising the issues it raised during the course of these proceedings, it would be unfair to saddle it with interest for what was, after all, the Estate's appeal. As the cases discussed above indicate, however, a majority of courts have decided that a trial court's erroneous setting aside of an award (jury verdict, arbitrator's award, administrative recovery), should not result in a transfer of monies (by diminishing the value of the award) from a victim to an injurer. Contrary to KSP's understanding, in other words, the purpose of the post-judgment interest statute, as we explained in\n   <em>\n    Emberton v. GMRI,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300031\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/299/565/#p583\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   is not to penalize judgment debtors for undue delay; the purpose rather is to prevent delay from penalizing judgment creditors. Since, in cases such as this one, \"[c]alculating interest from the date of the second [remand] judgment would penalize [the plaintiff] for the trial judge's error,\"\n   <em>\n    DeLong Equip. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878909\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/1340/#p1341\">\n    997 F.2d at 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , interest is to be calculated instead, as the Court of Appeals held, from the initial judgment, even though that judgment was mistakenly adverse to the Estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As a last gasp, KSP suggests that this result is contrary somehow to the general rule that waivers of immunity are to be construed narrowly. It is not. KRS Chapter 44, the Board of Claims Act, provides, of course, for a limited waiver of the Commonwealth's immunity from tort claims. As noted above, within that chapter, KRS 44.140(5) states with respect to Board awards challenged on appeal to circuit\n   court that \"[t]he court shall enter its findings on the order book as a judgment of the court, and such judgment shall have the same effect and be enforceable as any other judgment of the court in civil causes.\" This directive to treat a judgment premised on a Board of Claims' award as any other judgment of a Kentucky circuit court is crystal clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As noted in considerable detail above, for non-state-actor defendants who find themselves in circumstances like those now confronting KSP-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   a verdict and damages' award for the plaintiff, the trial court's erroneous vacation of that award, and an appellate court's reinstatement of it-the post-judgment interest statute, KRS 360.040, makes such defendants liable for post-judgment interest from the date of the initial, erroneous trial court judgment, not the date of the remand judgment. Under the above-quoted section of the Board of Claims Act, circuit court judgments erroneously vacating Board awards \"have the same effect,\" including that of ringing the post-judgment interest bell. While KSP is correct that we are to construe narrowly the waiver provisions of the Board of Claims Act, that rule does not entail that we ignore the Act's plain terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In sum, the Court of Appeals correctly read the Board of Claims Act as according circuit court judgments entered pursuant to the Act the same treatment under the post-judgment interest statute as ordinary civil judgments. Post-judgment interest accrues from entry of an ordinary judgment that erroneously vacates a damage award or erroneously calculates such an award, where an appellate court can mandate correction of the error without resort to additional proceedings. The Court of Appeals appropriately held that post-judgment interest began to accrue from the circuit court's initial, albeit erroneous, January 5, 2011 judgment. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the matter to the Franklin Circuit Court for entry of an appropriate order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   All sitting.

Because the post-judgment interest statute, KRS 360.040, provides for annual compounding, the Estate's claim has increased some since then.
