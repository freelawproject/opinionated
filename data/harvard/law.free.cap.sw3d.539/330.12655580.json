After filing its petition, the State filed a traditional motion for summary judgment against White Lion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c). In addition, the State requested that the district court sever the claims against Morello from those against White Lion in the event that the district court granted the State's motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   R. 41 (allowing for severance of claims). Ultimately, the district court granted the State's motion for summary judgment and motion to sever. Subsequently, the State filed a traditional motion for summary judgment against Morello. After reviewing the State's motion and Morello's response and after convening a hearing, the district court granted the State's motion for summary judgment and ordered Morello to pay $367,250.00 in civil penalties. Following that ruling, Morello filed a motion for new trial, and the district court denied the motion. Morello appeals the district court's judgment granting the State's motion for summary judgment and the district court's order denying his motion for new trial. We will reverse the district court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The property at issue in this case was originally owned by Vision Metals, Inc.

Several years later, Vision declared bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Vision declared bankruptcy, Morello bid on the property at an auction and entered into an agreement to purchase the property. A little over a month later, Morello assigned his rights to purchase the property to White Lion, which is a limited liability company that Morello formed. When the closing occurred after the assignment, Vision conveyed all of its interest in the property to White Lion. Subsequent to the closing, the Commission transferred the hazardous-waste permit and the compliance plan to White Lion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A few years after the permit and property were transferred to White Lion, the State, on behalf of the Commission, filed a suit against White Lion alleging that White Lion did not adhere to the requirements of the compliance plan, including the financial-assurance requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Later, the State amended its petition and sought to hold Morello individually liable as well. In its amended petition, the State noted that White Lion \"is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Texas\" and that \"Morello is the manager and operator of White Lion.\" Further, the State alleged that an \"owner or operator of\n   a facility must continue corrective action measures for the duration of the compliance period\" and must submit \"written reports detailing the effectiveness of the corrective action program,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20335.166\">\n    30 Tex.

In addition, the State alleged that the compliance plan required \"Morello and White Lion to\" \"set and record the flow rate of each recovery well each week,\" \"inspect all aboveground collection system pipes weekly,\" \"sample each well during the first and third quarters of each year,\" \"complete data analysis within sixty days of sampling,\" \"repair or propose to replace broken wells within 90 days of identifying the problem,\" \"submit reports on January 21 and July 21 of each year summarizing the status of the corrective action plan,\" and \"provide $574,000 in financial assurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Moreover, the State urged that the Commission sent \"Morello and White Lion a notice of violation letter for failing to provide financial assurance,\" conducted an investigation of the property, and discovered that \"Morello and White Lion\" \"had not prepared or submitted any reports regarding groundwater monitoring activities\"; \"had not conducted semiannual groundwater sampling and analysis\"; \"failed to repair or propose to replace the broken recovery wells\"; \"were not operating the complete, required corrective action system\"; \"failed to record the weekly flow rate of each recovery well\"; \"failed to conduct inspections of the aboveground collection system pipes on a weekly basis\"; and \"failed to notify the [Commission] of any periods of corrective action system shutdown.\" The State also asserted that \"Morello and While Lion are required to perform the duties set out in the compliance plan\" and were required to begin performing the duties when the Commission \"transferred [the] hazardous waste permit ... and compliance plan ... to White Lion\" but that neither of them \"ever performed\" those duties and were, therefore, \"in continuous daily violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20335.166\">\n    30 Tex.

In addition, the State asked the district court to sever its claims against Morello, and the district court granted the request. After the district court granted the State's motions, the State filed a motion for summary judgment against Morello. In its motion, the State urged that its attached evidence demonstrated that Morello \"has ensured that nothing would be done to comply with the terms, conditions, and limitations set forth in the Compliance Plan\" and failed to provide the required financial assurance. After convening a hearing on the motion and reviewing the various responsive filings, the district court granted the State's motion for summary judgment. Following that ruling, Morello filed a motion for new trial. Ultimately, the district court denied\n   Morello's motion.

When challenging the granting of the State's motion for summary judgment in his first issue, Morello highlights that the State acknowledged in its amended petition that White Lion \"is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Texas\" and that \"Morello is the manager and operator of White Lion.\" In light of the fact that White Lion is a limited liability company, Morello argues that he cannot be held individually liable for the conduct at issue because the State did not attempt to pierce the veil of the company and because the State has not asserted that his alleged misconduct falls within the type of conduct for which an agent of a limited liability company may be held individually liable for his actions taken on behalf of the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although the issue of individual liability in the context of corporate law has been more clearly established, the issue as it pertains to limited liability companies is less settled. For corporations, it is a \"bedrock principle of corporate law ... that an individual can incorporate a business and thereby normally shield himself from personal liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Willis v.
