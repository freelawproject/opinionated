Johnson (\"Johnson\") appeals from the motion court's denial of his Rule 29.15 motion following an evidentiary hearing. Johnson was convicted on one count of first-degree murder, one count of first-degree robbery, and two counts of armed criminal action. In his sole point on appeal, Johnson contends that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain a jury instruction patterned after MAI-CR 3d 310.06. Finding that defense counsel's conduct did not prejudice Johnson, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find no error of law. No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum opinion for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in accordance with Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
