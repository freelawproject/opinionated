Other grounds of error are urged upon us which we do not find necessary to pass upon at this time. All concur [Dowling, J., in result only], except Taylor and MeCurn, JJ., who dissent and vote for affirmance. (The judgment is for defendant for no cause of action in an action for damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, alleged to have resulted by reason of an explosion of gasoline tanks. The order denies a motion for a new trial.) Present \u2014 Cunningham, P. J., Taylor, Dowling, Harris and MeCurn, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
