Relying wholly upon circumstantial evidence, plaintiff attempted to establish that the fall of the deceased down a staircase in the building where he resided was caused by a defective step. The deceased sustained a fracture of the skull and died the next day. At the hospital to which he had been removed on the night of the accident, it was found that he was <em>\u201c </em>alcoholic.\u201d A chemical analysis of the brain made at the autopsy showed <em>\u201c </em>Ethyl alcohol present in fair amount 2 plus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">Though circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to support an inference of causation or of negligence, or both <em>(Dillon </em>v. <em>Rockaway Beach Hospital, </em>284 N. Y. 176, 179; <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Liberty Bank of Buffalo, </em>278 N. Y. 1; <em>White </em>v. <em>Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., </em>220 N. Y. 131, 136), upon the record here the jury\u2019s finding that there was a causal connection between the alleged defective condition of the stairs and the deceased\u2019s fall is contrary to the weight of the credible evidence. The judgment should, accordingly, be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Martin, P. J., Untermyer and Cohn, JJ., concur; Townley and Dore, JJ., dissent and vote to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">Judgment reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
