The IJ\u2019s denial of Mansi\u2019s requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) were grounded in an adverse credibility finding. The BIA concluded that this finding was not clearly erroneous and that Mansi had not shown entitlement to the requested relief. The BIA also concluded that Mansi had not shown error in connection with the IJ\u2019s decisions to exclude certain evidence and to dispense with closing arguments. Finally, the BIA denied his motion to remand, which was grounded in his challenge to the disputed evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Now, Mansi insists that he was credible and proved his entitlement to relief. We review the legal conclusions of the BIA and IJ de novo, and their factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 594 (5th Cir.2006). Reversal under the latter standard is not warranted absent a showing \u201cnot only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence compels it.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Among the findings that we review for substantial evidence are the factual conclusions that an alien is not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005). We will defer to an immigration court\u2019s credibility determination \u201cunless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable factfinder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 538 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">Our review of the record and the appellate briefs shows that this standard has not been met. Both the IJ and the BIA noted several material discrepancies betwixt Mansi\u2019s testimony and his application for relief. The adverse credibility determination in this case is thus supported by specific reasons derived from the record. The evidence does not compel a conclusion that no reasonable factfinder could have found Mansi not to be credible. <em>See Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538; <em>Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134. To the extent Mansi argues otherwise, this argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">Likewise unavailing are Mansi\u2019s arguments concerning evidentiary rulings, closing arguments, and his motion to remand. When reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to remand, we apply \u201ca highly deferential abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006). The remand was grounded in Mansi\u2019s contention that certain evidence should not have been excluded and that closing arguments should have been permitted. \u201cThe test for admissibility of evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>dence in a deportation proceeding is whether the evidence is probative and whether its use is fundamentally fair so as not to deprive the alien of due process of law.\u201d <em>Bustos-Torres v. INS, </em>898 F.2d 1058, 1055 (5th Cir.1990); <em>see also Bouchikhi v. Holder, </em>676 F.3d 173, 180 (5th Cir. 2012). Mansi has not shown substantial prejudice arising from the challenged rulings. <em>See Bouchikhi, </em>676 F.3d at 180. Furthermore, the exclusion of two documents was permissible under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.31(c), which provides that the IJ \u201cmay set and extend time limits for the filing of applications and related documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">In sum, Mansi has not shown that the BIA\u2019s rulings were in error, nor has he shown that the BIA abused its discretion by denying him a remand. Consequently, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
