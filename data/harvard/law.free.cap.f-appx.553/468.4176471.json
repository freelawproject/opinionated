He maintains that the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) when it enhanced his base offense level by 16 levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Because Arellano forfeited this claim of error by not urging it in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). To succeed on plain error review, Arellano must show (1) a forfeited error (2) that is clear or obvious and (3) that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). On such a showing, we may exercise our discretion \u201cto remedy the error ... if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, bracketing, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">A Georgia state court convicted Arellano in March 2011 for possessing cocaine with intent to distribute. He was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, with one year to be served in custody and four years on probation. Arellano was removed to Mexico in November 2011, but he crossed the border from Mexico into the United States on September 23, 2012, without permission from the Attorney General. Georgia revoked Arellano\u2019s probation in October 2012 and imposed a 180-day prison term. The district court adopted the presentence report, which reasoned that Arellano\u2019s Georgia sentence exceeded 13 months and consequently that the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) was in order, given that Arellano received criminal history points for the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Because no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause resulted, the district court was correct to apply the 2012 version of the Sentencing Guidelines manual. <em>See United States v. Rodarte-Vasquez, </em>488 F.3d 316, 322 (5th Cir.2007). However, the district court misinterpreted that version, which contained a change made by Amendment 764 that clarified how the length of a prior drug trafficking sentence is to be calculated for \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) enhancement purposes. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, Supp. to Appendix C, Amendment 764, pp. 11-12 (Nov. 1, 2012). Under the amendment, \u201cthe term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation [of a term of probation] counts toward the calculation of the offense level in \u00a7 2L1.2 only if it was imposed before the defendant was deported or unlawfully remained in the United States.\u201d Amendment 764, comment.; <em>see </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 comment. (n.l(B)(vii)) (effective November 1, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">The 180-day addition to the Georgia prison sentence did not occur until probation was revoked in October 2012, after Arellano\u2019s 2011 removal. Therefore, under the 2012 version of the Guidelines, the term of imprisonment imposed upon that revocation was not includable when calculating Arellano\u2019s sentence for the 2011 Georgia offense used for enhancing the sentence in the instant case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 comment. (n.l(B)(vii)). Consequently, the district court committed plain error when it misinterpreted the Guideline and enhanced Arellano\u2019s base offense level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>by 16 levels under \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1) (A) (i) rather than by 12 levels under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B). <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>see also United States v. Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>529 F.3d 293, 298 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">But for that error, Arellano\u2019s offense level would have been 17 and the sentencing guidelines range would have been 37 to 46 months, significantly lower than the 57-month sentence imposed. The error therefore affected Arellano\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 716 (5th Cir.2007). Given that the district court\u2019s error affected his sentence, Arellano has shown that the error \u201cseriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
