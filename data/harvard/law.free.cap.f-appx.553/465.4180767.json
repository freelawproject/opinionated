The district court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because Russell\u2019s causes of action effectively asked the district court to review the validity of a state-court order of demolition.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">On appeal, Russell does not address the propriety of the district court\u2019s finding that his claims were barred under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, and he does not otherwise present any argument regarding the district court\u2019s conclusion that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Instead, he alleges causes of action contesting the state court proceedings that resulted in the demolition order. When an appellant, like Russell, fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if he did not appeal that issue. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Russell has not raised any arguments challenging the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, any such argument is abandoned. <em>See id. </em>In any event, as Russell\u2019s claims arise from the state court proceedings and are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court\u2019s order of demolition, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review his claims under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 291, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005); <em>Davis v. Bayless, </em>70 F.3d 367, 375 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b492-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
