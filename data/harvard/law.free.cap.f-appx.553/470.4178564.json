As he did at sentencing, he challenges the reasonableness of the sentence, claiming it is greater than necessary to effectuate sentencing goals, overstates the seriousness of his supervised-release violations, and does not reflect his personal circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-22\">Revocation sentences are reviewed under a deferential \u201cplainly unreasonable standard, in a two-step process\u201d. <em>United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 326 (5th Cir.2013) (citing <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011)). First considered is whether the district court procedurally erred; then, the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed. <em>Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-23\">Ramirez does not claim procedural error. For the second step, a preserved objection to a sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness is reviewed \u201cfor an abuse of discretion, examining the totality of the circumstances\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 332 (citation omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ted). \u201cA sentence is substantively unreasonable if it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (8) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Even if we determine a revocation sentence is unreasonable, we may reverse only if \u201cthe error was obvious under existing law\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 326 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Ramirez\u2019 two-year sentence equaled the maximum statutory term of imprisonment the district court could have imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 558(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). We often uphold statutory-maximum sentences under the above-described plainly-unreasonable standard. <em>See Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The district court considered the factors Ramirez believes merit a lesser sentence. Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he district court made clear its belief that, in [the] light of [Ramirez\u2019] particular history [and characteristics], only a relatively severe, incarcerative revocation sentence was sufficient punishment\u201d. <em>Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 333. Ramirez\u2019 disagreement with the court\u2019s weighing of the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors does not demonstrate the imposed sentence was an abuse of discretion. The court was permitted to use its judgment in weighing the applicable factors, and this court may not reweigh them. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 56-60, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
