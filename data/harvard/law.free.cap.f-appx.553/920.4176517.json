The BIA concluded that, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c), Richards was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status because he was an alien crewman. On appeal, Richards argues that he is not an alien crewman and that he was lawfully admitted to the United States, as required for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). After review, we deny Richards\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>We have jurisdiction to review non-discretionary legal determinations as to statutory eligibility for discretionary relief. <em>Alvarado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>610 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir.2010). We review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>including the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretations. <em>De Sandoval v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir. 2006). We give Chevron<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> deference, where appropriate, to single judge, non-prece-dential BIA decisions where the BIA relied upon its own precedential opinion. <em>See Quinchia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>552 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2008) (distinguishing cases where the agency is entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference where it relied on a federal court\u2019s or the BIA\u2019s precedential opinion from those where a single judge, non-prec-edential BIA opinion is not entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference where it does not rely on existing BIA or federal court precedent). We must defer to the BIA\u2019s construction of a statute that it administers if it is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The Attorney General, at his discretion, may adjust the status of an alien who was inspected and admitted into the United States to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien meets certain requirements. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). Alien crewmen, however, are statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c). The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) defines a \u201ccrewman\u201d as \u201ca person serving in any capacity on board a vessel or aircraft.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(10). Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(b)(2), \u201cany alien who, on arrival in the United States, was serving in any capacity on board a vessel or aircraft or was destined to join a vessel or aircraft in the United States to serve in any capacity thereon,\u201d is ineligible for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">When determining whether an alien qualifies as a crewman, the BIA examines the alien\u2019s visa and the circumstances surrounding his entry into the United States. <em>Matter of G-D-M-, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 82, 85 (BIA 2009). If an \u201calien was issued a visa as a crewman and entered the United States in pursuit of his occupation as a seaman, then he is to be regarded as an alien crewman.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85. Upon entry as a crewman, the alien cannot avoid the limitations associated -with that status. <em>Id. </em>at 84-85. The pivotal issue in deciding whether an alien qualifies as a crewman is whether the alien entered the United States \u201cin pursuit of his calling as a seaman.\u201d <em>Parzagonis v. INS, </em>747 F.2d 1389, 1390 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">In <em>Matter of G-D-M-, </em>a three judge panel of the BIA determined that an alien who entered the United States on a Cl/D visa and was issued an 1-94 Form that classified him as a Cl nonimmigrant in transit, qualified as a crewman because he entered the United States with the intent to work as a crewman, even though he never found employment as a crewman. <em>See </em>25 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 83-85. The alien entered the United States by reason of his occupation as a seaman, regardless of whether he had prior training or experience as a crewman, or had located future employment on a specific vessel. <em>Id. </em>at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">The BIA\u2019s judgment is entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference because, although it issued a single judge, non-precedential opinion, the BIA relied upon <em>Matter of G-D-M-, </em>which is a precedential opinion. <em>See Quinchia, </em>552 F.3d at 1258. Accordingly, we will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the INA if it is reasonable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The BIA\u2019s conclusion that Richards was a crewman was a reasonable construction of the INA. Richards obtained a Cl/D visa in order to obtain admission to the United States. He testified he had previously been employed by Carnival Cruise Lines, he had been given a Cl visa that would allow him to work for Carnival Cruise Lines, and the documentation he presented upon arrival in the United States included a letter from Carnival Cruise Lines. Furthermore, Richards testified his intent in coming to the United States in 2001 was to join a ship. Based on these considerations, Richards entered the United States in pursuit of his calling as a seaman, and was therefore, an alien crewman. <em>See Parzagonis, </em>747 F.2d at 1390; <em>Matter of G-D-M, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 84. Because the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Richards was a crewman constituted a reasonable construction of the INA, this Court must defer to it. <em>See Quinchia, </em>552 F.3d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">With respect to Richards\u2019 argument he is eligible for adjustment of status because he was admitted to the United States as required under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a), no one disputes that he meets the admission requirement under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). However 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) does not apply to alien crewman. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c). As an alien crewman, Richards is not eligible for adjustment of status. Therefore, the BIA did not err in dismissing Richards\u2019 appeal. Accordingly, we deny Richards\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-6\">. <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def.
