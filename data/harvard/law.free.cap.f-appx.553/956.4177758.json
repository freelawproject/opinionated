On appeal, Hudson argues that Amendment 750 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines entitles him to a modified sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He also argues that his designation as a career offender violated the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010(FSA), as well as the Fifth and Eighth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-17\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). In 2010, the FSA raised the amount of crack cocaine required to trigger the relevant mandatory minimum imprisonment terms. <em>See </em>Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, \u00a7 2(a), 124 Stat. 2372. In order to account for these statutory changes in crack cocaine sentencing, Amendment 750 revised the drug quantity table and lowered the base offense levels for crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 750, reason for amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-18\">Under \u00a7 3582, district courts are permitted to modify a term of imprisonment when a defendant \u201chas been sentenced ... based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-19\">Here, Hudson\u2019s sentencing range was determined by his status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Since Amendment 750, which revised the drug quantity tables found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), \u201cdoes not alter the sentencing range upon which\u201d Hudson\u2019s sentence was based, the district court lacked the authority to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id.; see United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376-77 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (holding that the district court lacked authority to grant a \u00a7 3582(c) motion based on Amendment 750 where a sentencing range was determined by the defendant\u2019s status as a career offender).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>Similarly, the FSA does not entitle Hudson to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). First, his sentence was imposed in 2009, prior to the date the FSA took effect. <em>See United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013) (noting that the FSA does not apply to defendants who were sentenced before the Act was enacted on August 3, 2010). Second, even if Hudson had been sentenced after the enactment date, the FSA would not give Hudson grounds for reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because the FSA is \u201cnot a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Lastly, Hudson\u2019s constitutional arguments are non justiciable under \u00a7 3582. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that this Court lacks jurisdiction under \u00a7 3582(c) to hear \u201cextraneous resen-tencing issues,\u201d including those involving constitutional claims which should instead be brought under \u00a7 2255). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
