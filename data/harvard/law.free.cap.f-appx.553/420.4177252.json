California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Martinez has filed a response. To the extent that Martinez\u2019s response reflects that he wishes to raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Martinez\u2019s claims; such claims generally are not resolved on direct appeal when they have not been developed in the district court. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006). We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Martinez\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
