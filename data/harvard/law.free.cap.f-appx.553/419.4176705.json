In his petition, Adesoye alleged that the district court im-permissibly relied on proffered information on intended loss to increase his sentence. According to Adesoye, his claims were properly brought under \u00a7 2241 via the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because he was asserting a gateway claim of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">A federal prisoner can proceed via \u00a7 2241 only if he shows that relief under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, which in turn requires him to demonstrate under the savings clause. This requires advancing \u201ca claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, direct appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Adesoye has failed to make the requisite showing. He has also not shown that his claim of actual innocence provides an exception to the requirement that a petitioner first satisfy the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 in order to challenge his conviction and sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition. Therefore, the district court did not err in concluding that Ade-soye could not bring his claims in a \u00a7 2241 petition or in not conducting a hearing. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830-31 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also Ellis v. Lynaugh, </em>873 F.2d 830, 840 (5th Cir.1989). The district court also did not err in concluding that, to the extent Adesoye\u2019s petition could be construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, the court lacked jurisdiction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(a); <em>Solsona v. Warden, F.C.I., </em>821 F.2d 1129, 1132 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
