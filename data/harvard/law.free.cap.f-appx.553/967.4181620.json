On appeal, Coronell argues that the five-year statute of limitations applicable to the rescission of lawful permanent resident status under Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7 246(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1256(a), precludes the revocation of her naturalized U.S. citizenship. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-19\">Coronell, a native of Colombia, first entered the United States on January 19, 1992 with her husband, Alvaro De La Hoz. The couple joined a church in Hialeah, Florida in 1997 and quickly learned from other members that Marcial Cordero claimed that he could secure immigrant visas and permanent resident status for church members. The couple sought out Cordero\u2019s services. Based on false claims that De La Hoz was a religious worker, Cordero secured permanent resident status for both De La Hoz and Coronell. Coronell\u2019s status as a permanent resident made her eligible for naturalization as a U.S. citizen, <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 316(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a), which she was granted when she took the oath of allegiance on December 19, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-20\">Shortly thereafter, the government accused Cordero of filing more than two hundred fraudulent applications for immigrant visas and adjustment of status. Co-ronell\u2019s application was among those fraudulent filings. As a result, the United States filed a complaint to revoke Coro-nell\u2019s naturalized citizenship pursuant to INA \u00a7 340(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451(a). The government moved for summary judgment, arguing that the undisputed facts established that Coronell failed to lawfully obtain permanent resident status, a prerequisite for naturalization under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429. The district court agreed with the government\u2019s position and granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-21\">On appeal, Coronell challenges neither the district court\u2019s determination that her permanent resident status was unlawfully obtained nor the determination that lawful permanent resident status is a prerequisite to naturalization. Rather, she argues for the first time on appeal that INA \u00a7 246(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1256(a), creates a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>five-year statute of limitations applicable to denaturalization complaints premised on the invalidity of the underlying grant of permanent resident status. \u201cThis Court has repeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\u201d <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). While we recognize that the requirement that a litigant present an argument to the district court before raising it on appeal is not a jurisdictional one, and so we <em>\u201cmay </em>choose\u201d to hear an otherwise waived argument, <em>id. </em>at 1332, we decline to exercise that discretion here. Moreover, Coronell has not argued, nor do we conclude based on our independent review, that this case presents one of the \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances in which we have permitted issues to be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">For this reason, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
