He contends that the district court plainly erred when it enhanced his sentence based on a finding that his prior New York convictions for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree qualified as drug trafficking offenses for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)\u00ae. Specifically, Vasquez-Alvarado argues that the New York statute under which he was convicted is broader than the drug trafficking offense definition set forth in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 because it criminalizes the sale of substances that are not listed as controlled substances under federal law. Because the state court documents were insufficient to narrow his convictions to qualifying drug trafficking offenses, he argues that the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) enhancement was a clear and obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-21\">Vasquez-Alvarado did not object to the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) enhancement on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>specific grounds raised in the instant appeal. Our review therefore is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 855, 358 (5th Cir.2005). To show plain error, Vasquez-Alvarado must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The state court documents provide that on August 2, 2000, Vasquez-Alvarado was convicted of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.39. The Government contends that at the time of Vasquez-Alvarado\u2019s convictions, the 23 substances identified in his opening brief were covered by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, <em>et seq. </em>Vasquez-Alvarado concedes in his reply brief that the Government is correct. He has therefore failed to demonstrate that \u00a7 220.39 is broader than the drug trafficking offense definition set forth in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 or that the district court committed a clear or obvious error when it enhanced his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b478-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
