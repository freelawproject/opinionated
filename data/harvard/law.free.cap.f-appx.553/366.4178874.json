(\u201cStar-Tex\u201d) and Mariana Esquivel (\u201cEsquivel\u201d) \u2014 and Defendant-Appellee-Granite State Insurance Co. (\u201cGranite State\u201d) \u2014 moved for summary judgment before the magistrate judge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on what is, at base, an insurance-coverage dispute. The magistrate judge granted Granite State\u2019s motion and denied Star-Tex and Esquivel\u2019s motion. Star-Tex and Esquivel have now appealed. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">The lawsuit underlying this appeal is a declaratory action seeking to determine insurance coverage. The lawsuit underlying that action is a tort suit brought by Eddie Siegmund (\u201cSiegmund\u201d) in Texas state court against Star-Tex and Esquivel. Siegmund alleges that he was injured in an automobile collision caused by Esquivel and based on negligence, negligent-hiring, and respondeat superior theories of liability. Specifically, Siegmund alleged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\">[o]n or about June 29, 2010, [Sieg-mund] was seriously injured in an automobile collision caused by the negligence of Defendant Esquivel, an employee of Star-Tex Resources. Defendant Es-quivel was under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs at the time of the collision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">Star-Tex is a staffing company based in Austin, Texas that sends its employees to other companies for temporary-staffing purposes. As relevant here, Star-Tex contracted with a company called Auto Auction, which buys and sells cars, to supply temporary staff. Esquivel was staffed to Auto Auction when Siegmund, an Auto Auction employee, was struck and injured by a vehicle owned by Auto Auction while he was walking in the Auto Auction lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">When Star-Tex and Esquivel were notified of Siegmund\u2019s lawsuit, they requested defense from Granite State, Star-Tex\u2019s insurer. The plaintiffs sent Granite State a General Liability Notice of Occurrence/Claim, which stated that \u201cMariana Esquivel (an employee of Star-Tex) put car in motion pinning Eddie Siegmund between t[w]o cars causing injury.\u201d The no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>tice further stated that \u201cMariana[] Es-quivel was the Star-Tex employee driving the car. She tested positive for drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">On evaluating the plaintiffs\u2019 requested defense, Granite State denied coverage on the basis that the claims asserted in Sieg-mund\u2019s suit were barred by the auto-exclusion exception in Star-Tex\u2019s insurance policy with Granite State. Effective June 4, 2010, Granite State insured Star-Tex with commercial-property and commercial-general-liability insurance, providing coverage through June 4, 2011. The policy provides that Granite State</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \u201csuit\u201d seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \u201csuit\u201d seeking damages for \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any \u201coccurrence\u201d and settle any claim or \u201csuit\u201d that may result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL25\">Included in the definition of \u201cthe insured\u201d are \u201cyour \u2018employees\u2019, other than either your \u2018executive officers\u2019 ... or your managers ..., but only for acts within the scope of their employment by you or while performing duties related to the conduct of your business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The auto exclusion excepts from coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201cBodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any aircraft, \u201cauto\u201d or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured. Use includes operation and \u201cloading or unloading\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">This exclusion applies even if the claims against any insured allege negligence or other wrongdoing in the supervision, hiring, employment, training or monitoring of others by that insured, if the \u201coccurrence\u201d which caused the \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d involved the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any aircraft, \u201cauto\u201d or watercraft that is owned or operated or rented or loaned to any insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Following Granite State\u2019s denial of coverage, Star-Tex and Esquivel filed a declaratory action in Texas state court (subsequently removed to federal court) asking the court to declare that Granite State erred in its denial-of-coverage determination and that Star-Tex and Esquivel were entitled to full coverage under the policy. Additionally, the declaratory action sought to determine whether Granite State owed the plaintiffs duties to defend and indemnify in Siegmund\u2019s underlying suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">Both parties moved for summary judgment. Granite State moved for summary judgment on the basis that, under the \u201ceight-corners\u201d rule, which governs an insurer\u2019s duty to defend in Texas, courts must make the reasonable inference that Esquivel was driving an automobile at the time of the collision, which would trigger the insurance policy\u2019s auto exclusion and negate any duties to defend and indemnify on the part of Granite State. Star-Tex and Esquivel moved for summary judgment on the basis that the eight-corners rule requires courts to construe their claim broadly and expansively, resolving all doubts in favor of coverage. Because, according to the plaintiffs, Siegmund\u2019s underlying complaint asserts a <em>potentially </em>covered claim, Granite State\u2019s duty to defend was triggered. Further, the plaintiffs reason that the auto exclusion does not apply because the complaint does not state that Esquivel was driving or operating an automobile at the time of the collision. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>review of the parties\u2019 respective arguments, the magistrate judge granted Granite State\u2019s motion and denied Star-Tex and Esquivel\u2019s motion. Star-Tex and Esquivel subsequently appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment, applying the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. v. Emp\u2019rs Mut. Cas. Co., </em>592 F.3d 687, 690 (5th Cir.2010). \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(a). \u201cA genuine issue of material fact exists when the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Gates v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Protective &amp; Regulatory Servs., </em>587 F.3d 404, 417 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). \u201cOn cross-motions for summary judgment, we review each party\u2019s motion independently, viewing the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>264 F.3d 493, 498 (5th Cir.2001). An insurer\u2019s duty to defend is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Ooida Risk Retention Grp., Inc. v. Williams, </em>579 F.3d 469, 471-72 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u201cWhen, as here, jurisdiction is based on diversity, we apply the forum state\u2019s substantive law.\u201d <em>Bayle v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>615 F.3d 350, 355 (5th Cir.2010). In this case, both parties agree that Texas law applies, and so we discuss and apply (1) Texas\u2019s eight-corners rule, (2) a relevant exception to that rule recognized by this court, and (3) Texas law regarding an insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">\u201cUnder the eight-corners or complaint-allegation rule, an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is determined by the third-party plaintiffs pleadings, considered in light of the policy provisions, without regard to the truth or falsity of those allegations.\u201d <em>GuideOne Elite Ins. Co. v. Fielder Road Baptist Church, </em>197 S.W.3d 305, 308 (Tex.2006); <em>see also Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Nokia, Inc., </em>268 S.W.3d 487, 491 (Tex.2008) (\u201cThus, \u2018[e]ven if the allegations are groundless, false, or fraudulent the insurer is obligated to defend.\u2019\u201d (quoting 14 Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, Couch on INSURANCE \u00a7 200:19 (3d ed.2007)) (alteration in original)). \u201cThe rule takes its name from the fact that only two documents are ordinarily relevant to the determination of the duty to defend: the policy and the pleadings of the third-party claimant.\u201d <em>GuideOne, </em>197 S.W.3d at 308. Importantly, \u201cfflacts outside the pleadings, even those easily ascertained, are ordinarily not material to the determination and allegations against the insured are liberally construed in favor of coverage.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Zurich, </em>268 S.W.3d at 491 (\u201cThe duty to defend is not affected by facts ascertained before suit, developed in the course of litigation, or by the ultimate outcome of the suit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Under Texas law, the insured bears the burden of establishing that the insurance policy covers the claim. <em>See Northfield Ins. Co. v. Loving Home Care, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 523, 528 (5th Cir.2004). At that point, \u201cto defeat the duty to defend, the insurer bears the burden of showing that the plain language of a policy exclusion or limitation allows the insurer to avoid coverage of all claims, also within the conf\u00ednes of the eight corners rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In evaluat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ing whether each side has satisfied its respective burden, the Texas Supreme Court has directed courts applying Texas law to \u201cresolve all doubts regarding the duty to defend in favor of the duty and ... construe the pleadings liberally.\u201d <em>Zurich, </em>268 S.W.3d at 491 (citation omitted). \u201cWhere the complaint does not state facts sufficient to clearly bring the case within or without the coverage,\u201d however, \u201cthe general rule is that the insurer is obligated to defend if there is, potentially, a case under the complaint within the coverage of the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Heyden Newport Chem. Corp. v. S. Gen. Ins. Co., </em>387 S.W.2d 22, 26 (Tex.1965)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThus, the duty to defend arises only when the facts alleged in the complaint, if taken as true, would potentially state a cause of action falling within the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Northfield, </em>363 F.3d at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In undertaking this analysis, ordinarily \u201c[c]ourts may not[ ] ... (1) read facts into the pleadings, (2) look outside the pleadings, or (3) imagine factual scenarios which might trigger coverage.\u201d <em>Guar. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Azrock Indus., </em>211 F.3d 239, 243 (5th Cir.2000). However, \u201cwe may draw inferences from the petition that may lead to a finding of coverage.\u201d <em>Gen. Star Indem. Co. v. Gulf Coast Marine Assocs., </em>252 S.W.3d 450, 456 (Tex.App.2008). Accordingly, when a court applies the eight-corners rule, it must consider \u201cany reasonable inferences that flow from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Lib. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Graham, </em>473 F.3d 596, 601 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hallman, </em>159 S.W.3d 640, 645 (Tex.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Siegmund\u2019s suit asserts that he was \u201cseriously injured in an automobile collision caused by the negligence of ... Es-quivel,\u201d who was \u201cunder the influence of alcohol and/or drugs at the time of the collision.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Apart from that, however, the complaint is short on factual allegations. Nevertheless, Granite State argues that the auto exclusion applies because it is reasonable to infer from the complaint that Esquivel was operating a vehicle at the time she allegedly caused the collision. Granite State also reasons that the fact that Siegmund sued only Esquivel and no one else underscores that it is reasonable to infer that Esquivel was operating a vehicle. Any other assumption, according to Granite State, would impermissibly imagine factual scenarios not capable of reasonable inference based on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">However, whereas Granite State\u2019s inference is a reasonable one, it is not the <em>only </em>reasonable inference that we may draw from the complaint. Other reasonable inferences are possible that would not place Esquivel in an automobile at the time of the accident. For example, Star-Tex and Esquivel argue that it would be reasonable to infer from the complaint that Esquivel caused the accident while directing traffic in the Auto Auction lot or while walking in the lot, causing another driver to swerve and hit Siegmund. Both are reasonable inferences based on the complaint and both would explain why Siegmund supposedly brought suit only against Esquivel. Because the allegations in the underlying complaint \u2014 which can charitably be described as terse \u2014 lend themselves to multiple reasonable inferences, we cannot determine, based solely on the pleadings, whether there is a potentially covered claim. <em>Compare Ooida, </em>579 F.3d at 475 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>(\u201cThe underlying complaint does not establish Moses\u2019[s] role in the truck at the time of the accident; thus, determination of his status as tandem driver\u201d \u2014 necessary to determine whether the insurance policy\u2019s fellow-employee exclusion applied \u2014 \u201crequires consideration of evidence outside the eight corners of the complaint and the Policy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Our conclusion that the pleadings alone do not permit a determination concerning the issues of coverage and Granite State\u2019s duty to defend does not end the analysis. Granite State asserts that we may consider extrinsic evidence in determining the duties it owes to Star-Tex and Esquivel in the event that Siegmund\u2019s complaint is insufficiently precise to determine coverage. We conclude that there is a limited exception to the eight-corners rule that, under the circumstances of this appeal, allows us to consider extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u201cAlthough [the Texas Supreme Court] has never expressly recognized an exception to the eight-corners rule, other courts have.\u201d <em>GuideOne, </em>197 S.W.3d at 308; <em>see, e.g., Northfield, </em>363 F.3d at 531. \u201cGenerally, these courts have drawn a very narrow exception, permitting the use of extrinsic evidence only when relevant to an independent and discrete coverage issue, not touching on the merits of the underlying third-party claim.\u201d <em>GuideOne, </em>197 S.W.3d at 308 &amp; n. 2 (collecting cases). For instance, this court has <em>Erie </em>guessed that \u201cif [the Texas Supreme Court] were to recognize an exception to the eight-corners rule, it would likely do so under [these] circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Specifically, this court has <em>Erie </em>guessed that the Texas Supreme Court would recognize an exception to the eight-corners rule \u201cwhen it is initially impossible to discern whether coverage is potentially implicated and when the extrinsic evidence goes solely to a fundamental issue of coverage which does not overlap with the merits of or engage the truth or falsity of any facts alleged in the underlying case.\u201d <em>See Northfield, </em>363 F.3d at 531. Importantly, we have said that \u201c[i]n <em>GuideOne, </em>the Supreme Court of Texas cited this language from <em>Northfield </em>with approval, though it held that the circumstances of the case before it did not meet the conditions of the exception.\u201d <em>Ooida, </em>579 F.3d at 475-76 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we concluded in <em>Ooida </em>that <em>\u201cGuideOne </em>supports our <em>\u2018Erie </em>guess\u2019 that the limited conditions of an exception to the eight corners rule exists here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">Further, we have suggested that extrinsic evidence is more likely to be consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ered when an \u201cexplicit policy coverage exclusion clause[ ]\u201d is at issue. <em>See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Graham, </em>478 F.3d 596, 608 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Ooida, </em>579 F.3d at 476 (considering extrinsic evidence to determine whether deceased was tandem truck driver because coverage depended on applicability of fellow-employee exclusion); <em>W. Heritage Ins. Co. v. River Entertainment, </em>998 F.2d 311, 314-15 (5th Cir.1993) (considering extrinsic evidence demonstrating that cause of defendant\u2019s \u201cimpairment\u201d was intoxication, triggering application of insurance policy\u2019s liquor-liability exclusion); <em>Boll, </em>392 at 160-61 (considering extrinsic evidence that underlying car accident occurred while insured\u2019s son was operating the vehicle, thereby excluding coverage). Because coverage and Granite State\u2019s duty to defend in this case depend on the application of an \u201cexplicit policy coverage exclusion clause\u201d \u2014 namely, the auto exclusion \u2014 it is more likely that extrinsic evidence may be considered. <em>See Graham, </em>473 F.3d at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Granite State argues that, if we look beyond the eight corners, we should consider the undisputed extrinsic evidence that Esquivel was driving a car, put the car in motion, and pinned Siegmund between the car and another car, thus causing him injury and thereby triggering the auto exclusion. First, however, we must consider, based on the underlying complaint, whether \u201cit is initially impossible to discern whether coverage is potentially implicated.\u201d <em>Northfield, </em>363 F.3d at 531. We believe that it is. The complaint contains only one, brief sentence describing the facts of the accident. Importantly, it contains no description of <em>how </em>Esquivel caused the collision. Because Granite State\u2019s duty to defend hinges on what Es-quivel was doing when she caused the accident, \u201c[s]uch an explanation is critical to the question of coverage\u201d under the policy. W. <em>Heritage, </em>998 F.2d at 315 (considering extrinsic evidence because it was impossible, based on the vague allegations in the complaint, to determine the basis of the defendant\u2019s impairment when causing a car accident). In this respect, we find the magistrate judge\u2019s reasoning persuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">Siegmund\u2019s petition triggered the potential application of the Auto Exclusion in alleging he was injured in an \u201cautomobile collision.\u201d Had Siegmund\u2019s petition alleged only an accident without referencing an automobile or collision, it would have stated a potentially covered claim and the Auto Exclusion would not have applied. Alternatively, had the petition stated Esquivel was \u201cdriving\u201d or \u201coperating\u201d at the time she negligently caused the collision, this case would fall squarely within the Auto Exclusion. Because Siegmund\u2019s petition triggers a potential exclusion but omits a fundamental fact \u2014 how Esquivel\u2019s negligence caused the collision that harmed Sieg-mund \u2014 the first requirement to permit the Court to consider evidence outside the eight corners of the complaint is satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Second, we must consider whether \u201cthe extrinsic evidence goes solely to a fundamental issue of coverage which does not overlap with the merits of or engage the truth or falsity of any facts alleged in the underlying case.\u201d <em>Northfield, </em>363 F.3d at 531. We conclude that the extrinsic evidence here goes to coverage because it establishes that Esquivel, an \u201cinsured\u201d within the meaning of the insurance policy, was operating a vehicle at the time of the accident, triggering the auto exclusion. Moreover, the evidence goes only to coverage. It does not overlap with the merits of the underlying dispute because the mere fact that Esquivel was operating a motor vehicle does not establish her negligence or relate to Siegmund\u2019s negligent-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>hiring or respondeat superior claims. Further, the evidence does not engage in the truth or falsity of any fact alleged, particularly given the paucity of facts contained in Siegmund\u2019s terse complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Thus, considering this undisputed, extrinsic evidence in addition to the eight corners, we conclude that the auto exclusion applies, bars coverage, and removes Granite State\u2019s duty to defend Star-Tex and Esquivel in the underlying lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Finally, we must consider Granite State\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to its duty to indemnify Star-Tex and Esquivel. \u201c[T]he duty to defend is distinct from, and broader than, the duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>Zurich, </em>268 S.W.3d at 490 (alteration in original) (quoting Couch on Insuranoe \u00a7 200:1) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]he facts actually established in the underlying suit determine whether the insurer must indemnify its insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201c[generally, Texas law only considers the duty-to-indemnify question justiciable after the underlying suit is concluded, unless <em>\u2018the same reasons that negate the duty to defend likewise negate any possibility the insurer will ever have a duty to indemnify.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Northfield, </em>363 F.3d at 529 (quoting <em>Farmers Tex. Cnty. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Griffin, </em>955 S.W.2d 81, 84 (Tex.1997)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case, because there is no duty to defend in the underlying lawsuit due to of the auto exclusion, the same reason that negates that duty likewise precludes any possibility that Granite State will have to indemnify Star-Tex and Esquivel. Accordingly, we conclude that Granite State has no duty to indemnify Star-Tex and Esquivel.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the magistrate judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Granite State and also AFFIRM the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of summary judgment in favor of Star-Tex and Esquivel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
