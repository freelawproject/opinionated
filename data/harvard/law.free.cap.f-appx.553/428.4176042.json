The district court granted the employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. There is no error, so we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-21\">Anear was a driver who transported river pilots to and from the port. Driving assignments were made on a rotating basis from a tablet on which the name of each pilot was recorded when he called for a ride. Anear claimed that he frequently was assigned to pilots who did not give a tip or who tipped low amounts and that such assignments were made because of his race.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-22\">The district court correctly reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-23\">Plaintiff fails to point to any case law suggesting that tips, over which Plaintiff admits Defendant had no control, constitute compensation, terms, or privileges of employment under Title VII. Furthermore, Plaintiff does not point to any case law suggesting that all employees are entitled to the same amount in tips in the absence of an agreement with the employer regarding tipping. Additional<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ly, Plaintiff\u2019s conclusory allegations that the dispatcher intentionally made driver assignments based on race do not suffice without some supportive and qualifying evidentiary showing to create a material factual dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
