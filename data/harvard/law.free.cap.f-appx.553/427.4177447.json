She argues that the district court failed to properly consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and disregarded her history and personal characteristics in setting the sentence above the guidelines range. She raises these issues for the first time on appeal and we, therefore, review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Juarez, </em>626 F.3d 246, 253-54 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-21\">In imposing Walker\u2019s sentence, the district court clearly referenced the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court first noted three purposes of sentencing, matching certain of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, the district court outlined the need to protect society from the crimes of the individual, punish the offender, and deter others contemplating similar offenses. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B), (C). The district court then noted generally abuses to the bankruptcy system and the need to deter such fraud. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3353(a)(2)(B). Further, the district court stated that it selected the sentence \u201cafter considering the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 3553 pertaining to your history, your personal characteristics, as well as your involvement in the instant offense.\u201d <em>See </em>'\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A). The district court found that Walker engaged in the offense despite the fact that she earned a \u201cdecent\u201d salary, that she had four prior bankruptcy filings and thus was not an unsophisticated participant in bankruptcy proceedings, and that she had shown a \u201cpattern of fraudulent behavior\u201d in her dealings with the Bankruptcy Court, the Internal Revenue Service, and her creditors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) and (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-23\">Walker has failed to show that the district court gave significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, that it failed to account for a factor that should have received significant weight, or that it made a clear error of judgment. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Walker has shown no clear or obvious error as to the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Juarez, </em>626 F.3d at 254. Her challenge to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>sentence amounts to no more than a disagreement with the district court\u2019s balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, an analysis which the district court was in a better position than this court to perform and to which we accord great deference. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>633 F.3d 370, 375 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">As to the increase to 12 months of imprisonment from the top of the guidelines range of six months, this court has upheld variances and departures greater than the six-month increase to Walker\u2019s sentence, <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433, 441-42 (5th Cir. 2006); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Daughenbaugh, </em>49 F.3d 171, 174-75 (5th Cir.1995). The district court acted within its discretion in imposing Walker\u2019s sentence. <em>See Hernandez, </em>633 F.3d at 375. The decision of the district court is thus AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
