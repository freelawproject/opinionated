The district court sentenced Munguia to 120 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Munguia challenges the district court\u2019s application of the six-level enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b), which applies when the victim of the offense is a government officer and the defendant was motivated by the victim\u2019s status as a government officer in committing the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-25\">First, Munguia contends that there was no evidence that he was motivated by the victim\u2019s status as a government officer. Rather, he argues the offense was motivated by a personal dispute because he disagreed with the victim\u2019s attempt to remove him from an area and would have reacted the same way to another person\u2019s attempt to remove him. This argument is unavailing. The sole reason the assault arose was because the victim was performing his duties as a correctional officer. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s finding that Munguia\u2019s assault was motivated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>correctional officer\u2019s status as a government officer was plausible in light of the record read as a whole and not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>520 F.3d 414, 422, 424 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Next, Munguia contends that the district court engaged in impermissible double-counting of the victim\u2019s status as a government officer because the victim\u2019s status is also an element of his offense of conviction. Munguia\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. John, </em>309 F.3d 298 (5th Cir.2002), is misplaced. While the victim\u2019s status as a government officer is an element of the offense of conviction, <em>see </em>\u00a7 111, the base offense level for the applicable offense guideline, \u00a7 2A2.2(a), does not incorporate the official status of the victim. <em>See United States v. Kings, </em>981 F.2d 790, 792-94 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Kleinebreil, </em>966 F.2d 945, 955 (5th Cir.1992); <em>cf. John, </em>309 F.3d at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Munguia\u2019s double-counting argument fails for the alternative reason that double-counting is prohibited only if the relevant Guideline expressly forbids it. <em>See United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001). Neither \u00a7 2A2.2 nor \u00a7 3A1.2 expressly prohibit double-counting in the circumstances of the instant case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2A2.2 cmt. n.4, background. For the aforementioned reasons, the district court did not engage in impermissible double-counting of the victim\u2019s status as a government officer by applying the six-level enhancement in \u00a7 3A1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
