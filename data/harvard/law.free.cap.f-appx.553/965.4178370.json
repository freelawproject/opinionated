The district court \u2014 following an evidentiary hearing \u2014 did not err in denying Kendricks safety valve relief because Kendricks failed to meet his burden of proving that his safety-valve statement was sufficient, and the court\u2019s determination that Kendricks fell short of truthfully providing all of the information that he had about his offense was not clearly erroneous. Where a fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>pattern gives rise to two reasonable and different constructions, \u201cthe factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Saingerard, </em>621 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">The district court probably did not err and did not <em>plainly </em>err in failing to find (without prompting from the defendant) that the government breached Kendricks\u2019 plea agreement by expanding the scope of the required safety-valve disclosure statement to include information about prior drug transactions. For background, <em>see United States v. De La Garza, </em>516 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>199 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
