He contends that the district court plainly erred by failing to dismiss his indictment because the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (\u201cMDLEA\u201d) is unconstitutional as applied to his conduct. He points to <em>United States v. Bellaizac-Hurtado, </em>700 F.3d 1245 (11th Cir.2012); then, he argues that the phrase \u201cthrough international waters\u201d set forth in his plea agreement does not mean (and thus does not admit) that his boats actually left territorial waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-13\">Forbes-Suarez waived the right to raise his present challenge to his conviction by entering an unconditional guilty plea. See <em>United States v. Ternus, </em>598 F.3d 1251, 1254 (11th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Yunis, </em>723 F.2d 795, 796 (11th Cir.1984). In addition, no decision of this Court or the Supreme Court supports Forbes-Suarez\u2019s contention that his admitting the vessels in his conspiracy used \u201cinternational waters\u201d fails to include inherently a concession that the vessels went outside of \u201cterritorial waters.\u201d In a case like this one, \u201cinternational waters\u201d has a customary meaning and is not ambiguous. For MDLEA proceedings, territorial waters: international waters, at least in the absence of binding precedent saying something else. Therefore, the district court did not commit <em>'plain </em>error by failing to dismiss his indictment <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
