Salinas, Texas prisoner # 1700761, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A and 1915(e)(2)(B). We review the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-22\">If his brief is liberally construed, Salinas asserts that the district court\u2019s dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>was error, urging that he stated a cognizable due-process claim regarding the denial of credit for time served in federal custody and that <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), does not bar the claim. He additionally contends that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his suit violated his constitutional right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Salinas briefs no argument challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims regarding the denial of good-conduct and work time, the denial of release to mandatory supervision, or retaliation, nor does he otherwise renew those claims or his Eighth Amendment claim; these claims are therefore abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Salinas fails to demonstrate any error on the district court\u2019s part in dismissing his lawsuit. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
