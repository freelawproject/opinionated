His presentence investigation report (PSR) assigned him a base offense level of 32 under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4), which was decreased by three levels based on his acceptance of responsibility. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a)-(b) (Nov. 2005). With an adjusted offense level of 29 and a criminal history category of II, Washington\u2019s initial guidelines sentence range was 97 to 121 months imprisonment. However, Washington was subject to a statutory minimum sentence of 120 months under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). As a result, his advisory sentence range became 120 to 121 months imprisonment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c), and the district court imposed the statutory minimum 120-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-21\">In 2011 Washington filed a motion for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that he was eligible for a sentence reduction based on the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) and Amendment 750 to the sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied that motion, concluding that Washington was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because he was sentenced to the statutory minimum sentence. Washington now appeals the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">I.-</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir.2009). However, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">To determine whether a sentence reduction is warranted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court must calculate the guidelines range that would have applied if the retroactive amendment had been in effect when the defendant was originally sentenced. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1131.10(b)(1). A district court may then modify a term of imprisonment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, a defendant is not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if a guidelines amendment applies to the defendant but does not lower his applicable guidelines range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 emt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">In this case, Washington is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his amended guidelines range would not be lower than his original guidelines range. If Amendment 750 had been in effect when Washington was sentenced, his guidelines range would be 120 months imprisonment, the statutory minimum at the time. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 \u00a7 2D 1.1(c)(7), 5Gl.l(b). That revised range would not fall below his original guidelines range of 120 to 121 months. Accordingly, he is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">Washington tries to overcome the barrier of the 120-month statutory minimum by arguing that Amendment 750 must be applied in conjunction with the FSA, which lowered the relevant mandatory minimum from 120 months to 60 months. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). Under that line of thinking, Washington\u2019s amended guidelines range would be 60 to 63 months imprisonment, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(e), and he would be eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. However, our precedent forecloses Washington\u2019s argument. In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>we held that a defendant could not rely on the FSA for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because the FSA was a \u201cstatutory change by Congress\u201d and not \u201ca guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir. 2012). We also concluded that a defendant who had been sentenced before the FSA\u2019s 2010 effective date could not rely on the FSA when seeking relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because the FSA did not apply retroactively. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Washington was sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>tenced in 2006, well before the FSA was enacted. Thus, he cannot benefit from the FSA\u2019s reduced mandatory minimum sentence and he is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s denial of Washington\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-8\">. Amendment 750 revised the crack cocaine quantity tables in the sentencing guidelines. See U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 750 (Nov. 2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b995-9\">. Washington tries to distinguish <em>Berry </em>and <em>Hippolyte </em>on the grounds that the statutory minimum sentences in those cases were above the defendants\u2019 initial guidelines ranges while his statutory minimum sentence was lower than the top of his initial guidelines range. That is not a meaningful distinction, however, because in all three circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>the amendment to the sentencing guidelines would not have resulted in a sentencing range that was lower than the one originally determined at sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
