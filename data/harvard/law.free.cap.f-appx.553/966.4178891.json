At trial, the district court denied Pointer\u2019s motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 on the firearm charge, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Given that Pointer\u2019s gun (.45 auto pistol) was loaded, easily accessible in the shop where he sold cocaine, and in close proximity to drugs and money that could have been drug proceeds, a reasonable jury could have found a sufficient nexus between the gun and the drug trafficking crime to establish a violation of \u00a7 924(c). Besides, Pointer had stated that he kept the gun to protect his business; and a reasonable jury could believe that his business included drug trafficking. Thus, the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to establish that Pointer possessed his gun in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
