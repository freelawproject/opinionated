The application was amended on October 8, 1957. By such application petitioner sought authority to increase its rates for general flat rate service from a basic amount of $3.00 per service connection per month to $4.50 and to increase its general metered service rates from $2.50 per meter per month for the first 1,000 cubic feet or less to $3.75, with corresponding increases in the unit quantity rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">(2) November 1, 1957, a public hearing on the amended application was held at Santa Ana, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">(3) December 17, 1957, upon the record of the proceedings held November 1, 1957, the commission rendered its Decision No. 56003 (56 P.U.C. 105), making an interim order authorizing petitioner to increase its monthly residential flat rate from $3.00 to $3.75, with corresponding increases in the rates and charges in petitioner\u2019s general metered service schedule, pending final determination of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">(4) Prom December 26, 1957, through May 8, 1959, public hearings on the application for authorization to increase rates and an investigation on the commission\u2019s own motion into the rates, rules, regulations, contracts, operations, and practices pertaining to and involving water main extensions of petitioner were held at various times.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">(5) May 5, 1959, petitioner filed a petition for a proposed report pursuant to rule 69 of the commission\u2019s Buies of Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">(6) May 8, 1959, petitioner moved for a supplemental hearing to determine whether the commission would consider material outside the record in the making of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">(7) May 12,1959, the commission denied petitioner\u2019s motion made May 8, 1959, but granted petitioner\u2019s application for a proposed report pursuant to rule 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">(8) May 28,1959, the proposed report of Examiner Stewart C. Warner was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">(9) No action was taken by the commission with respect to the proposed report for almost 10 months, until an opinion and order, Decision No. 59828, dated March 22, 1960, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>an effective date of April 11, 1960, was filed by the commission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">(10) March 31, 1960, petitioner filed a petition for a rehearing before the commission, which petition was denied May 9,1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>These questions are presented for our determination:</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\">First. <em>Was the order to install meters beyond, the jurisdiction of the commission?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><em>No. </em>Section 761 of the Public Utilities Code reads: \u201cWhenever the commission, after a hearing, finds that the rules, practices, equipment, appliances, facilities, or service of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>public utility, or the methods of manufacture, distribution, transmission, storage, or supply employed by it, are unjust, unreasonable, unsafe, improper, inadequate, or insufficient, the commission shall determine and, by order or rule, fix the rules, practices, equipment, appliances, facilities, service, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>methods to be observed, furnished, constructed, enforced, or employed. The commission shall prescribe rules for the performance of any service or the furnishing of any commodity of the character furnished or supplied by any public utility, and, on proper demand and tender of rates, such public utility shall furnish such commodity or render such service within the time and upon the conditions provided in such rules. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Section 770 of said code reads: \u201cThe commission may after hearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u201c(a) Ascertain and fix just and reasonable standards, classifications, regulations, practices, measurements, or serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ice to be furnished, imposed, observed, and followed by all electrical, gas, water, and heat corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\">\u201c (b) Ascertain and fix adequate and serviceable standards for the measurement of quantity, quality, pressure, initial voltage, or other condition pertaining to the supply of the product, commodity, or service furnished or rendered by any such public utility</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u201c(e) Prescribe reasonable regulations for the examination and testing of such product, commodity, or service and for the measurement thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u201c(d) Establish reasonable rules, specifications, and standards to secure the accuracy of all meters and appliances for measurements.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u201c(e) Provide for the examination and testing of any and all appliances used for the measurement of any product, commodity, or service of any such public utility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">In <em>Title Guar. etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Railroad Com., </em>168 Cal. 295, 302 [142 P. 878, Ann.Cas. 1916A 738], it was held that a city vested with regulatory powers over water companies in existence prior to the passage of the Public Utilities Act had the power to require them to install meters at their own expense, the requirement that meters be used being an incident of the rate-fixing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">It is clear from the above-quoted sections of the Public Utilities Code that the Legislature intended to, and did, confer upon the commission power to require a public utility to install meters at its own expense. Such a power is necessary and desirable in order to prevent a waste of the product being distributed and discrimination between consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Second. <em>Was the commission\u2019s order directing the installation of meters unreasonable?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\"><em>No. </em> In the present case the commission ordered as follows: \u201c4. b. Dyke Water Company shall immediately institute a metering program and shall install, so as to permanently convert from flat rate to metered service, not less than 400 meters per month, in addition to metering all new service connections, until all residential and other general service connections shall have been metered; and \u201cc. Shall, within ninety days after the effective date of this order and every one hundred eighty days thereafter, report to this Commission in writing the total number of meters installed, together with the net number of meters installed during the period covered in each such report, until all of its service connections have been metered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Several years before, in a prior decision, No. 53858, reported at 55 P.U.C. 235, issued on October 1, 1956, in wMch petitioner was granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing water service in an extensive area in Orange County, the commission had ordered petitioner to install meters in the following language: \u201c1. (e) That Dyke Water Company shall forthwith institute a program of metering of water service in the certificated areas shown on the map, Appendix A, and shall report its progress in writing to the Commission within ninety days after the effective date hereof and every ninety days thereafter for a period of four years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">There was good reason for this order. As early as July 7, 1954, the following resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of the Orange County Water District:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u201cWhereas, it has been called to the attention of the members of the Board of Directors of the Orange County Water District that a wasteful usage of water is occurring in many of the residential sections located within the Orange County Water District; and</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u201cWhereas, analysis of this situation indicates that most of this wasteful usage of water prevails in areas where water is being served to the individual users on a \u2018flat rate\u2019 basis; and</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u201cWhereas, one of the powers of the Orange County Water District as defined in Paragraph 6 of Section 2 of the OCWD Act as amended reads as follows: \u2018For the common benefit of said district, to store water in underground water basins or reservoirs within or outside of said district, to appropriate and acquire water and water rights within or outside of said district, to import water into said district, and to conserve water within or outside of said district\u2019;</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u201cNow, Therefore, Be It Resolved, that the Secretary Manager be and he is hereby authorized and requested to bring this matter to the attention of the Public Utilities Commission, and request said Commission to do all within its power to require compliance of all utilities subject to its jurisdiction serving domestic water within the boundaries of the Orange County Water District with the following conditions :</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">(1) That totalizing water meters be installed on all service connections; and</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">(2) That applicable rates be established on a volume basis.\u201d The commission\u2019s order to install meters was not challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>by petitioner. On the contrary, petitioner forwarded the following letter to the commission on February 11, 1957: \u201cReferring to Decision No. 53858 and pursuant to ordering paragraph 1(e), we have had conferences with various meter companies in an effort to determine the cost and expense for metering.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\">\u201cProposals have been submitted to one meter company and if accepted we will be able to commence some of the installations within six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u201cWill keep you advised as to our progress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Other portions of Decision No. 53858, however, and certain related decisions, were challenged by petitioner in petitions for writs of review addressed to this court on March 18, 1957, in S.F. 19657-19660. Nowhere in these petitions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was any question raised with respect to the lawfulness or reasonableness of the commission\u2019s order to install meters.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">On the contrary, petitioner continued to represent to the commission that meters were being installed. On May 6, 1957, it forwarded the following letter to the commission: \u201cReferring to Decision No. 53858 and pursuant to order Paragraph 1 (e), we are submitting our second report.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u201cDuring the past ninety days we have installed the following quantities of meters:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">15...........................%\" meters</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">8 ............................1\" meters</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">5..........................1 %\" meters :</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">5............................3 \"meters</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">Total .................33 meters</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">\u201cWe are preparing to commence installation of meters at the rate of fifteen to twenty per day and will report in ninety days further progress with respect to this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">On October 10, 1957, it forwarded the following letter to the commission: \u201cIn reference to Decision No. 53858, Order IB, Dated October 1, 1956, this is to inform you that since January 1, 1957, we have installed eighty-two meters.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-15\">\u201cWe are installing meters regularly and will continue to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">On October 8, 1957, petitioner filed an amendment to its application, in which it requested \u201cauthority to place into effect immediately on an interim basis the rates as proposed in its original Application,\u201d representing to the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>that \u201cThe present financial condition of Applicant is such that emergency conditions exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The first public hearing was held on the amended application on November 1, 1957, at which time an expert witness, <em>testifying on behalf of petitioner, </em>after stating he was familiar with the commission\u2019s order on metering, was asked his opinion as to whether meters are necessary in this company\u2019s system. His reply was, <em>\u201cI think they are essential </em>At the same hearing another expert witness, testifying on behalf of petitioner, in support of an estimate of petitioner\u2019s rate base for 1956 and succeeding years, stated that his estimate \u201creflects a start of a metering program which, by the end of the year 1961, meters 10,000 customers,\u201d using the principle of \u201cmetering services of this company at the rate of 2,500 per annum, starting January 1, 1958, which makes 10,000 meters as of the end of 1961.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">This witness also testified in support of his estimates of \u201cadditional moneys necessary to finance Dyke Water Company.\u201d These estimates were of $100,000 a year for each of the years 1958 through 1961, inclusive, for a \u201cmetering program. \u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">On December 17, 1957, as stated above, the commission issued Decision No. 56003, in which petitioner was authorized, on an interim basis, pending final decision, to charge substantially increased rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The matter was set for further hearing on December 26, 1957, but, at petitioner\u2019s request, was continued to a date to be later fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Hearings were resumed on January 14, 1959. On January 15, 1959, the Orange County Water District expressed its concern that the metering program contemplated by petitioner, as reflected in the evidence above described, was inadequate, and offered evidence that annual water usage per service connection on petitioner\u2019s largely unmetered system was 0.94 of an acre-foot, compared with an average annual use of 0.57 of an acre-foot in four other nearby metered water systems, most of which had extensive industrial and commercial usage; that most of the water underlying the Orange County Water District is Colorado River water, imported under a ground water recharge program financed by a replenishment assessment levied at a uniform rate on all production of water from the ground water supplies of the district basin; that there was an unnecessary usage of approximately 7,000 acre-feet of water per year in the service area of petitioner; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>that water had been observed on many occasions running down the curbs in places where unmetered water service was being rendered; that it would cost the district approximately $84,000 to replace these 7,000 acre-feet of water in the ground water supplies; that under the district\u2019s assessment plan petitioner would be required to pay only $27,300 of said $84,000; and that those using water from unmetered systems were being subsidized by those using water from metered systems. The district confirmed and again urged upon the commission its resolution of July 7, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\">On May 7, 1959, shortly before the matter was submitted, Dyke Lansdale, president of petitioner, when asked on cross-examination what steps had been taken to implement the commission\u2019s order to institute a metering program, stated that petitioner had started a program for installing meters on all industrial and odd or oversized lots and in schools; that only tracts did not have meters, and that \u2018 \u2018 we have done very little tract work since the order was put out\u201d; that \u201cI feel that within the next two years it will be unnecessary for any of us to meter\u201d; and that the only plans petitioner then had for the metering of flat rate customers was a plan to install a meter on those customers who had been reported as wasters of water.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Testifying in response to a question as to whether he had made any investigation with respect to the financing of a metering program, Mr. Lansdale answered in the affirmative, and said that petitioner had had several offers for the sale of meters on an installment plan; that there was one offer to \u201cinstall the meter for us and bill us for an installed meter and they would take their money out of the increased revenues\u201d; that the financing of a metering program through the water meter suppliers or manufacturing companies was feasible; and that \u201cyou can get the metering company to make almost any type of an arrangement as long as they can get their money. I mean time isn\u2019t a big factor with them. There are three or four big metering companies and they are very, very competitive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">From the foregoing narrative it is clear that for the purposes of persuading the commission to grant it a rate increase petitioner professed wholehearted willingness to install meters, but that as soon as substantial rate relief was granted by the commission, to be effective for an indefinite period, the metering program was renounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">When the commission issued its order on March 22, 1960, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>directing petitioner to install not less than 400 meters per month, petitioner had had three and a half years since the issuance of the commission\u2019s prior order on October 1, 1956, within which to formulate a plan of its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The commission gave no credence to the representations contained in Dyke Lansdale\u2019s affidavit of March 30, 1960, in support of petitioner\u2019s petition for rehearing with respect to the commission\u2019s March 22, 1960, order. The affidavit alleges in substance that the commission\u2019s order would impose an impossible financial burden on petitioner and jeopardize its service; that the installation of 400 meters per month would require the employment of seven working crews and a foreman, plus additional capital equipment and personnel. Even if these allegations were entitled to any credence, it is to be noted that they assume that petitioner would have to do the installation work, and that the cost of such work would exceed petitioner\u2019s financial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">But President Dyke Lansdale himself had previously testified that numerous metering companies would compete for the opportunity to do the work of installation on favorable credit terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">At this late date petitioner is hardly in a position to complain that the commission\u2019s order of March 22, 1960, is impossible or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Nor was there anything unreasonable about requiring petitioner to bear the cost of installation of meters rather than imposing such cost upon the ratepayers. To require utility ratepayers to pay for capital installations in the form of meters not only is a departure from customary ratemaking, but also is wrong in principle. It results in a double burden upon ratepayers in that the ratepayers not only bear capital costs, but also continue, throughout the life of the plant installed, to produce a return to the utility upon the cost of the plant. <em>(Cf. Title Guar. etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Railroad Com., supra, </em>168 Cal. 295, 302 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Third. <em>Was the commission required to grant petitioner\u2019s request for a rehearing in order to hear evidence pertaining to the results of petitioner\u2019s operations occurring subsequent to the close of the hearings and before the issuance of the commission\u2019s decision?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\"><em>No. </em> Behearings are not matters of right before the commission, but are pleas addressed to the sound discretion of that body. The discretion to be invoked is that of the body making the order and not that of a reviewing court. <em>(Inter</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>state Commerce Com. </em>v. <em>City of Jersey City, </em>322 U.S. 503, 514 et seq. [64 S.Ct. 1129, 88 L.Ed. 1420].) It is therefore evident that in the present ease petitioner\u2019s application for a rehearing was not improperly denied by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\">Fourth. <em>Was the commission justified in reaching different conclusions from those of the examiner, although adopting certain of his findings?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><em>Yes. </em>In its decision the commission stated: \u201cThe Commission hereby finds that those sections of the proposed report dealing with factual and evidentiary matters constitute true statements of the evidence and of the facts and as such they are hereby adopted by the Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Petitioner contends that the commission\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in adopting as true sections of the report but issuing an order that was inconsistent with, and contrary to, the recommended order of the commission\u2019s examiner. In support of this, petitioner contends that the commission was guilty of a \u201cflat misstatement\u201d in stating, \u201cThe record indicates, from the testimony of applicant\u2019s president, that the financing of a metering program would be feasible.\u201d This statement by the commission is supported by the record. The transcript shows the following testimony of President Dyke Lansdale: \u201c Q. I want to confine my questions here principally right now to the financing and am I to understand from your statement that the financing of a metering program through the water meter suppliers or manufacturing companies is a feasible way to accomplish it? A. Yes, I feel that there are several different methods that could be worked. Q. Are feasible? A. Yes, it will work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">It appears from the examiner\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions that the examiner adopted as reasonable certain estimates, offered in evidence by the commission\u2019s staff, of petitioner\u2019s revenue, expenses, and rate base for the year 1959. These estimates showed that petitioner would earn for the year 1959 a return of 16.08 per cent at the rates in effect prior to the rates authorized by the commission\u2019s interim decision ; 23.78 per cent under the rates authorized by the interim order; 31.48 per cent at the rates proposed by petitioner in its application; and 11.90 per cent on the assumption that petitioner\u2019s entire system would be metered.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The reason why the old rates, as well as the interim and proposed rates, were calculated to yield such high returns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>is to be found in certain practices of petitioner involving extensions of its water mains to newly developed territory during a number of years from 1952 to 1958.  Such extensions were governed, or should have been governed, by petitioner\u2019s Rule and Regulation Number 15, published and filed with the commission as a part of its tariff. This rule, when so published and filed, had the force and effect of a statute, and any deviations therefrom were unlawful unless authorized by the commission. <em>(California Water &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Util. Com., </em>51 Cal.2d 478, 501 [23] [334 P.2d 887].)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Petitioner\u2019s rule in effect until August 15, 1955, provided that applicants for extensions to new subdivisions were required to advance and deposit with petitioner the estimated cost of construction, and that thereafter petitioner would pay to the depositor, for a period not to exceed 10 years, 35 per cent of the gross revenue due from consumers connected to the extension, but not more than the amount of such cost. A new rule prescribed by the commission, and effective on and after August 15, 1955, reduced the amount of the refunds to 22 per cent of the annual revenue from customers served from the extension, for not to exceed 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The evidence shows that from 1952 to 1958 petitioner entered into over 300 contracts for such extensions; that the advances under such agreements totaled $3,203,000; that many of these contracts required refunding at the rate of 35 per cent of petitioner\u2019s gross annual revenues from such extensions; that other such contracts involved unlawful deviations from petitioner\u2019s tariff rule; and that the refunds petitioner was required to pay constituted about one quarter of its gross revenues at the interim rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The Uniform System of Accounts for Water Utilities established by the commission prescribes the use of a deferred credit account called \u201cAdvances for Construction,\u201d in which shall be recorded \u201csuch advances for construction made in accordance with the utility\u2019s rules and regulations, as are to be refunded either wholly or in part. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">When physical plant is constructed or installed with the use of such advances, it is required that the cost be recorded in a utility\u2019s appropriate plant accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">For rate-fixing purposes the commission as a matter of policy, in calculating a utility\u2019s rate base, deducts from the balance in the plant accounts the balance in the Advances for Construction Account. The reason for such a deduction is that the commission considers it unreasonable to allow a utility to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>earn a return upon property the cost of which has been advanced by prospective consumers or sub dividers of property. <em>(Del Este Water Co., </em>52 P.U.C. 479, 482 [1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\">Upon repayment of such advances, however, such deductions cease <em>pro tanto, </em>and plant costs defrayed by such repaid advances become a part of the utility\u2019s rate base for rate-fixing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">This policy of the commission, and the rate-fixing principles contained therein, were recently challenged in a petition for writ of review addressed to this court in <em>Suburban Water Systems </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com., </em>S.F. No. 20484, which was denied without opinion on August 10, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Good reasons were offered by the commission\u2019s staff for declining to adopt all of the conclusions of the examiner, and the record supports the commission in the adoption of other and different findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Fifth. <em>Bid the commission err in not hearing oral argument of petitioner ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\"><em>No. </em>Petitioner contends that it has been prejudiced, since it has never had an opportunity to orally argue the merits of the application and the ease before any official other than the hearing officer, although petitioner requested such argument and the commission had set argument on the application and the ease before the commission in bank on May 19, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Petitioner was given ample opportunity to be heard by the filing of exceptions to the examiner\u2019s proposed report. The commission\u2019s rules governing proposed reports are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">\u201cUpon direction by the Commission, the presiding officer shall prepare and file his proposed report. The Secretary\u2019s office shall cause copies thereof to be served upon all parties to the proceeding.

In the case of <em>Federal Communications Com. </em>v. <em>WJR, </em>337 U.S. 265, 275 [69 S.Ct. 1097, 93 L.Ed. 1353], the Supreme Court of the United States stated: \u201c. . . due process of law has never been a term of fixed and invariable content. This is as true with reference to oral argument as with respect to other elements of procedural due process. For this Court has held in some situations that such argument is essential to a fair hearing [citation], in others that argument submitted in writing is sufficient. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>298 U.S. 468, 481 [56 S.Ct. 906, 80 L.Ed. 1288], it was said: \u201cArgument may be oral or written. The requirements are not technical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In the present case it is evident that petitioner had ample opportunity to present written arguments to the commission, and the commission was not required to hear oral arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Sixth. <em>Did the commission err in considering material outside the record?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\"><em>No. </em>The commission\u2019s order provides: \u201cAfter making appropriate modifications to the staff-derived figures so as to recognize reasonable increased revenues, greater expenses and a higher rate base for a properly metered system and giving due cognizance of the trend of rate of return as occasioned by the refunding of advances for construction during the year 1960 and subsequent years, the Commission concludes that applicant would earn a rate of return of somewhat more than 7 per cent on a depreciated rate base of approximately $2,269,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Petitioner contends: \u201cIt would appear from the quoted statement that material outside the record was considered by the Commission, and that on consideration of such extraneous matters, the recommended order of the hearing officer based upon evidence within the record was rejected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">The commission first ordered petitioner to install meters in 1956 and had evidence before it of a continuing urgent need for such installations. When it decided to order petitioner to install a specific minimum number of meters per month, it assumed that petitioner would do so, and that its plant in service, i.e., rate base, would thereby be substantially increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The commission also assumed that petitioner would perform its contractual obligations to refund advances for construction, thus diminishing the balance in its \u201cAdvances for Construction\u201d account, and thereby increasing its rate base.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\">With a rate base increasing as a result of these two factors, petitioner\u2019s rate of return would show a downward trend during 1960 and subsequent years from 16.08 per cent, estimated at the prior rates, to something approximating 7 per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">If these assumptions had not been made by the commission, it might have been constrained to reduce petitioner\u2019s rates even below what they were when the application for an increase was filed in order to reduce the excessive 16.08 per cent return.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">These assumptions, however, rested upon evidence in the record, and it cannot be justly said that they involved consideration of \u201cmaterial outside the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">There is likewise no merit in petitioner\u2019s contention that \u201cPetitioner had no opportunity to even know what material was being considered by the Commission or being received by the Commission from its staff in arriving at the opinion and order which is the subject of this Petition,\u201d in view of the fact that exceptions to the proposed report of the examiner were filed by the commission\u2019s staff and served upon petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In the instant case the commission had the record before it, and nothing appears to rebut the presumption that the decision of the commission was made after a consideration of the record. <em>(Pacific Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>28 Cal.2d 329, 339 [6] [170 P.2d 18].)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Seventh. <em>Did the commission err in failing to consider evidence of petitioner?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\"><em>No. </em>Petitioner has not pointed out any evidence that the commission failed to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Eighth. <em>Was the commission\u2019s decision unlawful because of its treatment of federal income taxes?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\"><em>No. </em>In its decision the commission said: \u201cThe question of what rate treatment should be given to reduce [d] federal income tax payments resulting from the use of accelerated depreciation as permitted by Section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code, is under consideration by the Commission, and pending determination of the problem by the Commission we have considered straight-line depreciation for income tax purposes in this matter. When decision is made by the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>mission as to the use of accelerated depreciation, then such necessary adjustments, if any, will be made by the Commission in respect to income tax payments made by the utility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Petitioner says this is \u201cuncertain and unclear\u201d in that \u201cit is impossible to ascertain therefrom the effect of present and anticipated federal income taxation on Petitioner\u2019s revenues,\u201d and \u201cPetitioner is unable to ascertain the present, and anticipated consequences of the opinion and order with respect to the payment of and allocation for anticipated income tax obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">It is not clear just what petitioner means. Obviously nothing the commission says can affect petitioner\u2019s obligation to pay its taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Following the case of <em>Galveston Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Galveston, </em>258 U.S. 388, 399 [7, 8] [42 S.Ct. 351, 66 L.Ed. 678], the commission for rate-fixing purposes has recognized and allowed income taxes as an operating expense. The amount of such taxes is usually arrived at after a deduction for depreciation of depreciable property.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 permits, at the taxpayer\u2019s option, several ways of calculating depreciation for income tax purposes. Among them are: \u201c (1) the straight line method, (2) the declining balance method, using a rate not exceeding twice the rate which would have been used had the annual allowance been computed under the method described in paragraph (1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Following the adoption of this legislation by Congress, the commission was repeatedly faced, in numerous public utility rate proceedings, with the difficult problem of what amount of money to allow for income taxes as an operating expense in cases where the utility had elected, or indicated its intention to elect, a method of accelerated depreciation for income tax purposes, thereby increasing the depreciation deduction, and decreasing the amount of taxes paid or to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Various alternatives were open, among them being (a) an amount calculated by the straight-line method irrespective of what method was used in calculating the amount of taxes that were actually paid or to be paid; and (b) allowance only of taxes actually paid, or to be paid, under whatever method of depreciation the utility elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">In the present proceeding the evidence shows that petitioner had elected the double rate declining balance method of computing depreciation, thereby increasing the depreciation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>deduction and decreasing the amount of income taxes it would actually pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">For rate-fixing purposes, however, and for the reasons given, the commission recognized the larger amount of tax which would have resulted from the use of straight-line depreciation. This, of course, redounded to petitioner\u2019s advantage, in that it reduced the amount of net income after taxes recognized by the commission as available for return on rate base, and tended to strengthen petitioner\u2019s showing in support of its request for increased rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Ninth. <em>Were the rates fixed by the commission confiscatoryf</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\"><em>No. </em>Petitioner says that the confiscatory nature of the commission\u2019s order is shown by even a cursory examination of the facts in the instant case. Petitioner\u2019s argument in support of this statement is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">First, it assumes that the financial emergency which the commission found in December 1957 in issuing an interim rate order upon a limited and incomplete record was proven by the complete record, and that such emergency continued through December 31, 1958. In its final decision, however, the commission found, \u201cIn the basic matter of revenues, the Commission finds that the revenues produced by the rates authorized in the interim order herein (Decision No. 56003) have fully met the needs of the financial emergency then existing and foreseen. The Commission finds as a fact that there is not presently such an emergency situation as would necessitate or otherwise justify a continuance of the increased rates and charges authorized by such interim order. It is fair and reasonable and in the public interest, therefore, to terminate the rates and charges authorized on the interim basis.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">This finding was fully justified by the evidence of estimates that petitioner would earn a 16.08 per cent return in 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Secondly, petitioner\u2019s argument assumes that the interim rate of $3.75 was reasonable because the examiner proposed such a conclusion. But for good reasons the commission was fully justified in declining to adopt that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Thirdly, petitioner\u2019s argument assumes that it was reasonable to impose upon petitioner\u2019s consumers a surcharge of 75 cents per month each for meters. But for the reason that petitioner\u2019s own president testified the financing of meters was not a problem, and that a surcharge would impose a double burden on the ratepayers, the commission was justified in refusing to impose such a surcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Fourthly, petitioner argues that its failure to pay any dividend demonstrates that a $3.00 rate is confiscatory. It cites no authority for such a position, and none has been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">This court in <em>Market St. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Railroad Com., </em>24 Cal.2d 378, 397 [150 P.2d 196], said: \u201cThus responsibility for rate fixing, insofar as the law permits and requires, is placed with the commission, and unless its action is clearly shown to be confiscatory the courts will not interfere\u201d;  and on page 399 [2] [24 Cal.2d] : \u201c. . . The petitioner herein must be charged with the burden of showing that the evidence does not support the commission\u2019s finding of value, and that the reduced rate is unreasonable and will result in confiscation of its property. That burden is coupled with a strong presumption of the correctness of the findings and conclusions of the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In <em>Federal Power Com. </em>v. <em>Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 602 [64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333], the court said: \u201c. . . the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of formulae in determining rates. Its rate-making function, moreover, involves the making of \u2018pragmatic adjustments.\u2019 . . . And when the Commission\u2019s order is challenged in the courts, the question is whether that order \u2018viewed in its entirety\u2019 meets the requirements of the Act. . . . Under the statutory standard of \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling. [Citations.] It is not theory but the impact of the rate order which counts. If the total effect of the rate order cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable, judicial inquiry under the Act is at an end.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The order of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Gibson, C. J., Traynor, J., Schauer, J., Peters, J., White, J., and Dooling, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a rehearing was denied July 19, 1961.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-11\">Section 1756 of the Public Utilities Code reads: Within 30 days after the application for a rehearing is denied, or, if the application is granted, then within 30 days after the decision on rehearing, the applicant may apply to the Supreme Court of this State for a writ of certiorari or review for the purpose of having the lawfulness of the original order or decision or of the order or decision on rehearing inquired into and deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>mined.

The applicant sought and seeks authority to increase its rates for general flat rate service from a basic amount of $3 per service connection per month to \u00a74.50, a 50 per cent increase, and to increase its general metered service rates from \u00a72.50 per meter per month for the first 1,000 cubic feet or less to \u00a73.75, with corresponding increases in the unit quantity rates, also representing an increase of 50 per cent. The estimated increase in gross annual revenues at the proposed rates is approximately $375,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u201cA public hearing on the First Amendment to the application was held before Commissioner Rex Hardy and Examiner Stewart C. Warner on November 1, 1957, at Santa Ana. The purpose of said hearing was to establish a record as to whether or not the applicant should receive interim rate relief. Based upon such record, an interim opinion and order (Decision No. 56003, dated December 17, 1957) authorized the applicant to increase its monthly residential flat rate from \u00a73 to $3.75, with corresponding increases in the rates and charges in the general metered service schedule. Said interim decision found the existence of exigent circumstances, primarily a financial emergency, which justified the authorized increases in rates and charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u201cBy an order dated October 30, 1956, the above-entitled investigation was instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\u201cPublic hearings on both of the above matters were held on a consolidated record before Commissioner Hardy and Examiner Warner on December 26, 1957; before Commissioner Matthew J.

When decision is made by the Commission as to the use of accelerated depreciation, then such necessary adjustments, if any, will be made by the Commission in respect to income tax payments made by the utility.</p>\n<p id=\"A-8\">\u201cBased upon the entire record and being fully cognizant of the views of the various parties, the Commission makes the following findings and conclusions. In viewing such findings and conclusions it should be kept clearly in mind that the basic matters of concern in these proceedings are two: namely, applicant\u2019s request for increased revenues and the Commission\u2019s investigation of applicant\u2019s main extension practices. All other issues, although of some importance, are ancillary.</p>\n<p id=\"Acv\">\u201cIn the basic matter of revenues, the Commission finds that the revenues produced by the rates authorized in the interim order herein (Decision \u00d1o. 56003) have fully met the needs of the financial emergency then existing and foreseen. The Commission finds as a fact that there is not presently such an emergency situation as would necessitate or otherwise justify a continuance of the increased rates and charges authorized by such interim order. It is fair and reasonable and in the public interest, therefore, to terminate the rates and charges authorized on the interim basis.</p>\n<p id=\"ADa\">\u2018 \u2018 One ancillary issue directly affecting revenues and the earning position of applicant is that concerning the needs for metering of service connections. The evidence on this subject is substantial and convincing that the public interest requires that applicant\u2019s system be fully metered at the earliest practicable date. The record indicates, from the testimony of applicant\u2019s president, that the financing of a metering program would be feasible.2 It appears reasonable, therefore, to require that applicant immediately undertake the installation of meters on existing service connections at a rate of no fewer than 400 meters each month until all have been metered. All new service connections, of course, shall be metered as they are placed in service.</p>\n<p id=\"A4\"><em>\u2018 </em>The Commission finds that applicant\u2019s estimates of revenues, expenses and rate base for the year 1959 are unrealistic, unreliable and unreasonable. The estimates of the Commission staff, 8 however, are found to be fair and reasonable and are hereby adopted for the rate-making purposes of the proceeding. Such will be used in testing the reasonableness of applicant\u2019s earning position at the rates and charges in effect prior to the interim order herein. After making appropriate modifications to the staff-derived figures so as to recognize reasonable increased revenues, greater expenses and a higher rate base for a properly metered system and giving due cognizance of the trend of rate of return as occasioned by</p>\n<p id=\"AGN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the refunding of advances for construction during the year 1960 and subsequent years, the Commission concludes that applicant would earn a rate of return of somewhat more than 7 per cent on a depreciated rate base of approximately $2,269,000. The Commission finds such a rate of return on such a rate base to be within the zone of reasonableness and concludes, therefore, that the pre-interim rates and charges for water service will, during the foreseeable future, enable applicant to fully meter its system, provide sufficient and properly qualified personnel function efficiently, conform to all the requirements of law and to earn a fair and reasonable return on its investment in plant devoted to public utility water service. The pre-interim rates will be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqn\"><em>\" </em>In the basic matter of main-extension practices, the Commission finds that applicant has extended its water system into territory into which it had no right to extend, and pursuant to agreements which are unlawful.4 Such extensions have been imprudent and the resulting involvement in making repayment of large sums of money out of revenues to defray the cost of capital additions to applicant\u2019s plant, both within and without applicant\u2019s certificated area, made by persons as advances for construction, clearly constitutes unlawful conduct; reveals a failure to recognize the minimum responsibility incumbent on the part of applicant\u2019s management; and indicates a failure to apply prudent management principles in the conduct of applicant\u2019s public-utility water business. Further, it appears that applicant may have contracted for long-term debt\u201d without having obtained this Commission\u2019s authority therefor as required by law. The Commission would be derelict in its duty of protecting the public interest if it were to countenance any continuation of these unlawful and imprudent practices or permit the burdening of utility customers with added costs attributable to such improper practices. The Commission concludes that applicant must immediately cease and desist from any extension practice which does not comply strictly with the lawfully effective Rule No. 15 concerning main extensions.</p>\n<p id=\"As9\">\"The Commission finds as a fact that the public interest and standard accounting practices require that applicant should be directed to adjust its books of account to conform to the balance sheet as of December 31, 1957, after adjustments, as shown on Table 4-B of Exhibit No. 19; that applicant should be directed to continue to carry out and place into effect the staff recommendations contained in Chapter 16 of Exhibit No. 19; and that applicant should be directed to immediately dispose of its recorded contributions pursuant to the classification and itemization in Appendix C of Exhibit No. 44 in accordance with the staff recommendations contained in Chapter 4 of said exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"A7V\">\u2018\u2018The Commission finds as a fact that the rates and charges for water service hereinafter ordered to be reinstated are for the future fair and reasonable rates and are justified by the record in this proceeding.
