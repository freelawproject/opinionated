Several days thereafter defendant deposited $1,500 in escrow; he did not take possession of the premises until January 20, 1959, but immediately made application for a beer license. On January 20,1959, defendant took possession, paid outside of escrow directly to plaintiff the sum of $372.92 for stock on hand, and discovered certain defects in the equipment and the premises, which defects he caused to be repaired prior to obtaining a city license. For these repairs he paid the sum of $171.48.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>On May 12,1959, the escrow holder notified the parties that the escrow was ready to close. On May 25, 1959, plaintiff and defendant, meeting at the escrow office, were unable to agree concerning payment for the repairs. A dispute arose. Thereafter, plaintiff went to the bar to collect the May payment of $100 due under the conditional sales contract. After defendant paid the $100, plaintiff told him she was going to see her attorney if he did not pay the remaining $1,500 in escrow, waive any claim against her for the repairs, and permit the escrow to close.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The next day, May 26, defendant received a letter from plaintiff\u2019s attorney demanding immediate possession of the premises. The following day, May 27, plaintiff filed the present action, mainly in claim and delivery; and pursuant to a writ of possession the marshal took possession of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\"><em>Questions: </em>First. <em>Did the trial court err in awarding judgment to defendant on his counterclaim for $1,500, the amount deposited in the escrow ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\"><em>Yes. </em> In this state the terms and conditions of an escrow must be performed. The doctrine of substantial performance does not apply, and no title passes prior to full performance of the terms of the escrow agreement. <em>(Hildebrand </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>196 Cal. 141, 145 [1] et seq. [236 P. 301, 39 A.L.R. 1076] ; <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Vestermark, </em>145 Cal.App.2d 374, 377 [1] et seq. [302 P.2d 347].)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\"> Applying the foregoing rule to the facts of the present ease, it is clear that the title to the $1,500 which defendant had placed in escrow never passed to plaintiff, and therefore defendant could recover it from the escrow holder and was not entitled to a judgment against plaintiff for this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">There is nothing in the record to show that the $1,500 is not now in the escrow. Therefore, we need not consider the situation which would exist if the money had in fact been taken out of escrow with defendant\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">Second. <em>Did the trial court err in allowing defendant on his counterclaim the sum of $397.25 upon the theory that plaintiff had wrongfully converted fixtures and equipment of the beer tavern consisting of a bar, back bar, shuffieboard, cocktail sink, tap beer box, beer bottle box, stools, and miscellaneous items of personal property belonging to defendant?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\"><em>Yes. </em>Under the terms of the escrow agreement the fixtures and equipment of Carol\u2019s bar and restaurant were part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the assets defendant agreed to purchase through escrow under a conditional sales contract. Title thereto would pass to defendant neither under the agreement nor under the law relating to the passing of title in escrow transactions until all the conditions of the escrow had been performed and the escrow closed. <em>(Todd </em>v. <em>Vestermark, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.2d 374, 377 [5] et seq.; <em>cf. Helperin </em>v. <em>Guzzardi, </em>108 Cal.App.2d 125, 128 [2] et seq. [238 P.2d 141].) Since such contingency did not occur, defendant never acquired ownership of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In addition, there is no evidence in the record as to the market value of the fixtures or other items for which the trial court allowed this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Gibson, C. J., Traynor, J., Schauer, J., Peters, J., White, J., and Dooling, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
