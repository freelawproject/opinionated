N. Sebastian, from a declaratory judgment which determined that Standard is primarily liable for the payment of a judgment for personal injuries which judgment was obtained by Harold Lee Garmon against James L. Scott, who was the operator of an automobile owned by Sebastian and which caused the above injuries to Garmon.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">The principal contention by Standard is that it may not be adjudged in the instant action that Scott was operating Sebastian\u2019s automobile with that owner\u2019s permission, so as to become an \u201cadditional insured\u201d under the omnibus coverage clause in the policy it issued to Sebastian, since it has already been adjudicated that Scott was not operating the Sebastian automobile at the time and place of the accident with Sebas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>tian\u2019s permission within the meaning of Vehicle Code, then section 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">On April 11, 1957, Sebastian drove his automobile onto the premises of Quick Way Car Wash (hereinafter referred to as Quick Way), in Inglewood. He drove up to the point where the driving chain is hooked onto the cars, alighted leaving his keys in the car, and paid the attendant. He spoke to no one, and immediately left the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">When the Sebastian automobile reached the end of the washing process, it was driven by Scott, an employee of Quick Way, away from the end of the washing machinery. Garmon, also a Quick Way employee, was inside an enclosure on the premises polishing another automobile a short distance from the end of the washing machine. Scott drove Sebastian\u2019s car into the automobile on which Garmon was working, pinning Garmon against the wall of the enclosure and thereby injuring him.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Garmon brought an action against Scott as the operator, and against Sebastian as the owner of the automobile. Sebastian\u2019s alleged liability was predicated exclusively on the provisions of Vehicle Code, then section 402, which made the owner responsible for the negligence of persons operating his vehicle with the owner\u2019s express or implied permission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Garmon obtained a judgment for $17,500 against Scott based on the latter\u2019s negligence, but judgment was in favor of the owner Sebastian. Scott did not appeal, but Garmon appealed from the judgment in favor of Sebastian, contending that as a matter of law the evidence established Sebastian\u2019s liability for Scott\u2019s negligence under Vehicle Code, section 402. The judgment was affirmed. <em>(Garmon </em>v. <em>Sebastian, </em>181 Cal.App. 2d 254 [5 Cal.Rptr. 101].)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In the case just cited the District Court of Appeal held that: \u201cUnder the evidence in this case the jury was not bound to find that . . . [Sebastian] had reason to anticipate that his ear would be moved near the polishing enclosure. ... We cannot say that there was not substantial support in the evidence for the implied finding of the jury that the permission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>given by . . . [Sebastian] did not embrace driving the automobile to a point away from the usual place of parking cars freshly washed but that such permission was limited to such usual movement.\u201d <em>(Garmon </em>v. <em>Sebastian, supra, </em>181 Cal. App.2d 254, 260.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The present action for declaratory relief was instituted by Exchange Casualty and Surety Company (hereinafter referred to as Exchange), Scott\u2019s insurer, against Scott, Garmon, and Sebastian. Exchange alleged that because of certain exemptions in the automobile liability policy which it issued to Scott, Exchange was not responsible for that driver\u2019s liability to Garmon. Garmon filed a cross-complaint against Scott, Exchange, Sebastian, and Standard, which alleged that Scott was an additional insured under the terms of the policy which Standard issued to Sebastian. Garmon\u2019s theory was that Scott was operating the automobile with Sebastian\u2019s implied permission within the meaning of Standard\u2019s insurance contract with Sebastian, so that Standard was liable for Garmon\u2019s judgment against Scott.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The policy which Standard issued to Sebastian provided under \u201cDefinition of Insured,\u201d that: \u201c.. . the unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 includes the named insured [Sebastian] and, . . . any person while using the automobile . . . provided the actual use of the automobile is . . . with the permission of . . . [Sebastian or his spouse].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Standard as a cross-defendant contended that Scott was not operating the automobile with Sebastian\u2019s permission, and that the issue of permission had been adjudicated in Sebastian\u2019s and thus in Standard\u2019s favor in the prior action. Standard asserted the further defense that it was exempt from liability for Garmon\u2019s judgment against Scott because its policy did not provide coverage for accidents arising out of the operation of an automobile sales agency, repair shop, service station, storage garage, or public parking place, and which occurred while the Sebastian automobile was being operated by any employee of such establishments. Standard claimed that Quick Way was in the nature of a service station or public parking place, and that therefore the employee Scott was not covered at the time and place of the accident. These contentions present the basic issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In support of the finding that Scott drove with Sebastian\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>permission was the following testimony on the cross-examination of Sebastian: \u201cQ: Mr. Sebastian, did you ever instruct anyone at the car wash not to drive your car while it was at the car wash ? A: No. Q: Did you ever instruct anyone at the car wash where your ear could be driven on the premises of the car wash ? A: No. Q: When you drove your car up there on this particular day, the day of the accident, did you place any restrictions on the movement or use of your ear? A: No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The trial court expressly found \u201cthat defendant Scott, at the time and place of said accident of April 11, 1957, was driving the automobile of the defendant Sebastian with the latter\u2019s permission within the meaning of the terms of the liability insurance policy which had been issued and sold by cross-defendant [Standard] ... to defendant Sebastian, and which policy was in full force and effect on April 11, 1957.\u201d The evidence furnishes substantial support for this finding. The court also found that \u201cQuick Way Car Wash is not an automobile sales agency, repair shop, service station, storage garage, or public parking place,\u201d within the meaning of the above-mentioned exclusionary clause in Standard's policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In his memorandum opinion, the trial judge observed: \u201cIt is common knowledge that after a vehicle is washed it is usually driven to a different place upon the premises for the completion of the operation and that thereafter, if the owner is not present to take immediate delivery of the car, it is driven to some place upon the premises to be parked. In the light of this, it must be assumed that one who entrusts his automobile to an auto-wash thereby manifests his consent to the operation of his automobile by the employees thereof within the premises and for a purpose reasonably related to that for which it is entrusted to them. \u2019 \u2019 The trial court also observed: \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>The issues in the two actions are not the same in that in the former action liability as against the defendant Sebastian as owner of the automobile was predicated upon the provisions of then section 402 of the Vehicle Code, wherein the liability here asserted against Standard as Sebastian\u2019s insurance carrier is predicated upon the provisions of its policy.\u201d The court concluded that the former judgment was not res judicata on the issue of permission and that Scott was an \u201cadditional insured\u201d within the meaning of Standard\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Judgment was entered in favor of Garmon against Exchange and against Standard, for the payment of Garmon\u2019s prior judgment against Scott. But because of the operation of Ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>change\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, Standard\u2019s liability was deemed to be primary, and Exchange\u2019s liability to be excess. Exchange did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Standard now contends on appeal, in addition to the contentions heretofore set out, that as Sebastian\u2019s indemnitor it is favorably bound by the prior judgment in favor of Sebastian, and that the prior adjudication precludes Garmon\u2019s instant suit against Standard because of the operation of the doctrine of collateral estoppel. But if the question of Sebastian\u2019s permission within the context of Vehicle Code, section 402, for Scott to operate his automobile is a different question from that of Sebastian\u2019s permission for Scott\u2019s operation within the context of the liability insurance policy issued to Sebastian, then Standard may not rely upon the prior adjudication by invoking the doctrine of collateral estoppel as to the instant issues. (See <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co., </em>39 Cal.2d 420, 424 [247 P.2d <em>1]; Osborne </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>155 Cal.App.2d 201, 208-210 [318 P.2d 94] ; <em>cf. Harbor Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Paulson, </em>135 Cal.App.2d 22, 29-30 [286 P.2d 870].)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\"> In that connection the prior action against Sebastian was based solely upon his imputed statutory liability as an owner under Vehicle Code, section 402, which section must be construed in a manner not favoring imposition of liability on the otherwise nonnegligent owner. <em>(Weber </em>v. <em>Pinyan, </em>9 Cal. 2d 226, 229-230 [70 P.2d 183,112 A.L.R. 407]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>185 Cal.App.2d 278, 281-282 [8 Cal.Rptr. 316].)  The present action by Garmon against Standard is founded exclusively on the claim that Scott is an additional insured within the terms of an insurance contract issued by Standard, and it is well established that uncertainties in such contracts must be construed in favor of imposing liability on the insurer. <em>(Arenson </em>v. <em>National Auto. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>48 Cal.2d 528, 539 [310 P.2d 961] ; <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., supra, </em>155 Cal. App.2d 201, 207; <em>Ritchie </em>v. <em>Anchor Casualty Co., </em>135 Cal. App.2d 245, 257 [286 P.2d 1000].)  Specifically, uncertainties created by the language of the contract as to the persons protected are to be construed in favor of imposing liability on the insurer <em>(Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Constr. Co., </em>46 Cal.2d 423, 437-438 [296 P.2d 801, 57 A.L.R.2d 914]), and as the injured third party, Garmon may take advantage of the rules of strict construction applicable against Standard. <em>(Harbor Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Paulson, supra, </em>135 Cal.App. 2d 22, <em>26; Sly </em>v. <em>Americm Indemnity Co., </em>127 Cal.App. 202, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>207-208 [15 P.2d 522].)  It is thus manifest that even though the evidence as to Scott\u2019s permitted operation of the Sebastian automobile may have been similar in the prior and in the instant action, the issue of permission to be decided in each proceeding was different because of the operation of the opposing modes of construction applicable to the imputed liability statute in the first action, and the insurance contract in the present action. It follows that the question of Scott\u2019s permission within the terms of Standard\u2019s policy was not litigated in the prior action and the principles of collateral estoppel do not apply in favor of Standard. <em>(Estate of Williams, </em>36 Cal.2d 289, 292 [223 P.2d 248, 22 A.L.R.2d 716] ; <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>63 Cal.App.2d 94, 97 [146 P.2d 279] ; Rest., Judgments, \u00a7 68; see also <em>Greenfield </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>32 Cal.2d 23, 45-46 [194 P.2d 1].) We are likewise persuaded that Standard may not invoke the principle of res judicata, since Garmon\u2019s suit against Sebastian based upon that owner\u2019s section 402 liability is a different cause of action from Garmon\u2019s action against Standard based upon the insurance policy itself. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Hawkinson, </em>47 Cal.2d 893, 895 [306 P.2d 797] ; Rest., Judgments, \u00a748.)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Standard also argues that since it has been held in <em>Wildman </em>v. <em>Government Employees\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>48 Cal.2d 31, 39-40 [307 P.2d 359], that the provisions of Vehicle Code, then section 402 are read into every policy of liability insurance in effect in this state by reason of Vehicle Code, then section 415,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it follows necessarily that the meaning of the word \u201cpermission\u201d employed in the policy and in former section 402 must be identical, and thus must be given the same construction.  But the claimed incorporation of former section 402 into the policy of insurance would require only that the scope of \u201cpermission\u201d within the context of such an automobile liability policy must be at least as broad as the scope of \u201cpermission\u201d within former section 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">It is manifest from what we have heretofore said that the scope of \u201cpermission\u201d under such a policy may in certain situations be broader than the scope of \u201cpermission\u201d under former section 402, because a different rule of construction is applicable to the owner\u2019s liability statute than to the construction of an automobile liability policy, and \u201cpermis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>sion\u201d within the two contexts need not be construed in a similar manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">It is also urged by Standard that our holding in the case at bar should be strongly influenced by <em>Hinchey </em>v. <em>Sellers, </em>7 N.Y.2d 287 [165 N.E.2d 156], wherein a prior action which litigated the question of the owner\u2019s consent to the operator under the terms of an automobile liability insurance policy was held to bar, upon the principles of collateral estoppel, a subsequent action involving the question of that owner\u2019s consent under an owner\u2019s imputed liability statute analogous to our former section 402. However, the suit on the automobile liability policy in <em>Hinchey </em>preceded the action under the automobile owners\u2019 liability statute, and it would appear that the determination of the question of consent or permission under the construction given the language of an automobile liability policy could be deemed to include the narrow construction <em>(Leppard </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>225 App.Div. 162, 164 [232 N.Y.Supp. 454, 456]) given to consent or permission in the context of an owners\u2019 liability statute.  But the converse would not be true, i.e., that permission under an owners\u2019 liability statute would necessarily include permission within the context of an automobile liability policy. Since the case now engaging our attention represents the converse of the above situation in the <em>Hinchey </em>case, it appears that our instant determination is in accord in principle with the result in <em>Hinchey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Standard also refers us to the recently decided case of <em>Home Indemnity Co., New York </em>v. <em>Lechner, </em>191 F. Supp. 116, which determined the issue of whether that federal court should grant declaratory relief, directed to the question of whether the operator of a vehicle involved in an accident was driving with the permission of the named insured within the context of an automobile liability insurance policy, while there was an action pending in a California court involving the question of that owner\u2019s permission to the operator within the context of Vehicle Code, section 17150. (Formerly \u00a7 402, subd. (a).) In dismissing the suit for declaratory relief, the federal court in <em>Lechner </em>concluded that if the California court found that the operator of the vehicle was driving with permission of the owner within the meaning of Vehicle Code, section 17150, \u201cthen the broad terms of the insurance policy defining \u2018insured\u2019 would include [the driver], and the issue of driving with permission would be decided for all purposes.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>(191 P. Supp. 116, 122.) It thus appears that the Lechner case is also in accord with our instant holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">It is manifest that \u201cpermission\u201d under the omnibus clause of the policy issued to Sebastian must be deemed to include express or implied permission. <em>(Norris </em>v. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co., supra, </em>39 Cal.2d 420, 423.)  Also, whether the requisite permission was present at the time and place of the accident is a question of fact. (See <em>Hobbs </em>v. <em>Transport Motor Co., </em>22 Cal.2d 773, 778 [141 P.2d 738].)  The trial court was thus fully justified in concluding that Scott operated the vehicle with Sebastian\u2019s permission, so as to become an additional insured under Standard\u2019s policy. That factual conclusion of \u201cpermission,\u201d supported as it is by substantial evidence and legitimate inferences therefrom, may not be disturbed on appeal. <em>(Crawford </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>3 Cal.2d 427, 429 [45 P.2d 183].)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">As an additional basis for its non-liability for Garmon\u2019s judgment against Scott, Standard urges us to consider the following provision in the policy it issued to Sebastian. The section \u201cDefinition of Insured,\u201d reads: \u201cThe insurance with respect to any person or organization other than the named insured or such spouse does not apply: (1) to any person or organization, or to any agent or employee thereof, operating an automobile sales agency, repair shop, service station, storage garage or public parking place, with respect to any accident arising out of the operation thereof. ...\u201d Standard particularly urges that since Scott was an employee of a car wash, and since the car wash was in the nature of a service station or public parking place, it is exempted from the instant liability by the above terms of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">However, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the trial court correctly concluded that Quick Way was not included as within the above exempted establishments, since the application of the above exclusion would be contrary to the public policy of this state as expressed in Vehicle Code, then section 415,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and interpreted in <em>Wildman </em>v. <em>Government Employee\u2019s Ins. Co., supra, </em>48 Cal.2d 31, 39.  It was stated in <em>Wild-man </em>that \u201cfor an insurer to issue a policy of insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>which does not cover an accident which occurs when a person, other than the [named] insured, is driving with the permission and consent of the [named] insured is a violation of the public policy of this state as set forth in sections 402 and 415 of the Vehicle Code.\u201d We have also held in <em>American Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Republic Indemnity Co., supra, </em>52 Cal.2d 507, 509-511, that a condition to a liability policy purporting to exclude coverage for customers operating vehicles of the named insured automobile dealer, and with that dealer\u2019s permission, was invalid because of the provisions of section 415 and the rule of the <em>Wildman </em>ease. (See also <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Constr. Co., supra, </em>46 Cal. 2d 423, 438; <em>Bonfils </em>v. <em>Pacific Auto. Ins. Co., </em>165 Cal.App.2d 152, 157-158 [331 P.2d 766]; <em>Cassin </em>v. <em>Financial Indemnity Co., </em>160 Cal.App.2d 631, 635 [325 P.2d 228] [condition of policy excluding coverage while automobile was operated by anyone over 60 years of age not effective because Vehicle Code, section 415, subd. (2), requires that automobile liability policy shall insure permittees of the named insured].)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Section 415 of the Vehicle Code provided that: \u201cA \u2018motor vehicle liability policy,\u2019 . . . issued ... to or for the benefit of the person named therein as assured, . . . shall meet the following requirements: ... (2) Such policy shall insure the person named therein and any other person using or responsible for the use of said motor vehicle . . . with the express or implied permission of said assured. (3) Such policy <em>shall insure every said person on account of the maintenance, use or operation </em>of every motor vehicle therein covered . . . against loss from the liability imposed by law arising from such <em>maintenance, use or operation. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Initially, it is clear that the phrase \u201cevery said person,\u201d in the above subdivision (3), refers to \u201cthe person named therein and any other person using . . . said motor vehicle . . . with the express or implied permission of said assured,\u201d in above subdivision (2), of section 415. Therefore, since we may not disturb the instant trial court\u2019s conclusion that Scott was operating the vehicle with the permission of the named insured, and since Scott was engaged in the maintenance of the Sebastian automobile at the time of the accident, subdivisions (2) and (3) of section 415 compel the conclusion that the policy which Standard issued to Sebastian would be invalid to the extent that it failed to provide coverage for Scott during the occurrence of the within accident.  A motor vehicle liability policy issued in this state is deemed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>include all coverage required by law <em>(Osborne </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., supra, </em>155 Cal.App.2d 201, 210), and any clause in such a contract which conflicts with law may not be enforced. <em>Canadian Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>West Nat. Ins. Co., </em>134 Cal.App.2d 512 [286 P.2d 532], is hereby disapproved to the extent that it approved and applied the similar \u201cgarage exclusion\u201d there involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">While Standard appealed from the whole of the judgment, it has not attacked the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Standard\u2019s liability was primary for Garmon\u2019s judgment against Scott, and that of Exchange, Scott\u2019s insurance carrier, was excess. The trial court\u2019s above conclusion appears to be correct on the authority of <em>American Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Republic Indemnity Co., supra, </em>52 Cal.2d 507, 511-513, which involved an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause similar to that which Exchange included in the policy issued to Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Gibson, C.
