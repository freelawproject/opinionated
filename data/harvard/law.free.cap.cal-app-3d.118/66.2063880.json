Specifically, the Controller asserts that Seth McKenna\u2019s will conveyed life estates coupled with general powers of appointment to each of his two sisters. The respondent estate contends that Seth McKenna\u2019s will conveyed life estates only. The determination of the nature of the interests devised to each of the sisters will affect the future calculation of inheritance taxes in <em>their </em>estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">By a will dated July 11, 1973, Seth McKenna made a bequest to his sisters. Paragraph Third of the will provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">\u201cI give all my right, title and interest to the properties and interests therein described in this Paragraph A in equal shares to my sisters, Mary McKenna Parvin ... and Emma Eugenia McKenna ... for life, with power to enjoy the use and maintenance and income thereof, after payment of taxes and other expenses in connection therewith, and with power to sell the same and enjoy the proceeds thereof provided that the donee also is willing to sell her own -interest therein in a similar manner and for an equivalent price. If one of my said sisters should die leaving the other surviving, I leave all of her remaining interest to such surviving sister for life. I further direct that upon the death of both of my said sisters, or in the event that neither of them shall survive me for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days, then that share or any portion of my estate that is then remaining, or the proceeds thereof, shall be given to my nephew, Edward Parvin, presently living in the Los Gatos, California, area. [II] (It is my intention in this Paragraph A to create an interest similar to that held to be a life estate in <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Flournoy </em>(1969) 76 Cal.Rptr. 289.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>While Seth McKenna\u2019s estate was in probate, Emma Eugenia Mc-Kenna died. Edward Parvin, remainderman and administrator of the will annexed of Seth McKenna\u2019s estate, filed a petition for determination of entitlement to distribution (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1080). The petition specified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\">\u201cAn uncertainty exists among the devisees and legatees of the will, as to whether Mary Parvin and Eugenia McKenna were devised a mere life estate or a life estate with a general power of appointment or some other interest in the property described in the Third clause of the Will of Seth McKenna, on file with this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\u201cPetitioner is the named remainderman in the Will of Seth Mc-Kenna, deceased. Petitioner is also the Executor and a legatee of the Estate of Eugenia McKenna, now deceased, and being probated in this Court under file No. 96127, and petitioner would take title to her possible interest in said property in trust for the benefit of his children, pursuant to the terms of her Will if such interest is subject to the terms of her Will. Mary Parvin, sister of decedent Seth McKenna, is a widow and the mother of petitioner, her only child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The petition prayed that the court determine the nature of the interests conveyed to Mary Parvin, the estate of Eugenia McKenna and Edward N. Parvin by Seth McKenna\u2019s will. The Controller appeared in the Probate Code section 1080 declaratory proceeding, expressing the belief that \u201cthe subject petition was filed for the sole purpose of affecting the inheritance tax in the estate of Emma Eugenia McKenna.. . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The superior court found that Seth McKenna intended to convey and did convey \u201ca life estate coupled with a limited power of sale\u201d with a remainder in fee simple absolute to E. N. Parvin. Further, the court specifically decreed that Seth McKenna did not convey powers of appointment or fee interests to Mary Parvin or Emma Eugenia McKenna.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">We disagree with the judgment below; however, we do not agree entirely with the Controller\u2019s position. We find that Seth McKenna intended to convey and did convey life estates coupled with powers of appointment to his sisters, Mary Parvin and Eugenia McKenna, but we find that the powers of appointment were limited, not general.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">No extrinsic evidence was introduced in the superior court. The interpretation of the will is thus one of law not of fact <em>(Estate of Arm</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>strong </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 796, 801 [17 Cal.Rptr. 138, 366 P.2d 490]), and we are not bound by the lower court\u2019s construction. <em>(Estate of Russell </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 200, 213 [70 Cal.Rptr. 561, 444 P.2d 353]; <em>Estate of Meyer </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 747, 751 [51 Cal.Rptr. 72]; <em>Estate of Logan </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 717, 722 [148 Cal.Rptr. 819].) We must construe the will, insofar as possible, to give effect to the testator\u2019s intention. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 101; <em>Estate of Russell, supra, </em>at p. 205; <em>Estate of Armstrong, supra, </em>at p. 803.) The \u201cintention\u201d is that expressed in the will itself. <em>(Estate of Cummings </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 661, 668 [69 Cal.Rptr. 792].) Still, if the probate court\u2019s interpretation is reasonable and consistent with the testator\u2019s intention, the construction below should be affirmed. <em>(Estate of Cummings, supra, </em>at p. 667.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">For inheritance tax purposes, a power to invade or consume the corpus of an estate is a power of appointment. <em>(Estate of Cohen </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 41, 49-50 [92 Cal.Rptr. 684, 480 P.2d 300]; <em>Estate of Morse </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 411, 415-416 [88 Cal.Rptr. 52].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The relevant provisions of the Revenue and Taxation Code are sections 13692 and 13693:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Section 13692 provides as follows: \u201c\u2018General power of appointment\u2019\u201d means a power which is exercisable in favor of the decedent, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate, provided that the following shall not be deemed to be general powers of appointment:</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\"> \u201c(a) A power to consume, invade, or appropriate property for the benefit of the decedent which is limited by an ascertainable standard relating to the health, education, support, or maintenance of the decedent.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u201c(b) A power not exercisable by the decedent except in conjunction with the creator of the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u201c(c) A power not exercisable by the decedent except in conjunction with a person having a substantial interest in the property subject to the power, which is adverse to exercise of the power in favor of the decedent. For the purposes of this subsection a person who, after the death of the decedent, may be possessed of a power of appointment (with respect to the property subject to the decedent\u2019s power) which he may exercise in his own favor shall be deemed as having an interest in the property and such interest shall be deemed adverse to such exercise of the decedent\u2019s power.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u201cIf the power is exercisable by the decedent only in conjunction with another person and if after the application of subdivisions (b) and (c) the power is a general power of appointment and is exercisable in favor of such other person, such power shall be deemed a general power of appointment only in respect of a fractional part of the property subject to such power, such part to be determined by dividing the value of such property by the number of such persons (including the decedent) in favor of whom such power is exercisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u201cFor purposes of subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section, a power shall be deemed to be exercisable in favor of a person if it is exercisable in favor of such person, his estate, his creditors or the creditors of his estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Section 13693 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">\u201c\u2018Limited power of appointment\u2019 means a power which does not qualify under the preceding section as a general power of appointment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">The present tax scheme applicable to powers of appointment treats <em>the creation </em>of either a general or a limited power of appointment as a taxable transfer from the donor-decedent to the donee. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 13694, added by Stats. 1965.) Thus, for purposes of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>heritance tax calculation in the Seth McKenna estate, designation of the power as general or limited is of no consequence. However, either the exercise or nonexercise of a general power is taxable again in a donee-decedent\u2019s estate (\u00a7 13696, added by Stats. 1965), while the exercise or nonexercise of a limited power may not be taxed in a donee\u2019s estate (\u00a7 13695, added by Stats. 1965).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Central to both parties\u2019 arguments concerning the power of appointments is <em>In re Lewis </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 371 [76 Cal.Rptr. 289], the case referred to in Seth McKenna\u2019s will as <em>\u201cLewis </em>v. <em>Flournoy.\u201d </em>The pertinent dispositive provision in that case said \u201c\u2018Second:\u2014I hereby give, devise and bequeath to my beloved wife, Ada Fannie Lewis, all the property of my estate, both real and personal, of whatsoever kind or character, and wheresoever situated, for her use and maintenance, with full power to sell any or all of said property as she may see fit; and I further direct that upon her death any of my estate that is then remaining shall be divided equally, share and share alike, among my six children, to-wit:\u2014George Benton Lewis, Frank Read Lewis, James Raymond Lewis, Thomas Ralph Lewis, Anna Irene Lewis, and John Edwin Lewis.\u2019\u201d (At p. 373.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Respondent first argues that the <em>Lewis </em>will created only a life estate. We disagree. The issue in <em>Lewis </em>was whether the decree of distribution in a prior estate (that of Thomas Benton Lewis, husband of decedent Ada Lewis) had incorporated Thomas Benton Lewis\u2019 will by reference. If it had not, the Controller and Ada Lewis\u2019 estate agreed that the assets of her husband had been conveyed to Ada Lewis in fee simple. If, on the other hand, the prior decree had incorporated the prior will, the parties stipulated that the assets were conveyed to Ada Lewis as a life estate with a limited power to consume. <em>(Lewis, supra, </em>at p. 374.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">In a reference to the Thomas Lewis bequest, the <em>Lewis </em>court commented: \u201cIt is well settled that a bequest or devise to a surviving spouse in general terms, without stating whether it is a fee or life estate, with broad powers of enjoyment or disposition, but with a gift over to subsequent takers of what remains on the death of the survivor, should be construed to create a life estate and not a fee in the survivor. <em>(Colburn </em>v. <em>Burlingame </em>[1923] 190 Cal. 697, 702 .. .; <em>King </em>v. <em>Hawley </em>[1952] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>113 Cal.App.2d 534, 538-549 ...; 31 Cal.Jur.2d Life Estates, \u00a7 10, p. 318.)\u201d <em>(Lewis, supra, </em>at p. 377.) Respondent stresses the fact that the <em>Lewis </em>court made no reference to the power of consumption. As the Controller points out, however, the existence or nonexistence of the power apparently had no tax consequences in the case. Ada Lewis died February 21, 1965, prior to the enactment of the present section 13696 which taxes the unexercised general power of appointment upon a donee\u2019s death. Moreover, we agree with the Controller that the reference to \u201cbroad powers of enjoyment or disposition\u201d by the <em>Lewis </em>court is a reference to the power of consumption stipulated to by the parties. The court\u2019s references to the <em>Colburn </em>and <em>King </em>cases support this conclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Moreover, <em>Lewis </em>was relied upon more recently in <em>Morse, supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.3d 411, 417, in support of that court\u2019s holding that the decedent had granted his wife a life estate and a general power of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>appointment.* **<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Morse, </em>the decedent left his wife the entire estate after two small bequests and directed that upon her death one-half of the estate \u201cremaining, if any\u201d (at p. 414) should go to their son. Respondent argues that \u201cremaining, if any\u201d is vastly different from the language used in the <em>Lewis </em>will and from the language used by Seth McKenna (\u201cany portion of my estate that is then remaining, or the proceeds thereof\u201d). The Controller argues with equal force that the language is identical. Even if it were plain (which it is not) that the <em>Morse </em>court was quoting from the decedent\u2019s will in that case, we would decline to rest our interpretation of Seth McKenna\u2019s gift to the sisters solely on this one phrase.  \u201cNo particular form of words is necessary to create a power of appointment.\u201d <em>(Estate of Rosecrans </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 34, 38 [92 Cal.Rptr. 680, 480 P.2d 296].) The object of the inheritance tax law \u201c\u2018is to include in a decedent\u2019s estate, regardless of . . . gossamer distinctions . . . about powers, special powers, powers in trust, and the like, all economic value which a decedent was in a position to divert to his own use if he desired.\u2019\u201d <em>(Estate of Nunn </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 799, 809 [112 Cal.Rptr. 199, 518 P.2d 1151].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Respondent argues further, however, that even if the language in <em>Lewis </em>created a life estate and a power to consume, still, Seth McKenna intended to create a life estate only. Respondent interprets the reference to <em>Lewis </em>as an indication that McKenna thought <em>Lewis </em>created only a simple life estate, and contends that this interpretation is reinforced by the reference in the will to \u201cpayment of taxes and other expenses\u201d which might well reduce the corpus, leaving an estate \u201cremaining.\u201d Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">It may well be that Seth McKenna\u2019s intention was to avoid subsequent inheritance tax on the gift to his sisters. And, arguably, it may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>that he thought he was accomplishing this by the provision and the reference to <em>Lewis.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To adopt respondent\u2019s interpretation, however, would require us to rewrite the will beyond its plain meaning. The estate in <em>Lewis </em>was a life estate coupled with a power in the donee to consume (during her lifetime), not a fee simple.  Read in its entirety, the provision here plainly gives the sisters a power of consumption of the corpus of their life estates in that they were given a power to sell the corpus and \u201cenjoy the proceeds thereof\u201d in addition to the life estate in the corpus that had been bequeathed to them.8 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Then, after both sisters are deceased, \u201cany portion .. . that is then remaining\u201d is given to Parvin in fee simple absolute. The language obviously assumes that there might not be an estate or proceeds remaining and thus confirms our view that the testator intended to give the sisters a power to consume the corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Our inquiry, however, does not end there. Having determined that each sister received a power of appointment over her life estate, we must additionally determine whether the powers were general or limited. If they were limited, their exercise or nonexercise is not taxable in the sisters\u2019 estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Most of the case law dealing with limited powers of appointment deals with whether or not a testator successfully set \u201can ascertainable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>standard relating to the health, education, support or maintenance\u201d of the donee. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 13692, subd. (a); see, e.g., <em>Cory </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 631 [165 Cal.Rptr. 330]; <em>Estate of All-geyer </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 169 [129 Cal.Rptr. 820]; <em>Estate of Nunn, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 799.) There do not appear to be any California cases relating to section 13692, subdivision (c), but that section appears to be determinative here.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">The will in the case at bar gives a life estate and, as we have noted, a power of consumption to each sister. But the exercise of the power is limited in that one sister could not exercise it unless the other sister also exercised her power on the same terms with respect to her share. The will further provided that if one sister died, leaving the other sister surviving, then the surviving sister took the \u201cremaining interest\u201d of the decedent sister. Thus, the interest of each sister in the other sister\u2019s share of the Seth McKenna estate was adverse to the exercise of the power given each sister to consume her own share. The reason is clear. If a sister exercises her power to consume her share of the corpus, to that extent it diminishes the estate the other sister might have acquired should the former have predeceased the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Our views are buttressed, we believe, by relevant federal regulations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cThe manifest purpose of the 1965 revision was to conform state inheritance tax treatment of powers with the federal estate tax treatment and, consequently, we accord great weight to applicable federal administrative regulations and decisional law.\u201d <em>(Estate of Nunn, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at pp. 805-806.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We conclude that within the meaning of section 13692, subdivision (c) and section 13693 the will created a life estate with a limited power of appointment in each sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to proceed in accordance with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Scott, Acting P. J., and Barry-Deal, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 17, 1981.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\">One of the purposes of the 1965 California legislative amendments to the state\u2019s inheritance tax law was to conform the taxation of powers of appointment under California law to the practice under federal estate tax laws. <em>(Estate of Cohen, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 49.) Treasury regulation section 20.2041-1 (b)(1) provides: \u201cThe term \u2018power of appointment\u2019 includes <em>all powers which are in substance and effect powers of appointment regardless of the nomenclature used in creating the power </em>and regardless of local property law connotations. For example, if a trust instrument provides that the beneficiary may appropriate or consume the principal of the trust, <em>the power to consume or appropriate is a power of </em>appointment.\u201d (26 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.2041-l(b)(l), italics added; see <em>Estate of Cohen, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 49-50.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-9\">A11 citations are to the Revenue and Taxation Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b69-10\">\u201cDecedent\u201d in this section, plainly, includes \u201cdonee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqef\">\u201cWe reach this conclusion notwithstanding the fact that section 13692 defines a general power of appointment as one exercisable in favor of the decedent, among others, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>and section 13305 defines decedent as including, among others, a donor rather than a donee. But section 13302 provides that this definition of decedent does not govern 'where the context otherwise requires,\u2019 and a reading of the remaining two subdivisions of section 13692 demonstrates that in their context the word decedent can refer only to the donee of a power of appointment. We do not believe that the Legislature would have used the word decedent within the same section in two different senses without plainly indicating that it was doing so.\u201d <em>(Estate of Morse, supra, </em>9 Cal.App.3d at p. 415, fn. 2.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\">There is one exception but it is not relevant here. In the years preceding the 1965 amendments, powers of appointment were taxed by a variety of methods in California. An excellent summary of the legislative history is set forth in <em>Estate of Conroy </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 734, 742-743 [136 Cal.Rptr. 807].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Thus, for example, in <em>King </em>v.

(At p. 700.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Respondent argues that, because the question of the power of appointment was not precisely at issue in Morse, it cannot be considered as authority for a determination of when such a power exists. We disagree, as apparently the Supreme Court did when it relied on <em>Morse </em>in <em>Estate of Cohen, </em>supra, 4 Cal.3d at pages 50-51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b73-11\">For example, in <em>Estate of Smythe </em>(1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 343, 345 [282 P.2d 141], the will said: \u201c\u2018All that I possess 1 give and bequeath to this same RUTH SMYTH for her during her life time, as she may need or see fit to use. If, upon her death, any of my estate remains, it is my will that such remainder be divided equally through her will between PACIFIC HOME a California Corporation in Los Angeles, where I now reside, and the Church of the Messiah, of which I am now a Member.\u2019\u201d This was found to be a life estate with a power to consume. In <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Mayhew </em>(1910) 158 Cal. 95 [110 P. 113], the decree distributed property to Mayhew \u201cfor his use, during his natural life, and on his death the unused portion of said sum to\u201d children and grandchildren. Again, this was a life estate with a power. (At pp. 99-103.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\">One could argue, likely with more authority, that Seth McKenna in fact was making it absolutely plain that he wanted his sisters to have something more than a simple life estate, but less than a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"ApK\">Powers of consumption are often coupled with creation of life estates or with the creation of a trust wherein the donee, as a trustee, has a general power to invade the corpus and appoint to the beneficiary. And the nature and extent of the power varies from case to case. \u201c[A] general power of appointment may be so unlimited as to give its holder rights equivalent to absolute ownership.\u201d <em>(Estate of Rosecrans </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 34, 40 [92 Cal.Rptr. 680, 480 P.2d 296].) But that is not always so. For example, a donee may hold a general power (i.e., the power to appoint to himself) but still not have the power to appoint the remainder at his death or give away the property during his lifetime. (See, e.g., <em>King </em>v. <em>Hawley, </em>supra, 113 Cal.App.2d 534, 537-538; <em>Estate of Nunn, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 799, 809; <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Mayhew, supra, </em>158 Cal. 95, 100.) Revenue and Taxation Code section 13692 is explicit that so long as the donee is one of the permissible appointees, the power is a general one unless it falls within one of the three limiting exceptions. The life tenant donee of a general power of appointment is still liable to a remainderman (where the donor named one), as any life tenant would be, to exercise his rights of use and consumption with due regard for the rights of the remainderman. <em>(King </em>v. <em>Hawley, supra, </em>at p. 538.) The power to convey the corpus to oneself does not convert a life estate into a fee. <em>(Estate of Legatos </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 657, 660 [81 Cal.Rptr. 910].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The Controller concedes in his opening brief that the language \u201cwith power to sell the same and enjoy the proceeds thereof\u2019 is simply a power of sale. As is obvious from our discussion, we doubt that the concession was warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b75-10\">See 26 Code of Federal Regulations, section 20.2041-3(c) (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
