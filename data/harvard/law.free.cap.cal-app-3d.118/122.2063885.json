Berry of conspiracy to defraud (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182, subd. 4); two counts of grand theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7 487); attempted grand theft in counts four through ten (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664/487, subd. 1); forgery in counts eleven through fifteen (Pen. Code, \u00a7 470). The trial court sentenced Berry to local custody, one year imprisonment on count two, and a consecutive six-month sentence on count three. Berry asserts ineffective assistance of defense counsel pretrial required dismissal of the proceedings. Berry contends his lengthy tape-recorded interrogation conducted by the deputy district attorney in the San Diego County jail, plus a followup recorded interrogation in the district attorney\u2019s office and a polygraph administered by the Department of Justice polygrapher were products of poor legal advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The trial court, following a pretrial evidentiary hearing, generalized there was \u201cattorney malfunction\u201d at early stages of the prosecution but denied Berry\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Facts \u2014Pretrial Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Berry was arrested on multiple charges of real estate fraud. He was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and stated he wanted \u201cto consult an attorney.\u201d Retained counsel (Roger L. Thompson) visited him and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>informed of the nature of the conspiracy, grand theft, attempted grand theft and forgery charges made. After Berry\u2019s arraignment, his counsel spent two hours viewing discovery matters in the prosecutor\u2019s office (about one-half of discovery material was then available). Several witness interviews were not completed by the prosecution and no handwriting comparisons had been done at this point. Defense counsel did not seek independent interviews with witnesses nor his own expert handwriting evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Attorney Thompson was of the opinion such efforts were unnecessary since Berry had told him what documents he had signed in another\u2019s name. Berry admitted to his lawyer he had instructed codefendant John Hull to set up mail services in La Jolla under phony names. He told Thompson he and codefendant Faucher, a real estate broker, had met with a Mexican lawyer using fictitious names to transfer money to Mexico. Berry denied any criminal intent and claimed Faucher had misled him into believing there were powers of attorney authorizing Faucher, then Berry at Faucher\u2019s instructions, to sign names of absentee landowners to sell their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Berry was a high school graduate with about three years of college credit and some law school training and thirty years of business experience. Thompson explained to Berry that if he were criminally involved \u201cwe don\u2019t talk to anybody.\u201d Berry assured Thompson he was completely innocent\u2014Faucher was responsible. He claimed he lacked knowledge or awareness that anything was wrong with the real estate transaction. In short, his claim was lack of mens rea. On several occasions Berry spoke to Thompson and professed his innocence. Based upon these protestations, Thompson concluded Berry was innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Berry sought release from jail for, among other reasons, he was having difficulty with his wife. Thompson testified the deputy district attorney handling the case was reluctant to recommend an OR release unless Berry could convince him, as he had Mr. Thompson, that he was innocent and Faucher was the real culprit. In such circumstance, the deputy district attorney would be willing to reduce bail or recommend an OR.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thompson represented the alternatives to Berry and explained the pitfalls and problems in talking to the district attorney. He told his client that talking to the district attorney was \u201ctalking to the enemy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>In this factual context, Thompson permitted the district attorney to interview Berry. Thompson sought to (1) achieve a bail reduction and (2) demonstrate, through cooperation, his client\u2019s innocence. What resulted was a detailed and thorough 90-minute tape-recorded interrogation in which Berry admitted: signing various signatures, including that of grantors and notaries on deeds; having Hull open a mail service for receipt of real estate documents using false names; and meeting with two attorneys\u2014one from Mexico\u2014under fictitious names, concerning transfer of large sums of money to Mexico. Berry firmly protested his lack of intent to steal. The reason? He trusted Faucher\u2019s representations regarding legal authority provided by a secret group of investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Contrary to Berry\u2019s expectations, the interviews strengthened the district attorney\u2019s resolution to proceed against Berry. However, there was a reduction of the bail and Berry was released from jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Thompson advised Berry on several occasions he should not take a polygraph examination if he had anything to hide. However, if everything was as Berry represented, Thompson felt Berry would benefit from a polygraph; he allowed Berry to make the final decision. Berry did take the polygraph examination and the results were unfavorable. At this point Thompson lost faith in his client. Attorney Joseph Milchen, a certified criminal law specialist and a former United States assistant attorney, expressed his opinion that Thompson\u2019s conduct was not that which could be reasonably expected of a reasonably competent attorney acting as a diligent advocate, giving these reasons: (1) Berry received no benefit in exchange for the initial interview; (2) Thompson \u25a0should not have exposed his client to the polygraph without first determining he could pass; and (3) the effect of the interview was to deprive Berry of the opportunity to require the prosecution to meet its burden of proof of facts as to the real estate fraud, depriving him of a meritorious defense\u2014lack of criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Facts\u2014The Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">There were 12 transactions. On each occasion, a man telephoned a north county real estate office offering to sell vacant lots in North County San Diego. The caller always wanted a quick cash sale and instructed the real estate agent to mail pertinent documents, the listing agreement, title reports and contracts in care of a fictitious attorney at various La Jolla mailing addresses. The real estate agent and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u201cseller\u201d never met in person. The purported seller always was unable to provide a telephone number at which he could be reached; signed documents were returned by mail messenger. The true owners of the lots offered for sale had no knowledge that their lots were being offered for sale; they had not signed any documents authorizing a sale. Berry signed the names of many of the true owners and also signed names of fictitious notaries on the documents. Faucher signed others.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At Berry\u2019s direction, Hull opened three mail service addresses in La Jolla using fictitious names. Berry provided Hull with the necessary cash and provided a list of names of those who might also expect to receive mail at these mail drops. The names given included actual owners of vacant lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Hull picked up mail from the mail service and delivered it to Berry. Upon receipt of the first message, Berry said \u201cit is started.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Berry and Faucher met with a Mexican attorney, Gomez, in San Ysidro to discuss investing money in Mexico. They used false names, Clark and Fisher respectively, during this meeting. At Berry\u2019s direction, Hull delivered two checks to Gomez in Mexico, a $32,000 check on the Souther transaction and a $37,000 check on the Lang transaction. These checks failed to clear because of forged indorsements. When Gomez later told Hull the checks would not clear because of fraud or forgery, Hull relayed the message to Berry who responded that everything was off.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Berry testified he was duped by Faucher into signing other peoples\u2019 names. Five witnesses described Faucher\u2019s penchant for the signing of names of others in real estate transactions. A former employer of Faucher had fired him for such activity. Berry had passed the exam for a real estate license and went to work for Faucher parttime. However, Berry did not demonstrate real estate experience and, while there, the company developed economic problems. Faucher told him he needed assistance with some out-of-state investors who would be buying and selling property. Berry said he arranged the mail drops and signed the numerous documents at Faucher\u2019s request, believing Faucher had authority to sign the names. After Berry was arrested and released on bail, Faucher, Berry testified, called him to apologize. The jury disbelieved Berry, convicted him on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Berry contends Thompson\u2019s pretrial representation was not that which could be reasonably expected of a reasonably competent attorney acting as a diligent advocate. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 425 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859].) Specifically, he claims Thompson led him on a \u201cblind adventure\u201d of cooperation with the prosecutor. After hearing evidence on the issue, the trial court generalized to the effect there had in fact been an \u201cattorney malfunction\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but denied Berry\u2019s pretrial motion to dismiss, reasoning that at best Berry would be entitled to a new trial\u2014but the case had not yet started; the entire matter was therefore \u201cmoot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">On appeal, Berry contends Attorney Thompson\u2019s ineffective assistance, bad advice pretrial, produced damaging admissions, leads to witnesses and disclosures of his defense and thereby impaired his ability to defend the action at trial. He argues Attorney Thompson\u2019s representation cost him a defense: the right to remain silent and put the prosecution to its proof. He asserts that dismissal is the only applicable remedy for the alleged deprivation of assistance of adequate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a defendant is entitled to have assistance of counsel for his defense and that right accrues as soon as the adversary proceedings have begun. <em>(Massiah </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964) 377 U.S. 201, 204-206 [12 L.Ed.2d 246, 249-250, 84 S.Ct. 1199].)  A defendant has rights under the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination. Questioning of a suspect must cease if he \u201cindicates in any manner and at any stage of the process that he wishes to consult with an attorney .. . . \u201d <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436, 444-445 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 706-707, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974].) The product of an interrogation can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>certainly affect the entire trial. <em>(Hamilton </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1961) 368 U.S. 52, 54 [7 L.Ed.2d 114, 116, 82 S.Ct. 157].)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The California Supreme Court has pointed out that \u201ca substantial portion of the obligation counsel owes is not directly connected with the trial but involves investigation and advice at pretrial and posttrial stages.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 412, 423.)  To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, an accused must establish that the attorney <em>\u201cfailed to act in a manner to be expected of reasonably competent attorneys acting as diligent advocates. In addition, appellant must establish that counsel\u2019s acts or omissions resulted in the withdrawal of a potentially meritorious </em>defense.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 425.) And that \u201cright is denied if trial counsel makes a critical tactical decision which would not be made by diligent, ordinarily prudent lawyers in criminal cases.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 424.) Moreover, diligent counsel have \u201ca \u2018\u201cduty to investigate carefully all defenses of fact and of law that may be available to the defendant\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 425) and \u201c\u2018[cjounsel should promptly advise his client of his rights and take all actions necessary to preserve <em>them(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Attorney Thompson\u2019s advice, strategy, is bottomed on his reliance upon Berry\u2019s continued protestation of innocence. Had Berry passed the polygraph test, the district attorney admits it would have been difficult to prosecute him. Had Berry been telling Thompson the truth concerning his lack of mens rea, then certainly his information relayed to the district attorney could have resulted in a dismissal or substantially reduced charges. Here Thompson had examined the prosecution\u2019s evidence in part and had interviewed his client at length and presented the client with the options to be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">In multiparty criminal proceedings, competent defense counsel may consider at a very early stage of the processes\u2014many times before an indictment or information is forthcoming\u2014the choice of cooperation with the prosecution in view of obtaining leniency or dismissal or the alternative of stonewalling\u2014fighting the charges every inch of the way even to the court of last resort. If the cooperation route is chosen, \u201csinging\u201d\u2014talking to the prosecution\u2014is commonly involved. This process may involve a giving of something of value; admission of possible guilt on the part of the defendant, offers of evidence to aid in establishing the guilt of a codefendant. To argue\u2014as does appellate defense counsel here\u2014that only after a quid pro quo is received, shall the client \u201ctalk\u201d is to demonstrate an unfamiliarity with the nature of prosecutors. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>expect any offer of dismissal, leniency, etc. <em>before </em>the prosecutor makes an appraisal of the evidence tendered is to be unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Berry contended he was innocent\u2014based on lack of mens rea. He had convinced Thompson of his innocence in face of many admitted acts pointing to his guilt. Further, he was most willing to load the guilt on the back of his codefendant. The timing of such an approach to the district attorney\u2014if it was to have any value\u2014was critical, for the first tattler to the district attorney\u2019s office may be the first with a claim on leniency. Here <em>both </em>defendants engaged in this race to disclaim guilt and shift blame. While Berry was first in time, he apparently had no substance with which to bargain. To hold in such circumstances that a failure to complete all discovery of prosecution materials before this approach is attempted is to almost assure its failure as a strategy to gain a favor. Delay may foreclose opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In assessing counsel incompetency, we must also add Berry\u2019s present concession that his information \u201cproperly\u201d conveyed could sometime \u201cresult in dismissal or substantially reduced charges.\u201d Berry argues (without fact base) that Attorney Thompson failed to communicate and negotiate the information \u201cproperly.\u201d It can be speculated with equal or greater vigor that Berry\u2019s inability to \u201cproperly\u201d convince the deputy district attorney of his veracity caused the lack of an offer of leniency and dismissal. As is apparent from the evidentiary course of the trial, Berry had no facts with which to bargain. He gave nothing to the deputy district attorney. Contrary to the trial court\u2019s generalization, we view the decision to cooperate or not to cooperate at this early stage of the proceeding as a tactical choice made within the spectrum of reasonable competence of a trial attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">With respect to the contention of lawyer ineffectiveness due to a failure to require the client to take and pass a prelie detector test before submitting to the prosecutor\u2019s polygraph machine, we note these salient factors: Berry admits the lie detector \u201chas demonstrated an unfortunate capacity to record the psychological reactions of truthful subjects as deception responses, and an anomalous inability to mirror the falsehoods of unresponsive subjects or those knowledgeable of the various ways to beat the machine.\u201d Highleyman <em>The Deceptive Certainty of the \u201cLie Detector\" </em>(1958) 10 Hastings L. J. 47, 62. Furthermore the generally accepted premise is that the results of the lie detector tests themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>are not considered reliable enough to have probative value. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 737, 759 [312 P.2d 665]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 738, 763-764 [114 Cal.Rptr. 467, 523 P.2d 267]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 844, 850 [157 Cal.Rptr. 348]; <em>Aengst </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Quality Assurance </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 275, 282 [167 Cal.Rptr. 796].)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 109 [125 Cal.Rptr. 518], the defendant took a \u201cunilateral\u201d test from a polygraph of his own choosing before submitting to the opposition machine. Said the court: \u201cWe believe this seriously diminished the reliability of the test and rendered inadmissible the evidence it was designed to produce.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 115-11.6) and \u201cthe more times a person is tested, the less reliable are the test results.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 118; fn. omitted.) In order to second such views, we need not seek out psychiatric opinions but need only consult our common knowledge, common experience with respect to the vagaries of the human mind and emotions. Feelings of guilt or innocence arise from a thousand undetermined and deepseated (subconscious?) sources. The effect of a \u201cfriendly\u201d or \u201chostile\u201d polygrapher, the confidence that arises from the fact that the test results\u2014whatever they may be\u2014will not be used against the subject, the fear of the machine itself, each and all have an effect on the sweat glands, blood pressure and rate of breathing and the reliability of the polygraph test.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Experts opine that among the factors that can adversely affect the reliability of the polygraph test are the emotional upset of the subject, fatigue, drunkenness, drugs, bad physical or emotional condition, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hardening of the arteries, obesity, feeblemindedness, amnesia, a psychotic condition, being a pathologic liar, lack of fear or concern at being caught in a lie, surreptitious nervous simulation, use of antiperspirants, hypnosis, extraneous noise or abnormal temperatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">For this court to conclude that Attorney Thompson was guilty of lawyer incompetence for a failure to require Berry to pass the pretest lie detector test is, if some experts are correct, to cast doubt on or diminish the reliability of the second test. If Attorney Thompson (and appellate counsel) were knowledgeable of the state of the polygraph art, each would be aware that the results of the \u201cfriendly\u201d and the \u201cunfriendly\u201d polygraph tests may well be different. Passing (or failure) on the first test is no assurance against a contrary result on a later test.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>An assertion of attorney incompetence to be successful needs some firm evidentiary base. We do not find it here. The failure to require Berry to submit to a pretest friendly polygrapher does not demonstrate lawyer incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">We are not prepared, based on this record, to find a failure of effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">If we accept, arguendo, Berry\u2019s characterization of Thompson\u2019s efforts and concede that the first prong of the <em>Pope </em>test was met, yet another barrier precludes reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Berry generalizes, argues he gave up this meritorious defense; \u201cthe right to remain silent and to put the prosecution to his proof.\u201d All that is wrong with this contention is that it is not supported by facts. The prosecution was put to its proof\u2014434 pages of testimony plus a multitude of documents to establish Berry\u2019s guilt. The statements obtained from Berry pretrial were not in fact used at trial. Berry\u2019s \u201cdamaging forgery admissions\u201d were not used. Proof of Berry\u2019s forged signatures, grantor and notary, was made not from Berry\u2019s admissions pretrial but by an expert on the questioned documents. The fact of a polygraph examination or its result were never revealed to the jury. Thus Berry\u2019s choice to testify cannot be seen a compelled act forced by earlier discussions with the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The state of the evidence at the close of the People\u2019s case did not depend for proof of any critical fact upon Berry\u2019s pretrial discussions; rather the People\u2019s independent evidence invited, almost compelled response. In such circumstance, the trial attorney cannot be faulted for putting his client on the stand. Berry\u2019s protestations of innocence were based upon (1) a lack of mens rea and (2) that some other defendant possessed the guilty intent. This was his defense posture both before and during trial. He was not believed pretrial by the prosecutor and\u2014from the verdicts\u2014not by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">Berry points to none and we can find no meritorious defense that was lost or precluded by the criticized pretrial discussion or the lie detector test given.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>In substance Berry seeks reversal of his conviction after an eminently fair trial, without a showing of any prejudice. Unless irregularities in the pretrial process are \u201cjurisdictional in the fundamental sense\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pompa-Ortiz </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 519, 529 [165 Cal.Rptr. 851, 612 P.2d 941]), they should be reviewed under the appropriate standard of prejudicial error and should require reversal <em>only </em>if the defendant can show he was deprived of a fair trial or otherwise suffered prejudice as a result of the error pretrial. <em>(Ibid.; People </em>v. <em>Chavez </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 334, 344-348 [161 Cal.Rptr. 762, 605 P.2d 401].) Berry cites us to no facts showing prejudice. The \u201cper se\u201d rule of reversible error is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Cologne, Acting P. J., and Wiener, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 1, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The United States Supreme Court denied a petition for writ of certiorari on November 2, 1981.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The deputy district attorney did not recall such a discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Prosecution handwriting experts supplied this evidence as to the identity of the writers.

Said the judge, \u201d... <em>if </em>there was legal malpractice or ineffective representation by Mr. Thompson, ... it could not constitute the basis for a motion to dismiss. ...\u201d Moreover, Thompson had not even been told \u201cwhat the motion is about.\u201d In fairness, Thompson should have at least been afforded fundamental due process and should have been given the opportunity to review his own records of the case before testifying.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
