The evidence and the Court\u2019s findings are set forth in its opinion reported in \u2014 <em>Del.Ch. </em>\u2014, 207 <em>A.2d </em>597.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-17\">Upon the basis of evidence which was principally oral, the Vice Chancellor found that Mr. Nichols was not mentally incapacitated, although his mind was weakened by age and failing health; that there was no unfair practice or imposition sufficient to show any overreaching by defendants; and that the purchase price was not grossly inadequate. After reading the entire record, we find that there is ample evidence to support those findings of fact. See <em>Nardo v. Nardo, Del., </em>209 <em>A.2d </em>905. We also find no reversible error in the rulings of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The Vice Chancellor ordered defendants to pay to plaintiffs the sum of $500 which plaintiffs had permitted to be deducted from the purchase price as a \u201ccontribution to expenses of transfer\u201d. No appeal was taken from this ruling, and we therefore express no opinion upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The judgment below must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
