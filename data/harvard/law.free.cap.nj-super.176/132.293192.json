Degnan, </em>Attorney General of New Jersey, attorney for respondent <em>(Erminie L. Conley, </em>Assistant Attorney General, of counsel, and <em>Karen Kurland Rem, </em>Deputy Attorney General, on the brief).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b162-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Plaintiff Philip Kaszerman filed a complaint for release of records of the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS) concerning himself and his son, compiled as a result of a child abuse referral naming plaintiff as a possible perpetrator. The Law Division judge held that child abuse records of DYFS were confidential under state statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a, and federal regulation, 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1340.3-3(d)(5), and dismissed the complaint. On this appeal plaintiff contends that he is legally entitled to the records under (1) state law regarding confidentiality, (2) the New Jersey Right to Know Law, (3) federal regulations concerning confidentiality of records, and (4) because of the legislative intent of the child abuse reporting laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The confidentiality of child abuse records is controlled by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a. Plaintiff does not fall within any of the statutorily-enumerated exceptions to the confidentiality accorded such reports. Although <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a(b)(5) does authorize disclosure to a parent \u201cwho is responsible for the child\u2019s welfare,\u201d that disclosure is specifically limited to situations where the information is \u201cneeded in connection with the provision of care, treatment, or supervision to such child.... \u201d In the instant case, plaintiff\u2019s reasons for wanting to obtain copies of the records have nothing to do with the provision of care or supervision of his child; rather, plaintiff obviously seeks to obtain the records for the purpose of compiling documentation for potential lawsuits he wishes to bring.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a(b)(6) authorizes disclosure of child abuse records to a court \u201cupon its finding that access to such records may be necessary for determination of an issue before the court....\u201d The court may, in turn, release the records to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>appropriate person upon a finding that \u201csuch further disclosure is necessary for determination of an issue before the court.\u201d In the present case, there is no \u201cissue before the court\u201d for which access to the records is necessary. Plaintiff has not initiated the lawsuits to which he refers in his complaint, but merely wishes to gather documentation for potential lawsuits. Thus, subsection (6) does not provide authority for release of the desired records to plaintiff himself nor does it support his contention that the records should be disclosed to a court for determination of an issue before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Since the records are expressly confidential except for the circumstances delineated in the statute, plaintiff has no right of access under the Right to Know Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1 et <em>seq., </em>which excludes from general public inspection records made confidential by State statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Under federal regulation, 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1340.3-3(d)(5), release of child abuse records to a parent may be made only with protection of the identity of reporters. In any event, release of DYFS\u2019s records is controlled by the more severe limitations on access imposed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Our review of the child abuse laws in <em>Title </em>9 convinces us that the trial judge was correct in holding that release of the records to plaintiff would thwart the legislative purposes of encouraging child abuse reporting while protecting the identity of referral sources. In his efforts to obtain access to the records in question, plaintiff raises a number of other contentions including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">1. His right to obtain evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">2. The judge\u2019s order authorizing release of the records in another action is legal precedent for release of these records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">3. Informants are sufficiently protected against civil and criminal liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">4. The informer\u2019s name can be stricken from the records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">5. The alleged common practice of DYFS to reveal the contents of records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-14\">6. Plaintiff is entitled to equality before the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-15\">7. DYFS simultaneously maintains that their records are both secret and non-secret.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-16\">8. Thousands of DYFS records are made public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>9. The complexity of the State\u2019s argument and lack of quotation from the law evidences the absence of a valid legal argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">10. There are no case histories in the State\u2019s brief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">11. DYFS should be a social work agency, not a police agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">12. Since DYFS and the Attorney General are a \u201cpolice-prosecutor team\u201d the subjects of DYFS records are entitled to copies of their records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">13. The State\u2019s brief is irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">14. The legal principles cited in the State\u2019s brief are not valid in New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">15. DYFS policy is sick and obscene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">We find these contentions to be clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
