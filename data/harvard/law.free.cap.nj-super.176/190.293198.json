A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Two multiple-count indictments, each charging breaking and entering with intent to rape, forcible rape, robbery and threat to take a life, were consolidated for trial. The two offenses indicated a similar criminal pattern and both were committed in the City of Plainfield, one on March 15, 1977 and the other on September 13, 1977. The crimes were otherwise unrelated.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Defendant was found guilty by a jury on all nine counts of the two indictments. Sentences aggregating 53 to 79 years in State Prison were imposed. (Defendant had previously been convicted of similar offenses after two earlier trials. Hence, the aggregate sentence includes the consecutive portion imposed upon the convictions involved in this appeal.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The guilty verdicts in the consolidated indictments before us were based primarily upon defendant\u2019s written confessions which were admitted in evidence. The sole contention on this appeal is that the trial judge erred in refusing to conduct Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearings to determine admissibility of the two written statements allegedly given by defendant. We agree with this contention and remand to the trial court for <em>Miranda </em>hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Defendant was arrested on October 15, 1977 when, during an interrogation of about five hours, he signed five confessions involving previously unsolved rapes which had been committed in the City of Plainfield between February and September, 1977. Consequently, he was charged with rape in five separate multicount indictments. The first of the five indictments, involving a rape which occurred on February 12, 1977, resulted in a conviction affirmed on appeal. During that trial a <em>Miranda </em>hearing was conducted on the confession relating to that offense. It was found to be admissible and was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">A second trial, before a different judge, involved an indictment for a rape committed in Plainfield on June 20, 1977. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Although defendant had been represented by private, retained counsel at his first trial, a representative of the Public Defender\u2019s office appeared on his behalf for the second trial. A <em>Miranda </em>hearing was conducted prior to selection of the jury. It is the State\u2019s contention, accepted by the trial judge in the matter presently before us, that defendant entered into a binding stipulation at the <em>Miranda </em>hearing on that second indictment permitting the trial judge to resolve the admissibility question in connection with the remaining three indictments. Upon hearing the testimony of two detectives and defendant, the trial judge ruled that all four confessions were admissible, including that which dealt with the charge for which a jury was then immediately selected and including the two indictments which later were consolidated for trial before another trial judge and are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">We find it difficult to understand why counsel apparently failed to provide the trial judge in the present case with a copy of the <em>Miranda </em>hearing transcript. In fact, no such transcript has been provided by either party on this appeal. Such a record is obviously essential to a proper disposition of the issue involved. E.2;5-3(b). Therefore, we have obtained a copy from the record on appeal of the trial of the second indictment against this defendant. His conviction in that trial has already been affirmed on appeal and his petition for certification has been denied. <em>State v. Powell, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>378 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">When defendant appeared for trial of the second charge resulting from the five confessions, it was the trial judge himself who suggested one hearing on all four remaining statements. The following colloquy took place, prior to trial, on February 8, 1978:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">THE COURT: Were these statements all taken at the same time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Yes, your Honor on the evening of October 15th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">THE COURT: In succession?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Yes, your Honor. They are separate statements but they were taken within a few hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>THE COURT: All right, so I understand it, we\u2019re starting the trial of 155 but we won\u2019t pick the jury until after we have the <em>Miranda </em>hearing, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s my understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">THE COURT: Well, have you suggested to counsel that we have one hearing on all the statements that will become the law of the case so it won\u2019t have to be done at each trial? So this way it\u2019s an advantage to the State so they don't have to produce the same witness over and over again. It seems to me it\u2019s always an advantage to the defendant because then the Court could have an overall picture of the whole incident as far as the taking of all the statements. Do you have any objection to that, proceeding that way, Mr. Wood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I have no objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">THE COURT: All right we\u2019ll do that. Then all right call your first witness please.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">A careful review of that record indicates that although counsel for defendant therein cross-examined State\u2019s witnesses with regard to some details of the crime on which he was then prepared to proceed, there was no such cross-examination with regard to the statements used in the consolidated charges resulting in the convictions presently before us. Furthermore, and most significantly, defense counsel consented to the judge\u2019s recommendation that \u201cthe statements . . . will become the law of the case . . . . \u201d without any apparent prior notice and without the express or implied approval of the defendant himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">In <em>State v. Yough, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>587, 590 (1967), our Supreme Court recognized that the standard practice requiring that motions to suppress statements or confessions be heard during trial was being violated in some cases where such motions were heard immediately before selection of the jury. Following our recommendation set forth in <em>State v. Elysee, </em>159 <em>N.J.Super. </em>380, 385 (App.Div.1978) the rule was amended as of September 10, 1979 to permit hearings to resolve admissibility of statements immediately prior to jury selection. R.3:13-l(b). Still, the absence of such a specific rule at the time of the consolidated hearings herein would not in itself vitiate a properly conducted <em>Miranda </em>hearing merely because it was conducted prior to selection of the jury, <em>State v. Graham, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>366 (1971), provided it was heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u201con the trial date\u201d and, provided further \u201cthat after making their determinations they have immediately proceeded with the trial without any fragmentation or interruption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372-373. In the case before us, the <em>Miranda </em>hearing which the trial judge considered binding upon him was not conducted on the trial date nor did the matter immediately proceed on the indictments with which we are concerned. There was considerable fragmentation and interruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Nor do we consider the stipulation, in any sense, binding upon defendant. \u201c[Fjairness and justice dictate that we disregard a stipulation which not only contravenes applicable law but also represents a studied effort to circumvent normal practice.\u201d <em>State v. Elysee, supra, </em>159 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Furthermore, we do not deal here with the type of procedural or tactical stipulation made by counsel for his client which is ordinarily binding on a litigant. <em>See State v. Cinigilo, </em>57 <em>N.J.Super. </em>399, 405-406 (App.Div.1959). In fact, the stipulation which was held binding against this defendant without any evidence of his understanding consent was made by someone other than his counsel in this case and by someone who did not purport to represent defendant with regard to the charges against him in the case presently on appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">It is true, as the plaintiff points out, that litigants are generally held bound by the mistaken as well as the sound procedural determinations of their counsel. <em>Karcher r. Philadelphia Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>214, 216 (1955); <em>State v. Newman, </em>36 <em>N.J.Super. </em>506, 511 (App.Div.1955). But the rule is not an absolute one and is to be applied rationally and with fair recognition of the fact that justice to the litigants is always the polestar. <em>See Devlin v. Surgent, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>148, 153 (1955); <em>N.J. Highway Authority v. Renner, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>485, 495 (1955). [Martin<em>dell v. Martindell, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>341, 349 (1956)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine applies only to the decision regarding a question of law or fact made during the course of the same litigation and is generally applicable and binding upon a trial judge even where the previous ruling was made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>another judge at a pretrial hearing. <em>Wilson v. Ohio River Co., </em>236 <em>F.Supp. </em>96, 98 (S.D.W.Va.1964), aff\u2019d 375 F.2d 775 (4 Cir. 1967). The purpose of the doctrine is essentially to avoid repetition of litigation of the same issue during the course of a single trial. Nevertheless, the concept has been described as \u201cmerely a non-binding decisional guide addressed to the good sense of the court in the form of \u2018a cautionary admonition\u2019 against relitigation \u2018when the occasion demands it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ross Products, Inc. v. N.Y. Merchandise Co., </em>242 <em>F.Supp. </em>878, 879 (S.D.N.Y.1965) (footnotes omitted). Hence, in a situation where a new trial was required after a mistrial, we held that a new <em>Miranda </em>hearing was appropriate although the confession had been excluded after the original hearing during the first trial. <em>State v. Hale, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 413 (App.Div.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We need not here decide, and so we do not here imply, that the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel are never available against a defendant in a subsequent trial where he has fully and fairly participated in the determination of an issue in a prior trial. See the concurring opinion of Judge Morgan in <em>State v. Ingenito, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>524, 533 (App.Div.1979). Since the circumstances of this case do not demonstrate full and fair participation by defendant in the prior litigation of <em>Miranda </em>issues respecting the confession of the crimes here charged, we leave the legal issue for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">For the reasons stated, the matter is remanded to the trial court for a plenary <em>Miranda </em>hearing which is to be conducted and completed within 30 days hereof. If either confession is excluded, a new trial will be required on all counts of both indictments and we will not retain jurisdiction. If both confessions are found admissible, a transcript of the hearing shall be provided forthwith by defendant and we will retain jurisdiction. Counsel for defendant is charged with the responsibility of advising the clerk of this court in writing as to the determination within five days after the announcement thereof.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-10\"> <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
