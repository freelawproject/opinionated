Phillips\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-20\">The district court did not err by denying Phillips\u2019s motion. Phillips is not eligible for a reduction of sentence because he is a career offender. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008). Phillips challenges his classification as a career offender, but in determining eligibility for a reduction of sentence, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering Phillips\u2019s sentencing range. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-21\">The denial of Phillips\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
