Cassidy, through counsel, appeals the magistrate judge\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) denial of his application for disability insurance benefits and supplemental Social Security income, arguing that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision of March 30, 2006, should be reversed because the ALJ granted him benefits in October 2008, pursuant to a subsequent application. Specifically, Cas-sidy argues that the ALJ\u2019s March 30, 2006, order was not supported by substantial evidence and was arbitrary and capricious because the same ALJ granted his subsequent disability application in an October 2008 order, which found that he had been disabled since April 14, 2006. He submits that he did not suffer any \u201cnew medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>conditions\u201d between March 30, 2006, and April 14, 2006, to account for the difference in the ALJ\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">\u201cWhen ... the ALJ denies benefits and the [Appeals Council] denies review, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision.\u201d <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cWe review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based upon proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). Substantial evidence consists of \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1440. The burden rests with the claimant to prove that he is disabled and entitled to Social Security benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(a); <em>Doughty, </em>245 F.3d at 1278. \u201cWe review the decision of the ALJ as to whether the claimant was entitled to benefits during a specific period of time, which period was necessarily prior to the date of the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Apfel, </em>179 F.3d 1276, 1279 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that a medical form completed approximately one year after the ALJ\u2019s decision was not probative of any issue in the case).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Although Cassidy alleges in eonclu-sory fashion that the ALJ\u2019s March 2006 decision was not supported by substantial evidence, he never directly challenges the quality or quantity of evidence supporting that decision. Our review of the record indicates that the ALJ\u2019s determination that Cassidy was not disabled because he retained the ability to perform the full range of sedentary work and thus could perform other work existing in significant numbers in the national economy was supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, medical evidence from both treating and consultative sources supported the ALJ\u2019s determination. Cassidy points to no further medical information before the ALJ at the time of the March 2006 decision to undermine that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The crux of Cassidy\u2019s argument is instead that the ALJ\u2019s March 2006 decision was arbitrary and capricious because it is inconsistent with a fully favorable decision rendered in October 2008 finding that he was disabled with an onset date of April 14, 2006. We disagree. The burden was on Cassidy to establish his entitlement to benefits during a specific time period. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s March 2006 decision to deny him benefits. According to Cassidy, his medical condition was the same at all relevant times between the two applications. Even assuming his underlying medical conditions were the same, the determination of Cassi-dy\u2019s disability was based not just on his medical conditions, but on how those conditions affected his residual functional capacity to perform work. Moreover, Cassi-dy concedes that significant additional medical evidence was presented in support of the claim decided in the October 2008 decision and that the evidence was relevant to the time after the March 2006 decision. Thus, the two decisions are not inconsistent. In short, Cassidy has failed to show any error in the ALJ\u2019s March 2006 determination that he was not disabled and not entitled to benefits because his sole argument on appeal is based on evidence that is not probative of the disability period in that application.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Based on our review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-6\">.
