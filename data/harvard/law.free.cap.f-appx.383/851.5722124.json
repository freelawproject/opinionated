We affirmed Ferguson\u2019s conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In June 2006, Ferguson filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; that motion was denied in December 2006. Shortly thereafter, Ferguson moved for the return of property under the same case number as his section 2255 action; that motion was denied on 30 January 2007. More than two years later, on 2 February 2009, Ferguson filed the instant motion to reopen: he argued that the government knowingly presented false and fabricated evidence to the district court in its response to his December 2006 motion for return of property. Ferguson argues that the government\u2019s fraudulent acts authorize reopening consideration of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Although Ferguson fails to cite a rule that would authorize the district court to reconsider, we will assume that he relies on Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under Rule 60(b)(3), \u201cthe court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for ... fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party,\u201d provided the Rule 60(b)(3) motion is made within a reasonable time but \u201cno more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Ferguson\u2019s motion for reconsideration was filed more than two years after his motion for return of property was denied; his motion was untimely filed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-19\">. We first affirmed in January 2005. The Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded for further consideration in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We reaffirmed upon reconsideration in March 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-7\">. Il is unclear whether Ferguson's motion for return of property was civil or criminal in nature. A motion for reconsideration in a criminal proceeding is timely if filed within the time frame for filing a notice of appeal. <em>See United States v. Russo, </em>760 F.2d 1229, 1230 (11th Cir.1985) (addressing denial of motion for reconsideration of denial of Fed. R.CrimP. 35 motion). And at the time Ferguson's motion for return of property was denied, a notice of appeal in a criminal proceeding was required to be filed within 10 days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed. Fed.R.App.P. 4(b)(1)(A)(i). Because Rule 60(b) \u2014 applicable to civil proceedings \u2014 allows a broader time frame for filing a motion for reconsideration, we assume Ferguson relies on Rule 60(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-23\">. We note that the facts upon which Ferguson bases his allegations of fraud in support of his 2009 motion to reconsider were known to him when his motion for return of property was denied in 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
