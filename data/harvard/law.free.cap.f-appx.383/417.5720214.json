His conviction was affirmed on appeal. <em>United States v. Percel, </em>553 F.3d 903, 906 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, Vasquez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2065, 173 L.Ed.2d 1143 (2009). He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial as untimely of his post-appeal motion for a new trial. He alleged that his motion was based on newly discovered evidence consisting of a statement from a non-testifying codefendant, Bonifacio Hernandez, indicating that Percel did not participate in the offenses of which he was convicted and had no knowledge of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-16\">Even if this court assumes that the motion was based on newly discovered evidence and was timely filed, Percel cannot show that he is entitled to a new trial. A defendant moving for a new trial must establish that: (1) the evidence is newly discovered and was unknown to him at the time of trial; (2) the defendant\u2019s failure to discover the evidence was not due to a lack of diligence; (3) the evidence is material, not merely cumulative or impeaching; and (4) the evidence would probably produce acquittal at a new trial. <em>United States v. Freeman, </em>77 F.3d 812, 817 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>714 F.2d 29, 31 (5th Cir.1983). Percel has not shown that his failure to discover Hernandez\u2019s potential favorable testimony was not due to his own lack of diligence. Nor has he shown, in light of the other evidence against him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>that inclusion of Hernandez\u2019s proffered testimony would probably result in his acquittal at a new trial. Two of Percel\u2019s co-defendants offered detailed testimony at trial impheating him in the offense. That testimony was corroborated to a large extent by testimony from DEA agents who conducted surveillance of the defendants on the day of their arrest; by video tapes made during that surveillance; and by items found during searches of the residences involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial. <em>See Freeman, </em>77 F.3d at 817. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
