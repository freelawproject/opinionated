He contends that his sentence of 9 months imprisonment and 2 years of supervised release was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">We review the sentence imposed following the revocation of supervised release only for abuse of discretion, and we use a two step process. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). First, we must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. If we find the sentence to be procedurally sound, the second step is to review the \u201csubstantive reasonableness\u201d of the sentence, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both that record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Adams contends that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not expressly refer to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing its sentence. We have explained that \u201cnoting in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). When a district court does not expressly mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we look to the record to see if the factors were, in fact, considered. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">The record makes clear that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Before imposing its sentence, the district court listened to statements from Adams\u2019 counsel, his employer, and his fiancee, all of whom discussed Adams\u2019 characteristics and history. The district court commented that it did not \u201cwant to undo what [Adams] ha[d] accomplished; but by the same token, the court\u2019s orders, the court\u2019s expectations have to be met.\u201d That statement illustrates the district court\u2019s consideration of Adams\u2019 history and the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B). We conclude that no procedural error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">Adams also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. He contends that it was greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing. The district court sentenced Adams to a term of imprisonment within the advisory guidelines and significantly below both the government\u2019s recommended sentence and the statutory maximum. The term of supervised release imposed by the district court was also well below the statutory maximum. Given Adams history of violating the terms of his supervised release, we cannot say that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
