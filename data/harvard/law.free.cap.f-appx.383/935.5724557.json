On appeal, Hernandez argues that his total sentence was unreasonable in light of the district court\u2019s failure to sentence him based on a \u201c1-to-l\u201d crack-to-powder cocaine ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-15\">We review a final sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1321 (11th Cir.2008). The Supreme Court has clarified that reviewing a sentence for reasonableness is review for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable lies with the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>ty challenging the sentence. <em>Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1322. Upon thorough review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in choosing not to apply a \u201c1-to-l\u201d crack-to-powder cocaine ratio and that Hernandez has not satisfied his burden to show that his sentence was procedurally or substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court failed to calculate or incorrectly calculated the Guidelines, treated the Guidelines as mandatory, failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The district court erred in none of these respects. To the contrary, it is undisputed that the court correctly calculated the Guidelines, giving Hernandez a two-point safety-valve reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b) and \u00a7 501.2(a) and a three-point acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a). The court also expressly stated that it had considered the arguments of the parties, the PSI, the advisory nature of the Guidelines, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in calculating Hernandez\u2019s sentence. The court particularly emphasized the seriousness of the offense, the centrality of Hernandez\u2019s participation in the drug conspiracy, and that his offense preyed upon drug-addicted victims in its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. A district court need not explicitly discuss its consideration of each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors on the record, as long as the sentencing judge \u201cset[s] forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">Moreover, the court\u2019s discussion of <em>Kim-brough </em>shows that it did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory. <em>See Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (addressing the Sentencing Guidelines \u201c100-to-l\u201d crack-to-powder cocaine ratio). The court properly noted Hernandez\u2019s argument that he should be sentenced under a \u201c1-to-l\u201d crack-to-powder cocaine ratio, but concluded that to do so would result in insufficient punishment in light of the nature of the drug conspiracy and its impact on its victims. Although the Supreme Court held in <em>Kimbrough </em>that a sentencing court has discretion to consider the crack and powder cocaine disparity, it did not require courts to adopt a lower guideline sentencing range in crack cocaine cases. <em>Id. </em>at 110, 128 S.Ct. at 575 (\u201c[I]t would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the erack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d). Finally, the district court did not base the sentence on clearly erroneous facts because its findings regarding Hernandez\u2019s involvement in additional uncharged offense conduct and the drug-addicted nature of his victims came directly from undisputed portions of the PSI. We thus hold that Hernandez\u2019s sentence was not proeedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Once we conclude that the district court made no procedural errors, we then consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence\u201d under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. A sentence is substantively unreasonable if it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. A district court\u2019s \u201cunjustified reliance\u201d on a single \u00a7 3553(a) factor \u201cmay be a symptom of an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1323 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Contrary to Hernandez\u2019s assertion on appeal, the district court explicitly balanced his request for mitigation based on the crack-powder cocaine disparity against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the need to promote adequate deterrence and the need for the punishment to reflect the seriousness of the offense. The court\u2019s consideration of these factors demonstrates that Hernandez\u2019s sentence is sufficient but no greater than necessary to fulfill the statutory purposes of sentencing. Moreover, the record reflects that the court gave due consideration to mitigating factors, including the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences, because Hernandez\u2019s 46-month total sentence falls far below the statutory maximum of 480 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). In sum, we conclude that Hernandez\u2019s 46-month total sentence was substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Hernandez\u2019s 46-month total sentence and hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to apply a \u201c1-to-l\u201d crack-to-powder cocaine ratio to its sentencing calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-7\">. We reject the government's argument that we should review Hernandez's claim on appeal for plain error due to a failure to object to the court\u2019s reasons for not applying a \"1-to-1\" crack-to-powder cocaine ratio. Whether the district court erred in not applying the \u201c1-to-l\u201d ratio is a challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence, to which an abuse of discretion standard applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b963-6\">. Hernandez mischaracterizes his sentence by asserting that it was based on a \u201c100-tol\u201d crack-to-powder cocaine ratio. In calculating Hernandez's sentence, the district court applied the post-Amendment 706 version of the Guidelines, which is based on crack-to-powder cocaine ratios less than 100-to-l. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b963-7\">. The factors in \u00a7 3553(a) that the sentencing court must consider are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-8\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-12\"><em>United States v.
