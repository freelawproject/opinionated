Butler, <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights complaint, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Butler\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint arose from his disbarment by the Georgia Supreme Court, pursuant to a formal complaint brought by the State Bar of Georgia (State Bar) charging him with embezzling funds from a client. The \u00a7 1983 complaint named the State Bar and Katherine Wood, the Special Master who presided over Butler\u2019s disciplinary proceedings, as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Butler contends his complaint was not barred by <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>because (1) since his alleged injury occurred before the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s disbarment order, he was not the \u201closer\u201d of the state court judgment and (2) he raised an independent claim alleging constitutional violations which arose from the wrongful conduct of defendants during the State Bar disciplinary proceedings against him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine provides \u201clower federal courts are precluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final state-court judgments.\u201d <em>Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1268 (quotation omitted). In <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005), the Supreme Court cautioned against broadly construing <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>and held the doctrine should be confined only to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-20\">Rooker-Feldman\u2019s reach extends to federal claims raised by the state-court loser that are deemed to be \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment such as (1) where the success of the federal claim would \u201ceffectively nullify\u201d the state court judgment; and (2) where the federal claim \u201csucceeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-21\">The district court did not err in finding <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>barred Butler\u2019s civil rights complaint because, squarely within the language of <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>he was a state-court loser who sued in federal court to complain of injuries caused by the state-court judgment which was rendered before the filing of his federal complaint. <em>See Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1268, 1270. To the extent Butler couches his complaint in terms of independent constitutional claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>against defendants, those federal claims were inextricably intertwined with the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s disbarment order and, thus, still fell within the confines of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>jurisdictional bar. <em>See Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-10\">. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine derives from <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 150, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923), and <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 1311-15, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b902-16\">. We review \"dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.2009).
