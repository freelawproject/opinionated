The District Court calculated the advisory sentencing guideline range without objection. Based in part on Defendant\u2019s criminal history, the District Court varied upwards from that range. Defendant objected and now appeals both the variance and a lack of notice that the District Court was considering a variance. We see no reversible error; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-24\">We review a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The District Court calculated Plaintiff\u2019s guideline range as being from 41 to 51 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court imposed a 70-month sentence with a three-year period of supervised release. In explaining the variance, the District Court said that it considered the pre-sentence report in its entirety, that it noted Defendant\u2019s criminal history with special attention, and that it considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The District Court concluded that an upward variance was justified because the Guideline range did \u201cnot adequately reflect the seriousness of [Defendant\u2019s] prior criminal record and the probability that [Defendant] will continue to commit crimes.\u201d The District Court also concluded that the sentence complied with the factors in section 3553(a) and adequately addressed the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">We review a District Court\u2019s sentencing decision in a two-step process. First, we determine if the District Court made a procedural error. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. We see no procedural error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Next, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>In doing so, we \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The District Court explicitly considered the section 3553(a) factors and gave extra weight to Defendant\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Defendant contends that the District Court erred because the severity of his past criminal activity was not sufficient to justify a variance. The District Court was troubled by the increasing severity of Defendant\u2019s criminal conduct and that Defendant\u2019s time between convictions was mainly a result of time spent in federal prison. We cannot say that the upward variance was outside of the District Court\u2019s broad discretion given the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">Defendant also appeals the lack of notice for the upwards variance. The sentence imposed by the District Court is a variance from the guidelines \u2014 not a departure. <em>See, Irizarry v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 708, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2202, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008). Variances do not require notice to the parties. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-8\">. We only deal with the longer sentence because the sentences \u2014 70 months and 12 months \u2014 for the two charges run concurrently-</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
