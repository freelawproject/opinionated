He says the entry of the notation \u2014 a \u201csecurity precaution designator\u201d \u2014 violates his constitutional rights because he was not afforded a disciplinary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\"> By his own admission, Lee first learned of the existence of the escape notation in his record at a classification hearing on August 14, 2003. It was on this date, then, that he became aware of the facts that might ultimately support a claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Yet Lee filed this federal complaint on June 14, 2008, well after the two-year statute of limitations had run.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He puts forth no legitimate reason to excuse this tardiness so we find his lawsuit time-barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And at any rate, Lee\u2019s alleged injuries do not implicate the deprivation of a constitutional right.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lee\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-20\">That said, Lee is entitled to a partial refund of the fee incurred in filing this lawsuit in the district court: according to our math, he overpaid. We VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment denying a refund, and DIRECT that court\u2019s clerk to refund any overpayment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
