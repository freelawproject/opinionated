Daley, Jr. appeals the order of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (\u201cDelaware District Court\u201d) dismissing his civil rights complaint. Upon consideration of the record, we conclude that the appeal does not present a substantial question. Therefore, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>In May 2004, Daley filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (\u201cTexas District Court\u201d), seeking the return of $800,000 allegedly seized in 1991 by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration at an airport in Houston, Texas. He also sought $14,890 in interest and attorneys\u2019 fees. The Texas District Court concluded that Daley\u2019s claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and dismissed the complaint as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). <em>See Daley v. United States Drug Enforcement Agency, </em>Civ. No. H-04-1914, 2004 WL 5806812 (S.D.Tex. May 24, 2004). Daley\u2019s appeal was dismissed in July 2007 for failure to pay the docketing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Daley filed the present complaint in March 2009, arguing that the seizure of the money was \u201cdefective\u201d because he did not receive \u201cnotice [or] a hearing before the issuance of warrants seizing real property.\u201d He requested that the Delaware District Court \u201cset aside the forfeiture declaration and order [the DEA] either to return the property ... or commence judicial forfeiture\u201d proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To support his allegations, Daley sought discovery and in camera inspection of documents related to the seizure. Daley named as defendants the Delaware District Court, the Texas District Court, and unspecified United States Attorneys Offices. The District Court dismissed the complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), concluding the defendants were immune from suit, <em>see Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 475, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994), and that his complaint duplicated the allegations made in the Texas District Court proceedings, <em>see Pittman v. Moore, </em>980 F.2d 994, 995 (5th Cir.1993). Daley appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and exercise plenary review over the Delaware District Court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). We may affirm on any basis supported by the record. <em>See Fairview Township v. EPA, </em>773 F.2d 517, 525 n. 15 (3d Cir.1985). Because we have granted Daley in forma pauperis status pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, we must dismiss the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it lacks an arguable basis in fact or law. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). We may summarily affirm if the appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">The statute of limitations for Daley\u2019s claims, as for claims arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, is borrowed from the forum state\u2019s personal injury statute. <em>See Napier v. Thirty or More Unidentified Federal Agents, Employees or Officers, </em>855 F.2d 1080, 1088 n. 3 (3d Cir.1988). Daley\u2019s cause of action accrued in Texas, which employs a two-year personal injury statute of limitations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a); <em>Cooper v. Brookshire, </em>70 F.3d 377, 380 n. 20 (5th Cir.1995). Although the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, a district court may <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e) where the defense is obvious from the complaint and no development of the factual record is required. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>See, e.g., Fogle v. Pierson, </em>435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In this case, Daley is contesting the validity of the original seizure of his property in 1991. It is therefore apparent from the face of Daley\u2019s complaint that the two-year statute of limitations expired well before he filed the present action in 2009.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree that any amendment to Daley\u2019s complaint would be futile. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002) (noting that amendment \u201cmust be permitted ... unless it would be inequitable or futile\u201d). Because Daley\u2019s appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Third Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\">. We construe Daley's claims as being brought under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). <em>See Pena v. United States, </em>157 F.3d 984, 987 (5th Cir.1998) (observing that Appellant's motion for the return of seized property presented the facts necessary for a <em>Bivens </em>action).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-12\">. The statute of limitations for personal injuries in Delaware is also two years. <em>See </em>10 Del. Code Ann. \u00a7 8119; <em>McDowell v. Del. State Police, </em>88 F.3d 188, 190 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b206-14\">. Even if we construed Daley's complaint as a civil action in equity, <em>see United States v. McGlory, </em>202 F.3d 664, 670 (3d Cir.2000) (en banc), it would be untimely. <em>See Menkarell v. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>463 F.2d 88, 91 (3d Cir.1972) (holding that the forfeiture of property by the United States without proper notice is subject to a six-year limitation period); <em>cf. United States v. One \"Piper\" Aztec, </em>321 F.3d 355, 359 (3d Cir.2003) (concluding that Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act, which sets forth a five year statute of limitations, \"does not apply retroactively to civil forfeiture proceedings commenced before August 23, 2000.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b206-23\">. Daley's Motions for Transcripts and his \u201cMotion in General, Application for Relief\u201d are denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
