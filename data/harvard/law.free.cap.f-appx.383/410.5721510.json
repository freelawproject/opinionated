Young appeals his 137-month sentence imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>following his guilty plea to possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base. The district court departed upward incrementally from criminal history category II to category VI, which resulted in a guideline range of 110 to 137 months. Young argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we engage in a bifurcated analysis of the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). Our first query is whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 751-53. If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, we then consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard ... takfing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. In exercising this bifurcated process, we review the district corut\u2019s application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Jeffries, </em>587 F.3d 690, 692 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Young asserts that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the court\u2019s decision to depart upward resulted from its mistaken belief that it had no authority to account for the sentencing disparities between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. As Young raised the issue in the district court, he has preserved the issue for review. Young\u2019s assertion, however, is belied by the record. In addressing Young\u2019s objection to the calculation of his base offense level, the district court correctly observed that the appropriate base offense level was the one set forth in the United States Sentencing Guidelines and that the court\u2019s hands were tied as far as the base offense level calculation went. At no point did the district court indicate a belief that it had no authority to impose a lower guideline sentence if it chose to do so. Moreover, it is clear from the record that the district court\u2019s decision to upwardly depart was based on Young\u2019s extensive criminal history, the likelihood of recidivism, and the need to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Young maintains that the district court committed a second procedural error by basing its decision to depart upward almost exclusively on his arrest record. Because Young did not raise this issue in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">The consideration of prior arrests, without more, is specifically prohibited by the Guidelines as a ground for an upward departure. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(3); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 434 (5th Cir.2006). The record indicates, however, that the district court\u2019s statements regarding Young\u2019s arrests were merely a part of the court\u2019s recitation of Young\u2019s lengthy and often violent criminal history and its determination that his criminal history category was underrepresented. It is apparent from the record that the departure was based on more than the mere fact of Young\u2019s arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">Even if it is assumed that Young\u2019s arrest record was a factor in the district court\u2019s decision to depart upward, the court imposed an alternative sentence of 137 months as a variant sentence. Under a variant sentence, consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>defendant\u2019s arrest record is not foreclosed by \u00a7 4A1.3. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). The district court committed no procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Young next contends that his 137-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. A sentence that results from a guideline-authorized upward departure, as is the case here, is considered to be a guideline sentence. <em>See United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 525 (5th Cir.2006). Reasonableness review, in the context of a guidelines departure, requires us to evaluate both \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly and the extent of that departure for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Young did not object to the substantive unreasonableness on the grounds that he advances on appeal, however, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 390-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The district court gave lengthy, detailed reasons for its departure, noting the seriousness of Young\u2019s offense, the seriousness of his involvement in the drug trafficking culture in general, his violent criminal history, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to protect the public from future crimes. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Young\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s assessment of his sentence is insufficient to show that it is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut.
