The BIA found that the IJ did not have jurisdiction because Borges was an arriving alien<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeking adjustment of status under the Cuban Adjustment Act of November 2, 1966, Pub.L. No. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161 (\u201cCAA\u201d). We find that the BIA properly vacated the IJ\u2019s decision for lack of jurisdiction and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">Borges arrived in the United States on May 4, 1980 from Cuba and requested status as a Cuban refugee. He did not possess any valid immigrant or entry documents and he never petitioned to adjust his status to that of a permanent lawful resident. On November 7, 1984, Borges was convicted of grand theft and on February 26, 1986, he was convicted of petit theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">Over twenty years later the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against Borges, charging him under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) as an inadmissable alien due to his convictions for crimes of moral turpitude. Appearing before the IJ, Borges filed for waiver of inadmissability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), as well as an application for adjustment of status under the CAA. The IJ found Borges removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and denied his application for adjustment of status because his crimes of moral turpitude rendered him ineligible. Further, the IJ found that he did not qualify for waiver of inadmissability because he did not have family members who would suffer extreme hardship upon his removal and the fifteen-year waiver did not apply to crimes of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-15\">Borges appealed to the BIA. The BIA found that pursuant to a previous BIA ruling in <em>Matter of Martinez-Montalvo, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 778 (BIA 2009), the IJ did not have jurisdiction over Borges\u2019s application for adjustment of status or his waiver of inadmissability. Therefore, the BIA did not reach the substance of the IJ\u2019s order regarding Borges\u2019s request for a waiver of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>inadmissability. The BIA vacated the IJ\u2019s decision and ordered that Borges be removed to Cuba. Borges appeals the decision of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">II.JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">The question of whether the IJ had jurisdiction over Borges\u2019s application for adjustment of status is a question of law; thus, this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We have jurisdiction to review only the decisions of the BIA; the IJ\u2019s order is reviewed only to the extent that it is adopted by the BIA. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). In the present case, the BIA vacated the IJ\u2019s order for lack of jurisdiction, so we only review the BIA\u2019s ruling concerning the jurisdiction of the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">III.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations de novo. See <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2006). However, our review of the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the statutes it administers \u201cis informed by the principle of deference articulated in <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Thus, we defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the regulations governing its decision \u201cif the interpretation ... is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1243 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">IV.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(1), the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) \u201chas jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status filed by any alien, unless the immigration judge has jurisdiction to adjudicate the application under 8 C.F.R. 1245.2(a)(1).\u201d Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)\u00ae, \u201c[i]n the case of any alien who has been placed in deportation proceedings or in removal proceedings (other than as an arriving alien), the immigration judge hearing the proceeding has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any application for adjustment of status the alien may file.\u201d However, the IJ may adjudicate an application for adjustment of status from an arriving alien if the alien meets four specific conditions. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245(a)(l)(ii)(A)-(D). Borges does not qualify for review by the IJ under these conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">We have previously reviewed 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 245.2(a)(1) and 1245.2(a)(1) under the standards set out in <em>Chewon, </em>467 U.S. at 842-45, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-83, and found that the regulations are valid interpretations of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1251-52 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, the BIA held in <em>Matter of Martinez-Montalvo, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 778, 783 (BIA 2009), that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 245.2(a)(1) and 1245.2(a)(1) effectively divest the IJ of jurisdiction over arriving aliens\u2019 applications for adjustment of sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>tus unless they can meet the conditions of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">\u201cTo establish due process violations in removal proceedings, aliens must show that they were deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted errors caused them substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). Adjustment of an alien\u2019s status is a discretionary form of relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). Likewise, waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) is a purely discretionary form of relief. <em>Garcia v. Attorney General of U.S., </em>329 F.3d 1217, 1224 (11th Cir.2003). Borges \u201ccannot prevail on his due process claim because he has no constitutionally protected interest in purely discretionary forms of relief.\u201d <em>Scheerer, </em>513 F.3d at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Borges is an arriving alien and does not meet the conditions of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(h). Therefore, the BIA properly ruled that the IJ did not have jurisdiction over his application for adjustment of status. Finally, because the IJ lacked jurisdiction over Borges\u2019s application for adjustment of status and application for a waiver of inadmissibility, the BIA did not violate Borges\u2019s due process rights by not considering the merits of the IJ\u2019s decision. Accordingly, upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny Borges\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-11\">. \u201cThe term arriving alien means an applicant for admission coming or attempting to come into the United States at a port-of-entry, or an alien seeking transit through the United States at a port-of-entry, or an alien interdicted in international or United States waters and brought into the United States by any means, whether or not to a designated port-of-entry, and regardless of the means of transport.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1001.l(q).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b919-9\">. ''[T]he amended 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1) reflects a reasonable construction of the statute's delegation of authority to the Attorney General,\u201d given that \u201cthe regulation appears fully consistent with the broader statutory framework governing adjustment applications, in which Congress has divided adjudication functions between [the Department of Justice] and [the Department of Homeland Security] and has authorized those departments to fill the gap as to specific application procedures.\u201d <em>Scheerer, </em>513 F.3d at 1251-52. Thus, we held that \u201cthe Attorney General did not exceed his authority in promulgating the amended 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)\u201d and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1) is not invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 1252.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
