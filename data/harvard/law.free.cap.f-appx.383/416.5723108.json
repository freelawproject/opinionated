On appeal, he contends that (1) the district court committed procedural error when it deferred to the child pornography Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, because the Guideline is not empirically based, and (2) the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence which reflected an unwarranted sentencing disparity and which was greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-22\">We review sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, the court must first ensure that the district court did not commit any significant procedural error in the sentencing process. <em>Id. </em>If the sentence is procedurally sound, the court considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>If the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, there is a rebuttable presumption that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008). The district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-23\">Guilliot\u2019s procedural attack to the empirical basis underlying \u00a7 2G2.2 is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). His substantive reasonableness argument is likewise unavailing. The record reflects that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the parties\u2019 arguments in reaching its sentencing decision. Guilliot\u2019s arguments fail to overcome the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>lines sentence. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). Furthermore, his belief that the mitigating factors presented for the court\u2019s consideration at sentencing should have been balanced differently is insufficient to disturb the presumption. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-18\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir.
