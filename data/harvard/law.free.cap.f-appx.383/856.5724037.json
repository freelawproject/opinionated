Llanos asserts the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence because two other defendants \u2014 Providencia Llanos and Caprice Battle \u2014 received only house arrest and probation instead of a custodial sentence. She argues the district court did not comply with \u00a7 3553(a)(6), which indicates one factor the court must consider is the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities. After review, we affirm Llanos\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-17\">In proving a court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence, the party challenging that sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both that record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Though sentences within the Guidelines are not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, the Guidelines are considered to be \u201ccentral to the sentencing process\u201d and the imposition of a sentence within the Guidelines is ordinarily expected to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 787-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-18\">Specifically, \u00a7 3553(a)(6) \u201caddresses unwarranted sentence disparities among federal defendants who are similarly situated.... \u201d <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1102 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2342, 176 L.Ed.2d 564 (2010). Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding the Guidelines were advisory in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we held \u201c[disparity between the sentences imposed on codefendants is generally not an appropriate basis for relief on appeal.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number><em>United States v. Regueiro, </em>240 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The district court imposed a substantively reasonable sentence. Llanos was responsible for a greater loss amount than Providencia or Battle. She also shoplifted three days after pleading guilty and lied about it to her probation officer. Under those circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a custodial sentence because her situation was different and a different sentence was warranted. Thus, we affirm Llanos\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-14\">. The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-16\">. In this case, the parties are not strictly codefendants. Although the parties appear to have committed similar conduct under a similar set of facts, their cases were separate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
