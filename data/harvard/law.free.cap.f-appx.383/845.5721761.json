At trial, a jury found that Bruno was subjected to a hostile work environment because of her sex, which was created by her immediate supervisor, County Commissioner and then acting Mayor Charles \u201cSonny\u201d McCoy. In a special verdict form, the jury found that, although Bruno unreasonably failed to take advantage of the preventative measures that were provided by Monroe County, the county did not exercise reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any sexually harassing behavior in the workplace. The jury awarded Bruno damages totaling $48,400.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>After trial, Monroe County moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b). In its motion, Monroe County argued that the trial evidence was insufficient for an objectively reasonable person to find that McCoy\u2019s behavior created a sexually hostile work environment, and further argued that it had demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any sexually harassing behavior in the workplace. The district court denied the county\u2019s motion and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">\u201cWe review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, applying the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Inc., </em>421 F.3d 1169, 1177 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cJudgment as a matter of law is appropriate when \u2018a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1)). \u201cWhen the merits of the motion turn on the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the entire record, examining all evidence, by whomever presented, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, we do \u201cnot assume the jury\u2019s role of weighing conflicting evidence or inferences, or of assessing the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we will \u201cgive credence to the evidence favoring the non-movant as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached, at least to the extent that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration omitted). We will reverse \u201conly if the facts and inferences point overwhelmingly in favor of the movant, such that reasonable people could not arrive at a contrary verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">One of Monroe County\u2019s arguments on appeal is that Bruno\u2019s subjective perception of McCoy\u2019s alleged harassment was not objectively reasonable because McCoy\u2019s conduct was not severe enough to create an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive. It contends that McCoy\u2019s stories and statements did not rise to the level of harassment, given that he did not touch Bruno, proposition her for sex or sexual favors, or condition her job performance on sexually related activity. It argues that there was no harassment that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of Bruno\u2019s employment and create an abusive work environment, but rather \u201c[t]he picture painted by Bruno at trial was simply that of an elderly man who recounted stories of his life, who did not understand that Bruno did not want to hear them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Under Title VII, it is unlawful for an employer \u201cto discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). In order to prove a hostile work environment, a plaintiff must demonstrate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-11\">(1) that he or she belongs to a protected group; (2) that the employee has been subject to unwelcome sexual harassment, such as sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other conduct of a sexual nature; (8) that the harassment must have been based on the sex of the employee; (4) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment; and (5) a basis for holding the employer liable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-4\"><em>Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., </em>594 F.3d 798, 808 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc). </em>In reviewing a case involving a claim of hostile work environment, \u201cthe evidence of harassment is considered both cumulatively and in the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cEither severity or pervasiveness is sufficient to establish a violation of Title VII.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). \u201cIn evaluating allegedly discriminatory conduct, we consider its frequency ...; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808-09 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">In order to prove discrimination, the plaintiff must demonstrate that \u201cthe environment was both subjectively and objectively hostile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 809. \u201cThe employee must subjectively perceive the harassment as sufficiently severe and pervasive to alter the terms or conditions of employment, and this subjective perception must be objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThe objective severity of harassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff\u2019s position, considering all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration omitted). \u201cAs the Supreme Court has observed, \u2018[t]he real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810 (quoting <em>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., </em>523 U.S. 75, 81-82, 118 S.Ct. 998, 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Applying these legal standards to the facts of this case, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that a reasonable person could conclude, based on the evidence presented, that McCoy\u2019s conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment based on sexual harassment. The evidence at trial showed that McCoy would cycle through a series of sexually-themed stories on virtually a daily basis when he and Bruno were alone, and when Bruno asked him to stop, he would continue as if he did not hear her. Furthermore, McCoy made various comments about Bruno that would cause a reasonable person in Bruno\u2019s position to consider McCoy\u2019s behavior severe or pervasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">After considering the totality of the circumstances, examining all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmov-ing party, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant\u2019s favor, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Monroe County\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to the jury\u2019s finding that Bruno was subjected to a hostile work environment based on sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">Monroe County next argues that, because it proved both elements of the <em>Far-agher</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>defense, the district court should have entered judgment in its favor. It contends that, because it had a comprehensive anti-harassment policy, which was effectively communicated to its employees, applied to everyone who conducted business for it, including county commissioners, clearly prohibited harassment, and included reasonable complaint procedures, it satisfied the first prong of the <em>Faragher </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>defense. Monroe County contends that, although it could not suspend, remove, or discipline a commissioner, it could remove an employee from a hostile work environment and there were other ways for a commissioner to be punished for sexual harassment, including suspension or removal by the Florida governor, action by the Florida Ethics Commission, or discipline by the Monroe County voters in the form of denying re-election. It asserts that, because its policy provided that harassment \u201cwill not be tolerated\u201d and that \u201cappropriate action\u201d will be taken, it was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">\u201cAn employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee.\u201d <em>Faragher, </em>524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. at 2292-93. The employer will be strictly liable for the hostile environment if the supervisor takes tangible employment action against the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 807, 118 S.Ct. at 2293. However, when an employee has established a claim for vicarious liability where no tangible employment action was taken, \u201ca defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807, 118 S.Ct. at 2293. \u201cThe defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807, 118 S.Ct. at 2293. \u201cBoth elements must be satisfied for the defendant-employer to avoid liability, and the defendant bears the burden of proof on both elements.\u201d <em>Frederick v. Sprint/United Management Co., </em>246 F.3d 1305, 1313 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Faragher, </em>524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. at 2293).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">The first element of the affirmative defense, which is the element at issue in this appeal, has two prongs: (1) reasonable care to prevent sexual harassment and (2) reasonable care to correct sexual harassment. <em>Id. </em>at 1313-14. \u201c[A]n employer\u2019s showing that it has a sexual harassment policy does not automatically satisfy its burden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314. \u201c[Ojnce a company has developed and promulgated an effective and comprehensive anti-sexual harassment policy, aggressively and thoroughly disseminated the information and procedures contained in the policy to its staff, and demonstrated a commitment to adhering to this policy, it has fulfilled its obligation to make reasonably diligent efforts to \u2018know what is going on\u2019 within the company.\u201d <em>Farley v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>115 F.3d 1548, 1554 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Applying these legal standards to the facts of this case, we conclude that the district court properly denied Monroe County\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. A reasonable jury, upon considering all the evidence, could find that Monroe County did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it undertook reasonable care in preventing sexual harassment by elected commissioners, such as McCoy. Although the express terms of Monroe County\u2019s sexual harassment policy clearly made it applicable to the county\u2019s \u201cagents,\u201d such as elected commissioners,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the evidence at trial showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>that the policy could be considered largely ineffective as to them. The policy only mentioned that \u201cdisciplinary action\u201d or \u201cappropriate remedial action\u201d would be taken against employees and third parties who have harassed another individual, completely failing to mention whether any action would be taken against the county\u2019s \u201cagents.\u201d Although we agree with Monroe County that a sexual harassment policy need not spell out every single possible punishment for it to be an effective deterrent, here the policy completely failed to mention that McCoy would be subjected to any remedial action whatsoever.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Trial testimony buttressed this reading of the policy, as Monroe County employees, including the then-county attorney, were highly skeptical that any remedial action could be taken against commissioners under the policy because of their statuses as elected officials, not \u201cemployees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Furthermore, a reasonable jury could find that the policy was not \u201caggressively\u201d communicated to the commissioners. The record suggested that Monroe County took a deferential stance when it came to communicating the policy to commissioners and ensuring their understanding of it. Crucially, Monroe County\u2019s human resources director testified that although all employees were <em>required </em>to attend sexual harassment training, commissioners were merely invited to attend. To the best of her knowledge, McCoy never did attend any training. In addition, Monroe County required all its employees to sign annually a statement acknowledging that they had reviewed either its sexual harassment policy or a powerpoint presentation on the topic, but no evidence was adduced at trial that Monroe County ever required McCoy to sign such a statement. The record also did not reveal whether Monroe County even required McCoy to undergo training or sign a statement following a series of events that raised a question as to the propriety of McCoy\u2019s behavior well before Mrs. Bruno brought her allegations. Rather, the County seemed to be placated by McCoy\u2019s response that he could take care of himself and knew how to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">In sum, the district court did not err in denying Monroe County\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law. First, we conclude that a reasonable jury could find, based on the evidence presented at trial, that McCoy\u2019s conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment based on sexual harassment. Second, a reasonable jury could also find that Monroe County failed to take reasonable care in preventing its commissioners, such as McCoy, from engaging in sexually harassing behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-6\">. <em>Faragher v.
