On appeal, he contends that this sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-21\">We review a sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). A reasonable sentence is one that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the reasonableness of the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, Virgil challenges only the substantive reasonableness of his eight-month sentence and we limit our review accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">At sentencing, Virgil agreed that the sentencing guideline range of four to ten months\u2019 imprisonment had been properly calculated and requested the court to sentence him at the low-end of the guideline range and order his placement in a halfway house. Virgil\u2019s attorney explained that the structure of the halfway house would assist Virgil in becoming a better citizen in society. The government asked for a longer term of incarceration given the circumstances surrounding the revocation of his supervised release, but agreed that placement in a halfway house would be beneficial. The probation officer briefly discussed her concerns regarding Virgil\u2019s activities since his recent release from incarceration, but indicated that there was \u201csome hope\u201d so long as he could be \u201credirected.\u201d The probation officer then explained to the district court that she believed that an eight-month rather than a four-month sentence would allow the Bureau of Prisons enough time to arrange for Virgil\u2019s placement upon release in a halfway house.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The district court stated that it \u201ccarefully considered the statements of all parties and the information contained in the violation report\u201d and then sentenced Virgil to an eight-month term of imprisonment with a special condition that Virgil serve four months in a halfway house immediately after his term of imprisonment. Although the district court did not explicitly mention that it considered the \u00a7 3553 factors, given the statements from Virgil, the government and the probation officer regarding the benefit to Virgil of spending time in a halfway house in light of the ultimate sentence imposed, the record reflects that the district court \u201cadequately and properly considered\u201d the sentencing objective of rehabilitation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). That the district court placed great weight on this one factor does not render the sentence unreasonable, given that the district court attempted to craft a sentence that was responsive to this individual defendant\u2019s request for rehabilitation. Moreover, Virgil\u2019s attorney, the government\u2019s attorney, and the probation officer each provided the court with information about Virgil\u2019s recent background as well as their impressions about his individual characteristics, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), statements the district court stated that it considered before rendering sentence. Accordingly, we find that Virgil\u2019s eight-month sentence is not substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\">.
