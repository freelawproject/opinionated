Cruz-Paguada argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence based on his prior conviction for smuggling illegal aliens into the United States, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1324, when that conviction was not charged in his indictment. Cruz-Paguada\u2019s argument is foreclosed by the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). \u201c[W]e are bound to follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless and until the Supreme Court itself overrules that decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1035 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006). The district court did not err, much less plainly err, by enhancing Cruz-Paguada\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Cruz-Paguada\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
