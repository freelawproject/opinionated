For the reasons below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-19\">The procedural history of this case and the details of Cannon\u2019s claims are well known to the parties and need not be discussed at length. Briefly, Cannon filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. He argued that when he was admitted into the county prison, an intake counselor wrote down that Cannon was a pagan and not a Hebrew Israelite. He contended that he was not allowed to participate in Hebrew activities, which denied his rights under the First Amendment. He requested that the District Court grant the writ and enjoin respondents from violating his rights. The District Court denied the petition without prejudice to Cannon presenting his claims in a properly filed civil rights complaint. Cannon filed a timely notice of appeal, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-21\">We agree with the District Court that Cannon\u2019s claims concerning his participation in religious activities at the prison do not lie at the \u201ccore of habeas\u201d and, therefore, are not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Leamer v. Fauver, </em>288 F.3d 532, 542-44 (3d Cir.2002). None of his claims challenges the fact or length of his sentence or confinement. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-22\">Summary action is appropriate if there is no substantial question presented in the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
