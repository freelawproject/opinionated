Based on the record, we conclude the district court erred and the appellee is due to be resen-tenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">Darrell Mells pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii). The government timely filed a notice of enhanced penalties under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 based on Mells\u2019s 1992 drug convictions, which subjected Mells to a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. This mandatory ten-year enhanced penalty was included in Mells\u2019s written plea agreement and the district court advised Mells during the plea colloquy that he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. In addition, Mells repeatedly acknowledged that he had a prior conviction and faced the enhanced mandatory minimum sentence. Furthermore, the presentence investigation report identified the mandatory minimum sentence as ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">At sentencing, the court imposed a term of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment without explanation. When reminded that there was a ten-year mandatory minimum due to the enhanced penalty provision, the court stated that the presentence investigation report listed the mandatory minimum as five years and the court did not find the enhancement applicable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>On appeal, the government argues that the district court lacked authority to sentence Mells below the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence because the government had not moved for a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and Mells did not qualify for a reduction under the \u201csafety-valve\u201d provisions in \u00a7 5C 1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Mells responds that the \u00a7 851 enhancement notice was deficient in failing to cite the statutory basis for the enhancement or advise him of the enhanced sentence. He contends that the government must strictly comply with the notice requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the adequacy of a \u00a7 851 notice. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>544 F.3d 1176, 1183 n. 6 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>501 F.3d 1237, 1239 (11th Cir.2007). Section 851(a)(1) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-6\">No person who stands convicted of an offense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason of one or more prior convictions, unless before trial, or before entry of a plea of guilty, the United States attorney files an information with the court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or counsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.... Clerical mistakes in the information may be amended at any time prior to the pronouncement of sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">The purpose of \u00a7 851 is to inform the defendant that the government is seeking a sentencing enhancement so that the defendant can challenge the convictions if inaccurate and adjust his trial or pleading strategy with full knowledge of the consequences. <em>See Ramirez, </em>501 F.3d at 1239. \u201c[T]he \u00a7 851 notice requirement is jurisdictional: unless the government strictly complies, the district court lacks jurisdiction to impose an enhanced sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Jackson, </em>544 F.3d at 1184.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">This court generally requires strict compliance with \u00a7 851(a)(l)\u2019s filing and service requirements, but has permitted minor errors in the information\u2019s contents if the information \u201cunambiguously signaled the government\u2019s intent to rely upon a specific prior [drug] conviction\u201d to enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence and the defendant is not confused as to which prior conviction forms the basis of his enhancement. <em>Perez v. United States, </em>249 F.3d 1261, 1264-66 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">Here, the \u00a7 851 information stated that based on Mells\u2019s prior convictions in 1992 for three drug-related offenses the government \u201cwill ask the Court to sentence the defendant to enhanced punishment.\u201d A copy of the 1992 judgment of conviction was attached to the information. The indictment identified the amount of drugs involved as 500 grams or more of cocaine under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii). Mells\u2019s plea agreement and PSI specified that the sentence included a mandatory minimum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Mells acknowledged the enhanced penalty at the plea colloquy and again at sentencing. Thus, Mells does not \u2014 and cannot\u2014 claim he was misled by the notice or that the notice was ambiguous. <em>Cf Perez, </em>249 F.3d at 1267. The fact that the information did not identify the statute under which the enhancement arose did not render the enhancement inadequate because nothing in the plain language of \u00a7 851 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>requires the government to include such information. <em>See generally </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The cases Mells cites do not alter our conclusion. <em>United States v. Bowden, </em>2009 WL 32755 (11th Cir.) (unpublished), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1014, 175 L.Ed.2d 619 (2009) (concluding the notice was insufficient because it failed to identify the prior convictions and cited the wrong statute for the enhanced penalty), <em>United States v. Morales, </em>560 F.3d 112 (2d Cir.2009) (remanding because the \u00a7 851 notice was misleading), and <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>980 F.2d 245 (4th Cir.1992) (permitting the government to amend the notice to correct a clerical error where the notice otherwise clearly identified the prior convictions). Not only are these cases not binding authority but are distinguishable because Mells has not argued that he was misled or confused. Moreover, they do not dictate the result Mells seeks. The Second Circuit in <em>Morales </em>and the Fourth Circuit in <em>Campbell </em>stated that the \u00a7 851 notice was not required to identify the statutory section authorizing the enhancement. <em>See Morales, </em>560 F.3d at 113-14; <em>Campbell, </em>980 F.2d at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">We therefore conclude that the \u00a7 851 notice in this case was sufficient to fulfill the purpose of the notice requirement. It identified the prior convictions that formed the basis of the enhanced penalty and gave Mells the information to challenge the accuracy of the facts alleged and to plan his strategy. Mells was told repeatedly that he faced a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence, and he repeatedly acknowledged the enhancement. Because the notice was sufficient, the district court erred by failing to apply the enhancement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">Accordingly, we vacate and remand with instructions to resentence Mells in accordance with the mandatory ten-year minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-10\">. The PSI, which is part of the record on appeal, clearly identifies the mandatory minimum penalty of ten years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b860-9\">. Although the government disputes that it is jurisdictional, we are bound by prior precedent. Because the issue is jurisdictional, Mells may challenge the adequacy of the \u00a7 851 notice at any time. <em>See United States v. Giraldo-Prado, </em>150 F.3d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir.1998) (noting that \"a party may raise jurisdiction at any time during the pendency of the proceedings\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\">. Once the mandatory minimum applied, the district court could sentence Mells below the statutory minimum only upon a motion by the government based on substantial assistance. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, or if Mells qualified for the safety-valve provision, \u00a7 5C1.2. Neither instance applied to Mells.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
