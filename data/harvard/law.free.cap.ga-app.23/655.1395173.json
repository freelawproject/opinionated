Even if the agent\u2019s authority to collect notes for purchase-money from purchasers of pianos included authority to institute legal proceedings to recover pianos from purchasers, it does not appear that the agent had authority to institute such proceedings against a person who, as in this ease, according to the allegations of the petition, was not a purchaser and never had in his possession, power, custody, or control the piano involved in the proceeding, and against whom the proceeding was instituted not for the purpose of recovering the piano, but maliciously.

Callaway, as agent, instituted the proceeding, in the name of the company, to recover a certain piano which it had sold to the plaintiff\u2019s sister. Callaway was employed to collect for his principal from persons who had purchased pianos. Granting that it was within the scope of his authority to institute legal proceedings to recover possession of pianos from purchasers, there is nothing in the petition to show that he had any authority to institute a bail proceeding in the name of his principal against a third person who \u201cnever had such possession, power, custody, or control\u201d of the piano sold, and where the proceeding was \u201cnot for the purpose of recovering said piano, . . but maliciously.\u201d Civil Code (1910), \u00a7 3576; <em>Lewis </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>Amorous, </em>3 <em>Ga. App. </em>50 (59 S. E. 338). Nor is there in the petition anything to show that the principal, \u201cwith full knowledge \u2022of all the material facts relating to the act in question,\".ratified the act of the agent in instituting the bail-trover proceeding. Therefore the court did not err in sustaining the demurrer to the petition as amended and dismissing the petition, <em>Glass v. Brittain Brothers Co., </em>21 <em>Ga. App. </em>634 (94 S.
