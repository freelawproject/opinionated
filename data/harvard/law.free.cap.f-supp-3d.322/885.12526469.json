But the Government bans him from doing so, because 28 years ago, Hatfield lied on some forms that he sent to the Railroad Retirement Board: a felony in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Hatfield later pled guilty to one count of violating the statute, an offense for which he received no prison time and a meager amount in restitution fees pursuant to a formal plea agreement with the Government. Now, Hatfield brings this as-applied challenge to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) -the statute that bans him from owning a gun-on the grounds that it violates his Second Amendment rights. Hatfield embeds his argument in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767963\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/685/#p692\">\n    616 F.3d 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 692 (7th Cir. 2010), which instructed that \"[the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    D.C. v.

So for the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff Larry E. Hatfield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of this case are undisputed. From August 5, 1989 to January 5, 1990, Hatfield completed several claim for benefits forms and sent them to the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board. (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. A, ECF No. 41-1.) That agency administers benefits for unemployed railroad workers pursuant to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20351\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But Hatfield lied on the forms: he claimed that he was unemployed for 53 days when he was actually working for the Merchant Management Corporation of St. Louis, Missouri. Hatfield wrongfully obtained $1,627.73 from the Railroad Retirement Board because of the lie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Shortly thereafter, the Government charged Hatfield with one count of making a false statement in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) : a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hatfield later pled guilty to the charge following formal plea negotiations with the Government. Even though\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) provides for up to five-years imprisonment for each violation, the Government recommended in the amended plea agreement that the court only sentence Hatfield to three years' probation plus restitution in the amount of improper benefits received: $1,627.73. The court agreed, and ultimately sentenced Hatfield to those terms. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hatfield\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:91-cr-30093.) Since that time, Hatfield has maintained a spotless record: he has no mental health issues, he does not drink, he has no drug addictions, and he does not even have any traffic citations since his felony conviction. The only other blight in\n   his history is a driving while intoxicated charge from the 1980s, which predates the felony charge. (Hatfield Dep. 31:24-32:13, ECF No. 41-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Fast forward nearly three decades and we have a problem. Even though Hatfield received a small fine and no prison time for his non-violent statutory felony,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) bans him from owning a gun. That statute makes it unlawful for a person to possess a gun if they have been convicted of a crime that is technically punishable by more than one year (i.e. a felony)-regardless of the sentence that the individual actually received. Since making a false statement in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) is punishable by up to five years, Hatfield falls within the gambit of \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hatfield now brings an as-applied challenge to the statute, arguing that it violates his Second Amendment rights. His theory is straightforward: the Seventh Circuit has said that \"there must exist the possibility that the [felon disarmament] ban could be unconstitutional in the face of an as applied challenge,\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767963\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/685/#p692\">\n    616 F.3d at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Hatfield believes that he is the perfect challenger. He argues that the Government does not have an important interest in banning non-violent felons who received no prison time like him from having a gun. Hatfield also points out that while every state he researched has some sort of process to restore Second Amendment rights to felons on a case-by-case basis, the federal government does not. Curiously,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) does provide a similar mechanism for a federal felon to restore their Second Amendment rights through an application to the Attorney General, but Congress has chosen to not fund \u00a7 925(c) since the early 1900s. Accordingly, the only other ways for a felon affected by \u00a7 922(g)(1) to restore his gun rights are (1) through a Presidential pardon, or (2) an expungement of the felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Government moved for summary judgment, arguing that (1) the Second Amendment does not protect felons; and (2) even if it does, \u00a7 922(g)(1) satisfies intermediate scrutiny as-applied to felons like Hatfield. (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 41-2.) The Court held oral argument on the matter, where Hatfield made a cross-motion for summary judgment for the reasons stated within his response brief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Summary judgment must be granted \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The Government also points to\n   <em>\n    Yancey\n   </em>\n   , which explained that \"most scholars of the Second Amendment agree that the right to bear arms was tied to the concept of a virtuous citizenry and that, accordingly, the government could disarm 'unvirtuous citizens.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784074\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/681/\">\n    621 F.3d at 684-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But here, the Government has characterized the \"problem\" far too broadly. If the Court only considers felons in the aggregate, then there would be no distinction between an as-applied challenge to \u00a7 922(g)(1) and a facial challenge. And even if the Court narrows the scope to non-violent felons, it is still not enough-there are scores of non-violent felons in this country, all with massive discrepancies in prison sentences, fines, restitution payments, and more. Accordingly, the Court holds that the \"class\" of as-applied challengers here should be more specific to Hatfield's general circumstances: non-violent felons who received no prison time and a small monetary fine for their offense. That distinguishes this case from a recently failed \u00a7 922(g)(1) challenge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin, where the challenger had received twelve months and one day in jail plus a $50,000 fine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kanter v.

Wis. Dec. 29, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   With that principle in mind, the Government has failed to show an \"extremely strong public-interest justification\" for banning non-violent felons who received no prison time from owning a gun for self-defense purposes. Rather, Hatfield is correct that the Government has engaged in an \"abdication of their obligations\" here: the Government-instead of focusing on a narrow class of as-applied challengers-rests their position on the broad idea that since felons have shown a \"manifest disregard for the rights of others,\" the Government may immediately strip them of their Second Amendment rights. The Government seems to think this is the case even if they cut a plea deal with the felon that recommended zero days in prison, like they did with Hatfield. It is absolutely impossible to reconcile the Government's positions here that (1) a specific felon is so harmless that the felon does not need to go to prison for their felony conviction, but also (2) the felon is so dangerous that they should be stripped of their right to own a gun and defend their home. This type of logical inconsistency shows that the Government is not taking the Second Amendment seriously. The Second Amendment\n   <em>\n    has to mean something\n   </em>\n   as a matter of law, policy debates aside. Overbroad policies ignoring a constitutional amendment are inexcusable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii.

The Federal Firearms Act of 1938-the first major piece of federal legislation on this matter-only banned those \"convicted of a crime of violence\" from owning guns. PL 75-785, June 30, 1938,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Stat.%201250\">\n    52 Stat. 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That legislation did not reach non-violent offenders, like Hatfield. In 1961, Congress amended the statute to substitute \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" for \"crime of violence\"-meaning the statute now reached all felons, regardless of their underlying crime.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That Act cemented \u00a7 922(g)(1) into its current form. But the Act also crafted something else:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), a relief valve for felons impacted by \u00a7 922(g)(1) to restore their firearm rights by application to the Attorney General. Specifically, if the Attorney General (through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives [ATF] ) determines that a felon is not \"likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest,\" then the Attorney General may restore the felon's firearm rights. The statute also provides for judicial review of the Attorney General's decision. \u00a7 925(c) is a tacit admission by Congress that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is overbroad by facially applying to all felons regardless of their underlying crime or circumstances-indicating a bad fit between \u00a7 922(g)(1) and the Government's purpose of keeping firearms out of the hands of dangerous criminals who may create armed mayhem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   If the Government argued here that \u00a7 925(c) is a relief valve that saves \u00a7 922(g)(1)'s poor fit, then they could have won this case. But the Government was foreclosed from bringing that argument because\n   <em>\n    Congress stopped funding\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 925(c) in 1992-transforming what should have been a simple administrative proceeding into constitutional litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PL 102-393, October 6, 1992,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20Stat.%201729\">\n    106 Stat. 1729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

ATF, however, was forced to return the application and explained that the appropriations laws prevented the Bureau from expending funds on \u00a7 925(c) applications. The challenger then filed suit in federal court, relying on the judicial review provision in the statute. The Supreme Court denied the challenge, and explained that pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, federal courts could not engage in judicial review of the agency decision without an actual denial by the agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76-77,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190394,9190659\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/123/584/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This case is post-\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   , and instead centers on an as-applied constitutional challenge to \u00a7 922(g)(1). Hatfield\n   has not asked for a review of any agency decision, but rather asks the Court to declare that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as-applied to him-the only thing he can do at this point, short of a presidential pardon. And Hatfield is correct: the Government has not demonstrated (1) an extremely strong public-interest justification for banning non-violent felons who received no prison time from possessing firearms for self-defense purposes, and (2) a close fit between that purpose and \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the end, the Government's position in this case was peculiar. In the early 1990s, they recommended to the sentencing court that Larry Hatfield should receive zero months in prison for his crime: making a false statement to the Railroad Retirement Board, a statutory felony arising over 150 years after the Founders penned the Second Amendment. Hatfield has maintained a spotless record since his felony conviction. But now, the Government argues that Mr. Hatfield-and nonviolent felons in similar shoes-are so dangerous to society that they simply should not be able to enjoy their constitutional right to keep a gun in their homes for self-defense. Those two positions are irreconcilable. And not only that, the Government insists that this is not a matter for the federal courts to touch, but rather should be left to the other branches of government via a mechanism like\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) -which Congress does not even fund anymore.
