CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Superseding Indictment in this case was filed on November 16, 2017. (Doc. No. 29.) The case is set for trial on September 11, 2018. On September 5, 2018, the same day as the final pretrial conference, the Government filed a Motion to Amend the Indictment (Doc. No. 125) that is opposed by Defendant (Doc. No. 133).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Government seeks to amend the Superseding Indictment to include allegations regarding distribution of an additional controlled substance. In Count Six of the Superseding Indictment, a grand jury charged Defendant with possessing with the intent to distribute cocaine. The Government represents that, at some unstated time after the grand jury returned the Superseding Indictment, it \"learned through two cooperating individuals that the defendant mentioned that officers failed to locate the heroin that he had in his residence at the time of his arrest.\" (Doc. No. 125 at 1.) The Government further avers that \"[a]gents returned to the defendant's residence, after the execution of the search warrant and were unable to locate the heroin.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Government states that on August 4, 2018, it \"located a witness who confirmed that he purchased heroin from the defendant and the defendant sold heroin from his mobile home.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The Government does not state precisely when it disclosed this information to Defendant, but it clearly waited one month to request the Court to amend the Superseding Indictment to add heroin to Count Six alongside cocaine. The Government argues that its requested change is \"purely [a] matter of form\" and that Defendant is not prejudiced because drug identity is not an element of the offense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In response, Defendant argues that the Government's proposed amendment would violate his Fifth Amendment right to be tried only on charged offenses that have been presented to him in an indictment returned by a grand jury in the jurisdiction wherein the alleged crime was committed. (Doc. No. 133 at 1.) Defendant argues that the Government has been aware of this \"alternate way in which the offense could have been committed\" for a long period of time, and, accordingly, the proposed amendment is not a mere change in \"form,\" but rather a substantive change that implicates fair notice concerns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4.) In sum, Defendant contends that the Government's proposed amendment would affect his right to have a meaningful opportunity to effectively present a defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The Fifth Amendment guarantees that an accused be tried only on those offenses presented in an indictment and returned by a grand jury.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Government does not seek to make a grammatical correction or numerical clarification that will have no impact on the charges against Defendant. Rather, the Government seeks to accuse Defendant of possessing with intent to distribute heroin, in addition to cocaine. These are\n   <em>\n    new, substantive allegations\n   </em>\n   that were never presented to the grand jury, and thus were never tested to determine whether they are \"worthy of being presented to a jury for a determination of the defendant's guilt or innocence.\" Inexplicably, these allegations appear to have languished for some period of time, to be apparently resurrected by the late corroboration of one witness. This only highlights the importance of the grand jury evaluation process. It is the Court's view that, under the law, the proposed amendment would be inappropriate and per se prejudicial to Defendant. And, given the extremely belated timing of this motion - literally at the moment of the pretrial conference and days before trial - the proposed amendment would also be\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   prejudicial to Defendant, who would be required to at least modify, if not revise, his trial strategy in response to the additional potential avenue of criminal liability. The Court simply does not find that it is can or should impose this burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In sum, \"a court cannot permit a defendant to be tried on charges that are not made in the indictment against him.\"\n   <em>\n    Stirone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167188\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/361/212/#p217\">\n    361 U.S. at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167188\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/361/212/#p217\">\n    80 S.Ct. 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This case has been in the Government's hands for over a year. In Count Six, Defendant was explicitly charged with possession of and intent to distribute\n   <em>\n    cocaine\n   </em>\n   , not heroin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 29.) To amend the Superseding Indictment to include heroin even though no grand jury has passed on that as \"an essential description of the crime\" would contravene the Fifth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Budd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5703383\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/517/\">\n    496 F.3d at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Cook, dissenting). Indeed, to do so offends this Court's notion of basic fairness. Furthermore, introduction of evidence regarding the alleged heroin distribution that was the subject of the proposed amendment could \"constructively amend\" the Superseding Indictment, resulting in equivalent problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Government's Motion (Doc. No. 125) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . Defendant shall proceed to trial on the nine Counts of the Superseding Indictment as it stands. Evidence regarding the alleged heroin distribution is excluded pending any further motion by the Government at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Defendant also challenges certain aspects of the Government's recitation of the history of the evidence regarding the heroin and the lack of corroboration prior to August 4, 2018. For example, Defendant asserts that the Government has statements allegedly made by Defendant himself referencing heroin at 88 Palm Tree Court. (Doc. No. 133 at 2-3.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    The Court notes additionally that the Sixth Circuit's Pattern Jury Instruction applicable to Count Six requires reference to the specific drug charged.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pattern Crim.
