Facial Challenge and Prayer for Relief in the Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In Paragraph 61 of the Amended Complaint (ECF 84), under Count I, Plaintiffs assert that the Statutes and Regulations are unconstitutional both facially and as applied. The facial challenge to the Statutes' constitutionality, as pled in the Amended Complaint, was therefore not limited to a facial overbreadth theory, which was pled in Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   , in their prayer for relief, Plaintiffs requested \"[s]uch other legal and equitable relief to which Plaintiffs may appear entitled.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Rule 54(c)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Rule 54(c), F. R. Civ. P., provides, except for default judgments, that a final judgment \"should grant the relief to which\n   each party is entitled, even if the party has not demanded that relief in its pleadings.\" This broad grant of authority to enter an appropriate final judgment is relevant to the Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For a number of independent reasons, the Court has decided to grant the form of relief as requested by the Plaintiffs. In the first place, this is not a single plaintiff case. In some of the cases the Defendant relies on, there have been only one or a few plaintiffs, and the facts alleged are common to all plaintiffs. Here, as noted above, there are numerous Plaintiffs, representing many different aspects of the adult pornography industry. The Plaintiffs could have, and perhaps should have, brought the case as a class action, but the absence of a class does not, as a matter of law, limit the Court's ability in issuing a final decree that is fair to the parties and represents the legal reasoning as set forth by this Court in several existing opinions, and in several opinions by the Third Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This entire litigation was supported by many different plaintiffs involved in basically all aspects of the adult pornography industry. The Plaintiffs include producers, performers, artists, promotors - and the trial testimony disclosed their activities in significant detail. Thus, the Court's decision, holding at least some aspects of the Statutes and regulations, invalid under the First Amendment, considered, in practical effect, a trial record concerning all aspects of the adult pornography industry. Indeed, in the recent recorded telephone conference with counsel, Government counsel could not detail any aspect of the adult pornography industry that would be unaffected by this Court's ruling, and still be subject to valid and constitutional enforcement of all aspects of the Statutes in the future. In addition, the Third Circuit has already struck down one aspect of the Statute as unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, and although it did not enter a final judgment, the clear import of the Third Circuit's ruling was that the Government could not enforce the search and seizure provisions of the Statute against anyone, not just the individual Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This case has been pending for almost nine years, with several Third Circuit decisions. Several aspects of the Statute are still binding on the adult pornography industry, as reflected in the attached judgment, where the Court declined to award relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The leading law review article on the topic of court decrees in cases concerning facial or as-applied attacks on legislation, by Professor Fallon, cited above, has been frequently been quoted. He describes what is basically a doctrinal and jurisprudential quagmire, resulting from confusions in decisions of the Supreme Court and the Circuit Courts. This Court concludes, in its discretion, that there is no longer a strict dividing line between the relief that would be proper when a statute is facially unconstitutional, as opposed to a statute being declared unconstitutional \"as applied.\" The Supreme Court has basically noted with approval many of the points made by Professor Fallon and the underlined sentence in the\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   case, above,\n   gives this Court authority to enter the relief sought by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The final decree is attached.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Defendant also provided additional information regarding\n    <em>\n     United States v.
