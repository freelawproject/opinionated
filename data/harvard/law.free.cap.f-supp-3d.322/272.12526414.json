(Docket No. 12 at p. 3.) In 2014, the parties entered into a written agreement (the \"Agreement\"), which named MD Distributors as \"the exclusive distributor of [Dutch Ophthalmic's] products in the markets of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and the islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix.\" (Docket No. 1, Ex. 1 at p. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   One year later, the parties entered into an amended agreement (the \"Amended Agreement\"). (Docket No. 7, Ex. 1.) Section 1.1 of the Amended Agreement states that \"[the Amended Agreement] between [Dutch Ophthalmic] and [MD Distributors] dated July 23, 2015 ... supersedes and replaces all previous understandings, agreements or contracts, written or verbal between [Dutch Ophthalmic] and [MD Distributors].\" (Docket No. 7, Ex. 1 at p. 15.) Dutch Ophthalmic and MD Distributors agreed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [A]ll Annexes hereto and all non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be exclusively governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with Dutch law, with the exclusion of Dutch International private law and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods (Vienna Sales Convention).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Docket No. 7, Ex. 1 at p. 21.) The Amended Agreement also sets forth a forum selection clause, providing that \"[a]ll disputes arising from this Agreement (whether contractual or non-contractual) shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court of Rotterdam.\" (Docket No. 7, Ex. 1 at p. 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 5, 2017, \"[Dutch Ophthalmic] informed [MD Distributors] of the unilateral cancelation and/or nonrenewal of the [Amended Agreement].\" (Docket No. 1, Ex. 1 at p. 6.) In response, MD Distributors commenced an action against Dutch Ophthalmic in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance for breach of contract pursuant to Puerto Rico Law 75, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, sections 278\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Puerto Rico Law 75\"), and Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R.

(Docket No. 1 at p. 2.) MD Distributors contends, however, that the forum selection clause and choice of law provisions are unenforceable for the following reasons: (1) the Amended Agreement is void, (2) the clauses violate public policy pursuant to Puerto Rico Law 75, (3) the forum is inconvenient, and (4) the Rotterdam Court will not apply Law 75.

The dispositive inquiry in this action is whether the forum selection clause is enforceable. MD Distributors challenges the enforceability of the forum selection clause pursuant to the three\n   <em>\n    Bremen\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The forum selection clause was not a product of fraud or overreaching\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Overreaching\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   MD Distributors argues that the forum selection clause is unenforceable because the Amended Agreement is a contract of adhesion. (Docket No. 12 at p. 8.) \"A contract of adhesion is a contract offered by the authoring party on a take it or leave it basis rather than being negotiated between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034498\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/10/#p15\">\n    575 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   19 n. 7. MD Distributors anchors its argument on the proposition that it did not have an opportunity to negotiate the clause, seek the advice of counsel, or \"understand the nature of some of the clauses contained in the contract.\" (Docket No. 12 at p. 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This argument fails. In\n   <em>\n    Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of the United States held that forum selection clauses in contracts of adhesion are presumptively valid.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11320033\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/585/#p593\">\n    499 U.S. 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11320033\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/585/#p593\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11320033\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/585/#p593\">\n    113 L.Ed.2d 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) (citing\n   <em>\n    Bremen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p10\">\n    407 U.S. at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p10\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Bremen\n   </em>\n   , overreaching consists of \"unfair exploitation of [a party's] overwhelming bargaining power or influence over the other party.\"\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034498\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/10/#p15\">\n    575 F.3d at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . MD Distributors' argument fails because the terms of the forum selection clause are unambiguous, and nothing in the record suggests that the inequality in bargaining power among the parties is so disproportionate that the forum selection clause must be voided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silva\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11075934\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/385/\">\n    239 F.3d at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (enforcing forum selection clause where \"clause was written in plain language and the contract was of reasonable length.\");\n   <em>\n    Stereo Gema\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5662409\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/941/271/#p273\">\n    941 F.Supp. at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting claim that forum selection clause was unenforceable due to party's lack of awareness where \"[t]he terms of the clause [were] clear ...

In these circumstances, this Court presumes that each party at a minimum read and understood the terms of the Amended Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034498\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/10/#p15\">\n    575 F.3d at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"knowledge [of the contract] is imputed as a matter of law\").

Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The record demonstrates that the forum selection clause was not a product of fraud. The First Circuit Court of Appeal's decision in\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   is illustrative. In\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff argued that (1) no one explained the forum selection clause to him or informed plaintiff that he could seek an attorney, that (2) he did not attempt to negotiate, and that (3) he did not understand the legal implications of the terms.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034498\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/10/#p15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034498\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/10/#p15\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

MD Distributors' argument that the Amended Agreement \"should be considered null and void because of [Dutch Ophthalmic's] deceitful conduct,\" without more, cannot sustain Dutch Ophthalmic's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stereo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5662409\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/941/271/#p273\">\n    941 F.Supp. at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting challenge to forum selection clause where \"[plaintiff] was told that if he did not sign the agreement, [the defendant corporation] would not supply [him] with its products.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Enforcement of the forum selection clause would not be unreasonable or unjust\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   MD Distributors contends that it would be unjust and unreasonable to litigate the breach of contract action in The Netherlands. (Docket No. 12 at p. 11.) To invalidate a forum selection clause, \"the resisting party must show that trial in the contractual forum will be so gravely difficult and inconvenient that he will\n   <strong>\n    for all practical purposes be deprived of his day in court.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Bremen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p10\">\n    407 U.S. at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p10\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). MD Distributors argues that because all of the business records and witnesses are located in Puerto Rico, litigation in a foreign jurisdiction regarding the Amended Agreement is prohibitively difficult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This argument is unconvincing. The First Circuit Court of Appeals has held that \"something considerably more than the mere inconvenience of traveling to litigate in a different, even faraway foreign jurisdiction, is required to overcome a contractual agreement to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Mercurio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9017897,9177437\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/402/62/\">\n    402 F.3d 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66 (1st Cir. 2005)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royal Bed &amp; Spring Co. v.

MD Distributors does not allege that the relevant business records cannot be submitted or that witnesses cannot appear before the Rotterdam Court. Ultimately, MD Distributors' argument centers on mere inconvenience. \"The fact that another location would prove more convenient to the party resisting the agreed upon location[, however,] is not sufficient to meet the 'heavy burden' required to obviate a forum selection clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Antilles Cement Corp. v.

Enforcement of the forum selection clause does not contravene the public policy of Puerto Rico\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   MD Distributors argues that enforcement of the forum selection clause contravenes the public policy of Puerto Rico, (Docket No. 12 at p. 16.) MD Distributors relies on Puerto Rico Law 75, which serves \"to protect the interest of commercial distributors working in Puerto Rico.\"\n   <em>\n    Gemco Latinoamericana, Inc. v.

Laws Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7\u00a7 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . Puerto Rico Law 75 states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [a]ny stipulation that obligates a dealer to adjust, arbitrate or litigate any controversy that comes up regarding his dealer's contract outside of Puerto Rico, or under foreign law or rule of law, shall be likewise considered as violating the public policy set forth by this chapter and is therefore null and void.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7 278b-2. MD Distributors is a \"dealer\" pursuant to Law 75.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Triangle Trading Co. v.

Laws Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ). MD Distributors asserts that the forum selection clause is unenforceable because (1) \"the interpretation [of the forum selection clause] falls outside the ambit of federal common law; and (2) if the case were transferred to Rotterdam, \"there is no certainty that Puerto Rico's\n   Law 75 would even be applied.\" (Docket No. 12 at pp. 6 and 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This argument is flawed for two reasons. First, it rests on a false assumption that the public policy of Puerto Rico is dispositive. On the contrary, courts have frequently upheld forum selection clauses pertaining to claims arising pursuant to Puerto Rico Law 75.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Royal Bed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1811866\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/906/45/#p49\">\n    906 F.2d at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding forum selection clause prescribing Brazil as mandatory forum);\n   <em>\n    Antilles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5641910\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/526/205/#p208\">\n    526 F.Supp.2d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same; England);\n   <em>\n    Stereo Gema\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5662409\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/941/271/#p273\">\n    941 F.Supp. at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same; California);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Puerto Rico Surgical Techs., Inc. v.

Oct. 26, 2010) (Pieras, J.) (holding that clause in exclusive distribution agreement designating California as the forum did not contravene a strong public policy of Puerto Rico). Second, MD Distributors' argument is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    454 U.S. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    70 L.Ed.2d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981), the leading case on the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   doctrine. In\n   <em>\n    Piper\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court of Appeals erred in holding that plaintiffs may defeat a motion to dismiss on the ground of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   merely by showing that the substantive law that would be applied in the alternative forum is less favorable to the plaintiffs than that of the present forum. The possibility of a change in substantive law should ordinarily not be given conclusive or even substantial weight in the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   inquiry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, this Court finds that the forum selection clause does not contravene the public policy of Puerto Rico. Because the forum selection clause is enforceable, dismissal is warranted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
