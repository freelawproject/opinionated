Vox's complaint includes four counts against Mr. Mansfield for (1) fraud; (2) fraudulent concealment; (3) conversion; and (4) unjust enrichment. Pending before the Court is Mr. Mansfield's motion to dismiss Vox's complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 14.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Vox is a digital media company organized under Delaware law with its principal place of business in the District of Columbia. Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6 2. Vox creates and distributes news content online \"covering sports, culture, technology, and politics, among other subjects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In August 2012, Vox hired Mr. Mansfield to work as its \"Procurement Manager\" within the finance and accounting department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9. Mr. Mansfield worked in that position for three years, until he left Vox in June 2015 and moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he currently resides.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8, 21. As Procurement Manager, Mr. Mansfield \"coordinat[ed] procurement methods; manag[ed] data from company cards, expense reports, and corporate accounts for budget reporting; and monitor[ed] spend[ing] levels.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Mr. Mansfield also managed Vox's corporate credit card account and its various frequent-flier and travel reward accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 15. Upon joining Vox, Mr. Mansfield \"acknowledged and agreed to abide by\" Vox's \"Employee Handbook.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. In so doing, he \"agreed to 'serve the Company faithfully and use [his] best efforts to promote its interests.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also agreed he would not damage, destroy, or steal company property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Vox applied for its corporate credit card in May 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. The credit card had a \"rewards program\" under which a customer earned \"points\" based on the customer's spending.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 16. The customer could use the points to purchase travel or merchandise or simply convert the points to cash or cash-equivalent bonus cards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. A corporate customer could choose to enroll the company itself in the rewards program or allow individual employees to earn the points.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Vox chose to enroll the company itself; therefore, \"all points accrued from company [credit] cards under the rewards program would be for Vox Media's use.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Likewise, Vox enrolled itself in travel reward accounts that operated similarly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16. The company did not authorize individuals to redeem or transfer the company's travel or credit card points for personal use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14. During Mr. Mansfield's tenure, Vox had not dedicated a specific use for the rewards points; it was \"deliberating\" and put the points \"aside until the company had determined a use for them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Vox alleges that Mr. Mansfield \"betrayed the company\" by \"secretly stealing from it throughout his employment, and even afterwards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. According to Vox, Mr. Mansfield \"repeatedly use[d] his control over the corporate credit card and travel accounts to transfer cash ... or reward points ... to his personal accounts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, Mr. Mansfield allegedly converted rewards points to cash-equivalent gift cards and instructed the merchants to send the gift cards to his\n   personal address.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also allegedly used the rewards points to purchase luxury goods-including a watch worth over $1,700-which he also sent to his personal address.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 22. Mr. Mansfield also allegedly bought himself airline tickets using Vox's frequent-flier points.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to Vox, Mr. Mansfield \"continued this theft long after he left his position\" in June 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. He allegedly continued using Vox's points until at least February 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From March 2013 through at least February 2016, Mr. Mansfield allegedly stole over $210,000 worth of Vox's assets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30. Vox discovered Mr. Mansfield's alleged scheme in April 2016 and filed its complaint on April 14, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

For example, Vox alleges that Mr. Mansfield was \"entrusted with the management of corporate assets,\" Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6 1, and had \"a special duty of care,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23, yet \"never disclosed\" his actions to the company,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Vox also alleges that Mr. Mansfield had a duty to \"serve the company faithfully\" and not steal \"any company property\" pursuant to its policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mr. Mansfield contends that he was not a fiduciary because he had a \"relatively low-level position\" and \"was not an officer or director, or even the head of a department.\" Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 14 at 8. Whether Mr. Mansfield was indeed a fiduciary is \"contested question[ ] of fact\" that the Court may not resolve at this stage of the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Feld Ent., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3850920\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/873/288/#p308\">\n    873 F.Supp.2d at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"District of Columbia law has deliberately left the definition of 'fiduciary relationship' flexible.\"\n   <em>\n    Kemp v.

As such, determining whether a fiduciary relationship exists is \"a\n   <em>\n    fact-intensive\n   </em>\n   question, and the fact-finder must consider 'the nature of the relationship, the promises made, the type of services or advice given and the legitimate expectations of the parties.' \"\n   <em>\n    Millennium Square Residential Ass'n v. 2200 M Street LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3935690\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/952/234/#p248\">\n    952 F.Supp.2d 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248-49 (D.D.C. 2013) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Firestone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7637568,3691597\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/76/1205/\">\n    76 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1211 ) (emphasis added). Given Mr. Mansfield's alleged control over Vox's credit card and travel accounts and its alleged expectation that he would serve the company faithfully, it is plausible that Mr. Mansfield had a fiduciary relationship with Vox.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Therefore, the Court cannot conclude, at this stage of the proceedings, that Vox's complaint is conclusively time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Vox Sufficiently Pled Fraudulent Concealment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Relatedly, Mr. Mansfield argues that Vox failed to plead \"any element[ ]\" of fraudulent concealment. Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 14 at 8. As discussed, the Court finds that Vox pled facts sufficient to infer that Mr. Mansfield concealed his alleged theft and that Vox had no notice of the concealment, despite its due diligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Firestone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7637568,3691597\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/76/1205/\">\n    76 F.3d at 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the elements of fraudulent concealment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Still, Mr. Mansfield argues that the Vox has not pled fraudulent concealment because it has not \"establish[ed] that [Vox] used due diligence in trying to uncover the facts.\" Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 14 at 8. Mr. Mansfield contends that Vox exercised \"no oversight\" and failed to allege any steps its employees took to supervise Mr. Mansfield, request access to the rewards accounts, or review the accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. Vox responds by arguing that the Court may not infer a lack of diligence on a motion to dismiss.
