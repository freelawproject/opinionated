Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   LaserShip, a package delivery company, is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Virginia. Defendant Blake Averill is CEO of the company and resides in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. Reynoso, a Massachusetts resident, was a professional owner-operator providing equipment and labor services to LaserShip from November, 2012, to May, 2017. In May, 2017, the parties executed an Independent Contractor Agreement (\"Agreement\") which governed the terms and conditions of their business relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   That Agreement superseded independent contractor agreements previously entered into between the parties in January, 2014, August, 2014 and March, 2016. The Agreement contains a merger clause stating that it supersedes any and all other agreements between the parties. It also includes a mandatory forum selection clause as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Choice of Forum. The parties agree that any legal proceedings between the parties arising from, in connection with, or relating to this Agreement or arising out of, in connection with or relating in any way to any prior agreements between the parties, any current or prior relationship between the parties, any other dealings between the parties, or to any aspect of the relationship between the parties to this Agreement, whether under federal, state, local, or foreign law, shall be brought exclusively in Vienna, Virginia, or in the nearest location in Virginia where such proceedings can be maintained. LaserShip and Contractor hereby consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such fora.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Throughout his employment with the company, Reynoso was responsible for delivering packages for LaserShip and was paid according to the number of deliveries he made. LaserShip assigned Reynoso certain routes, set his schedule, prevented him from delivering for any other company, required him to drive a white van and provided him with a uniform bearing the LaserShip logo. LaserShip also required Reynoso to report to the warehouse for each day of work by 8:30 a.m. to retrieve packages and to call the warehouse at the end of the day to confirm that the routes were complete. Reynoso asserts that he, and others similarly situated, have been misclassified as independent contractors and that there was an employer-employee relationship between LaserShip and those providing equipment and labor services to LaserShip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Reynoso also alleges that as a result of that misclassification, he and other delivery drivers have suffered damages and incurred expenses that should have been paid by LaserShip, such as expenses for gasoline, vehicle maintenance and payroll taxes. Further, Reynoso and other drivers regularly worked more than 40 hours per week and, because paystubs did not include all hours worked, Reynoso and others similarly situated suffered lost wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Reynoso brought this action in Massachusetts Superior Court for Middlesex County asserting claims individually and on behalf of others similarly situated for 1) misclassification as independent contractor in violation of the Wage Act, M.G.L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148B &amp; 150 (\"the Wage Act\"), 2) nonpayment of overtime wages in violation of the Massachusetts Overtime Law, M.G.L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1A &amp; 1B, 3 ) nonpayment of earned overtime wages in violation of M.G.L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148 &amp; 150, 4) failure to maintain proper payroll records in violation of M.G.L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, M.G.L. c. 151, \u00a7 15 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=454%20C.M.R.%2027\">\n    454 CMR 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .02(2) and 5) unjust enrichment.

Although Rule 12(b)(6) remains a proper vehicle to seek enforcement of a forum selection clause in this Circuit, a district court should \"ordinarily\" use \u00a7 1404(a) to enforce a forum-selection clause that identifies a federal forum for the convenience of the parties and in the interest of justice.\n   <em>\n    Atl.

That language indicates that the parties have agreed to bring any federal actions in the Eastern District of Virginia because it encompasses Vienna, Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herbert H.

Motion to Transfer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   LaserShip contends that the forum-selection clause in the Agreement should be enforced because there is no public interest warranting a refusal to transfer, the forum selection clause encompasses the claims brought in this action and the forum-selection clause is mandatory, as opposed to permissive. Reynoso responds by suggesting that the forum-selection clause is invalid because it effectively waives rights under the Wage Act in violation of the anti-waiver provision. He also rejoins that the forum-selection clause is invalid because it contravenes Massachusetts public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The analysis established in\n   <em>\n    AtlanticMarine\n   </em>\n   warrants enforcement of the forum-selection clause and transfer pursuant to \u00a7 1404(a). First, the fact that Reynoso filed this action in Massachusetts is entitled to no weight.\n   <em>\n    Atl.

Next, contrary to Reynoso's contention, there is no public interest consideration sufficient to render this an \"unusual case\" warranting a decision not to transfer in the face of a forum-selection clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Upon transfer to the proper federal forum, here the Eastern District of Virginia, that district will apply the choice-of-law rules of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Enforcement of the forum-selection clause in the Agreement does not constitute a waiver of Reynoso's rights under the Wage Act. Plaintiff's contention that Virginia courts will decline to apply Massachusetts law, effectively allowing the forum-selection clause to operate as a waiver of rights, is unavailing. First, although the Wage Act\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   does embody fundamental public policy, nothing in the Wage Act's text or structure suggest that enforcement must always be available in Massachusetts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Melia\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zenhire, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273605\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/462/164/#p169\">\n    462 Mass. 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 169,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20N.E.2d%20580\">\n    967 N.E.2d 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).
