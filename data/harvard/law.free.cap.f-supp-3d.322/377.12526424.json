(\"Taverna Associates\"),\n   and Juliet Taverna (\"Juliet\") (together, the \"Taverna Defendants\") (all together, the \"Defendants\"). The Plaintiffs allege fifteen New York State causes of action stemming from a series of life insurance policies purchased by the Plaintiffs from 2010 through 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is a motion filed by the Taverna Defendants pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\" FED. R. CIV. P. \" or \"Rule\") 12(b)(6), seeking to dismiss the complaint as it pertains to the Taverna Defendants for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. For the following reasons, the Taverna Defendants' motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are drawn from the Plaintiffs' complaint, and for the purposes of the instant motion, they are construed in favor of the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thomas and Arlene are married retirees that are currently residing in Smithtown, New York. Thomas is a retired physician. Their daughters, Tracey and Kristen, both live in East Moriches, New York. Like her father, Tracey is a physician. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Juliet is an insurance agent, registered with the New York State Department of Financial Services, who is employed by or owns Taverna Associates, a corporation based in Greenwich, Connecticut. Juliet managed a portion of the Plaintiffs' wealth for an indeterminate period of time. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In November 2009, Juliet advised Arlene to consider purchasing $3,800,000 in life insurance. On January 18, 2010, Transamerica Policy No. 42629921 was issued. Arlene was listed as the insured and Kristen and Tracey as the owners of the policy. Thomas and Arlene also purchased two MetLife life insurance policies prior to January 2012. Policy No. 7402938 was a $1,667,884 policy and Policy No. 7403224 was a $3,000,000 policy. The Plaintiffs also purchased a second Transamerica Policy, No. 92526800, with a death benefit of $600,000. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In January 2012, Juliet advised Arlene to surrender the Plaintiffs' four current life insurance policies, which had a combined death benefit of $9,067,884 and purchase a new set of policies. The Plaintiffs surrendered their four life insurance policies and began transferring the surrender values of them using like-kind exchanges into new insurance policies issued by United of Omaha Life Insurance Company. At that time, Thomas and Arlene purchased Unity of Omaha Joint and Last Survivor Life Insurance Policy No. BU1375075 with a $3,600,000 death benefit. Kristen and Tracey were responsible for all premium payments and the policy was executed by all the Plaintiffs. Compl. \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Three months later, based on Juliet's advice, Arlene purchased Unity of Omaha Universal Life Insurance Policy No. BU1375078 with a $2,600,000 death benefit. Arlene is listed as the insured on the policy and Tracey is responsible for all premium payments. Compl. \u00b6 21. The following month, on the advice of Juliet, Thomas purchased Unity of Omaha Universal Life Insurance Policy No. BU1375080 with a $1,667,884 death benefit. Thomas is the insured under the policy and Tracey is responsible for all premium payments. Compl. \u00b6 22. These three Unity of Omaha life insurance policies (\"Unity of Omaha Policies\") have a combined death benefit of $7,867,884.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In February 2017, the Plaintiffs terminated their relationship with Juliet and Taverna Associates. The Unity of Omaha Policies remained in effect for five years prior to the initiation of this action. The\n   Plaintiffs fully paid the annual premiums; however, fortunately, no death benefit needed to be paid. According to the Plaintiffs, the Unity of Omaha Policies were in excess of the Plaintiffs' coverage needs, were not justified by their assets, and were in excess of their ability to pay the premiums. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. THE RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 18, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed the above-mentioned complaint in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Omaha Defendants filed their answer on September 18, 2017, whereby they asserted a series of crossclaims against the Taverna Defendants and a counterclaim against the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 4, 2017, the Taverna Defendants moved under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss the complaint, contending that the Plaintiffs' allegations, even if taken as true, fail to plausibly state claims upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Sup. Ct. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Plaintiffs have failed to allege the \"course of dealing\" exception to the limited role of an insurance broker. While the complaint does state that Juliet was the Plaintiffs' financial advisor, the pleadings are devoid of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   allegations that Juliet ever provided financial advice to the Plaintiffs that was not insurance related. There is nothing in the complaint that can allow this Court to conclude that Juliet provided financial advice on the Plaintiffs' other assets; that she executed any additional transactions for the Plaintiffs; or that they regularly met or spoke regarding finances. Instead, it focuses on the Taverna Defendant's role in acquiring the insurance products at-issue. The Plaintiffs allegations are confined exclusively to Juliet's role as an insurance broker, not as a broader financial advisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, the complaint fails to allege the long-standing client relationship that is characteristic of the \"course of dealing\" exception. The earliest interaction between Juliet and the Plaintiffs that is noted in the complaint occurred in November 2009. Approximately two and a half years later, the Plaintiffs executed their final life insurance policy with the Taverna Defendants. Although the complaint does note that Juliet contacted the Plaintiffs in February 2017 to \"advise [the] Plaintiffs to change their insurance policies,\" Compl. \u00b6 33 n.4, there is no indication that this was part of an ongoing business relationship, or that there was any contact in the almost five years after the Plaintiffs purchased their last policy. This lack of a long-standing, continuous relationship is suggestive of a typical insurance broker relationship, rather than the special relationship that the Plaintiffs claim. Therefore, even in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, and drawing all inferences in their favor, the complaint does not successfully allege a \"course of dealing\" exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court also rejects the Plaintiffs' contention that \"specific wrongs\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   occur each time Plaintiffs paid a premium under the [Unity of Omaha Policies].\" DE 36 at 16 (emphasis in original).

Based on this allegation, it is unclear to the Court what exactly was omitted and fails to reveal any of the relevant circumstances. Similarly, even if the Taverna Defendants \"fail[ed] to inform Plaintiffs that the [Unity of Omaha Policies'] benefits were not materially better than Plaintiffs' existing insurance coverage,\" the Plaintiffs have not alleged a fraudulent omission. This allegation is also too vague to satisfy Rule 9(b)'s requirements. What constitutes \"materially better\" can constitute an opinion and mean different things to different people. Without knowing what \"materially better\" is referring to, the Court is unable to determine whether there was an omission in the first place, let alone understand the circumstances. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs' allegation that the Taverna Defendants \"fail[ed] to inform Plaintiffs of the benefits being gleaned by the Defendants\" is similarly flawed. This amorphous contention\n   falls short of Rule 9(b)'s pleading standard. If the Plaintiffs are alleging that the Taverna Defendants failed to inform them that their insurance broker received commissions for the issuance of their policies, that omission fails to rise to a level amounting to fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Levitin v.
