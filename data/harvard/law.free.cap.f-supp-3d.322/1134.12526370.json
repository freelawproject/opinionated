More specifically, given sunlight and the right meteorological conditions, NOx and VOCs can react with each other to produce ozone. This case turns on BLM's consideration of NOx and VOCs at the second stage of the three-stage process described above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The May 2015 Lease Sales\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Acting under an RMP encompassing northeastern Colorado, BLM issued an August 2014 environmental assessment (\"EA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   analyzing the environmental consequences of a proposed May 2015 auction of numerous oil and gas leases in that region. (Administrative Record (ECF No. 11) (\"R.\") at 3895.) BLM understood that some of the lease parcels fall within the Nonattainment Area. (R. at 3700.) The EA therefore included a discussion of the NAAQS conformity requirement. (R. at 3700-01.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Applying the General Conformity Rule, BLM concluded that it did not need to perform a full conformity analysis for a number of reasons. As to \"direct\" emissions, BLM noted that leasing does not authorize any sort of emissions-generating activity, and so no \"direct\" emissions would result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Concerning \"indirect\" emissions (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , future emissions likely to result upon approval of a lessee's APD), BLM found them analogous to land transfers, which EPA exempts from conformity analysis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) BLM also found that indirect emissions were not reasonably foreseeable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   - It is unclear who[ ] may bid on, let alone win individual lease parcels. Where such sales are made on a broad scale, it is unclear how many individuals may gain an interest in any number of the nominated parcels.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   - Further, it is unclear if/how the parcels would be developed during the initial 10 year lease period, such that an emissions inventory could be reasonably estimated and compared to the de minimis thresholds, on an annual basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (R. at 3701.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   BLM additionally reasoned that its proposed lease sales were analogous to sales of offshore leases for the Outer Continental\n   Shelf, an action which EPA regulations specifically exempt from conformity analysis because EPA has determined that indirect emissions are not reasonably foreseeable in that context. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, BLM relied on EPA regulations that excuse conformity analysis as to certain aspects of drilling operations that must pass muster under separate CAA approval process known as new source review (\"NSR\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With this exemption in mind, BLM reasoned, \"It is unclear but highly likely that several project design features, for example equipment sets, such as tanks, separates, compression[ ] engines, pump jacks, dehydration units, etc..., will require at least a minor new source review (i.e. permit) prior to constructing such facilities to implement any subsequent development proposals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (ellipses in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In March 2015, WildEarth formally protested BLM's plans for the May 2015 lease sales. (R. at 765.) WildEarth challenged BLM's conclusion that it need not perform a NAAQS conformity analysis for ozone. (R. at 775-79.) Among its many arguments, WildEarth claimed that BLM already had data through which it estimated reasonably foreseeable emissions on a broad, region-wide scale, and so there appeared to be no reason why it could not use that same data to estimate emissions from the various parcels included in the upcoming auction. (R. at 778.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In May 2015, BLM issued a revised EA incorporating and responding to comments and objections, such as WildEarth's. (R. at 3895.) As for choosing not to perform a NAAQS conformity analysis, BLM re-adopted all of its original reasoning save for the analogy to the exempted activity of land transfers. (R. at 3916-17.) Apparently responding to WildEarth's comment about BLM already possessing data from which it could predict emissions, BLM elaborated that it could \"make broad predictions about possible future emissions in a region for purposes of NEPA cumulative impacts analysis,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   but \"it does not have specific information about whether or how the specific parcels under consideration may be developed during the initial 10 year lease period, such that a more precise emissions inventory could be reasonably estimated and compared to the [100-tpy] threshold[ ].\" (R. at 3916.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Soon after releasing this revised EA, BLM put 86 parcels up for auction, and sold 73 of them, including some within the Nonattainment Area. (R. at 1843, 3906, 4065, 4068.) Relying on extra-record evidence, WildEarth claims that 31 of the 73 are in the Nonattainment Area. (ECF No. 13 at 20 &amp; n.5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   BLM objects to consideration of these documents (ECF No. 14 at 22 &amp; n.5), and indeed, WildEarth has not moved to supplement the record. But the Court finds that whether it accepts WildEarth's numbers or not, the outcome of this lawsuit would be the same, so the Court need not resolve BLM's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The November 2015 Lease Sales\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In November 2015, BLM conducted another auction of leases for parcels in northeast Colorado (some within the Nonattainment Area) following essentially the same pattern as it did with the May 2015 lease sales. BLM released an EA for the proposed November 2015 sales in May 2015. (R. at 7591.) For the same reasons described in its May 2015 EA approving the May 2015 lease sales, BLM decided that EPA regulations exempted it from performing\n   a NAAQS conformity analysis for ozone as to the proposed November 2015 sales. (R. at 7613.) In September 2015, WildEarth formally objected for the same reasons advanced in its objection to the May 2015 lease sales. (R. at 5547-52.) And, in November 2015, BLM issued a revised EA addressing and rejecting WildEarth's objections and re-adopting the reasoning in the original EA. (R. at 7723, 7755-56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Shortly after issuing the November 2015 revised EA, BLM put 121 parcels up for auction and sold 106 of them, including some within the Nonattainment Area. (R. at 7751, 7965, 7969.) Again relying on extra-record evidence, WildEarth says that 36 of the 106 sold parcels are within the Nonattainment Area (ECF No. 13 at 20 &amp; n.6), and the Court again finds that it need not resolve BLM's objection to this extra-record assertion because the resolution would not change the outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Framing the Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For clarity, the Court emphasizes that BLM did not perform a NAAQS conformity analysis, or in other words, BLM never forecasted whether either the May 2015 or November 2015 lease sales would prolong the ozone problems in the Nonattainment Area. Relying on the General Conformity Rule, BLM instead concluded that it had no duty to make such a forecast because it was not reasonably foreseeable that either the May 2015 lease sale or the November 2015 lease sale would indirectly lead to 100 tpy in emissions of an ozone precursor. All parties agree that reasonable foreseeability of indirect emissions at the 100-tpy threshold is the crux of the current dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To repeat, emissions are reasonably foreseeable under the General Conformity Rule if \"the location of such emissions is known and the emissions are quantifiable as described and documented by the Federal agency based on its own information and after reviewing any information presented to the Federal agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2093.152\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 93.152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because BLM knew precisely where each lease parcel was located, there is no dispute in this lawsuit over the \"location of such emissions is known\" clause, leaving only a question of whether emissions were \"quantifiable as described and documented by [BLM] based on its own information and after reviewing any information presented to [it].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Previous Emissions Predictions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   What information, then, was in BLM's possession, or was otherwise presented to it, that would allow it to quantify the ozone precursor emissions likely to result indirectly (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , in the future) from the lease sales? WildEarth points to three studies in BLM's possession. (ECF No. 13 at 27-32.) The Court will summarize each in turn. Additional details from these studies are presented below in Part IV.C.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The 2012 Development Scenario\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In March 2012, BLM's Royal Gorge Field Office (which encompasses the Nonattainment Area) received a study it had commissioned titled \"Reasonable\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Foreseeable Development Scenario for Oil and Gas, Royal Gorge Field Office, Colorado\" (\"2012 Development Scenario\"). (R. at 9557.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Royal Gorge Field Office intended\n   to use this study when revising its RMP. (R. at 9563.) It contains historical drilling statistics in the relevant region (R. at 9566-80), estimates of future oil and gas prices (R. at 9580-82), an assessment of \"occurrence potential\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , discovery of new oil and gas resources in the region) (R. at 9582-84), and predictions about numbers of new wells through the year 2030 (R. at 9584-91).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The 2013 Emissions Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In July 2013, the Royal Gorge Field Office received from a contractor a \"Draft Oil and Gas Air Emissions Inventory Report for Seven Lease Parcels in the BLM Royal Gorge Field Office\" (\"2013 Emissions Report\"). (R. at 3332.) According to WildEarth, BLM commissioned this document \"to meet the requirements of a settlement agreement between [WildEarth] and BLM in a previous lawsuit\" (ECF No. 13 at 27), about which the parties otherwise say nothing (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. at 3336 (mentioning a \"Stipulation and Order entered into by WildEarth Guardians and the BLM\" in 2012) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The 2013 Emissions Report studied seven specific lease parcels in northeast Colorado (four in Weld County, three in Morgan County). (R. at 3336-37.) Drawing on the 2012 Development Scenario's estimates and assumptions regarding the potential density of well sites, the 2013 Emissions Report projected the number of wells likely to be drilled on the seven lease parcels under examination. (R. at 3338.) The authors assumed that each lease parcel would have at least one well, because, they said, \"[p]arcels must have at least one well in order to retain the lease.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Having set forth the assumptions, the 2013 Emissions Report then provided per-well estimates of emissions, including emissions of NOx and VOCs, calculated in tons per year. (R. at 3340.) The calculations for those specific ozone precursors are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-70\"><strong>NOx (tpy)</strong> <strong>VOCs (tpy)</strong> <strong>Oil Extraction</strong> Construction 11.16 0.75 Operation 10.58 20.96 Maintenance 0.00 0.00 Reclamation 0.02 0.00 TOTAL 21.75 21.72 <strong>Natural Gas Extraction</strong> Construction 11.18 0.76 Operation 4.53 33.30 Maintenance 0.00 0.00 Reclamation 0.02 0.00 TOTAL 15.73 34.06</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The 2015 Modeling Study\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In January 2015 BLM's Colorado State Office received a study it had commissioned as part of RMP revisions, titled \"Colorado Air Resource Managing Modeling Study\" (\"2015 Modeling Study\"). (R. at 9055.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   This study drew on the 2012 Development\n   Scenario\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   to create assumptions about air emissions under \"High, Low, and Medium Development Scenarios\" for oil and gas operations in northeastern Colorado by the year 2021. (R. at 9078-80.) The projections include estimates of NOx and VOC emissions in tons per year. (R. at 9111-12.) WildEarth does not point to any particular estimated value as significant, but instead emphasizes the 2015 Modeling Study's existence as evidence that emissions may be forecasted with reasonable certainty. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13 at 32; ECF No. 15 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Reasonable Foreseeability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Having reviewed the foregoing three documents, the Court frankly expected WildEarth to present an argument essentially as follows: The 2013 Emissions Report (authored as part of a settlement with WildEarth) estimates that a typical oil well in operation emits 10.58 tpy of NOx and 20.96 tpy of VOCs; and a typical natural gas well in operation emits 4.53 tpy of NOx and 33.3 tpy of VOCs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part IV.B.2, above.) Thus, it would take only 10 oil wells or 23 natural gas wells operating in a single year to exceed 100 tpy for NOx, and only 5 oil wells or 4 natural gas wells operating in a single year to exceed 100 tpy for VOCs. Surely (the argument would continue) BLM could feel reasonably certain that, of the dozens of leases it planned to auction, at least, say, 5 will result in oil extraction operations occurring in the same year. BLM accordingly could reasonably foresee ozone precursor emissions above the 100-tpy threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   But WildEarth, quite surprisingly, does not make this argument. Moreover, the typical rate (if there is a typical rate) at which leases offered at auction result in operating oil or natural gas wells is far beyond a judicially noticeable fact-much less the number of leases that result in operating wells simultaneously with other new wells arising from the same auction. Accordingly, the Court presumes that WildEarth intentionally chose not make any argument akin to the foregoing, and the Court will explore it no further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Parties' Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    WildEarth's Opening Brief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   WildEarth instead offers a different argument. WildEarth begins by borrowing the 2013 Emissions Report's assumption that lessees must place at least one well on every leased parcel to avoid forfeiting the lease. (ECF No. 13 at 27.) WildEarth then draws on its claim that the May 2015 sale yielded 31 leases in the Nonattainment Area, meaning, \"at a minimum,...31 new wells.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Multiplying the per well emissions estimates for NOx and VOCs from the [2013] Emissions Report by 31 new wells results in: (1) 674.25 tpy of NOx and 673.32 tpy of VOCs for oil wells, and (2) 487.63 tpy of NOx and 1,055.86 tpy of VOCs for gas wells. Accordingly, estimated NOx and VOC emissions from the May 2015 lease sale exceed the Clean Air Act's 100 tpy emission threshold for a conformity determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) WildEarth performs the same calculation for the November 2015 sales, which allegedly yielded 36 leases in the Nonattainment Area and thus could be expected to result in 36 new wells with \"(1) 783 tpy of NOx and 781.92 tpy of VOCs for oil wells, and (2) 566.28 tpy of NOx and 1,226.16 tpy of VOCs for gas wells.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   All of these calculations rely on the \"TOTAL\" rows of the table reproduced in Part IV.B.2, above, meaning WildEarth assumes that all of the listed activities in that table (construction, operation, maintenance, and reclamation) occur in the same year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   WildEarth also generally argues that the 2012 Development Scenario, the 2013 Emissions Report, and the 2015 Modeling Study all show that BLM is capable of forecasting emissions. \"Yet BLM offers no reasonable explanation as to why indirect emissions for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   oil and gas development in the [region] are reasonably foreseeable, but indirect emissions for the 2015 May and November leasing authorizations are not.\" (ECF No. 13 at 32 (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    BLM's Response Brief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   BLM has several responses. As to WildEarth's numerical calculations, BLM claims that they are fraught with problems, not the least of which is the assumption that 31 or 36 wells would all go through the construction, operation, maintenance, and reclamation phases in the same year. (ECF No. 14 at 29, 38.). BLM also argues that WildEarth's calculations fail to account for numerous uncertainties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The first set of uncertainties turn on whether a parcel will ever be developed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   BLM does not know when it notices the sale how many of the leases it offers for competitive bid will be sold....For those parcels successfully leased, BLM does not know if the successful bidder will develop the resource during the ten-year primary lease term. In many instances the lessee does not do so and the lease expires. Alternatively, a lease may terminate early due to nonpayment of annual rent. In other cases, a single well may be drilled to generate production and extend the term of the lease beyond ten years, but other development of the lease may not occur until later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26 (citations omitted).) Thus, says BLM, WildEarth's one-well-per-lease assumption is inappropriate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Another set of uncertainties flows from lack of knowledge regarding \"how many wells will be developed on an individual parcel....The density of wells (both Federal and non-Federal) can range from over 150 wells per township to less than one per Township, depending on oil and gas resource potential.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Yet another set of uncertainties revolve around\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   a parcel will be developed, assuming it will be developed at all:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   BLM's leases have a ten-year initial development window. The conformity impacts of emissions associated with well construction (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , earthmoving equipment, drilling rigs) are materially different if all wells on all leased parcels are drilled during the first year of the leases, as opposed to well construction spaced evenly over the ten-year period. An assumption that construction on all of the leased parcels will occur in a single year exponentially increases the estimated emissions in that year compared to construction that is evenly spaced over a ten-year period, and may result in a determination of nonconformity for that year whereas emissions attributable to evenly spaced construction could conform to the SIP. BLM has no ability to know the timing of a potential\n   lessee's construction plans at the leasing stage. Nor has it any knowledge about when production will commence on any of the leased parcels after construction of the wells.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27 (citations and footnote omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   BLM also claims it lacks needed knowledge about the equipment that lessees may use to develop their parcels: \"At the leasing stage, BLM does not know the type of drill rig the lessee will propose to use. BLM does not know whether a flare or vapor recovery unit will be employed. These and other variables directly impact the ability to estimate foreseeable emissions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28 (citations omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   And finally, BLM\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   does not know how the wells will be developed, including whether hydraulic fracturing will be used and whether they will be vertical or horizontal bores. BLM does not even know whether the lessee will target oil or gas resources and what the production rates might be for the various resources that might be recovered from different geologic formations. Each of these unknowns affects a reasonably foreseeable emissions inventory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 (citations omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   BLM further notes that, for purposes of NEPA analysis in the May and November 2015 EAs, it made separate per-well emissions estimates based on data derived from the 2015 Modeling Study. (ECF No. 14 at 29-30, 40-41.) These estimates differ widely from the 2013 Emissions Report. For example, the 2013 Emissions Report forecasts 11.16 tpy of NOx during construction of an oil rig, whereas the two EAs forecast only 0.72 tpy for the same activity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. at 3916, 7755.) And it forecasts only 6.67 tpy of VOCs during operation of an oil well (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), as compared to the 2013 Emissions Report's forecast of 20.96.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to BLM, these substantial differences \"reflect the assumptions and speculation that is associated with emissions estimates at this early stage of development, which are necessarily of a different scale and level of detail than data used in a conformity analysis.\" (ECF No. 14 at 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Additionally, BLM points out an alleged absurdity:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   [I]t is inappropriate to scale reasonably foreseeable development projections from a field office-wide scenario that includes both federal and non-federal mineral development reported on a township basis to individual parcels, some of which are no more than 40 acres. A township with maximum projected development (150 wells per township) would yield a projection of 0.26 wells for a 40-acre[ ] parcel, a nonsensical number for purposes of modeling emissions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42 (citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. at 4055 (stating in the May 2015 EA, \"Obviously, a quarter well is not something that exists.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As for WildEarth's argument that the 2012 Development Scenario, the 2013 Emissions Report, and the 2015 Modeling Study demonstrate BLM's ability to forecast emissions, BLM counters that those documents rely on the \"kinds of conservative assumptions [that] may be appropriate for evaluating maximum environmental impacts [such as under a NEPA analysis], but bear little relation to actual emissions from the actual number of wells to be drilled on a parcel.\" (ECF No. 14 at 39.) In a similar vein, BLM elsewhere states its acknowledgment\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   that its projections of reasonably foreseeable development and associated [2015 Modeling Study] emission inventories are appropriate for estimating potential emissions on a field office scale or\n   for assessing cumulative environmental impacts in accordance with NEPA requirements. In contrast, BLM determined that because a conformity analysis requires more precise information to allow an accurate comparison of project-level emissions with specific thresholds in the General Conformity Rules, it cannot reasonably estimate air quality impacts for conformity purposes because of all the unknowns previously discussed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41 (citations omitted).) Thus, BLM's argument reduces to the notion that \"indirect emissions from lease sales are not reasonably foreseeable for purposes of conformity determinations because they are not quantifiable with sufficient precision at the lease sale stage of oil and gas management.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    WildEarth's Reply Brief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In reply, WildEarth asserts that \"sufficient precision\" is not part of the General Conformity Rule. (ECF No. 15 at 6-9.) WildEarth also notes the apparent incongruity between relying on previous emissions forecasts for purposes of NEPA but rejecting them for purposes of NAAQS conformity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 n.3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As to BLM's argument that the per-well projections in the EA differ significantly from previous projections (ECF No. 14 at 40-41), WildEarth says nothing. As to BLM's argument that scaling down region-wide studies could lead to \"nonsensical\" calculations such as 0.26 of a well on a particular parcel (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 42), WildEarth claims that this is simply another instance of seeking more precision than the General Conformity Rule requires (ECF No. 15 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In general, WildEarth re-urges its view that existing documents provide more than enough data to permit BLM to predict that the May and November 2015 lease sales will each lead to ozone precursor emissions of over 100 tpy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-13.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Precision &amp; the General Conformity Rule\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   To resolve the parties' disputes, the Court begins with the broad dispute over the precision or lack thereof required by the General Conformity Rule. When EPA first proposed that rule (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20Fed.%20Reg.%2013%2C836\">\n    58 Fed. Reg. 13,836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mar. 15, 1993) ), it generated several comments about whether \"reasonably foreseeable\" was adequately defined (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C214\">\n    58 Fed. Reg. 63,214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63,226 (Nov. 30, 1993) ). EPA's commentary accompanying the final rule addressed this concern by, among other things, \"add[ing] the discussion below\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   ...the final definition does not require a Federal agency to use all emissions scenarios contained in financial documents or environmental analyses. That approach could not in many cases be implemented since the various documents contain quite different scenarios and a\n   single document sometimes contains multiple emissions scenarios. In addition, some scenarios could be based on speculation. The definition does not require the use of worst-case assumptions, unlikely growth scenarios, or analyses where it is impossible to assess local air quality impacts....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   The final rule requires the Federal agency to review all of its own information and all information presented to the Federal agency. Selection and documentation of the relevant emissions scenarios for conformity review is the responsibility of the Federal agency and should be based on reasonable expectations of future activity resulting from the Federal action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C214\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   WildEarth naturally prefers to emphasize language such as that in the last sentence of this guidance-\"reasonable expectations of future activity.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 15 at 8.) BLM, not surprisingly, emphasizes the recognition in the prior paragraph that differing scenarios, unlikely scenarios, speculation, worst-case assumptions, and so forth, need not always be considered, even if in the agency's possession.

While specifically noting that \"[i]t is difficult to predict what will occur a few years into the future [much less] 20 years ahead\" (R. at 9584), the document projects 196 wells on BLM land within the Nonattainment Area by 2030. (R. at 9587, 9640.) It further states that it makes no projection about how much oil or gas will be produced from those 196 wells, but simply \"assume[s] that [BLM] production would be equal to about the [BLM] percentage of all wells projected (about 4% for conventional wells and 6% for coalbed natural gas wells).\" (R. at 9588.) Thus, the 2012 Development Scenario does not-on its own, at least-provide anything close to a usable amount of information to reasonably predict future emissions from either the May or November 2015 lease sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   WildEarth, understanding this, combines the 2012 Development Scenario with the 2013 Emissions Report and thereby extrapolates its own emissions predictions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part IV.C.1.a, above.) But WildEarth does not deny BLM's charge that its predictions assume construction, operation, maintenance, and reclamation on all 31 parcels (from May 2015) or 36 parcels (from November 2015) in the same year. WildEarth's calculations are therefore akin to a worst-case scenario, which EPA counseled against relying upon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C214\">\n    58 Fed.

But, as already noted (Part IV.B.3), WildEarth does not draw on the 2015 Modeling Study for any particular dataset or projection that could be helpful to BLM. WildEarth instead holds it up as an example of BLM predicting future emissions in a different context, and argues that BLM should therefore be able to predict emissions in this context. Such an argument is not enough to overcome the \"presumption of validity\" in favor of agency action.\n   <em>\n    Sorenson Commc'ns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3651243\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/567/1215/#p1221\">\n    567 F.3d at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   To reiterate, the question before the Court is whether BLM's \"own information and...information presented to [it]\" was sufficient in May 2015 and/or November 2015 to permit BLM to quantify emissions such that it could predict ozone precursor emissions of more than 100 tpy indirectly resulting from either lease sale. The Court concludes only that WildEarth has not carried its burden to show that BLM acted arbitrarily or capriciously in determining that the information in its possession was insufficient to permit it to make a reasonable forecast of indirect emissions. BLM's actions will therefore be affirmed, and the Court does not reach BLM's alternative arguments about analogies to offshore leasing and about new source review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
