Silver, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Secretary of Labor (\"Plaintiff\") alleges Defendants Austin Electric Services LLC and Toby Thomas, Austin Electric's President, (collectively \"Defendants\") violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") by failing to pay employees overtime compensation and by failing to keep employee records. (Doc. 1). Plaintiff moved, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b), for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing Defendants from interviewing their employees regarding this litigation and from obtaining their employees' declarations, (Doc. 119), and Plaintiff's supplemental briefing requests a variety of additional relief. (Doc. 153). For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint alleges Defendants failed to pay their employees overtime compensation and failed to keep employee records, in violation of the FLSA. (Doc. 1). Although discovery is closed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants-apparently without notifying their counsel in this litigation-hired separate\n   counsel, Mses. Pace and Sellers, who then began interviewing Defendants' employees, allegedly in connection with a company-wide, neutral human resources audit (the \"audit\"). According to Defendants, this audit was an appropriate administrative function of the company in that it sought employee input on a variety of matters including safety practices, anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies, equipment, timekeeping, paid time off, and paid sick leave. During the audit, Defendants' employees were gathered together for interviews, following which employees were given declarations to sign. These declarations purportedly addressed the topics discussed in the interview: safety practices, anti-harassment/anti-discrimination, and, of significance here, timekeeping practices. (Doc. 124).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges Defendants subverted the administrative audit's alleged neutral purpose by using it to take from employees information about this lawsuit, specifically whether employees previously gave information to Plaintiff relevant to this case and, if so, the nature of the information provided. Plaintiff further alleges employees were not informed the interviews were voluntary, and that the declarations employees were asked to sign were to be used in this litigation as waivers of employees' claims to back-pay. As such, Plaintiff requested that this Court enjoin Defendants from continuing the audit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court reviewed the parties' initial filings in connection with Plaintiff's motion and held a hearing on June 1, 2018. (Doc. 135). At that hearing, counsel for both parties surprisingly stated that neither of them had seen or reviewed the employee declarations that were the subject of Plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction. Because the declarations' content was crucial to resolving Plaintiff's motion, the Court ordered Defendants to produce a random sampling of declarations for the Court's and Plaintiff's review. (Doc. 135).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants submitted the declarations on June 8, 2018, (Doc. 146), which the Court and Plaintiff reviewed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   There are three types of declarations, each concerning one of three subjects: safety, professional workplace conduct, and timekeeping/pay. The declarations were allegedly available in both English and Spanish, and interpreters were provided. Since only the timekeeping/pay declaration is relevant here, it will be discussed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The timekeeping/pay declaration appears to follow two formats. Defendants do not explain the reasons for using one format as opposed to the other, but the primary difference between the two is temporal. Thus, the first declaration format is retrospective in that it asks employees to state, under penalty of perjury, that they \"record all the hours [they] work on a timesheet,\" that they \"do not work extra hours unless they are included on [the] timesheet,\" that \"[n]o one has instructed [them] to underreport the hours [they] work,\" and, finally, that they \"have been paid for all hours that [they] worked at the Company.\" (Doc. 146). This format is reproduced below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   DECLARATION OF\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I, _______________________________, declare under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct. If called to testify in Court about these matters, I could and would competently testify to the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   1. I am over the age of 18 and a resident of ____________ County, Arizona.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   2. I have personal knowledge of the matters stated in this Declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   3. I am a _________________________ with Austin Electric Services, LLC (the \"Company\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   4. I record all the hours I work on a timesheet that I complete and give to the Company each week. I do not work extra hours unless they are included on my timesheet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   5. I have never been told by anyone to not record the hours I work on my timesheet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   6. No one has instructed me to underreport the hours I work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   7. I understand that the Company requires employees to accurately record the hours they work each day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   8. I have been paid for all hours that I worked at the Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dated this ____ day of___________, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-27\">Signature: ______________________</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In some instances, however, employees made changes or additions to the retroactive declaration format that have some relevancy. (Docs. 146 at 61, 65; 159 at 4). For example, it is telling that one employee amended the retroactive declaration format with the words \"[g]oing forward\" so paragraph 4 read \"\n   <em>\n    Going forward,\n   </em>\n   I record all the hours I work on a timesheet that I complete and give to the Company each week ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The second timekeeping/pay declaration format is forward-looking, and asks employees to state, under penalty of perjury, that they \"will record all the hours [they] work on a timesheet,\" \"will not work extra hours unless they are included on [the] timesheet,\" and will notify human resources or their field operations manager if someone instructs them to underreport their hours. Based upon the sample set of declarations Defendants produced, it appears this format was used far less frequently since, of the twenty-one timekeeping/pay declarations Defendants produced, only four were forward-looking. The forward-looking declaration format is shown below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   DECLARATION OF _______________________\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   I, __________________________________, declare under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct.

I have personal knowledge of the matters stated in this Declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   3. I am a ________________________ with Austin Electric Services, LLC (the \"Company\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   4. I will record all the hours I work on a timesheet that I complete and give to the Company each week. I will not work extra hours unless they are included on my timesheet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   5. If someone tells me to not record the hours I work on my timesheet, I will immediately call my field operations manager or payroll/human resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   6. I understand from today forward that the Company requires employees to accurately record the hours they work each day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Dated this ____ day of ____________________, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-39\">Signature: __________________________</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After Defendants produced the employee declarations, Plaintiff then filed supplemental briefing in support of its application for an injunction. (Doc. 153). In it, Plaintiff argued the declarations show Defendants are retaliating against employees by soliciting coerced declarations containing false and misleading testimony, that the declarations are designed to identify employees who are cooperating with Plaintiff, that the declarations may undermine Plaintiff's claims for back-pay because they are certainly relevant to the underlying lawsuit, and that employees who signed the declarations may now be hesitant to give full and accurate statements in this action, if doing so would contradict their signed declarations. Plaintiff also requested additional relief beyond an injunction, including that Defendants' employees receive a curative notice reassuring them of their FLSA rights and rectifying Defendants' misconduct. (Docs. 153; 161). In response, Defendants argued they took steps to ensure the employee interviews were not coercive, that Defendants have a right to interview employees about working conditions, that an injunction is not necessary, and that employees need not receive notification that these declarations were inappropriately obtained. (Doc. 159). Plaintiff replied, reiterating many of the same arguments made previously. (Doc. 161). The Court held oral argument on August 8, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Southwest Fuel Management\n   </em>\n   subsequently struck the employees' declarations and forbade the employer from introducing them for any purpose at trial, both because they resulted from coercion and because \"they were not timely disclosed.\"\n   <em>\n    Acosta v.

And to further cure any prejudice, the court ordered that employees receive a notice including information about the lawsuit, a reminder that employees need not speak with the Department of Labor or the employer about the claims, that speaking with their employer might adversely impact the Department of Labor's ability to collect back-wages on the employees' behalf, and that their employer could not retaliate against them for working off-the-clock, even if it violated company policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In sum,\n   <em>\n    Acosta v.

However, as set forth below, an employer's legitimate efforts to educate its employees about company policies,\n   or to investigate prior violations of company policy, are not actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Applying these principles, in\n   <em>\n    Mata v.

But an employer is prohibited from obtaining, under coercive circumstances, employee declarations, particularly declarations that are relevant to and go to the heart of a pending claim that the employer failed to fully compensate employees. This is what happened in both\n   <em>\n    Acosta v. Southwest Fuel Management\n   </em>\n   and in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Though there was competent evidence offered by the parties, this Court can resolve the case based on the undisputed evidence. That undisputed evidence establishes the following. First, the structure of the audit must be understood in the context in which it arose. Defendants hired separate counsel, Mses. Pace and Sellers, for the purpose of conducting this audit. Pace explains that she was selected to conduct the audit in part because she and Scott Tonn (\"Tonn\"), Defendant Austin Electric's co-owner, \"are friends and next door neighbors\" who \"talk frequently about a variety of topics as both of [them] are active in civic and construction industry professional endeavors.\" (Doc. 145 at 2). Pace explains that she was aware of Tonn's \"frustration\" that the Department of Labor was insisting it was noncompliant, despite that Austin Electric \"believed it was in compliance and has spent a lot of resources to ensure compliance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Pace states that she was \"surprised that DOL was insisting that Austin Electric continued to be out of compliance,\" since Austin Electric \"appeared to have very good policies in place\" and \"was very transparent\" with employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Despite that the purported purpose of the audit was to uncover wrongdoing, these representations by counsel indicate a lack of neutrality, and bias against the Department of Labor, when the audit was instituted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Further, despite that Pace and Defendants were obviously acutely aware of the Department of Labor's ongoing investigation, neither explains why Defendants' counsel in this litigation were not notified that Defendants were hiring outside counsel and conducting an audit, particularly considering the audit concerned critical issues involved in this litigation. Pace and Defendants also do not offer any explanation why the Department of Labor was not informed that this audit would be occurring.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Regarding the audit itself, the undisputed evidence establishes what follows. Employees\n   were instructed to attend interviews on work time. (Doc. 124-1 at 18-19 \u00b6 57; Doc. 124-2 at 2 \u00b6 6). When conducting the employee interviews, Pace and Sellers never informed the employees that the interviews were voluntary, or that employees could leave. (Doc. 124-1 at 19 \u00b6 58 (\"[T]he subject of whether employees had a choice to decline the interview never came up.\"). The interviews generally lasted an hour, although some employees' interview processes took significantly longer. (Docs. 124-1 at 18-19; 124-2 at 2). The interview outline suggests employees would be told that, if they had questions, they \"can always talk to\" their supervisor or the operating manager, (Doc. 147 at 2), but that employees were not told they could consult a neutral person, such as a lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   During the interviews employees were asked about the specific events in this litigation, including whether they had been instructed to underreport their hours worked and whether they had been paid for all hours worked. (Docs. 124-1 at 10, 15, 18-19; 124-2 at 2-3; 147). These are the critical issues in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   More particularly, the interview outline states employees would be asked whether they \"accurately record all ... hours worked\" and whether \"anyone instructed [them] to NOT report all the hours [they] work.\" (Doc. 147 at 5). Then, regardless of an employee's response and likely to solidify the point, the interview outline asks employees \"[s]o no one has told you to underreport the hours you work?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Beyond this, the interview outline also notes that, at the conclusion of the interview, employees should be asked \"[h]ave you ever been interviewed about human resources matters before,\" and states that, if employees indicate they had been interviewed by a government agency such as the Department of Labor, they should be asked \"the circumstances,\" the \"concerns or issues,\" \"whether they have any questions,\" and, specifically, whether \"the agency [told the employee] that there was any issues or anything wrong or that you were owed money, etc?\" (Doc. 147 at 7). Consistent with this, Pace and Sellers clearly acknowledge that they inquired into Defendants' employees' contacts with government agencies, including the Department of Labor, and asked whether the government agency indicated the company had engaged in any wrongdoing. (Docs. 124-1 at 11-12; 124-2 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   However, although the questions to be asked during the interview were documented, it appears employees' specific answers during the interview were not recorded. In fact, the only employee answers that were recorded were apparently those recorded in the written declarations which followed the interviews, declarations which were pre-prepared by the interviewers and were not open-ended forms to be completed by employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   More specifically, following their interviews, employees were presented with declarations for their signature, under penalty of perjury. (Docs. 146; 147 at 7). The declarations did not inform employees that they could consult counsel prior to signing the declarations, or any other neutral person, or that their decision to sign the declaration was voluntary. (Doc. 146). Further, the declarations did not state that employees might be within the group of employees on whose behalf the Department of Labor was seeking back wages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Employees also were not informed that, by signing these declarations, employees might adversely affect the exercise of their FLSA rights. (Doc. 145-1 at 18). This despite the fact that, as previously noted, the\n   majority of the timekeeping/pay declarations are retroactive. (Doc. 146). In particular, these retroactive declarations asked employees to declare, under penalty of perjury, that they \"record all the hours [they] work on a timesheet,\" that they \"do not work extra hours unless they are included on [the] timesheet,\" that \"[n]o one has instructed [them] to underreport the hours [they] work,\" and, finally, that they \"have been paid for all hours that [they] worked at the Company.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, the record does not indicate that employees were given a choice between forward-looking and retrospective declaration formats. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). And in fact, at least one employee who\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   worked overtime and had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   been paid for all hours worked was given the retroactive declaration format to sign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61). In addition, a second employee who received the retroactive declaration specifically edited it in an attempt to make it exclusively forward-looking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65). Further, it is particularly significant that employees received declarations covering three topics-safety, professional workplace conduct, and timekeeping/pay-but only the timekeeping/pay declaration asked employees to make retroactive statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 146).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   After signing these declarations, employees were not provided a copy of the declarations they signed, despite that they were signed under penalty of perjury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 145-1 at 19). And all of this occurred in the context of an ongoing, highly antagonistic lawsuit, brought by Department of Labor, alleging Defendants both failed to properly compensate employees for hours worked and failed to maintain accurate employee records. (Doc. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As a result, several employees contacted Plaintiff to express concerns. It was at this point that Plaintiff, for the first time, learned Defendants were conducting an audit. Employees stated the interviews \"began with Defendants' attorneys initially asking safety related questions\" but \"very quickly\" transitioned to asking questions\n   regarding the claims involved in this litigation. Specifically, employees reported being asked whether they provided information to Plaintiff about Defendants' alleged FLSA violations and, if so, what information they provided. Some employees said they lied during the interview for fear they would be retaliated against for reporting Defendants' FLSA violations to the government. In addition, employees stated they felt \"blindsided\" by the interviews, felt they could not decline to participate in the interviews, and felt \"uncomfortable and upset both by the questions and length of questioning.\" Moreover, \"at least one employee\" reported that, when he asked if his participation was required, he was informed it was \"a mandatory interview.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 119).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Beyond the employees' statements, other circumstances of the audit instill concern. As previously stated, Defendants do not represent that they have previously conducted such an audit at any point prior to the commencement of this litigation. (August 8, 2018 Hr'g Tr.). Further, although Pace states that audits such as this are \"common tools used by employers to evaluate the working environment and the companies' compliance with applicable labor and employment laws,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4), nothing suggests that the collection of retroactive declarations during such audits in any way serves that purpose. Indeed, retroactive declaration-collection goes far beyond what would be included in any traditional \"audit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Marriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 81 (11th ed. 2004) (defining an audit as \"a methodical examination and review\"). Further, though Pace represents that audits such as this may disclose \"unknown rogue managers or employees,\" nothing suggests managers were interviewed as part of this audit, or that managers were asked to sign retroactive declarations regarding their actions. Taken together, these actions suggest this audit-and particularly the collection of retroactive declarations-was taken in response to this litigation, and for the purpose of quashing employees' back-pay claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendants' conduct is sufficient to warrant the issuance of a limited injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Acosta v. Southwest Fuel Management\n   </em>\n   , here Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of a claim that Defendants' actions in obtaining its employees retroactive declarations, under coercive circumstances and during a pending Department of Labor investigation into Defendants' payment practices, violated the FLSA's anti-retaliation provision.\n   <em>\n    Acosta v. Sw. Fuel Mgmt., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20739425\">\n    2018 WL 739425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-*7. It is irrelevant that Defendants did not know\n   <em>\n    which\n   </em>\n   of its employees were potential witnesses in the Department of Labor's suit for back-pay, since the audit was intended to include all of Defendants' employees, and thus necessarily would include employees with claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Moreover, as in as in\n   <em>\n    Acosta v. Southwest Fuel Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the employees' pursuit of their statutorily protected rights to full compensation allegedly triggered Defendants' retaliatory conduct. This suggests irreparable harm may result from the continuation of the audit, as employees may be deterred from engaging in protected conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. Indeed, in the context of this litigation, the deterrent effect of the Defendants' actions in obtaining their employees' declarations is obvious. Once Defendants obtained the declarations, employees with legitimate claims would be faced with a dire choice. If these employees later testified in this suit that they had not, in fact, been adequately compensated, Defendants could not only use their declarations for impeachment, but could also threaten employees for making false statements under penalty of perjury. Faced with this choice, employees with legitimate claims might decide to forgo their statutory right to compensation, simply to ensure their later testimony in this case remained consistent with the declarations Defendants obtained under questionable circumstances. These concerns are further heightened considering Defendants employ vulnerable populations such as convicts, immigrants, and refugees. (August 8, 2018 Hr'g Tr.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Further, as in\n   <em>\n    Acosta v. Southwest Fuel Management\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff only seeks an order requiring Defendants to comply with the law, meaning the balance of hardships tips in favor of granting an injunction tailored to address the interviews' coercive elements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. And finally, because \"[t]here is a strong public interest in favor of enforcement of the FLSA,\" the issuance of a limited injunction would be in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Thus, the Court will issue a limited injunction designed to address these elements of Defendants' interviews and declarations. Defendants will be prohibited from requesting employees sign any declarations concerning Defendants' timekeeping policy and pay that are not exclusively forward-looking, which will ensure Defendants do not coerce employees into in any way abandoning the pursuit of their statutorily protected rights to full compensation.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Acosta v.

Under no circumstances may employees' contacts with the Department of Labor be inquired into.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Limiting the injunction in this manner will enable Defendants to safely continue meeting with employees to educate them regarding the company's timekeeping, safety, and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies, and to solicit employee\n   feedback.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11190540\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/229/917/#p928\">\n    229 F.3d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 928-29 ;\n   <em>\n    Mata\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011338102\">\n    2008 WL 11338102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

Finally, Defendants will be required to produce redacted versions of all worker declarations. These actions will obviate, at this time, any need for the other relief Plaintiff requests in its supplemental briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To be clear, although this Court acknowledges Defendants had a legitimate reason for inquiring into their employees' compliance with timekeeping and other policies, and even for securing declarations stating that employees will comply with those policies going forward, in the context of this case, Defendants have articulated no legitimate reason-and the Court cannot think of one-for requesting their employees sign retroactive declarations stating, under penalty of perjury, that they have never underreported their hours, have never been instructed to underreport their hours, and have been fully compensated for all work done. Likewise, inquiring into employees' contacts with government agencies regarding this litigation serves no legitimate investigatory or educational purpose. Thus, these actions will be enjoined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Defendants' Motion to Deny Plaintiff's Motion for its Failure to File a Reply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Separately, due to Plaintiff's failure to file a reply in support of its original motion requesting injunctive relief, Defendants requested Plaintiff's motion be denied, that the hearing be vacated, and that Defendants be awarded fees and costs. (Doc. 129). Yet, the failure to file a reply is clearly not a basis to deny a motion. L.R. Civ. 7.2(d) (providing that a party may file \"a reply memorandum if that party so\n   desires\"). Thus, Defendants' motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Defendants' Supplement Regarding Newly-Discovered Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   During oral argument on August 8, 2018, Plaintiff's counsel represented that he had submitted a \"referral for criminal prosecution\" based upon the actions of Ms. Petrilli, a former employee of the Department of Labor who submitted a declaration on Defendants' behalf in this case. At that time, the Court cautioned Plaintiff's counsel about pursuing such a course of action without clear authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   However, in light of Plaintiff's stated decision to refer Ms. Petrilli for criminal prosecution, Defendants now request this Court stay its ruling on Plaintiff's preliminary injunction motion to permit Defendants to submit briefing on the issue of Ms. Petrilli's criminal prosecution. Specifically, Defendants argue that on the same day Plaintiff's counsel informed this Court that it was referring Ms. Petrilli for criminal prosecution, Plaintiff took Ms. Petrilli's deposition in another matter, during which Plaintiff inquired into her consulting practice without informing her that she had been referred for criminal prosecution regarding actions she had taken in connection with her consulting practice. Defendants argue that Plaintiff's actions implicate the doctrine of unclean hands, which should bar the equitable relief Plaintiff seeks here. Defendants represent that they intend to submit briefing on the matter no later than Monday, August 20, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Even if Defendants' allegations are true, the parties agree that Ms. Petrilli's deposition was taken in connection with another lawsuit. (Docs. 169; 170). If Plaintiff indeed deposed Ms. Petrilli in another proceeding without informing her of her Fifth Amendment rights, assuming that was required, this Court trusts that such misconduct can be adequately dealt with in that proceeding. Further, why Defendants would have consulted with Ms. Petrilli in the first place is beyond comprehension considering Defendants received privilege logs and discovery from Plaintiff showing that Ms. Petrilli was involved in this very litigation during her employment with the Department of Labor. (Doc. 170). For these reasons, Defendants' request to stay these proceedings further will be denied. Further, Defendants will not be granted leave to file a motion regarding Plaintiff's alleged misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion, (Doc. 119), is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . Defendants may continue meeting with employees to inform them regarding the company's timekeeping policies, to solicit their feedback regarding a variety of other company policies, and to investigate employees' compliance with company policies, although not policies relevant to this litigation without this Court's prior approval. Defendants may not ask employees to sign any declarations regarding Defendants' timekeeping policy unless those declarations are exclusively forward-looking.

For one, Plaintiff argues Defendants are attempting to circumvent the Court's scheduling order, in which the Court stated Plaintiff need not disclose the identities of its informer witnesses until 75 days before trial. This argument is not meritorious. The scheduling order merely states that Plaintiff need not disclose the identity of its informer witnesses until 75 days before trial. The scheduling order does not, however, prohibit Defendants from legitimately independently learning the identity of Plaintiff's informer witnesses. Of course, Defendants may not use coercion in doing so. Beyond this, Plaintiff also requests to add a claim against Defendants and the lawyer responsible for collecting these employee declarations. (Doc. 153 at 8). However, since this request was raised for the first time in Plaintiff's supplemental briefing in support of its motion for an injunction, the Court will not grant Plaintiff's request. Instead, the Court will give Plaintiff leave to file a separate motion requesting leave to amend its complaint to add this claim, and will order Defendants to respond to the motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Further distinguishing\n    <em>\n     Mata\n    </em>\n    , it is important to note that, there, the employer had an existing, well-recognized policy requiring the employer to investigate violations of overtime reporting policies.\n    <em>\n     Mata\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011338102\">\n     2008 WL 11338102\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3.

If that was truly the motive, Defendants and Defense counsel should have no objection to precluding the use of the declarations in this, or any, litigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The safety and professionalism at work declarations, which employees were also asked to sign during the interview, asked employees to declare, among other things, that they \"understand and agree to follow the Company's safety policies, practices, and procedures,\" \"know to report injuries that occur at work,\" \"will not make inappropriate comments,\" and \"will not make inappropriate touchings of other employees.\" Raising questions regarding the neutrality of the audit, these declarations did not, for example, ask employees to declare, under penalty of perjury, that they had\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    made inappropriate comments or inappropriate touchings, that they\n    <em>\n     had\n    </em>\n    reported all injuries that occurred at work, or that they\n    <em>\n     had\n    </em>\n    followed the Company's safety policies. (Doc. 146). It cannot be gainsaid that any declaration-collection conducted during an audit that was designed to be completely neutral, as to provide employees with knowledge of company policies and to ensure employees knew them, would merely need to be prospective, not retrospective.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Defendants submitted a letter-not a declaration-from Ms. Pace, in which Ms. Pace represents that \"[i]t was the plan and still is the intent to provide employees with copies of their declarations ... upon conclusion of the HR audit.\" (Doc. 145-1 at 19). However, Ms. Pace's letter did not indicate she ever told the employees that they would later receive copies of their signed declarations and precisely when that would occur. Moreover, the declarations do not state that employees would later receive a copy of their signed declarations. Likewise, the interview outline does not indicate that employees should be informed they would receive a copy of their signed declarations at a future date. Indeed, nothing suggests Defendants' employees were given any reason to expect that they would later receive copies of their declarations, or that they should ask for copies of their signed declarations if they did not. The fact that employees were not simply provided copies of the declarations they signed is further evidence of the coercive nature of Defendants' conduct.\n    <em>\n     Acosta v. Sw.

Defendants argued the Court could not consider the employees' statements in these declarations because they were hearsay. Defendants are incorrect. The rules of evidence do not apply strictly to preliminary injunction proceedings, and thus this Court may consider the employees' statements for the purpose of deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Acosta v.
