BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This lawsuit arises under the Medicare Secondary Payer (\"MSP\") provisions of the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' class action complaint against Defendant is one of numerous similar actions filed by Plaintiffs in courts\n   across the country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs are a collection of entities \"whose business model involves obtaining assignments from Medicare Advantage Organizations [ (\"MAOs\") ], first-tier entities, and downstream entities to recover reimbursement for payments made for the medical expenses of Medicare beneficiaries that should have been made by a private insurer pursuant to the Medicare Secondary Payer Act (MSPA).\"\n   <em>\n    Auto-Owners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201953861\">\n    2018 WL 1953861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b) ). Plaintiffs filed this class action as the assignee of three separate entities-Florida Healthcare Plus (\"FHCP\"), Health First Administrative Plans, Inc. (\"HFAP\") and Interamerican Medical Center Group, LLC (\"IMCG\")-to seek reimbursement from Defendant pursuant to the MSPA. Thus, as the Court in\n   <em>\n    Auto-Owners\n   </em>\n   noted, the threshold issue this Court must consider is whether these entities \"ha[ve] standing under the private cause of action in the MSPA, \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A).\"\n   <em>\n    Auto-Owners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201953861\">\n    2018 WL 1953861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant argues, among other things, that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring this case because (a) \"the Complaint does not allege that any of the putative assignors are (1) a Medicare beneficiary; (2) an MAO; or a (3) direct healthcare provider to the Medicare beneficiary;\" (b) the \"original plaintiff, MSPA Claims I, LLC (\"MSPA [Claims]\"), lacked standing when the lawsuit was filed ... [and] cannot amend to add new plaintiffs;\" and (c) \"the Complaint does not support that Plaintiffs have standing under the putative assignments because, among other reasons, the agreements are not assignments.\" (DE 51 at 2). Defendant also presents several other arguments as to why Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) but, because this case must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we need not address the merits of Defendant's other arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As the alleged assignee of FHCP, HFAP, and IMCG (the \"Assignors\"), Plaintiffs bring three representative claims.

At that time, Medicare paid for medical expenses even when Medicare beneficiaries were also enrolled in third-party insurance policies that covered those same costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MSP Recovery, LLC v.

In an effort to reduce costs, Congress passed the MSPA in 1980 which made Medicare the secondary payer, rather than the primary payer, for medical services provided to its beneficiaries when they are covered for the same services by a private insurer. See \u00a7 1395y(b)(2). Thus, the private insurer becomes the primary payer, as defined by the statute, for medical services. However, when a primary payer cannot be expected to make a payment for a service promptly, Medicare may make conditional payments. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(i). Once notified of its responsibility for a payment, a primary payer must reimburse Medicare for any payment made within 60 days. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(ii). In an effort to enforce this scheme, the MSPA created a private cause of action for double damages when a primary plan fails to provide payment.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs are not MAOs, Medicare beneficiaries, or direct health care providers. Rather, as in other cases involving the same Plaintiffs and the same causes of action, Plaintiffs allege that they have obtained claims for reimbursement via assignments from the Assignors. In order to demonstrate a valid assignment, and therefore a valid right to pursue these claims, Plaintiffs provided the Court with the recovery agreements and assignment agreements discussed in\n   <em>\n    Section I\n   </em>\n   above. (DE 49-H; DE 49-L; DE 49-N). Plaintiffs, however, are not a party to all of these contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant argues that this case should be dismissed because Plaintiff MSPA Claims lacked standing at the time the lawsuit was filed. (DE 51 at 6). Defendant supports this argument by contending that because \"MSPA originally sued as an alleged assignee of FHCP,\" (DE 6-46 at 1), \"whether MSPA has standing depends on whether MSPA in fact received a valid assignment from FHCP.\" (DE 51 at 6) (citing\n   <em>\n    MSPA Claims 1, LLC v. Covington Specialty Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272067\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/212/1250/#p1258\">\n    212 F.Supp.3d 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1256 (S.D. Fla. 2016) ). Defendants argues that MSPA Claims lacks standing for four reasons: \"First, the alleged assignments to MSPA were not approved by FHCP. Second, the \"assignment\" from FHCP to La Ley Recovery Systems, Inc. (\"La Ley\") terminated before this action was filed. Third, the \"assignment\" from FHCP to La Ley is not an \"assignment\" at all [because] [i]t is an independent contractor collection agreement which did not confer standing on MSPA. Fourth, MSPA cannot acquire standing after it filed this lawsuit.\" (DE 51 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendant. Plaintiffs do not have standing to bring this suit for two reasons: first, Plaintiff MSPA Claims lacked standing when this lawsuit was originally filed and, thus, cannot amend in an attempt to confer standing on the newly-added Plaintiffs; second, Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to show that any of the alleged Assignors have standing under the MSPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff MSPA Claims lacked standing at the time this action was filed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   MSPA Claims first brought this lawsuit as an alleged assignee of FHCP. (DE 6-2 at 1). Various courts in this District have addressed Plaintiff's standing as a purported assignee of FHCP and have found that Plaintiff MSPA Claims \"lacks standing to assert FHCP's claims because it has not been validly assigned the right to do so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    MSPA Claims 1, LLC v.

(\"La Ley\"), which in turn assigned them to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201342\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The agreement purportedly assigning rights from FHCP to La Ley is attached to Plaintiff's third amended complaint as Exhibit H (\"La Ley Agreement\") and the agreement purportedly assigning rights from La Ley to Plaintiff MSPA Claims is attached as Exhibit I (\"Plaintiff's Assignment Agreement\"). (DE 49-H; DE 49-I). The La Ley Agreement contains the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   1.2 Term: The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year from the date of execution herewith, with an automatic renewal for an additional one (1) year period unless terminated at any time by the parties with ninety (90) day prior written notification.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     La Ley Recovery may assign the Agreement in whole or in part but the assignee must be approved by the Client\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (DE 49-H at 3). The La Ley Agreement defines \"Client\" as FHCP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this case, as in\n   <em>\n    MSPA v.

United\n   </em>\n   , that Defendant's factual challenge to Plaintiff's standing as an assignee is also meritorious. La Ley and Florida's Department of Financial Services (\"DFS\"), in its capacity as FHCP's receiver, engaged in a lengthy dispute regarding the La Ley Agreement. Specifically, in the order appointing DFS as FHCP's receiver, which is dated December 10, 2014, DFS repudiated the La Ley Agreement. (DE 6-42 at 46). DFS then repeatedly repudiated the La Ley Agreement by letters dated February 5, 2015, April 23, 2015, and June\n   10, 2015. (DE 6-42 at 94, 122-124). Any doubt that DFS approved Plaintiffs Assignment, which is dated February 20, 2015, is eviscerated by DFS's April 23, 2015 and June 10, 2015 letters, and finally DFS's September 18, 2015 petition to the receivership court asking it to enjoin La Ley and any assignees or affiliates from any further collection activity based on the La Ley Agreement. (DE 23-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because Plaintiffs have not shown that MSPA Claims had standing-by virtue of FHCP assigning its claims to La Ley, which in turn allegedly assigned them to MSPA Claims-Plaintiff MSPA Claims lacks standing to bring any claims on behalf of FHCP as its assignee. \"Article III standing must be determined as of the time at which the plaintiff's complaint is filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Focus on the Family v.

The\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   Court relied on the reasoning from\n   <em>\n    Auto-Owners\n   </em>\n   to find, as the Court in\n   <em>\n    Auto-Owners\n   </em>\n   found, that because the alleged MAO assignor \"has not been assigned any rights from [a separate MAO] to pursue claims under \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A), Plaintiff MSP Recovery Claims, Series, LLC also has no rights to pursue claims under \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A).\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202392827\">\n    2018 WL 2392827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Auto-Owners\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege that the Assignors have standing under \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A).
