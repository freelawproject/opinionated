The plaintiffs named in the Complaint include individuals who are residents of various states and the District of Columbia, a non-profit corporation, and a corporation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs define the putative class, with certain exceptions, as: \"All persons and entities that purchased air passenger transportation services for flights within the United States and its territories and the District of Columbia from Defendants or any predecessor, subsidiary or affiliate thereof, at any time between July 1, 2011 and the present.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142. Plaintiffs assert that they do not know the exact number of\n   members in the putative class because that information is within the Defendants' control, but Plaintiffs believe that the number of Class Members is in the millions and that Class Members \"are sufficiently numerous and geographically dispersed throughout the United States so that joinder of all Class [M]embers is impracticable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 143.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The basis of Plaintiffs' lawsuit is Plaintiffs' allegation that Defendants colluded to limit capacity on their respective airlines in a conspiracy to fix, raise, maintain, and/or stabilize prices for air passenger transportation services within the United States, its territories, and the District of Columbia in violation of Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 3 ), and that Plaintiffs suffered pecuniary injury by paying artificially inflated ticket prices as a result of this purported antitrust violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 1, 11-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In that June 18, 2018 Order, the Court found that \"the prerequisites for a class action have been met\" and certified a Settlement Class virtually identical to the aforementioned Settlement Class, except that the dates run \"between July 1, 2011 and June 14, 2018.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 18, 2018 Order, ECF No. 249, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Now pending before this Court are Plaintiffs' two [almost verbatim] motions for approval of the Settlement Notice Program. Plaintiffs move this Court for approval of their proposed Settlement Notice Program, which is intended to advise Settlement Class Members of their rights regarding objecting to the Settlement Agreement and excluding themselves from the Settlement Class, the procedure for submitting such exclusion request; and specifics about the Fairness Hearing and their right to appear at that Hearing. Plaintiffs further request that this Court order the Non-Settling Defendants - Delta and United - to provide Plaintiffs with e-mail\n   customer contact information in order that Plaintiffs may give notice to possible class members. As previously noted, the Non-Settling Defendants \"do not object to providing the e-mail addresses associated with the relevant tickets in their transactional data\" but they request 30 days from the date of this Court's Order in which to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS OF CLASS NOTICE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the instant case, Plaintiffs have retained Kinsella Media, LLC (\"KM\") and Shannon Wheatman Ph.D. \"to design and implement a comprehensive class notice program.\" Pls.' Am. Mem., ECF No. 257-1, at 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Notice Program anticipates a four-pronged approach to notifying potential Class Members. First, Plaintiffs will provide direct e-mail notice to Southwest customers, where \"Southwest's transactional data includes e-mail addresses for approximately 95% of its customers.\" Pls.' Am. Mem., ECF No. 257-1, at 9-10. Plaintiffs have also requested that this Court order the Non-Settling Defendants to produce their customer e-mail addresses so that those customers may be directly e-mailed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if the Court does not require the Non-Settling Defendants to provide e-mail customer contact information, class notice will be directly e-mailed to \"approximately\n   38.95 million settlement class members.\" Pls.' Am. Mem., ECF No. 257-1, at 10. The e-mail delivery will be tracked and where an e-mail is returned as undeliverable because of circumstances other than a non-existent address (a \"soft bounce\"), e-mail delivery will be attempted up to three times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs propose a paid media publication plan whereby they will place advertisements about the proposed settlement in Time Magazine and on a variety of websites, distributions channels, and social media networks, to supplement the direct e-mail notice. Third, Plaintiffs will employ an earned media program, which includes a press release \"distributed to PR Newswire's US1 news circuit reaching approximately 15,000 print and online media outlets and more than 5,400 websites, databases, and online services.\" Pls.' Am. Mem., ECF No. 257-1, at 11. Finally, Plaintiffs will establish a website that enables potential Class Members access to additional information about the settlement and the case, including a toll-free number for further inquiries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As previously noted, the Non-Settling Defendants do not object to providing customer e-mail addresses if they are given thirty days in which to accomplish this task. The Non-Settling Defendants note however that \"extensive physical mailing address information [is] also available in the non-settling Defendants' transactional data, much of which has already been produced to Plaintiffs[,]\" although Plaintiffs counter this statement with their assertion that \"the non-settling Defendants have produced very little residential contact information.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Non-Settling Defs.'

The Non-Settling Defendants suggest that the best notice practicable may be a combination of e-mail and traditional mail notice, with no reference to any difference in costs associated with e-mail versus traditional mail and how it will affect the total settlement fund. In contrast,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs' notice experts estimate that a mailing to an individual class member would substantially exhaust the settlement fund - requiring payments of anywhere from $12.3 million to $43.4 million to provide mailed notice [and] [t]hus, providing mailed notice to the class, or even to a small fraction of the class, would quickly devour the entirety or the vast majority of the settlement corpus of $15 million.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Pls.'

That 1974 case involved a choice between direct individual notice by mail or publication, while this case anticipates the use of direct individual notice by e-mail and publication in print and on Internet sites. In\n   <em>\n    Eisen\n   </em>\n   , the names and addresses of class members could be easily ascertained, whereas in this case, the Non-Settling Defendants indicate that their data \"do not necessarily identify the person or entity that actually \"\n   <em>\n    purchased\n   </em>\n   \" their air transportation services\" but instead include some contact information for passengers, and verifying the identity of any particular class member (the ticket purchaser) \"may require a highly individualized inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Non-Settling Defs.' SW Resp., ECF No. 219, at 2. In another case involving a class comprised of purchasers of airline tickets, the information compiled by defendants there;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , names and addresses of 9.3 million persons associated with credit card numbers, was determined by the court not to be a list of class members, and thus, the court concluded that there was no assurance that notice to persons on that list would definitely result in notice to a substantial number of class members, and this was \"not the classic case where Rule 23(c)(2) individual notice [was] mandated.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Domestic Air Transp.

Finally, the class in\n   <em>\n    Eisen\n   </em>\n   was composed of 6 million people, with 2.25 million people able to be identified for purposes of individual notice, whereas the class here is estimated to be between 84.7 million and 153.8 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' SW Reply, ECF No. 225, at 8. The cost of individual notice in\n   <em>\n    Eisen\n   </em>\n   was about $225,000, while the cost of mailing a postcard notice to Settlement Class Members here would be between $12,333,000 and $31,834,000, (after accounting for the 41 million Southwest e-mails), and this would either decimate or deplete the \"settlement corpus of $15 million\" paid by Southwest, and it would substantially reduce the settlement corpus of $45 million paid by American.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

American Airlines and Non-Settling Defendants Delta and United estimated that for all three airlines, for the period 2011-2017, the majority of domestic airline travel was booked online using the airline's website or an online travel agent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sealed Response, ECF No. 230. The Court posed the following question to Southwest:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [I]n light of the fact that Plaintiffs have indicated that Southwest's transactional data includes e-mail addresses for approximately 95% of its customers... does Southwest also have postal addresses for its customers, and is so, [ ] for what percentage of its customers does it have postal addresses?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   April 16, 2018 Minute Order. Southwest responded that \"approximately 89% of [its] reservations are made over the internet\" and it \"has postal addresses for approximately 90% of purchasers.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Southwest's Resp. to the Court's April 16, 2018 Minute Order, ECF No. 227, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Pursuant to a Minute Order dated April 25, 2018, the Court requested that Plaintiffs respond to the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [I]n light of the fact that Plaintiffs have indicated that the cost of mailing notices to potential class members would range between 12.3 and 43.4 million dollars, the Court requests an estimate of the range of costs associated with providing e-mail notification to potential class members, and the range of costs associated with the other methods of disseminating notice, as proposed in the Plaintiffs' notice program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   April 25, 2018 Minute Order. The Plaintiffs responded by estimating the cost of e-mail notification and publication based on three difference scenarios: (1) assuming they only had the Southwest customer e-mails already in their possession, which would necessitate a broader range of publication; (2) assuming they had additional e-mail addresses, which would allow a more narrow scope of publication; and (3) assuming they had virtually all the e-mail addresses in the Non-Settling Defendants' possession,\n   which would permit an even narrower scope of publication. The combined total costs for the e-mail and publication notification decreased as more e-mails were added and a more narrow scope of publication was required, and the overall cost for any of the three scenarios was meager when compared to the cost of using direct mail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, taking into account that the majority of class members use the Internet to book their flights, as well as the large size of the class and the disproportionately higher cost of providing notification by direct mail as opposed to e-mail, and considering that the e-mail notification will be supplemented by publication through print and media outlets and numerous websites, databases and online services, the Court finds that the notice proposed in the Settlement Notice Program constitutes the \"best notice practicable\" under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court shall GRANT Plaintiffs' Motions for Approval of Settlement Notice Program, and the Non-Settling Defendants will be permitted thirty days in which to compile and provide the relevant customer e-mail addresses to the Plaintiffs.
