No. 93-1) and Defendants' cross-motion for partial summary judgment (Dkt. No. 108). Having thoroughly considered the parties' briefing and the relevant record, the Court finds oral argument unnecessary and hereby DENIES Plaintiff's motion and GRANTS Defendants' cross-motion for the reasons explained herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court previously articulated background information and summarized the associated statutory schemes at issue in this case and will not repeat that information here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 39, 56, 58, 79, 84.) Plaintiff and Defendants have filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment (Dkt. Nos. 93-1, 108) solely as to Claims # 2 and # 3 from Plaintiff's Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint (Dkt. No. 74 at 28-29) consistent with a stipulated briefing schedule (Dkt. Nos. 87, 103). Plaintiff brings these claim pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , seeking judicial review of agency actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (\"NOAA\") failed to withhold required amounts from annual grants the agencies make to Washington to reduce and manage Washington's nonpoint sources of water pollution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.) The grants are made pursuant to Section 319 of the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201329\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1), and Section 306 of the Coastal Zone Management Act (\"CZMA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201455\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). NOAA and EPA are required to withhold certain amounts from those grants if Washington fails to \"submit an approvable [Section 306] program.\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455b(c)(3). It is undisputed that NOAA has yet to finally approve Washington's Section 306 program. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that because Washington has not submitted an approvable Section 306 program, NOAA and EPA have failed to meet their statutory obligations to withhold amounts from Washington's CWA Section 319 and CZMA Section 306 grants for years beginning no later than 2002 and potentially as early as 1996. (Dkt. No. 93-1 at 17-31.) Plaintiff asks the Court to set aside prior grants and compel Defendants to withhold required amounts from future grants until Washington submits an approvable program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.) Defendants contend that Plaintiff lacks standing to assert Claims # 2 and # 3, that these claims are barred by the statute of limitations, that APA review does not apply to the type of agency action at issue in Claims # 2 and # 3, and that even if APA review does apply, the agencies have not unreasonably delayed withholding grant funds. (Dkt. No. 108 at 12-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
