First, citing no authority, defendant asserts that because the Tenth Circuit's order dismissing plaintiff's interlocutory appeal of the\n   <em>\n    Arterbury I\n   </em>\n   suppression order did not specify whether the appeal was dismissed with or without prejudice, this Court must presume that the dismissal was with prejudice. Dkt. # 13, at 3. Accordingly, defendant contends, plaintiff waived its right to appeal the\n   <em>\n    Arterbury I\n   </em>\n   suppression order and that order thus binds plaintiff in this case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202252\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Cir. 2017) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court considers first defendant's argument that the Court must (1) presume that the Tenth Circuit dismissed plaintiff's interlocutory appeal of the\n   <em>\n    Arterbury I\n   </em>\n   suppression order with prejudice (because the dismissal order was silent as to prejudice), and (2) conclude that plaintiff thus waived its right to appeal the suppression order and that the order thus binds plaintiff in this case. Defendant's argument is grounded in neither law nor logic. Defendant does not provide, and the Court has not found, support for the proposition that voluntarily dismissed appeals are presumed to be with prejudice. Rather, the weight of authority suggests that, under Fed. R. App. P. 42, a voluntarily dismissed appeal may be reinstated if a timely notice of appeal can still be filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   16AA C. Wright &amp; A. Miller,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice &amp; Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3998 (4th ed. Updated April 2018) (collecting cases). Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4 provides that the government had thirty-days after the\n   <em>\n    Arterbury I\n   </em>\n   court entered the suppression order, or an order on reconsideration, to file a notice of appeal. That time has obviously passed, and defendant is therefore correct, in a sense, that plaintiff is foreclosed from refiling its interlocutory appeal of the\n   <em>\n    Arterbury I\n   </em>\n   suppression order. But plaintiff is not seeking to do so. And defendant does not proffer, and the Court\n   does not see, any reason why the fact that plaintiff is time-barred from refiling its interlocutory appeal of the\n   <em>\n    Arterbury I\n   </em>\n   suppression order leads to the conclusion that plaintiff is also barred from seeking a new indictment against defendant, which the\n   <em>\n    Arterbury I\n   </em>\n   court dismissed, in no uncertain terms, \"without prejudice to refiling same.\"\n   <em>\n    Arterbury I\n   </em>\n   , 15-CR-182 at Dkt. # 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Next, the Court addresses defendant's argument that the doctrine of collateral estoppel makes the\n   <em>\n    Arterbury I\n   </em>\n   suppression order binding here. The precise question that this argument presents is, as far as the Court can tell, one of first impression. It is the following: does collateral estoppel bar a prosecuting authority from prosecuting a defendant where a suppression order was granted in defendant's favor in a prior litigation at a procedural stage where jeopardy had not attached, and where, since the prior litigation, a higher court has issued controlling precedent overruling the legal basis upon which the suppression order was granted? For reasons now explained, in the Court's opinion, the answer is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Though rooted in and usually associated with civil litigation, courts have applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel in the criminal context since at least 1916.

In the instant matter, the operative question is thus whether criminal collateral estoppel has a source other than the Double Jeopardy Clause, such that defendant may invoke the doctrine to bar relitigation of an issue determined at a prior proceeding in which jeopardy never\n   attached.

Defendant argues that it is the change-in-law exception to collateral estoppel itself that is inapplicable here because\n   <em>\n    Workman\n   </em>\n   did not change the law, but merely applied the good faith exception correctly. What neither party addresses, however, is whether the change-in-law exception to collateral estoppel, which is well-established in the civil context, applies to criminal collateral estoppel. The parties do not provide, and the Court has not found, any authority indicating that it does. And the Court will not simply assume that it does because, as the foregoing analysis illustrates, a set of concerns unique to the criminal context governs the doctrine of criminal collateral estoppel. For example, if an issue was determined in a defendant's favor at a proceeding where the defendant was in jeopardy, collateral estoppel as a component of the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a prosecuting authority from relitigating that issue as an ultimate issue in a successive proceeding, even where there has been an intervening change in law overruling the initial determination. The parties' discussion of the change-in-law exception to civil collateral estoppel, therefore, misses the forest for the trees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Having established that criminal collateral estoppel has application outside of a double jeopardy context, as a due process-oriented rule of federal law, and that no authority indicates whether there exists a change-in-law exception to this rule, the question before the Court boils down to this: is it fundamentally unfair to defendant, in light of\n   <em>\n    Workman\n   </em>\n   , for the Court to allow plaintiff to reprosecute Arterbury? To aid in this determination, the Court harkens back to the basic aims of the due-process oriented, federal rule of criminal collateral estoppel. These include: (1) reducing the chance that relitigation of an acquitted act could result in the conviction of an innocent defendant; (2) promoting\n   finality; (3) promoting judicial economy; (4) denying the prosecution the opportunity to improve its case for a second trial; (5) preventing prosecutorial harassment; and (6) preventing prosecutorial forum shopping.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"586385\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/655/243/\">\n    655 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   245 ;\n   <em>\n    The Due Process Roots of Criminal Collateral Estoppel\n   </em>\n   , 109 Harv. L. Rev. at 1732-33 (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Considering these aims in light of the facts of this case, the Court finds that allowing plaintiff to reprosecute Arterbury is not fundamentally unfair to defendant. In\n   <em>\n    Arterbury I\n   </em>\n   , defendant was not acquitted of any acts. As to finality, the\n   <em>\n    Arterbury I\n   </em>\n   court's dismissal order specified that the case was dismissed without prejudice to refiling same; defendant, therefore, was on notice that plaintiff could refile its case against him. Regarding judicial economy, this principle cuts in defendant's favor, but its importance in the criminal context is lessened because of the \"public interest in the accuracy and justice of criminal results.\"\n   <em>\n    Standefer v. U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180575\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/10/#p25\">\n    447 U.S. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180575\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/10/#p25\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180575\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/10/#p25\">\n    64 L.Ed.2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980) (quotation omitted). Finally, nothing before the Court indicates that plaintiff sought to use\n   <em>\n    Arterbury I\n   </em>\n   as a rehearsal for the instant matter, is harassing defendant, or is simply forum shopping. Rather, plaintiff, in what appears to be good faith, sought grand jury reissuance of the indictment against defendant because it believes, correctly, that\n   <em>\n    Workman\n   </em>\n   overrules the legal basis upon which the\n   <em>\n    Arterbury I\n   </em>\n   court granted defendant's motion to suppress. Under these circumstances, therefore, the due-process oriented, federal rule of criminal collateral estoppel does not require the Court to bar plaintiff from prosecuting\n   <em>\n    Arterbury\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, defendant's motion to enforce prior order suppressing evidence on grounds of collateral estoppel (Dkt. # 13) is\n   <strong>\n    denied.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Defendant's Motion to Suppress and Request for an Evidentiary Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant argues that, even if the\n   <em>\n    Arterbury\n   </em>\n   I suppression order does not bind the parties in this case (which, as this opinion and order establishes, it does not), the Court must suppress the evidence that the FBI obtained in searching his residence and computer (including photos and videos of child pornography), as well as his statements to law enforcement officers. Dkt. # 14, at 1, 26. Defendant provides three reasons in support of this argument. First, he asserts that the E.D. Va. magistrate judge, under Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(b), lacked the authority to issue the PlayPen warrant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Second, he contends that the affiant, in obtaining the PlayPen warrant, recklessly failed to disclose material information to the E.D. Va. magistrate judge, and defendant requests an evidentiary hearing on this issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15 (citing\n   <em>\n    Franks v.

Dkt. # 18, at 4. Plaintiff is correct. As discussed,\n   <em>\n    Workman\n   </em>\n   held that the good faith exception applies to evidence obtained pursuant to the PlayPen warrant.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276122\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1313/#p1314\">\n    863 F.3d at 1320-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In so holding, the court explained that the Supreme Court has identified five situations where the good faith exception is inapplicable, including where,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   1. the affiant obtains the warrant by recklessly or intentionally supplying\n   false information to the judge, [and] [...]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   3. the executing officers cannot reasonably believe that probable cause existed [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 1317-18 (citing\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    468 U.S. at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).
