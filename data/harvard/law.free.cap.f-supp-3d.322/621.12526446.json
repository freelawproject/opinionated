Petitioner raises four claims, including multiple claims of ineffective assistance of his trial counsel, a violation of his due process rights during the guilty plea process, and a claim that his sentence is unconstitutional under the Sixth Amendment. Petitioner also filed a motion to stay his Petition on the basis that his state court post-conviction proceeding (with respect to one of his grounds for relief) is still pending. Magistrate Judge Marilyn Heffley recommended that the Court deny the Petition without granting a stay and without issuing a certificate of appealability. Petitioner objects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court will approve and adopt Magistrate Judge Heffley's Report and Recommendation, overrule Petitioner's objections, and deny Petitioner habeas relief.

Op. at 18. The PCRA court also noted that in Petitioner's own letters to counsel during his direct appeal, in which he challenged the imposition of consecutive sentences, Petitioner repeatedly admitted his guilt and his understanding that the second strike provision applied to his crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Petitioner argues in his objections that Judge Heffley ignored clear and convincing evidence establishing that the PCRA's credibility determinations were incorrect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objs. at 4-10. Specifically, Petitioner asserts that the PCRA court should have believed his testimony that he was incorrectly informed that he was subject to a third strike sentenced based on (1) the ADA's statements during the plea colloquy that she had discussed the possibility of a\n   third strike sentence with defense counsel, and would give him notice if she intended to seek it at sentencing; and (2) the lack of any other discussion of second or third strike sentences during the plea colloquy. With respect to trial counsel's testimony at the PCRA hearing that he informed Petitioner that he was not eligible for a third strike, Petitioner argues that the testimony is \"baseless\" in light of (1) counsel's earlier letter to Petitioner stating that the third strike was applicable; and (2) the lack of evidence that Petitioner ever received the letter counsel claims he sent to Petitioner correcting that misinformation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Petitioner is correct that there was some discussion of third strike sentences during his plea colloquy, and that the ADA mentioned that a third strike sentence may be applicable. However, the ADA also stated that the second strike sentence was ten to twenty years, and the trial court later asked Petitioner whether he understood that the maximum sentence he was facing was ten to twenty years -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the second strike sentence. Petitioner answered that he understood that the maximum sentence he faced was ten to twenty years. Given that the trial court informed Petitioner of the maximum sentence he faced\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the ADA's discussion of the potential for a third strike sentence, any confusion that may have resulted from the ADA's comments was corrected by the court. Therefore, Petitioner has failed to introduce clear and convincing evidence rebutting the PCRA's factual determination that Petitioner's testimony was not credible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller-El\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191097\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/322/#p340\">\n    537 U.S. at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191097\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/322/#p340\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court also finds that Petitioner has failed to introduce clear and convincing evidence that the PCRA court incorrectly found his counsel's testimony credible. Petitioner's counsel acknowledged that his initial advice regarding the applicability of a third strike sentence was incorrect. However, Petitioner's counsel also testified that he sent Petitioner another letter stating that he did not agree with the ADA that Petitioner was eligible for a third strike, and that he separately had \"numerous discussions\" with Petitioner in which he explained that the third strike was not applicable. The PCRA court found this testimony credible. Petitioner has not submitted any evidence - much less clear and convincing evidence - undermining his counsel's testimony during the PCRA hearing. Instead, Petitioner contends that this Court should override the PCRA court's credibility finding because his counsel does not have any proof that Petitioner received the second letter correcting the earlier misinformation. However, even if Petitioner did not receive the second letter, Petitioner's counsel testified that he had \"numerous discussions\" with Petitioner in which he advised Petitioner that the third strike was not applicable. Petitioner does not have any evidence (aside from his own contrary assertions) that that testimony was false. Accordingly, the Court will uphold the PCRA court's factual finding that Petitioner's counsel correctly informed Petitioner of the sentence he faced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller-El\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191097\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/322/#p340\">\n    537 U.S. at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191097\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/322/#p340\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   With respect to the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , Petitioner must demonstrate that his counsel's deficient performance is the reason that he pleaded guilty, and that, but for that advice, he would have decided to plead not guilty and proceed to trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197970\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/52/#p59\">\n    474 U.S. at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197970\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/52/#p59\">\n    106 S.Ct. 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Petitioner contends that the evidence identified by Judge Heffley related solely to one of the six robberies, and that there was no evidence connecting him to the other five robberies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. He explains that he told his PCRA counsel that he was guilty because he feared that if he continued to profess his innocence, counsel would ignore him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Regardless of whether the evidence noted by Petitioner's counsel at the PCRA hearing related to only one of the six robberies, the apparent lack of evidence for the other five crimes does not constitute \"clear and convincing evidence\" sufficient to rebut the PCRA court's factual finding that Petitioner's testimony regarding his reasons for pleading guilty was not credible. Nor is the purported lack of evidence regarding five robberies sufficient to rebut the PCRA's finding that Petitioner's counsel - who testified that the reason Petitioner pleaded guilty was because he was guilty - was credible. Therefore, the Court will rely on the credibility findings of the PCRA court to determine that Petitioner has not satisfied the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As Petitioner has not demonstrated that the state court's denial of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim was contrary to clearly established federal law, or based upon an unreasonable application of the facts, the Court will deny the Petition with respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim asserted in Ground One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Due Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Next, Petitioner objects that Judge Heffley failed to consider his due process claim, in which he asserted that his rights to \"due process\" were violated when the Commonwealth threatened him with an \"illegal\" sentence in order to induce a guilty plea.

Judge Heffley recommended that the Court deny Petitioner's \"due process\" claim for the same reasons as his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, stating: \"to the extent that Arnold argues that he was denied an opportunity to withdraw his plea after it was learned that the Commonwealth had threatened him with an illegal sentence to secure the plea, that claim likewise fails.\" R &amp; R at 17 n.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Petitioner contends that his rights to due process were violated when the prosecutor in his case threatened him with an illegal sentence to induce a guilty plea.

As explained above, the PCRA court found credible the testimony of Petitioner's trial counsel, who explained that Petitioner pleaded guilty because he was \"essentially caught.\" Aug. 31 PCRA Tr. at 14. Even if Petitioner's counsel had successfully litigated a motion to suppress Petitioner's confession, there was ample other evidence against him. For example, with respect to one of the robberies, officers recovered a bag containing a fake gun of the same make and model as the one used in the robberies, together with a Walmart receipt that indicated that Petitioner purchased the fake gun with his own credit card.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 23 (quoting Sentencing Tr. at 20-21). Thus, Petitioner does not establish that, had his counsel filed a motion to suppress his confession, he would have pleaded not guilty and gone to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In his objections, Petitioner draws a distinction between the bank robbery, for which the fake gun and receipt were found, and the other six robberies, for which he contends there was no evidence. Objs. at 13-15. He explains that the evidence of the bank robbery cannot be used to establish that he would have pleaded guilty even if his counsel had successfully litigated a motion to suppress the confession, because it only relates to one of the seven robberies. According to Petitioner, he is innocent of the other six robberies and would not have pleaded guilty if his confession (which he contends he only made because he was not provided with an attorney) was suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   However, the evidence of the bank robbery was not the sole reason that Judge Heffley recommended finding that Petitioner had not met his burden to establish the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . Petitioner must do more than introduce \"mere allegations\" that he would not have pleaded guilty and would have proceeded to trial, which he has not done. Considering Petitioner's counsel's testimony at the PCRA hearing that Petitioner pleaded guilty because he was guilty - which the PCRA court found credible - Petitioner has failed to meet his burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   For the same reasons, Petitioner fails to show that his PCRA attorney was ineffective for failing to litigate the ineffectiveness of his trial counsel with respect to the motion to suppress the confession. Even if Petitioner had shared his version of events with his PCRA counsel - which Petitioner does not squarely allege he did - his PCRA counsel's decision not to bring an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on the basis of the failure to file a motion to\n   suppress does not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness in light of the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver and Petitioner's admission that he did not remember the morning in question. As a result, the Court will overrule Petitioner's objection to the R &amp; R and deny Petitioner habeas relief on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel for Failure to Ensure Adequate Plea Colloquy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Next, Petitioner contends that his plea counsel was ineffective for failing to ensure that his plea colloquy was adequate. His objection focuses on only one point: that counsel failed to inform him \"of the maximum sentence he was facing.\" Objs. at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The record is crystal clear, however. Counsel informed Petitioner that \"the maximum sentence for these felonies of the first degree is ten to [twenty] years in jail and a fine of no more than $25,000...\". Open Guilty Plea Tr. at 8. While Petitioner is correct in that the oral plea colloquy never broached the subject of consecutive sentences, it did not need to because that information was already included in the written plea colloquy.

Objs. at 15. According to Petitioner, it is \"obvious\" that his counsel was referring only to the statutory maximums for first degree felonies in Pennsylvania without any sentencing enhancements, and that any second or third strike enhancements would be in addition to the maximum sentence provided by his counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2948148\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/416/#p440\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, according to Petitioner, he was never accurately informed of his true maximum sentence. However, the maximum sentence as stated by Petitioner's counsel\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   include an enhancement: the second strike enhancement. It was the second strike which provided the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9714(a)(1). Therefore, Petitioner is incorrect that the colloquy \"simply did not cover what [Petitioner] was facing.\" Objs. at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   As Petitioner was correctly informed of the maximum sentence he faced during the plea colloquy, his arguments are both factually and legally meritless.
