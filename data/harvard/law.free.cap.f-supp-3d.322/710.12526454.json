No. 1-1). Antero and Midstream Partners removed the cases to this Court on February 12, 2018, on the basis of diversity jurisdiction (Dkt. No. 1). The plaintiffs argue that the Antero defendants have been improperly deducting post-production costs from royalty payments due to the plaintiffs under certain oil and gas leases.

Having reviewed the plaintiffs' proposed second amended complaints, the Court concludes that the amendment is not made in bad faith. The plaintiffs do not seek to add any new causes of action, but rather to plead additional allegations in support of the causes of action originally pled. Furthermore, the amendment neither unduly delays these recently-filed actions, nor unduly prejudices the remaining defendant, Antero.

No. 17 at 1). This Court's precedent plainly requires the plaintiffs to allege the parties' connection to oil and gas leases at issue. In\n   <em>\n    Cather v. Seneca-Upshur Petroleum, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff alleged only that defendant Forest Oil was \"a lessee or ultimate assignee of the leases\" at issue. No. 1:09CV139,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203271965\">\n    2010 WL 3271965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D.W.Va. Aug. 18, 2010). Because the Court was not satisfied that this allegation clearly established Forest Oil's connection to the contracts, it construed Forest Oil's motion to dismiss as a motion for a more definite statement and allowed the plaintiff to file an amended complaint detailing the corporate merger that resulted in Forest Oil's interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Here, as argued by Antero, the allegations in the first amended complaints varied in sufficiency with regard to each lease. Some of the leases attached to the amended complaints were executed by the plaintiffs and Antero themselves, but a significant number were executed by other parties. Although the plaintiffs attached royalty statements from Antero, none of these documents references the particular tracts or leases in question in a manner sufficient to establish the parties' connection. In the second amended complaints, however, the plaintiffs allege facts sufficient to establish their own-and Antero's-connection to each lease through the record chain of title for the tracts at issue (Dkt. No. 27-1 at 2-25). Accordingly, the second amended complaints adequately allege the existence of enforceable contracts between the plaintiffs and Antero.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Second, Antero argues that the plaintiffs' amended complaints fail to allege that they performed any of their obligations outlined in the lease agreements or were excused from such performance. This is a light burden;\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   does not require the plaintiffs to plead factual support for a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, so long as their allegations make it factually plausible that the defendants are liable for the misconduct alleged.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Connelly v. Lane Const. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058329\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/780/#p788\">\n    809 F.3d 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 788-89 (3d Cir. 2016). Indeed, in amending the complaints for a second time, the plaintiffs took the opportunity to address their performance, and have sufficiently alleged that they fulfilled their duties and obligations under the leases by maintaining title (Dkt. No. 27-1 at 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Because the plaintiffs have corrected each of the pleading deficiencies identified in Antero's motion to dismiss, the Court concludes that the plaintiffs have adequately pleaded claims for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Matter of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Antero also argues that the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for breach of contract as a matter of law because the leases at issue allow Antero to deduct post-production costs (Dkt. No. 17 at 9-14). The second amended complaints attach eight separate leases with different language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As an initial matter, only one of the leases at issue is a flat-rate lease subject to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-6-8\">\n    W.

The Court will address the three types of leases at issue in this case in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   First, the leases regarding Tract (A) require a royalty on \"the net amount realized by Lessee computed at the wellhead.\" They also contain a \"Market Enhancement Clause,\" which forbids deductions regarding preparation, transportation, and sale of a marketable product, but permits deductions for steps taken to enhance the value of already marketable products. Antero contends that, because certain of the leases covering Tract (A) contain a Market Enhancement Clause, it may deduct post-production expenses from the plaintiffs' royalties (Dkt. No. 17 at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Indeed, leases containing the Market Enhancement Clause may be\n   <em>\n    Tawney\n   </em>\n   -compliant. The clause \"expressly provide[s] that the lessor shall bear some part of the costs incurred between the wellhead and the point of sale,\"\n   <em>\n    Tawney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8317851\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/219/266/\">\n    633 S.E.2d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Syl. Pt. 10, by deducting the actual cost of enhancements to the value of oil and gas that is already in marketable form. Nonetheless, the clause also expressly forbids Antero from deducting costs to market oil and gas or place it in marketable form.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8317851\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/219/266/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Given that such deductions fall within the general breach-of-contract allegations in the second amended complaints, the Market Enhancement Clause provides no reason to dismiss the complaints for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Second, the royalty provisions regarding Tracts (B), (C), (E), (F), and (H) appear to require royalties based on the market price due to either of the following clauses: (a) \"value at the well,\" or (b) \"gross proceeds received from the sale of the same at the prevailing price.\" Antero argues that\n   <em>\n    Tawney\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable because the royalty provisions are based on \"market value\" rather than \"proceeds\" (Dkt. No. 17 at 12-14). In support, it relies on\n   <em>\n    Imperial Colliery Co. v. Oxy USA Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047520\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/912/696/\">\n    912 F.2d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1990), in which the Fourth Circuit reasoned that post-production deductions are a permissible way to arrive at the \"wholesale market value at the well.\" Although the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Imperial Colliery Co.\n   </em>\n   is on point, the more recent and binding decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Tawney\n   </em>\n   rejected a similar argument. There, the defendant asserted that \"wellhead-type language clearly called for allocation of post-production expenses\" when read in conjunction with language such as \"gross proceeds,\" \"market price,\" or \"net of all costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Tawney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8317851\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/219/266/\">\n    633 S.E.2d at 28-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Due to inherent ambiguities, the court found that none of these modifiers was sufficient to overcome the\n   <em>\n    Wellman\n   </em>\n   presumption that the lessee must bear post-production costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8317851\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/219/266/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the \"market value\" provisions do not render the leases unambiguous enough to escape\n   <em>\n    Tawney\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Third, Antero argues that the plaintiffs have not stated a claim for breach of contract with regard to Tract (G), which is subject to a flat-rate lease (Dkt. No. 17 at 14). Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Leggett\n   </em>\n   , Antero is entitled to take reasonable, actual post-production deductions from the plaintiffs' royalties with regard to this well. The plaintiffs have thus alleged that the \"defendants charged [them] with costs and charges which were unreasonably excessive and not actual\" (Dkt. No. 27-1 at 32). This allegation makes it plausible that Antero has breached the lease agreements by failing to comply with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Leggett\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, the plaintiffs have stated a claim for breach of contract with regard to Tract (G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For these reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Antero's motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for Breach of Contract (Count One).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Antero argues that the plaintiffs' claims for Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Count Two) should be dismissed because a fiduciary duty is not formed by the mere execution\n   of an oil and gas lease (Dkt. No. 17 at 15-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In their response, the plaintiffs concede that many courts have held that an oil and gas producer does not owe a fiduciary duty to a landowner with respect to the operational duties and allegations to its lessees. However, they argue that \"these cases fail to acknowledge that the duties and responsibilities actually assumed by a lessee as a result of a natural gas lease are much different than that seen in more typical leases\" (Dkt. No. 19 at 17). They further argue that a duty exists, \"particularly when the gas company receives money for both the plaintiffs and defendants,\" because the gas company must honestly account for the royalties owed to the landowners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In its reply, Antero reiterates its argument that West Virginia law has repeatedly held that the duty owed between parties in an oil and gas lease does not rise to the level of a fiduciary relationship (Dkt. No. 20 at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   This Court has previously concluded that a fiduciary duty does not exist between the parties of an oil and gas lease because the duty created is one of \"ordinary prudence\" and not of a fiduciary.\n   <em>\n    Cather v.

West Virginia law is clear that a fiduciary duty does not exist in this type of case dealing with gas and oil leases.

In the second amended complaints, the plaintiffs allege that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   [d]efendants misrepresented to plaintiffs that defendants were entitled to take deductions from plaintiffs' royalty, that they had the right to take the amount of deductions they took, reduced plaintiffs' royalty payments, misrepresented the amount of volume that was taken from plaintiffs' property, overcharged plaintiffs for services, and/or wrongfully claimed plaintiffs' royalty due was less than the amount actually due, and failed to report to plaintiffs that they were extracting and selling liquids from plaintiffs' natural gas, thereby denying plaintiffs the rents and royalties to which they were due.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Dkt. No. 27-1 at 36. The plaintiffs' allegations of fraud can therefore be grouped into three categories: (1) affirmative misrepresentations, (2) material omissions, and (3) fraud by way of reducing royalty payments. The first question before the Court is whether these allegations amount to fraud under West Virginia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As to affirmative misrepresentations, the plaintiffs have failed to allege any such misrepresentation with particularity. While the plaintiffs generally allege that the \"defendants misrepresented ... that [they] were entitled to take deductions from plaintiffs' royalty, [and] that they had the right to take the amount of deductions they took,\" the complaint does not specifically identify any false representation made by the defendants to the plaintiffs (Dkt. No. 27-1 at 36). Because these allegations of affirmative misrepresentations lack the specificity necessary to provide the defendants with \"the particular circumstances for which [they] will have to prepare a defense at trial,\" they are stated with insufficient particularity to meet the requirements of Rule 9(b).\n   <em>\n    In Town Hotels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9350808\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/246/469/#p487\">\n    246 F.Supp.2d at 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   As to material omissions, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants \"failed to report ... that they were extracting and selling liquids from plaintiffs' natural gas\" (Dkt. No. 27-1 at 36). This claim seemingly depends on the existence of some legal duty owed by the defendants to the plaintiffs to share the allegedly undisclosed information. However, the plaintiffs have failed to allege which defendant(s) were responsible for these alleged omissions. Moreover, Antero is the only defendant alleged to be a party to any of the plaintiffs' leases. Because Midstream is not a party to the leases, the plaintiffs cannot claim that it owes them any contractual duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs have alleged fraud based on the defendants' \"reduc[tion of] plaintiffs' royalty payments\" and \"overcharge[ of] plaintiffs for services\" (Dkt. No. 27-1 at 36). At bottom, it is simply unclear how these allegations, which do not involve any representations, fit within the elements of an action for fraud under West Virginia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Nevertheless, as argued by Antero, the plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege justifiable reliance, the third element of fraud. Beyond a general allegation that they \"rel[ied] on the defendants for\n   the honest accounting and lawful payment[ ]... of royalty owed\" (Dkt. No. 27-1 at 36), the plaintiffs have not alleged any acts they took in reliance on Antero's alleged misrepresentations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mountain Link Assocs., Inc. v.
