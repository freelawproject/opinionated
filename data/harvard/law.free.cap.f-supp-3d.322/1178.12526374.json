Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Royal Pacific Limited (Royal Pacific) and Faith Electric Manufacture Company, Ltd. (Faith Electric) entered into a distribution agreement through which Royal Pacific became the exclusive distributor of Faith Electric's products, including ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) receptacles, to certain companies. [Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7; Doc. 10, Counterclaim \u00b6\u00b6 1, 8] One of these companies was Menard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. 1, \u00b6 10; Doc. 10, Counterclaim \u00b6 9] The present matter was initiated by filing of Royal Pacific's\n   <em>\n    Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Other Relief\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 1], in which Royal Pacific alleges that, in 2016, problems arose with the quality of several of Faith Electric's products, including GFCI receptacles. [Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14] Royal Pacific further alleges that it notified Faith Electric, but that Faith Electric failed to remedy the problems and that, because the quality problems \"damaged Royal Pacific's reputation and harmed Royal Pacific's business relationship with Menards,\" Royal Pacific terminated the distribution agreement in March 2017. [Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 29, 36] Royal Pacific seeks a declaratory judgment that Faith Electric breached the contract between them and breached the implied warranty of merchantability. [Doc. 1] Faith Electric denies that any of its products were defective and alleges in counterclaims that Royal Pacific breached the agreement, defamed Faith Electric, violated the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act (NMUPA), interfered with Faith Electric's prospective business advantage, and committed prima facie tort. [Doc. 10]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After inviting the parties to clarify the facts supporting jurisdiction, this Court found that the parties are diverse and the amount in controversy is greater than $75,000.

NMUPA Unfair Practices Act (Count III) and Prima Facie Tort (Count V)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Faith Electric does not oppose dismissal of its claims for violation of the NMUPA\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and prima facie tort. [Doc. 21, pg. 4, n.1] However, it asks that the Court dismiss these counts \"without prejudice\" so that it can later refile them \"as and if warranted.\" [Doc. 21, pg. 4, n.1] Royal Pacific opposes dismissal without prejudice and argues in its\n   <em>\n    Reply\n   </em>\n   that, instead, dismissal should be \"with prejudice\" because Faith Electric is unable to rectify the failings inherent in these counts in any subsequent pleading. [Doc. 27, pg. 1-2]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Faith Electric's statement could be construed as a voluntary dismissal of Counts III and V under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1), which provides that \"the plaintiff may dismiss an action without a court order by filing ... a notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves either an answer or a motion for summary judgment.\" Here, so long as the Court does not consider evidence outside of Faith Electric's counterclaims, Royal Pacific's\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   would not be converted to a motion for summary judgment, and thus would not prevent a voluntary\n   dismissal under Rule 41(a). When a claim is dismissed pursuant to this rule, \"the dismissal is [generally] without prejudice.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   However, our Tenth Circuit has stated that there is \"no authority ... to support the contention that Rule 41(a) applies to dismissal of less than all claims in an action.\"\n   <em>\n    Gobbo Farms &amp; Orchards v.

Here, Faith Electric agrees to the dismissal of only two of its five claims. Hence, Rule 41(a) does not apply. \"Instead, a [p]laintiff who wishes to dismiss some claims, but not others, should do so by amending the complaint pursuant to Rule 15.\"\n   <em>\n    Carskadon v.

Okla. May 11, 2011) (stating that \"[i]n cases where a plaintiff has attempted to use the Rule 41 mechanism to dismiss fewer than all claims against a defendant, courts convert the faulty Rule 41 motion into a Rule 15 motion to amend\"). Under Rule 15(a)(2), leave to amend a complaint should be \"freely given.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). It is within the Court's discretion, however, to deny leave to amend a pleading based upon \"undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [and] futility of amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Foman v.

Royal Pacific argues that amendment of the counterclaims would be futile, and hence, the Court should dismiss them with prejudice. [Doc. 27] Because Faith Electric stated its assent to dismissal of the claims in its\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   , it did not address Royal Pacific's arguments as to whether dismissal should be with or without prejudice. [Doc. 21]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court will grant Faith Electric leave to amend its complaint. Royal Pacific's motion to dismiss will thus be denied as moot as to the prima facie tort and NMUPA claims. Should Faith Electric move for leave to reassert such claims in the future, the Court will consider the parties' arguments as to prejudice and futility of such an amendment upon full briefing at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defamation (Count II)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Royal Pacific argues that Faith Electric's defamation claim should be dismissed because Faith Electric \"does not identify any defamatory statements and [therefore] does not allege the prima facie elements of a claim for defamation under New Mexico law.\" [Doc. 13, pg. 3] Faith Electric counters that it, \"consistent with the notice pleading standard of Rule (8)(a)(2), alleges more than sufficient facts to support its defamation claim.\" [Doc. 21, pg. 4]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Generally, the elements of a defamation action include: a defamatory communication, published by the defendant, to a third person, of an asserted fact, of and concerning the plaintiff, and proximately causing actual injury to the plaintiff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Newberry v.

To reiterate, Faith Electric alleges that Royal Pacific, \"commencing in or around March 2016 and continuing thereafter, represented to third parties that Faith [Electric's] products were defective and presented safety hazards to persons purchasing and/or using Faith [Electric's] products.\" [Doc. 10, \u00b6 23] While Faith Electric's allegations identify the content of the allegedly defamatory statements (the quality of their product), they do not identify with any precision when the statements were made, by whom, to whom, or in what context. Instead, Faith Electric alleges that the communications were made sometime after March, 2016, by an unnamed person. Since Faith Electric's counterclaim was filed in October, 2017, this allegation encompasses approximately eighteen months in which the communication(s) could have occurred. Moreover, the assertion (made only in Faith Electric's\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   , not its counterclaim) that the recipients of the statements include \"at minimum, some of or all of\" nine different companies merely highlights the vagueness of the assertion. In sum, Faith Electric alleges that, at some point in an eighteen month period, someone at Royal Pacific told, one or more times, one or more people at one or more of nine different companies that Faith Electric's product was faulty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, Faith Electric concedes that \"it is true that at present Faith [Electric] does not know the exact date of the statements, emails, and other forms of publication of defamatory statements made by [Royal Pacific] to third parties after March 2016.\" [Doc. 21, pg. 6] It argues that \"these details already are in [Royal Pacific's] hands\" and that Faith Electric will have access to those details through discovery. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The problem with this argument is that it suggests that Faith Electric lacks the factual underpinning necessary to plead a defamation claim. By acknowledging that it lacks these facts, Faith Electric \"[has] essentially conceded that [it does] not now have information or knowledge which would support the conclusion that [Royal Pacific] defamed [it].\"\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v.
