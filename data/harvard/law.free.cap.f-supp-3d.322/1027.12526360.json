(\"Defendants\") filed a Motion for Terminating Sanctions Against Plaintiffs for Spoliation of Evidence (\"Motion\"). (Doc. No. 399).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants Argus Health Systems, Inc., Benescript Services, Inc., Prime Therapeutics, Inc., and First Health Services, Corp. have filed joinders to this motion.

No. 408).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After considering all papers filed in support of and in opposition to the motions, the Court Grants Defendants' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because the parties are familiar with the facts, they are restated here only when necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs are owners of retail pharmacies. On December 5, 2002, they filed the above-captioned, putative class action (Case No. CV 02-1327), alleging that defendants are \"prescription drug claims processors\" (\"PBMs\") that (1) did not prepare a fee study mandated by California Civil Code \u00a7 2527 ; (2) failed to distribute such a fee study to their clients; or (3) prepared flawed fee studies. (Doc. No. 1,\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32). On February 25, 2004, plaintiffs filed a second class action, Case No. CV 04-0407, alleging similar violations of California Civil Code \u00a7 2527 and California Business &amp; Professions Code \u00a7 17200. (Case No. 04-0407, Doc. No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Civil Code \u00a7 2527(c) sets forth the formula for calculating a pharmacy's fee for the purpose of the studies. The statute requires PBMs to apply this formula, then compile the data collected into a study report, which must include the information specified in \u00a7 2527(c). PBMs are under an obligation, every two years thereafter, either to perform a new survey or to supply their clients with a copy of the previously transmitted study together with a notice of the cost of living changes (measured by the Consumer Price Index) since the earlier study was prepared.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202527\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 2527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Any PBM that is not in compliance with the requirements of Civil Code \u00a7 2527 is prohibited from entering into any new contract with a licensed California pharmacy, performing the provisions of an existing contract with a licensed California pharmacy, or processing any prescription drug claims submitted by a licensed California pharmacy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202527\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202527\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00a7 2527(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Civil Code \u00a7 2528 creates a private right of action for a PBM's violation of Civil Code \u00a7 2527. That section imparts standing to sue upon owners of licensed California pharmacies that have a contractual relationship with, or render pharmaceutical services to, a beneficiary of a client of the offending PBM.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202527\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Successful plaintiffs are entitled to civil remedies between $1,000 and $10,000 per violation of Civil Code \u00a7 2527, injunctive and declaratory relief, and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202527\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202527\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00a7 2528.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July 2004, this Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss in Case No. 02-1327, holding that plaintiffs had not sustained an injury-in-fact sufficient to confer Article III Standing. (Doc. No. 155). The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that the pharmacists had alleged a \"procedural injury\" sufficient to confer Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beeman v. TDI Managed Care Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5408688\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/1035/#p1039\">\n    449 F.3d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1039 (9th Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants then sought judgment on the pleadings on free speech grounds; this Court denied the motion in May 2007. (Doc. No. 218). In August 2007, the Court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment, holding that because three of the plaintiff pharmacists had brought a parallel suit in state court,\n   <em>\n    Bradley v. First Health Services Corp.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. BC319292, and litigated that case to final adverse judgment, these plaintiffs were barred under res judicata principles from pursuing their overlapping claims in this action. (Doc. No. 249). On October 5, 2007, the Court consolidated Case Nos. 02-1327 and 04-0407. (Doc. No. 258; Case No. 04-0407, Doc. No. 303).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 19, 2011, a split Ninth Circuit panel affirmed this Court's denial of defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings on free speech grounds.\n   <em>\n    Jerry Beeman &amp; Pharmacy Servs., Inc. v. Anthem Prescription Mgmt., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759224\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/1085/#p1107\">\n    652 F.3d 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1107 (9th Cir. 2011). The Ninth Circuit granted defendants' petition for rehearing en banc in October 2011, and later certified the state law free speech question to the California Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beeman v.

In December 2013, the California Supreme Court concluded that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202527\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 2527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq. does not violate the California Constitution's free speech protections.\n   <em>\n    Beeman v.

The Ninth Circuit then vacated the panel opinion and remanded the action to this Court for further proceedings. (Doc. No. 308). Its mandate issued on April 14, 2014. (Doc. No. 310).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs took no further action to prosecute the case until April 1, 2016, when Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking preliminary approval of a class settlement reached with defendant Cardinal Health MPB, Inc., f/k/a Managed Pharmacy Benefits (\"MPB\") and certification of a settlement class. (Case No. 04-0407, Doc. No. 389).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ten days later, however, Plaintiffs filed a motion to substitute Carrie Lynn Warren McCarthy as successor in interest to Named Plaintiff Charles Miller. (Doc. No. 328; Case No. 04-0407, Doc. No. 393). Miller and Anthony Hutchinson, the representative for the other named plaintiff Rocida, Inc., had died before the onset of the settlement negotiation: Miller on October 12, 2010 and Hutchinson\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on March 30, 2012. Their counsel, Michael Bowse and Alan Mansfield, did not inform MPB or any of the Defendants of their deaths until after the settlement was negotiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants challenged the standing of the remaining plaintiffs as well as the proposed successor, and further asked the Court to deny class certification. The parties conducted limited discovery on these matters and filed additional briefs. After reviewing the matters, the Court found that McCarthy is Miller's successor, but that she and the remaining named plaintiff, Rocida, Inc., as well as their counsel, were inadequate to represent the class. (Case No. 02-1327, Doc. 369; Case No. 04-0407, Doc. 455).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Destruction of Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the course of conducting limited discovery relating to class certification, Defendants learned that certain documents related to Plaintiffs' pharmacies had been destroyed. Plaintiffs had not informed Defendants of this document destruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Corporate Representative for Plaintiff Rocida, Inc., Directed the Purchaser of Finley's Rexall Drug to Shred Documents and Erase All Electronic Records.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Joann Miner is the sole owner of Plaintiff Rocida, Inc. (Doc. No. 407-2 at 2, \u00b6 1). From 1990 to 2008, she was the Chief Financial Officer of Rocida, Inc., and handled the bookkeeping for Rocida, Inc. and the pharmacy it owned, Finley's Rexall Drug. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On July 29, 2016, Defendants took the deposition of Miner in her capacity as the corporate designee of Rocida, Inc. (Doc. No. 399-1 at 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Miner testified that when the litigation was commenced, she was given an instruction to preserve documents that may be requested or necessary in the litigation. (Doc. No. 399-1 at 26, 58:15-18). When she was given this instruction, she understood that she was required to preserve certain records. (Doc. No. 399-1 at 26-27, 58:24-59:1). Despite her awareness of this obligation, Miner testified that \"after quite awhile, [she] figured [the litigation] probably wasn't going to go anywhere, and [she] really didn't worry about it a lot.\" (Doc. No. 399-1 at 26, 58:15-20;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 2759:2-13). Miner also testified that she only received \"[a]n occasional phone call\" from counsel about the case. (Doc. No. 399-1 at 29, 79:12-80:8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Miner testified that when Finley's Rexall Drug was sold in 2007, she \"left almost everything\" in the building, and told the new owners, NTN Corp., that they could shred documents after five years. (Doc. No. 399-1 at 22, 45:15-22;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28, 60:13-20). Miner testified that these documents included Rocida, Inc.'s annual meetings minutes, financial statements, prescription records, cash receipts, purchase records,\n   contracts with pharmacy benefit managers, contracts with wholesalers or entities from which Rocida, Inc. was purchasing prescription drugs, payroll documents, and a list of accounts receivable that were being retained by Rocida, Inc. (Doc. No. 399-1 at 22-24, 45:4-47:5,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26, 58:3-14). Miner also testified that she told the new owners that in 2012 they could erase electronic records from 1990-2009. (Doc. No. 399-1 at 47:16-24). She also testified that she did not retain any of the electronic records that she left with NTN, Corp. (Doc. No. 399-1 at 24-25, 25:2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Former Plaintiff Charles Miller's Documents Were Damaged by a Flood and Discarded By Plaintiff Carrie Lynn McCarthy.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff Carrie Lynn McCarthy is the stepdaughter and successor in interest to former plaintiff Charles Miller. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 17-18, 94:15-95:5). On August 16, 2016, Defendants deposed McCarthy. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 6). McCarthy testified that in August of 2010, she relocated to California to live in Miller's house at 6827 Neil Street, Riverside, California while Miller was suffering from cancer. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 10-11, 52:25-53:2;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19, 96:4-13;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15, 62:17-63:1;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 17:19-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Before his death in October 2010, Miller informed McCarthy there was a pending lawsuit that would have to be finished. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 8-9, 50:14-51:2). Miller told McCarthy that the lawsuit was a class action, and that he was part of the class. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 9, 51:10-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After Miller's death, Plaintiffs' counsel waited years to contact McCarthy about the lawsuit, and it is not clear if Plaintiff's counsel ever informed her of her obligation to preserve documents. Instead, McCarthy testified that since the time of Mr. Miller's death, she had \"put\" this case \"on the back burner,\" and \"[i]t wasn't something [she] thought about until [she] was contacted by [Plaintiffs' counsel Alan] Mansfield\" in 2014. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 9, 51: 10-21;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After Miller passed away, McCarthy continued living in the house on Neil Street. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 14-15, 62:17-63:1). In or around late January or early February 2011, the Neil Street house was flooded. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 11, 53:6-10). The flood affected three-quarters of the house and the entire garage. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 53:14-17). McCarthy testified that she had not taken any steps to preserve Miller's documents; many of them just happened to be in the garage at the time of the flood. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 24-25, 169:24-170:3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The flood affected \"a lot of cardboard boxes\" containing Miller's documents. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 10, 52:5-10). After the flood, McCarthy threw away all of the affected documents. (Doc. No 407-1 at 11-12, 53:23-54:1). Plaintiff did not go through them page by page; instead, instead, she glanced through the documents and threw away everything that had gotten wet. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 12-13, 54:13-55:1;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, 52:2-9;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24, 169:17-23 (\"I had flooded, damaged boxes that I knew if I kept a hold of would create a mold issue, which potentially becomes a health hazard. So everything that I had that was wet, mine, Charlie's, Yucaipa Valley Pharmacy, anything that was in the garage was destroyed because of the damage it received.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The destroyed documents contained the vast majority of Mr. Miller's personal and business documents; the only documents that McCarthy saved were Miller's death certificate and his army records. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 25, 170:14-21). McCarthy testified that she did not recall exactly the documents that were destroyed, but from her memory of looking at them as she threw them away, she believes they included tax records related to Miller's business. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 12, 54:1-13). McCarthy also\n   testified that she no longer had any documents relating to the sale of the Yucaipa Valley Pharmacy after the flood. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 25, 170:22-24). McCarthy testified that she was not in contact with Plaintiffs' counsel when she discarded the affected documents. (Doc. No. 407-1 at 13, 55:3-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As discussed above in Section I.B.1, Miner had been given instructions regarding document preservation, but after only sporadic contact from Plaintiffs' counsel and the lack of progress in the litigation, she determined - incorrectly - that she no longer had an obligation to preserve these documents. Similarly, McCarthy had been told by Miller that he was a plaintiff in a pending class action lawsuit related to his pharmacy business, but she did not do anything to preserve potentially relevant documents when he died. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section I.B.2.). Furthermore, Defendants had requested categories of documents included in the documents that were destroyed by Miner and McCarthy.

Miner was in direct communication with NTN Corp. about the documents at issue and has admitted to directing their destruction. Although Miner now claims that some documents survived her direction to shred and erase documents, she does not demonstrate that all relevant documents survived or that the surviving documents ameliorate the damage that she directed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Similarly, despite the knowledge of the pending litigation before the flood, McCarthy did not protect any of Miller's documents from damage nor did she contact Plaintiffs' counsel about the documents. After the flood, McCarthy intentionally discarded all of the affected documents. McCarthy made no effort to contact Plaintiffs' counsel to inquire about discarding the damaged documents, made no efforts to salvage the damaged documents, and did nothing to document the destruction so that Defendants could test her assertion that the documents were indeed unsalvageable.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section IV above). Plaintiffs' arguments in opposition fail to rebut the presumption that the destroyed documents are relevant, or that their destruction caused prejudice to Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs Have Failed to Rebut the Presumption that the Destroyed Documents were Relevant.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although Defendants cannot know the full extent of the relevant documents destroyed by Plaintiffs, Defendants have been able to identify several categories of relevant documents that were likely included in the spoliation from the depositions of Miner and McCarthy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Doc. No. 399 at 24-27; Section II.B. above).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In particular, Defendants show how at least some of the destroyed documents relate to the adequacy of the Section 2527 studies and Plaintiffs' pharmacy ownership. (Doc. No. 399 at 24-25). The Court agrees. The Miner and McCarthy depositions indicate that the destroyed documents include those that would likely demonstrate \"the pharmacy's usual charges for ... commonly prescribed drug products\" and \"the average wholesale price of drug ingredients.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202527\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 2527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). As Plaintiffs admit in their opposition, these types of documents can be used to determine the information used to generate a Section 2527 fee study. (Doc. No. 407 at 23 (\"[T]hose materials are necessary and relevant to prepare a study that complies with the requirements of Section 2527(c)....\"). In addition, the business records destroyed by both Miner and McCarthy would also provide evidence relevant to determining pharmacy ownership, the pharmacies' contractual relationships, the services the pharmacies rendered, and correspondence with prescription drug claims processors - necessary elements to determine standing under Section 2528.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal Civ. Code \u00a7 2528.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that since the Section 2527 studies are available, \"[t]here is no\n   need\" to assess destroyed documents that would supply the data that was used to prepare such studies. (Doc. No. 407 at 24). Similarly, Plaintiffs also argue that since there are documents that show Plaintiffs' pharmacy ownership, there is no need for the destroyed documents that also relate to the ownership of the pharmacies. (Doc. No. 407 at 24). The existence of some relevant documents says nothing about the relevance of the destroyed documents, however. Plaintiffs ignore the possibility the destroyed evidence could undermine or contradict Plaintiffs' evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not rebutted the presumption that the destroyed documents are relevant to either the Section 2527 studies at the heart of this case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   or documents relevant to determining Plaintiffs' standing to bring their claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs Have Failed to Rebut the Presumption that Defendants Have Suffered Prejudice.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Defendants are not prejudiced because some of the documents that were destroyed are still available, or Defendants may be able to obtain the same information from other sources. The Court finds these arguments unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   First, Plaintiffs assert they still have possession of some documents that Miner previously indicated had been destroyed, and are withholding them on the basis of their objections, not because the documents no longer exist. (Doc. No. 407 at 10). Miner has submitted a declaration in support of Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendants' Motion, claiming that the \"pre-2007 computer data of which NTN took possession is still kept on the computers at Finley's Rexall Drug\" and has \"not been erased or destroyed.\" (Doc. No. 407-2 at 2-3, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7). Miner's declaration does not state that the surviving electronic documents contain all of the information that was contained in the shredded documents, however. Miner also stated that she still has possession of the historical financial statements of Rocida, Inc., but did not describe what constitutes \"the historical financial statements of Rocida, Inc.,\" and how these documents will make up for the document destruction. (Doc. No. 407-2 at 2-3, \u00b6\u00b6 8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Miner's sparse declaration does\n   not demonstrate that Plaintiffs still have possession of all relevant and potentially relevant documents that were destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have not suffered prejudice because the destroyed documents may still be available from third-party sources. (Doc. No. 407 at 13-14). These assertions are largely speculative. For example, Plaintiffs argue, without support, that some of Mr. Miller's documents that were damaged in the flood and discarded by McCarthy are \"likely still available\" in an electronic format. (Doc. No. 407 at 19). Even if such information were available from third party sources, Plaintiff has not demonstrated how these documents would adequately protect Defendants from the prejudice caused by the entirety of Plaintiffs' document spoliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that Defendants possess some documents that contain the same information as some of the documents that were destroyed by Plaintiffs. (Doc. No. 407 at 9-10, 14). This appears to contradict Plaintiffs' previous statements indicating they had sole possession of documents related to certain Section 2527 fee studies.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , (Doc. No. 399-1 at 89, \u00b6 4; Doc. No. 399-1 at 122, \u00b6 4 (2003 declarations from Miller and Hutchinson stating that the information on which a proper Section 2527 fee study must be based \"is not provided in any way to any of the defendants\" and only available from pharmacists).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs have not rebutted the presumption that Defendants would suffer prejudice. The Court finds that at the very least, Plaintiffs' spoliation would impair Defendants \"ability to go to trial\" by forcing Defendants \"to rely on incomplete and spotty evidence\" in defending against Plaintiffs' claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731058\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/951/#p958\">\n    464 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   959 ;\n   <em>\n    Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v.

The Court finds that lesser sanctions would have no effect on the sustained, deceptive behavior by Plaintiffs' counsel during this litigation. For example, in addition to hiding the spoliation at issue, Plaintiffs' counsel did not inform the Court about their clients' deaths and did not attempt to substitute named plaintiff Miller until after a settlement had been negotiated. Plaintiffs also have been sanctioned repeatedly for other discovery violations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 04-00407 Doc. Nos. 436, 449, 498). That lesser sanctions have already been employed without success is enough\n   to determine that lesser sanctions should not be issued for the violation at issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Davidson v.

It is unlikely that an order directing certain facts be taken as true would be any different from dismissal. An adverse inference jury instruction providing a rebuttable presumption in Defendants' favor would still leave Defendants without remedy if Plaintiffs introduce some evidence that overcomes such a presumption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731058\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/951/#p958\">\n    464 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   960 ;\n   <em>\n    Espejo v.
