ECF No. 31. Defendant, Jack Guemple, filed a Response to the Motion on June 19, 2018. ECF No. 33. In its Motion, Empire moves for default judgment against Defendant, Glenda Pandt-Brown, because she failed to file responsive\n   pleadings in this matter. Mot. at 2. Guemple objects, arguing that a default judgment against Pandt-Brown would be irreconcilable with a meritorious outcome on his claim. Resp. at 2.
