On April 15, 2016, Plaintiffs Silvie Pomicter and Last Chance for Animals (\"Plaintiffs\") filed a verified complaint against Defendants Luzerne Country Convention Center Authority (the \"Authority\") and SMG (\"SMG\" and, together with the Authority, \"Defendants\"), alleging that Defendants' policies and practices violate the First Amendment. Doc. 1. In particular, Plaintiffs seek both declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the Defendants from enforcing their policy of (1) confining all leafletting and protesting activity to barricaded designated areas on the sidewalk outside of the Mohegan Sun Arena (the \"Arena\"), (2) prohibiting use of voice amplification by protestors, and (3) prohibiting use of profanity and vulgarity by protestors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 15, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction. Doc. 2. The Court held an evidentiary hearing on April 25, 2016, and granted Plaintiffs' motion as modified on April 27, 2016. Doc. 19. On November 13, 2017 and December 18, 2017, the Court held a non-jury trial, during which the Court heard testimony from Sylvie Pomicter, Chris DeRose, president of Last Chance for Animals, and Brian Sipe, the general manager of the Arena. In addition, the parties have stipulated that the evidence that was received at the preliminary injunction hearing is part of the trial record. Doc. 42, at 11. Upon review of all testimony and evidence of record in this case, the Court concludes that the Defendants' leafletting restriction, voice amplification ban, and profanity or vulgarity ban, as reflected in the Revised Protest Policy, violate the First Amendment principles set forth by Supreme Court case law. Accordingly, judgment will be entered in favor of the Plaintiffs and against Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Findings of Fact\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Doc. 23 (\"April 25, 2016 Hr'g Tr.\") at 36:25-37:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   16. Patrons attending events at the Arena arrive primarily by car, turn into an access road from Highland Park Boulevard, park in one of the lots outside the Arena, and then proceed on foot to one of the two entrances known as the East and West Gates. Ex. P-7 (\"Pomicter Decl.\"), \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   17. The concrete outside the East and West gates has two distinctive colors, a \"dark\" concrete and a \"light\" concrete. Undisputed Facts \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   18. The total square footage of the concrete in front of the East Gate is 18,746 square feet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   19. The total square footage of the concrete in front of the West Gate is 10,560 square feet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   20. The East Gate is where most of the patrons enter the Arena and where the ticket box office is located. April 25, 2016 Hr'g Tr. at 15:18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   21. The light colored concrete is closest to the entrance of the Arena, approximately 37 feet wide, and identified as the \"entry bridge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:4-8; 49:2-16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. D-C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   22. A sidewalk connects the East and West gates and is approximately 30 feet wide and 321 feet long.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:2-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. D-C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   23. The sidewalk is generally open to the public, although it is primarily used for individuals attending events at the Arena or purchasing tickets to upcoming events.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:5-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   24. The Arena is large enough to hold up to 10,000 people for an event.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:24-39:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Protest Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   25. In 2008, SMG promulgated a protest policy for all events at the Arena (the \"Initial Protest Policy\"). Ex. D-B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   26. Pursuant to Defendants' Initial Protest Policy and practices in place at that time, Plaintiffs were confined to a barricaded designated area in the parking lot outside the East Gate, which prevented them from approaching patrons of the Circus and providing them with literature. April 25, 2016 Hr'g Tr. at 9:11-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   27. In March 2016, prior to the filing of the instant action, Defendants revised the Initial Protest Policy to include two barricaded protest areas located on the \"dark concrete\" outside both the East and West Gates (the \"Revised Protest Policy\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:22-23; 32:1-21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. D-H. The protest areas would be able to be expanded up to 500 to 700 square feet depending on the number of protestors, with an estimated allowance of up to 5 square foot per person.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   28. The Revised Protest Policy states that all protestors \"are to be within the designated area outside [of] the East &amp; West Gate,\" and that \"[h]andouts can only be distributed from within [the] designated area.\" Ex. D-H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   29. The Revised Protest Policy further states that \"[a]ny promotional verbiage suggesting vulgarity or profanity is not permitted\" and \"[u]se of profanity is prohibited.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   30. Finally, the Revised Protest Policy prohibits any use of \"artificial voice amplification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Events Since the Preliminary Injunction Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   31. After a preliminary injunction hearing, the Court issued a preliminary injunction Order on April 27, 2016. Doc. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   32. The Order allowed up to 20 protestors to \"distribute literature on the sidewalk connecting the East and West Gates or on the darker colored concrete outside the East and West Gates at any one time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. In other words, the Court's Order allowed up to 20 protestors to leaflet freely outside the designated areas, so long as they do not \"approach patrons who are standing in line to purchase tickets ... walking through the parking area or vehicle traffic lanes ... [or] within the first six feet of entry onto the darker concrete from the parking lot.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   33. After the Order was issued, Plaintiff Sylvie Pomicter protested outside the Arena on two days in April, 2016 and two days in April, 2017, when the Ringling Bros. circus was performing at the Arena. Trial Tr. at 5:11-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   34. Chris DeRose attended an April 2016 protest with Ms. Pomicter at the Arena.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:6-46:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   35. Ms. Pomicter regularly keeps track of how many protesters attend the events that she organizes, as well as how much literature is distributed at each event. She has done so for her protests for thirty-three years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:4-14; 9:16-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   36. On the two days she protested outside the Arena in 2016, Ms. Pomicter recorded the attendance of 39 protesters in total.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   5:20-24. On the two days she protested outside the Arena in 2017, Ms. Pomicter recorded the attendance of 20 protesters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   6:2-3. To Ms. Pomicter's knowledge, her protestors stayed in the East Gate area of the Arena, not the West Gate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   25:9-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   37. For the protests that Ms. Pomicter attended, the Authority set up barricaded areas for the protestors to stand in outside the East and West Gage entrances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   7:18-23; Ex. D-A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   38. However, consistent with the Court's preliminary injunction Order, the Authority also allowed some protestors, including Ms. Pomicter, to leave the barricaded area and approach patrons with leaflets in 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8:2-11. During the 2016 protests, about 12 protestors distributed literature and talked to patrons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   39. During the protests in 2016, the designated barricaded area at the East Gate was a small, rectangular enclosure constructed from bike racks. The enclosure was set against the edge of the East Gate fence. Protestors inside the barricaded area stood facing patrons in a single line.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   7:18-23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Exs. P-10, P-16, P-17, P-22, P-23 (\"Video Clip Exhibits\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   40. Both Ms. Pomicter and Mr. DeRose testified that the protesters in the barricaded areas drew very little attention from the approaching patrons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9:7-10, 47:7-14, 50:12-21, 51:2-4. They testified that they were \"barely noticed\" by the patrons, that the patrons standing in line near the protestors \"were not even looking over at us,\" and that perhaps \"one or two\" approached the protestors inside the barricaded areas to take leaflets from them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9:7-10; 50:12-21, 51:2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   41. Video clips introduced at trial showed that there were about 20 to 30 feet between the barricaded area and the nearest line of patrons who were waiting in line for ticket sales.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. P-22. There were several lines of patrons for ticket sales in the area, and the line of patrons closest to the barricaded area blocked the view of patrons from other lines from being able to see the protestors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10:16-11:1; 48:16-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   42. During the protests in 2016, Ms. Pomicter observed approximately twelve protestors distributing leaflets outside the barricaded area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8:7-11. Video evidence showed that most, if not all, interactions between leafletting protestors and patrons were friendly and non-confrontational, including a family with a little girl who smiled while taking leaflets from Ms. Pomicter.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   Exs. P-10, P-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   43. However, there was video evidence that showed one patron who saw the literature that a protestor was distributing and raised his middle finger to the protestor; the protestor withdrew his leaflet and the patron walked on without incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. P-16; Trial Tr. 14:19-22. The gesture did not prompt any reaction from protestors or other patrons. Both Ms. Pomicter and Mr. DeRose testified that they do not typically confront such persons. Trial Tr. 14:12-25; 15:10-17; 51:14-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   44. During the 2016 protests, one of Ms. Pomicter's protestors had a T-shirt that contained profanity (specifically, the \"F\" word). Mr. Sipe, who was present at the protest, brought the issue to Ms. Pomicter's attention, and Ms. Pomicter in turn asked the protestor to zip up her jacket so as to cover up the word. The protestor did so; and she was allowed to continue to engage in protest activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   23:6-24:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   45. In the year prior to the Court's preliminary injunction order, Ms. Pomicter estimated that her protestors were able to hand out 30 leaflets from inside the barricaded area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9:23-10:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   46. In 2016, after some protestors were allowed to leaflet outside the barricaded area, Ms. Pomicter estimated that her protestors were able to hand out 780 leaflets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9:11-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   47. In April, 2016 and October, 2016, then-Presidential candidate Donald Trump held rallies at the Arena.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   87:24-88:12. At those rallies, secret service personnel determined the protest policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   88:15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Brian Sipe testified that he believed the secret service's directions preempted the Court's preliminary injunction Order on issues of crowd control.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   101:15-102:8. At the October 2016 rally, Mr. Sipe believed that approximately four anti-Trump protestors showed up at the event; they were directed to stay in a grassy area at the Arena.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   48. The Authority contends that the designated areas for protestors serve to prevent crowd congestion, prevent patrons from \"hav[ing] to interact with [protestors],\" manage \"security risk\" arising from potential confrontations between patrons and protestors, and prevent loss of revenue and goodwill from patrons who \"do not want to be subjected to one on one interaction with or risk confrontation with protestors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   72:22-73:5; 74:16-22; Doc. 46 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   49. With respect to additional security costs, Mr. Sipe testified that if the Authority anticipated protestors at an event, it would hire an estimated four additional security guards for the Arena, amounting to an estimated cost of $648 per event.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   82:20-24; 93:14-21, Ex. D-R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   50. For the Plaintiffs' protests, the Arena hired three additional security personnel for each event.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   51. Mr. Sipe testified that no patron has complained to him about any interactions with protestors, nor is he aware of any complaints to the Arena about protestors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   90:16-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   52. The Arena retains the authority to ban weapons, body armor, open flames, fighting, inciting violence, and making threats.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   94:5-95:11. The Arena has security guards and two law enforcement officers from Wilkes-Barre Township Police present at all events. If a fight were to occur, the police officers would be able to take necessary legal action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   53. The Authority has only designated the sidewalk for expressive activity during events; the area is not designated for expressive activity during non-event times.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   95:12-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   54. When asked about the treatment of counter protestors, Mr. Sipe testified that both protestors and counter protestors would be confined to the same barricaded area, though the area would be expanded as necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   96:12-24. Mr. Sipe stated this would allow \"[l]aw enforcement [to] have an easier time controlling that controlled atmosphere, and also our patrons would not have to walk through people back and forth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Conclusions of Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   1.

As it turned out, Mr. Sipe's estimates were overinflated. In preparing for Ms. Pomicter's protests, the Authority saw the need to hire only three additional security personnel. Doc. 52 at 93:14-21.

Furthermore, the Authority's reservations regarding crowd control are undermined by video evidence introduced at trial, which clearly shows that the expansive Arena entrances are wide enough to accommodate leafletters without confining them to a narrowly barricaded area along the edge of the Arena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   31. As the Supreme Court has instructed, the reasonableness inquiry \"must be assessed in light of the purpose of the forum and all the surrounding circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    ISKCON v.

Both the East Gate and West Gate are over 10,000 square feet in area; and they are connected by a long sidewalk of over 300 feet in length. The videos in this case were taken from the East Gate. They show that some patrons were looking at leafletters from afar, some approached the leafletters, and some walked at a distance from the leafletters.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. P-10, P-23. None of the videos shows that cumbersome congregation of people formed due to open leafletting. Thus, by its sheer width and design, the Arena's sidewalk grounds would be more than able to accommodate peaceful leafletting even if the leafletters were not barricaded along the edge of the Arena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   32. Taking into account the undisputed facts of the sidewalk space available at the Arena, as well as the video evidence of the Plaintiffs' open leafletting activity, the Court finds that allowing leafletters outside of the barricaded area would not cause additional congestion.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diener\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11359886\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/232/362/#p386\">\n    232 F.Supp.2d at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (allowing leafletting activity \"given the physical\n   characteristics of the museum grounds ...

Additionally, the Arena is large enough to hold up to 10,000 people for an event. April 25, 2016 Hr'g Tr. at 38:24-39:1. \"A large majority of the audience arrives within an hour\" of popular events' start time, and most of them exit \"immediately after the event.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   39:4-8.

Tr. at 14:18-22 (Plaintiffs' counsel confirming that they are not challenging the Authority's power to prohibit anyone from interfering with ingress or egress, blocking access to the Arena, harassing patrons, or approaching patrons who are standing in lines).

Veering away from concrete evidence, the Authority speculates that extreme political groups may descend upon the Arena in the future, such as \"white nationalist group[s] or the KKK ... [or] Antifa ... any of those groups, again, especially, if we had the President or any elected official coming to the venue, that could be quite an issue for us.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   75:22-76:7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 46, Defendant Trial Brief at 29 (arguing that \"if the Ku Klux Klan, the Neo-Nazis, the Antifa, or any other group wants to use this sidewalk for protest ... they would have the same rights as the animal protestors in this case.\") But such speculation strains credulity when the Authority has no record of any violent or unruly protests in the past. Mr. Sipe, the Arena's general manager, testified that he has never had any complaints from patrons regarding protestors. Trial Tr. at 90:16-22. Moreover, the Authority retains its power to use ordinary methods of crowd control and to ensure peaceful conduct.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   35. Mr. Sipe further testified that there had only been a handful protests in the past decade: Ms. Pomicter's animal rights protests and two Trump rallies in 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87:25-88:1. During the Trump rally in October, a total of four protestors showed up.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102:6-8. In fact, Mr. Sipe testified that other than Ms. Pomicter's protests and Trump rallies, there had only been one other protest at the Arena-an appearance by President George W. Bush in 2004.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92:9-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   36. Furthermore, if such controversial groups\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   to protest at the Arena, they may likely draw counter-protestors. Mr. Sipe testified that in such a case, both protestors and counter protestors would be confined to the same area, though the area would be expanded as necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96:12-24. If a concern for security risk motivated the protest policies, then the Authority's restriction of all protestors and counter protestors to the same area makes little sense, as the scenario would likely invite discord between the opposing groups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   37. Thus, the Authority's concerns regarding the likelihood of violent protests by extreme political groups are speculative and unsupported by any evidence or logic.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cornelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p799\">\n    473 U.S. at 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p799\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that \"the record amply supports an inference that respondents' participation ... jeopardized the success\" of a charitable fund-raising drive, when the drive received \"approximately 1,450 telephone calls complaining about the inclusion of [protestors]\" and there existed evidence of \"significant declines in the amount of contributions.\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As for its articulated purpose of maximizing revenue and avoiding loss of patrons, the Authority introduced evidence that it would incur an additional $648 in costs for every four security guards it hires for each event. Ex. D-R. While the Authority hosts around 125 events each year, Doc. 52, at 83:6-7, Mr. Sipe testified that there had only been a handful of protests in the last two years: Ms. Pomicter's animal rights protests, and the Trump rallies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87:25-88:1. For the former, the Arena hired three additional security personnel for the protests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93:14-21. As to the latter, the Authority incurred no additional expense, since the secret service provided security for the events.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101:15-102:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   39. Thus, common sense would not dictate that the Authority would bear significant additional costs if leafletters are allowed beyond barricaded areas, since the Authority would not anticipate protests at most of the Authority's events, which are sporting events or family events.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   66:1-8. In any case, the Authority always hires security and two law enforcement officers for each event, even if the protestors were confined to the barricaded area.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 75:13-15 (\"We do have Wilkes-Barre Township Police present at all our events outside the gates.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 94:24-95:2 (\"Q. What happens when someone fights in front of the Arena? A. We have security outside, we also have two law enforcement officers from Wilkes-Barre Township Police.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   40. The question is whether there would be any\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   costs to the Authority if it allowed protestors to leaflet freely rather than confining them to the barricaded areas. If truly controversial and divisive groups chose to protest at the Arena, the Authority would presumably incur high security costs even if the protestors were confined to a barricaded area, particularly if counter-protestors were confined to the same designated area. In other words, common sense inferences do not \"provide a way of tying the limitation on speech to the forum's purpose\" in this case.\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055563\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/435/#p441\">\n    834 F.3d at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   41. As\n   <em>\n    ISKCON v. Lee\n   </em>\n   instructs, a restriction on First Amendment rights will still be struck down if \"the record contains no information from which we can draw an inference that would support its ban.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480771\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/672/#p687\">\n    505 U.S. at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20S.%20Ct.%202711\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No such inferences may be drawn from the record before the Court. The most illuminating information in the record, i.e. the video evidence of actual protests at the Arena, shows that Plaintiffs leafletted openly and peacefully at their 2016 protest,\n   and did not cause any issues or problems for the Arena. Exs. P-10, P-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   42. On the other side of the balance, the restriction severely curtails protestors' First Amendment rights. Both Ms. Pomicter and Mr. DeRose testified that they were \"barely noticed\" by the patrons, that the patrons standing in line near the protestors \"were not even looking over at [them],\" and that perhaps \"one or two\" approached the protestors inside the barricaded areas to take leaflets from them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9:7-10; 50:12-21, 51:2-4. The video evidence also shows that protestors behind the barricades were largely ignored by patrons or blocked from view.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. P-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   43. Thus, the record does not suggest that the leafletting restriction is a reasonable way to curtail congestion or prevent loss of revenue. Nor can the Court find that common sense would raise such an inference. The leafletting restriction imposed by the Authority, which sequesters leafletters to barricaded areas along the edges of the Arena, unreasonably impinges on Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    The Voice Amplification Ban\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   44. The Revised Protest Policy also states that \"[n]o artificial voice amplification is permitted.\" Ex. D-H. Generally, \"amplified speech, such as through the use of bullhorns, is protected expression.\"\n   <em>\n    Startzell v. City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039289\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/183/\">\n    533 F.3d 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199 n. 10 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing\n   <em>\n    Stokes v.

In\n   <em>\n    Startzell\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit held that the \"police had ample justification to direct Appellants to move when they interfered with the permitted event's activities by expressing their message with loud bullhorns right next to the main stage where musical performances were held, directly confronting a transgendered individual, and blocking access to the vendors who had applied for booths at OutFest.\"\n   <em>\n    Startzell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039289\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/183/\">\n    533 F.3d 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199 (3d Cir. 2008)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   46.\n   <em>\n    Startzell\n   </em>\n   concerned a traditional public forum, therefore the government's restrictions would have been subject to even higher scrutiny than it would be in this case, which concerns a nonpublic forum.

At trial, Mr. Sipe testified that the voice amplification ban is necessary to protect vendors at the Arena, who \"sometimes\" sell merchandise outside; he opined that \"any voice amplification that would be\n   louder than [the vendors'] would, obviously, inhibit that sale,\" and that if the protestors' amplification was \"loud enough,\" it could \"interfere with what's going on inside the venue.\" Doc. 52, at 64:23-65:2.

The evidence introduced at trial does not show any such vendors on site during Ms. Pomicter's protests, the Court is thus without concrete evidence as to whether the area of the Arena sidewalk may accommodate both protestors and vendors' voice amplifications without mutual interference. Ms. Pomicter, however, testified at trial that during the seven years that she has protested at the Arena, she had \"only seen the Ringling Circus, maybe once, maybe twice, come out and try to sell their wares ... so it's very seldom.\" Doc. 52, at 33:3-6. She further testified that if there had been vendors during her protests, she would \"hold off using our amplification for the 15 minutes they're there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:1-2.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg.

In its current state, the Revised Protest Policy includes a wholesale ban on all \"artificial voice amplification\" for First Amendment activity. Ex. D-H. Given the broad and encompassing area of the Arena sidewalk and the seldom usage of voice amplification by the vendors, the Court finds such a sweeping ban on noise amplification to be unreasonable. The only evidence that the Authority has offered to justify the ban is that protestors' use of noise amplification\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   interfere with Arena announcements or sales merchants' use of noise amplification. Doc. 52, at 64:23-65:2.

The Policies do not otherwise define \"vulgarity\" or \"profanity,\" nor did the Arena offer a concrete definition at trial, though Mr. Sipe implicitly equated profanity with \"cursing or any type of foul language\"; he also opined that public nudity would be \"vulgar\" under the Revised Proposed Policy.

The Authority has prohibited \"any promotional verbiage suggesting vulgarity or profanity\" and any \"use of profanity,\" without defining either term or providing any examples.

There is no doubt that the ban is at least content-based, as it prohibits a specific type of speech-this is so despite the fact that the ban would apply to any speaker who uttered vulgar or profane speech. \"[A] speech regulation targeted at specific subject matter is content based even if it does not discriminate among viewpoints within that subject matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

Though the parties do not argue the point, the ban likely constitutes viewpoint discrimination as well. The Supreme Court recently held that the disparagement clause of the Lanham Act, which prohibited trademarks that might disparage \"every person living or dead as well as every institution,\" was \"far too broad\" and constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Matal v.

In fact, the Court said that a purported interest in \"preventing speech expressing ideas that offend ... strikes at the heart of the First Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604763\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1744/#p1765\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604763\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1744/#p1765\">\n    at 1764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the issue of viewpoint discrimination, the Court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   Our cases use the term \"viewpoint\" discrimination in a broad sense, and in that sense, the disparagement clause discriminates on the bases of \"viewpoint.\" To be sure, the clause evenhandedly prohibits disparagement of all groups ...

But in the sense relevant here, that is viewpoint discrimination:\n   <em>\n    Giving offense is a viewpoint.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604763\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1744/#p1765\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604763\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1744/#p1765\">\n    at 1763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   57. But the Court need not reach the question of whether the profanity and vulgarity ban constitutes viewpoint discrimination as well as content-based restriction. In light of recent Third Circuit and Supreme Court guidance on the need to tolerate even offensive or disagreeable speech, the Court finds the vulgarity and profanity ban to be overbroad. Far-reaching censorship like this one, even if it arises from good-faith motives, is at risk of selective enforcement, \"as future government officials may one day wield such statutes to suppress disfavored speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2230\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   58. In\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit found that a selective ban of offensive messages in certain mediums-while allowing other mediums to post the same type of messages-was unreasonable even in a nonpublic forum. Specifically, the Court held that an airport cannot restrict advertising in order to keep \"travelers from seeing potentially offensive noncommercial content,\" especially when it allowed television broadcasting shows and newsstands to display \"the very types of non-commercial information that the City seeks to exclude from its advertising space.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055563\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/435/#p441\">\n    834 F.3d at 446-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In so holding, the Court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   [T]here is little logic to the inference the City asks us to draw. Although we have no reason to doubt that the City does try to maintain a 'soothing and pleasing' environment in the Airport, that broader\n   effort apparently does not involve shielding travelers from noncommercial content on the ground that it might offend them.

The Arena hosts many forms of entertainment events. Common sense would dictate that profanity would as likely to arise from rival team fans at a sporting event as from animal rights protestors. If the Authority is prepared to ban all permitted guests for using profanity at all events, including fans at sporting events, it may do so by implementing an Arena-wide policy that applies to patrons and protestors alike. However, on its face, the Revised Protest Policy only applies to protestors wishing to express their views at the Arena. Ex. D-H. There is no evidence of an analogous ban that applies to patrons or other permitted guests of the Arena. Thus, based on the record adduced at trial, the Revised Protest Policy unreasonably singles out First Amendment activity by imposing a blanket voice amplification ban on protestors alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   60.

D-H (\"All persons are welcome to express their views at the Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza.\") Furthermore, the record in\n   <em>\n    Eichenlaub\n   </em>\n   contained concrete evidence of the speaker's disruptiveness while he attempted to speak about \"matters of private concern,\" a topic that had never been permitted at the township meetings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319318\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/274/#p281\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   65. By contrast, the record in this case does not contain evidence of profanity or vulgarity causing disruptiveness or physical violence. When one of Ms. Pomicter's protestors wore a shirt with a profane word on it, Mr. Sipe alerted Ms. Pomicter to the fact and the protestor promptly zipped up her jacket such that the word was no longer showing. Trial Tr. at 66:19-24. Ms. Pomicter testified that it was \"the first time\" she's encountered such a problem.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:13-14. Furthermore, both Ms. Pomicter and Mr. DeRose said that they do not use profanity while protesting, finding it \"counterproductive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   14:5-8; 55:4-14. Finally, some of the video evidence shows one patron making an obscene gesture toward a protestor (raising the middle finger), but he was ignored by other patrons and the protestors, creating no issue for the Arena security at all.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   14:19-22; Ex. P-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   66. To bolster support for the vulgarity ban, Mr. Sipe speculates that other instances of vulgarity could occur at the Arena, offering the example of an animal rights protestor who was only covered in body paint at a protest in Downtown Wilkes-Barre.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   66:19-24. However, this is conjecture on Mr. Sipe's part. The people who actually have protested at the Arena in the last few years testified that they do not use profanity at protests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:5-8, 55:4-14. There is no evidence on the record that profanity or vulgarity is an existing problem of the Arena's protests in need of remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   67. The non-speculative evidence presented on this issue included only a profane word printed on a protestor's T-shirt and a patron's usage of a rude hand gesture. There is no reason to conclude that either expression were likely to have prompted violence from protestors or patrons of the Arena. These two incidents can hardly qualify as \"fighting words\" undeserving of First Amendment protection. It is reasonable to infer from the record that these past incidents would be the best\n   indicator of what the Authority may expect for future protests. Without more concrete evidence, the Arena cannot justify its broad ban based on speculation of violence that may be incited by profanity. Again, because Plaintiffs are bringing a facial challenge to the Revised Protest Policy (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Oral Arg. Tr., at 16:1-3), the Revised Protest Policy's prohibition of vulgarity and profanity, as it is currently written, impermissibly restricts protestors' First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs. A separate Order of Judgment follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    The Court notes that the Authority retains its power to use ordinary methods of crowd control, including the power to order a large congregation of people to disperse in order to facilitate pedestrian flow; prohibit people from blocking access points or harassing patrons standing in line; prohibit violence or weapons; or alert the police as to fighting or unwanted trespass. Such ordinary crowd control measures, which are applied to patrons and protestors alike, remain available to the Authority and are not affected by the content of this Court's ruling.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    Because the corresponding Pennsylvania constitutional provision \"provides protection for freedom of expression that is broader than the federal constitutional guarantee,\" the restriction is equally unreasonable under Pennsylvania law.\n    <em>\n     Pap's A.M. v.
