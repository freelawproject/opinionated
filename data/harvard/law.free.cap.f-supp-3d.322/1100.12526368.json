ECF No. 136. The parties agree that bifurcation should occur, but disagree as to the scope. After considering the parties' arguments through briefing and a hearing that occurred on July 24, 2018, for the reasons below, I GRANT the Motion in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff initiated this case as a civil enforcement action under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They also agree that this case should be bifurcated, but disagree on when certain issues should be presented in the case and on the scope of discovery pursuant to bifurcation. ECF No. 145 at 1; ECF No. 150 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Concerning substantive issues in trial, the parties mainly disagree on whether the claim for punitive damages should be presented in the first or second phase of the trial. ECF No. 145 at 8; ECF No. 150 at 8. The issues on discovery include: (1) whether discovery for the first phase of the trial should be limited only to discovery that is already completed; (2) whether expert discovery should be limited to only that regarding the aggrieved individuals testifying in the first phase of the trial; and (3) whether Plaintiff must abide by the current deadline for expert witness disclosures. ECF No. 145 at 5-6; ECF No. 150 at 3-7. Related to this last discovery issue, after filing the current Motion, Plaintiff filed a motion to amend the scheduling order to extend the deadline for expert disclosures.

Non-contested issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   There are two non-discovery related issues-besides the issue of bifurcation itself-that appear uncontested. First, Defendant \"opposes any request by the EEOC to include its fourth cause of action for retaliation in Phase I.\" ECF No. 145 at 9. To this, Plaintiff states that there is \"no disagreement that the retaliation claim should not be included in the Phase I trial because it is not alleged as a pattern or practice and depends on individual-specific facts.\" ECF No. 150 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Next, in its purposed bifurcation approach, Plaintiff states that \"it may be appropriate for the Phase I jury to decide the EEOC's third claim alleging discriminatory standards, criteria, or methods of administration.\" ECF No. 136 at 4. As noted in Plaintiff's Reply, Defendant does not dispute this suggestion. ECF No. 150 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   ORDERED that the trial of this case shall be bifurcated into two phases as follows. During Phase I of the trial, the EEOC shall have the burden to demonstrate that Defendant has a pattern or practice of unlawful discrimination, and if so, whether the alleged pattern or practice of discrimination was done with malice or reckless disregard for the federally-protected rights of employees with disabilities. If it is found that the alleged pattern or practice of discrimination was done with malice or reckless disregard for the federally-protected rights of employees with disabilities, an advisory amount of punitive damages shall be awarded. In Phase I, it will also be decided whether Defendant's policies were a standard, criteria, or were administered in a manner that has the effect of discrimination on the basis of disability. Phase I shall be tried to a jury, with the Court determining whether it is\n   appropriate to order any prospective relief based upon the jury's finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   During Phase II, a new jury (or juries) will decide all individual claims and resultant damages, including claims of retaliation. If the Phase I jury finds that Defendant engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination, there will be a presumption that any adverse actions regarding the individual claimants were part of the pattern or practice of discrimination. If the Phase I jury does not find that Defendant engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination, individual claimants will not be afforded the presumption. After the Phase II trial (or trials) occur, the court will allocate and adjust the damages awarded to the aggrieved individuals, including any punitive damages awarded in Phase I, pursuant to statutory limits.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
