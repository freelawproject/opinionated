Blake, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiffs, Healthy Teen Network and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (\"Baltimore City\") have sued the defendants, Alex M. Azar II, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Health and Human Services itself, (collectively \"HHS\"), claiming that the defendants' decision to end their grant award under the Teen Pregnancy Prevention, (\"TPP\"), program early is contrary to the agency's regulations and arbitrary and capricious. Healthy Teen Network and Baltimore City now move for a preliminary or permanent injunction. HHS opposes the motion, and has cross moved for dismissal for failure to state a claim or for summary judgment. Because both parties agree that there are no disputed issues of fact, and that the plaintiffs' case presents pure issues of law, the plaintiffs' motion will be treated as a motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the\n   reasons stated below, the plaintiffs will be granted summary judgment and the defendants' motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Regulatory Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although administered through the Office of Adolescent Health in HHS, (Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 27, Ex. B, p. 3), the TPP program is a creature of Congress. For the first time in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010, Congress directed that of the funding appropriated to HHS:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   $110,000,000 shall be for making competitive contracts and grants to public and private entities to fund medically accurate and age appropriate programs that reduce teen pregnancy and for the Federal costs associated with administering and evaluating such contracts and grants, of which not less than $75,000,000 shall be for replicating programs that have been proven effective through rigorous evaluation to reduce teenage pregnancy, behavioral risk factors underlying teenage pregnancy, or other associated risk factors, of which not less than $25,000,000 shall be available for research and demonstration grants to develop, replicate, refine, and test additional models and innovative strategies for preventing teenage pregnancy, and of which any remaining amounts shall be available for training and technical assistance, evaluation, outreach, and additional program support activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-117,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20Stat.%203034\">\n    123 Stat. 3034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The program has been renewed in every appropriations act since, including the 2018 Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%20348\">\n    132 Stat. 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a result of this funding, HHS announced two funding opportunities-labelled Tier 1 and Tier 2-in April 2010. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 23). Tier 1 grants were to be awarded to tried and true program models that had already shown promise in reducing teen pregnancy and delaying sexual activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Tier 2 grants were to break ground, and fund new research and programs for reducing teenage pregnancy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Five years later, HHS expanded its funding opportunities, this time adding Tier 1B and 2B grants. Tier 1B grants were awarded to \"replicate evidence-based TPP programs to scale in communities with the greatest need.\" (Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 27, Ex. B, p. 3). And Tier 2B grants were designed to test \"new or innovative approaches to prevent teen pregnancy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). These two grants provided funding to Baltimore City and Healthy Teen Network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To support what HHS anticipated would be \"substantial programmatic involvement ... between OAH and the grantee during performance of the project,\" (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 34), Tier 1B and Tier 2B awards were distributed over two periods. The first is called the budget period, and refers to the funding successful applicants were guaranteed for one fiscal year. (Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 27, Ex. B, I-34). The second is called the project period-the amount of funding successful applicants could expect over the course of a five year project plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Successful applicants were not guaranteed funding for the entire project period, but were required to submit a non-competing continuation application-which had to include a \"progress report for the current budget year, and work plan, budget and\n   budget justification for the upcoming year\"-for each of the four budget periods, after the initial award year, during the project period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Each award required grantees to \"comply with all terms and conditions outlined in their grant awards,\" and with HHS's Grants Policy Statement. (Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 27, City of Baltimore 2015-16 Notice of Award, Ex. A at 68).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Grants Policy Statement is important for two reasons. First, the Statement warned that funding over the course of a project period is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   contingent on satisfactory progress, the availability of funds, and the continued best interests of the Federal government. They are not guarantees that the project or program will be funded or will be funded at those levels, and they create no legal obligation to provide funding beyond the ending date of the current budget period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Defs.' Mot. ECF No. 27, Grants Policy Statement, U.S. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs., Ex. B at I-34). The Statement further warns that HHS may decide not to \"make a non-competing continuation award\" because (1) \"[a]dequate Federal funds are not available to support the project;\" (2) \"[a] recipient failed to show satisfactory progress in achieving the objectives of the project;\" (3) \"[a] recipient failed to meet the terms and conditions of a previous award;\" or (4) \"[f]or whatever reason, continued funding would not be in the best interests of the Federal government.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at II-89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Grant termination is the last piece of this case's regulatory puzzle. HHS regulations define \"termination\" as \"the ending of a Federal award, in whole or in part at any time prior to the planned end of period of performance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2075.2\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And \"period of performance\" is its own term of art, referring to the \"time during which the non-Federal entity may incur new obligations to carry out the work authorized under the Federal award.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2075.2\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   HHS may only terminate a grant award if: (1) the grantee failed \"to comply with the terms and conditions of the award;\" (2) \"for cause;\" (3) \"with the consent\" of the grantee; or (4) if the grantee requests termination and provides written notification of the reasons for such termination.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2075.372\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Healthy Teen Network and Baltimore City both were awarded funding under the TPP program in 2015 for five-year project periods ending in 2020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Baltimore City\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 29, 2015, Baltimore City was awarded an $8.745 million grant over a five year project period, with $1.749 million anticipated for each budget period. (Pls.' Mot., ECF No. 18, Ex. 2, \u00b6 9). The award noted that Baltimore City was guaranteed funding for the first year (the budget period) of the project period, and that projected future funding (over the project period) was \"subject to the availability of funds and satisfactory progress of the project.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After submitting non-competing applications, Baltimore City was granted funding through year two of the project period. On July 3, 2017, however, Baltimore City received a notice of award for the third budget period, which explained the award and warned that \"this award also shortens the project period to end on June 30, 2018,\" two years earlier than was projected when Baltimore City won funding in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24). The notice did not\n   explain HHS's decision to cut the project period short, although Baltimore City is sure that it \"complied with all program requirements throughout the grant,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and HHS has not stated otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Baltimore City appealed the termination of the grant in August of 2017 without response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25). Indeed, HHS still has not provided Baltimore City with any specific reason for its decision to end the City's project period by two years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Healthy Teen Network\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 1, 2015, Healthy Teen Network was awarded $3.6 million in funding over a five year project period, with $723,000 anticipated for each one year budget period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pls.' Mot., ECF No. 18, Ex. 3, \u00b6 3). As was true for Baltimore City's award, notice of Healthy Teen Network's award warned that the project period merely represents \"recommended future support ... subject to the availability of funds and satisfactory progress of the project.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10). Also like Baltimore City, Healthy Teen Network successfully submitted non-competing continuation applications for the next two years of the project period. On July 6, 2017, along with its award for year three of the project period, however, Healthy Teen Network was notified that its project period would be cut short by two years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). HHS's decision was unexplained, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15), and Healthy Teen Network alleges that in August 2017 it was advised by an HHS employee that there was no use in appealing the agency's decision, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After ending Baltimore City's and Healthy Teen Network's project periods early, HHS later provided two public explanations for its decision. It claimed: (1) \"that there was strong evidence of negative impact or no impact by the funded projects;\" and (2) that because the President's proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2018 eliminated funding for the TPP program, HHS anticipated it would lack funding for the projects and terminated them early. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 107-08). Healthy Teen Network and Baltimore City contend that these explanations are merely pretense undercut by HHS's longstanding praise for their work, which persisted even after their funding was terminated, (Pls.' Mot., ECF No. 18, Ex. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 26); by the Tier 1B grants themselves, which were only awarded to programs that had demonstrated positive results in reducing teen pregnancy; and by the fact that, despite what the President's budget might have suggested, only Congress possesses the power to eliminate funding for the TPP program, (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 107-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiffs sued HHS on February 15, 2018, and subsequently moved for a preliminary or permanent injunction. HHS cross-moved for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) or for summary judgment under Rule 56. The court heard oral argument on the motions on April 19, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) provides that summary judgment should be granted \"if the movant shows that there is no\n   <em>\n    genuine\n   </em>\n   dispute as to any\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

But even if the court were to consider HHS's arguments, at best, their extra-textual materials are ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Ignoring the fact that nowhere do the regulations suggest that the budget period is the period of performance, HHS argues that the \"budget period\" makes more sense as the \"period of performance\" because it represents guaranteed funding, whereas the \"project period\" provides merely an expectation of future funding. HHS insists that there can be no obligation of funds that have not yet been awarded. But there can be obligations\n   <em>\n    contingent\n   </em>\n   on future funding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, one of the purposes of a five-year period of performance is to give the grantee organization\n   some assurance that, so long as Congress continues to provide funding and they comply with the terms of their grant, they can plan for the necessary staff and facilities to carry out the grant's purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Nevertheless, HHS argues that its Grants Policy Statement supports its view that the budget period makes more sense as the period of performance by stating that: \"the amount of Federal funds authorized for obligation and any future-year commitments, is issued for each budget period in the approved project period.\" (Defs.' Opp., Ex. B, HHS Grant Policy Statement, I-33). Thus, in the agency's view, a grantee can only incur obligations during the budget period and as a result that is the period of performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   But the Grants Policy Statement is merely a guidance document, and, even if it says what HHS believes it says, does not control over the agency's regulations. Putting that aside, the very next sentence after the part of the Statement quoted by the agency seems to contemplate grantees obligating funds even before their budget period: \"until an awarding office has issued a [Notice of Award] for the initial budget period, any costs incurred by the applicant for the project are incurred at its own risk.\" And the document defines \"obligations\" much the same way HHS's regulations do: \"[t]he amounts of orders placed, contract and subawards, goods and services received, and similar transactions by a recipient during a budget period that will require payment during the same or a\n   <em>\n    future budget period.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at B-7) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, at best, the Grants Policy Statement provides equivocal support for the government's position. And indeed it may be evidence that a \"project period\" is the \"period of performance\" because its definition of \"obligations\" contemplates payment beyond the one-year budget period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Next, the agency argues that the court's interpretation would violate the Anti-Deficiency Act. The Act prohibits \"[a]n officer or employee of the United States Government\" from \"mak[ing] or authoriz[ing] an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation or fund for the expenditure or obligation\" or from \"involv[ing] [the] government in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made unless authorized by law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A)-(B). Thus, the Act bars federal employees from obligating funds \"for future payment of money in advance of, or in excess of, an existing appropriation.\"\n   <em>\n    Hercules Inc. v.

There is no reason to think it would.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Reading \"period of performance\" as including at least the \"project period,\" as the text clearly commands, means only that the grantee could obligate funding projected in its project period, and not that HHS would be required to provide that funding. Indeed, as the Grants Policy Statement puts it, such obligations would be done at the grantee's own risk-it may or may not receive funding to cover the obligation, but the obligation itself does not affect the discretionary nature of HHS's funding decisions under the TPP program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Ending on a practical note, HHS insists that \"termination\" is not one of a number of ordinary functions carried out during a grant funding program but rather best considered as a sanction, used only in limited circumstances such as where the agency fails to comply with the conditions of its award. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Transcript of Oral Argument, pp. 35-36). Treating project periods as the \"period of performance\" runs counter to long running agency practice, according to HHS, and would threaten the use of project periods-which no one doubts provides a helpful framework for awarding funds-across all grant awarding agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At base, the agency would have the court ask, \"Notwithstanding the clear text of its regulations, does the plaintiffs' interpretation make sense as a practical matter?\" But the court may not ignore clear text based on past agency practice or prudential considerations,\n   <em>\n    N.L.R.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609970\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/929/#p941\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 941-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and in any event the record as to past practice has not been definitively explored. It may be the case that considering the \"project period\" as the \"period of performance\" is impractical. It may also be the case that the agency has never treated a project period as the period of performance. Or it may be the case that the agency has never terminated a grant prior to the end of its project period where there were no grounds to do so. In any event, unlawful action does not necessarily become lawful by virtue of a long period of unchallenged practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On the merits of HHS's counter argument, nothing about the court's ruling would permanently affect the project period system of awarding grants. HHS remains free to amend its regulations to make the period of performance the budget period rather than the project period, and thus line up its governing regulations with what it claims to be ordinary practice. What it cannot do, however, is act as if its regulations say something other than what they say. The period of performance includes the project period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Thus, the agency's decision to end Baltimore City's and Healthy Teen Network's project periods constituted a termination. HHS was therefore required to comply with at least one of the four conditions for termination: (1) the grantee failed \"to comply with the terms and conditions of the award;\" (2) \"for cause;\" (3) \"with the consent\" of the grantee; or (4) if the grantee requests termination and provides written notification of the reasons for such termination.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2075.372\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(4). Because it is undisputed that none of these four conditions was met, HHS's action was unlawful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the plaintiffs' motion\n   for a permanent injunction will be granted. The agency's decision will be vacated, and the agency will be ordered to process the plaintiffs' non-compete continuation awards consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   II. Arbitrary and Capricious Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Even if HHS's decision to end Baltimore City's and Healthy Teen Network's grants was not a termination, the plaintiffs claim the decision was still arbitrary and capricious and thus unlawful. Because (1) HHS's decision to end the plaintiffs' project periods early is reviewable; (2)\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalizations cannot cure a decision unreasoned at the time it was made; and (3) the agency failed to consider relevant factors when making its decision, the plaintiffs are granted summary judgment as to this claim as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As a threshold matter, HHS argues that its decision to recompete Baltimore City's and Healthy Teen Network's funding is a decision committed to agency discretion by law because the appropriations acts that have funded the TPP program delegate broad discretion to HHS to determine how best to spend the money. But the relevant congressional act does impose restrictions on how HHS may distribute TPP funding, and the court has manageable standards to ensure that it acts accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The APA provides that \"[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But no such review is available if the \"agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\" 5 U.S.C \u00a7 701(a)(2).

HHS is correct, to an extent. Congress's appropriation for the TPP program comes with few restrictions, pregnancy prevention is an issue squarely within HHS's expertise, and how to accomplish that object eludes judicially manageable standards. Yet, the government's argument sweeps too broadly, and misses the subtlety of the plaintiffs' challenge. Baltimore City and Healthy Teen Network challenge HHS's decision to end their project periods as arbitrary and capricious because the agency failed to provide reasons for its decision, and in doing so asks not for the court to weigh in on the worthiness of the organizations HHS selected and rejected for funding, but whether HHS acted within permissible congressional bounds when doing so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The appropriations act for the TPP program required that HHS use the appropriation to (1) \"fund medically accurate and age appropriate programs that reduce teen pregnancy;\" (2) to \"replicat[e] programs that have been proven effective through rigorous evaluation to reduce teenage pregnancy, behavioral risk factors underlying teenage pregnancy, or other associated risk factors;\" and (3) \"to develop, replicate, refine, and test additional models and innovative strategies for preventing teenage pregnancy.\" Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, Pub.

Thus, the appropriation was not an unrestricted sum of money to use for any purpose that might fall within HHS's broad mandate, but rather directs the agency to use the funds to support proven or innovative medically accurate methods of preventing teenage pregnancy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   HHS has not shown that it considered any of these congressionally prescribed factors when making its decision to end the plaintiffs' program periods early, as it did not provide any contemporaneous reasons for its decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the court may not \"supply a reasoned basis for the agency's action that the agency itself has not given.\"\n   <em>\n    N.C.

Here no such reasoned analysis was provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Sidestepping its obligation to provide reasoned decisionmaking, HHS argues that its discretion over the project periods is so broad that it did not have to provide any reason at all for ending the plaintiffs' project periods early. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Transcript of Oral Argument, p. 37-40). But even if that were not true, HHS insists, it did in fact give reasons for its decision, specifically that the programs funded were not performing as HHS expected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   To begin, both parties concede that HHS eventually offered public reasons for ending TPP grants early, and HHS asserts that those reasons are good reasons. They may be, but that is beside the point, because an agency may not justify an action through\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

Here, neither party asserts that HHS met this requirement. Therefore, HHS's\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   public justifications for its decision cannot carry the agency's burden to provide reasons for its decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Falling back, HHS asserts that those\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalizations were unnecessary in any case because the Grants Policy Statement warned grantees that their project periods may be cut short if \"[f]or whatever reason, continued funding would not be in the best interests of the Federal government.\" (Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 27, Grants Policy Statement, Ex. B at II-89). Thus, HHS asserts any reason for its decision would suffice. There are two problems with this view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The first is that HHS ignores the second, narrowing, clause of the condition it is quoting. HHS cannot provide just any reason for its decision, that reason must be a change in the federal interest. HHS provides no evidence a change in the federal interest motivated its decision here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The second, and more fundamental, problem with HHS's view is that the \"federal\n   interest\" does not necessarily mean \"the federal interest as determined by HHS.\" The ultimate touchstone for all agency action is not its own guidance documents, or even regulations, but the power delegated to it by Congress. HHS misses this point by not once considering the appropriation act funding the TPP program, and provides no evidence that Congress authorized HHS to determine the federal interest in the area of teen pregnancy or that Congress had nevertheless indicated itself that the federal interest in this area has changed. But still more, by failing to consider Congress's grant of authority, HHS has not shown that an unanchored federal interest is even a relevant factor in distributing grant funding under the TPP program. In fact, congressional appropriations for funding the TPP program, as stated above, suggest that the federal interest must be anchored in, among other things, the prevention of teenage pregnancy. Thus, even under the framework HHS proposes, not only was the agency required to provide reasons for its decision, those reasons had to be related to the relevant factors in the congressional appropriation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In sum, the text of Congress's appropriations act suggests that HHS was to provide and end grants with some reference to their success in preventing teen pregnancy. HHS may have had a sufficient, lawful reason, for terminating the plaintiffs' project period early, but because it failed to provide a reason in this case, or to meaningfully explain the factors it considered relevant to its decision, it is impossible to determine what was motivating the agency and whether that motivation was relevant at all. HHS's decision was, therefore, arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the plaintiffs will be granted summary judgment. HHS's decision to terminate the Baltimore City's and Healthy Teen Network's project periods will be vacated, and the agency will be ordered to process the plaintiffs' non-compete applications consistent with this opinion. A separate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    In light of the parties' agreement, there is no need to address in detail the elements for granting a permanent injunction, but it is clear that the plaintiffs have met them.
