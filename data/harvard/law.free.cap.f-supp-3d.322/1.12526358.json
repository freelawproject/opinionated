Accordingly, by all accounts, Professor Clark was acting within the scope of her employment at the time of the accident, and therefore the claim against her must be dismissed under the plain language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In his opposition, plaintiff disavows these allegations in his complaint and seeks leave to amend his complaint \"to plead that Defendant Clark was acting outside the scope of her employment so that discovery can be done on that issue.\" Pl.'s Opp., ECF No. 14 at 19-21. Although the Court must \"freely give leave\" to amend a complaint \"when justice so requires,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), plaintiff's request here appears to be \"a transparent attempt by plaintiff to amend his pleading in order to avoid a dispositive defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Colliton v. Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore LLP\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-0400,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204386764\">\n    2008 WL 4386764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2008). As another court explained in rejecting a plaintiff's attempt to \"retreat from his assertion\" that the defendant was acting \"within the scope of his employment, \"[w]here a plaintiff blatantly changes his statement of the facts in order to respond to the defendant's motion to dismiss and directly contradicts the facts set forth in his original complaint, a court is authorized to accept the facts described in the original complaint as true.\"\n   <em>\n    Rishikof v.

Here, the Court rejects Mr. Coleman's attempt to circumvent the clear allegations in his complaint in response to the defendants' dispositive motion. Accordingly, the Court denies plaintiff's request to amend his complaint to add allegations that would directly contradict the allegations in his original complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
