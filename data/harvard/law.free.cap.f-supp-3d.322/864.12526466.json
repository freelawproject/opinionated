The defendant moved to dismiss\n   the case pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). For the reasons that follow, the motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   To review, Mr. Scott Walter Eiswert was honorably discharged from the military on November 29, 2005. He applied for service-connected disability benefits with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (\"VA\") in May 2006 for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (\"PTSD\"). The VA denied the application in September 2006. Mr. Eiswert applied for reconsideration on August 24, 2007, and the VA once again denied his request on February 4, 2008. During this process, Mr. Eiswert was unable to obtain treatment for PTSD. On March 25, 2008, Mr. Eiswert declined the VA's attempts to schedule an appointment with the VA's PTSD Auerback Clinic. Tragically, Mr. Eiswert committed suicide on May 16, 2008. In sum, Mr. Eiswert received no treatment from the VA for PTSD from July 28, 2006, through March 25, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Eiswert's wife, Tracy Lynn Eiswert, the plaintiff, continued to pursue the benefits. The VA granted PTSD-related disability benefits on August 13, 2008, retroactive March 28, 2007. The VA increased this amount and the effective date on August 26, 2008, due to error. The VA did so again in April 2009 and May 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 20, 2010, Ms. Eiswert filed an administrative claim pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202675\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking compensation for damages resulting from her husband's suicide. The VA denied the claim on November 5, 2010. She sought reconsideration on February 1, 2011. The VA notified Ms. Eiswert that the reconsideration was denied on April 19, 2011, and informed her she had six months to pursue her claim in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Eiswert and her children (\"plaintiffs\") filed the instant action alleging medical malpractice on October 11, 2011. Plaintiffs' counsel attached expert statements from board-certified psychiatrists to the Complaint, [Doc. 1]. These experts opined that within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the VA's failure to recognize and treat Mr. Eiswert's PTSD contributed to his untimely death. One expert stated that the VA's treatment fell below the applicable standard of care. Plaintiffs' counsel also attached the experts' Curriculum Vitae. However, the Certificate of Good Faith as required by Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-122 was not attached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant then filed a Motion to Dismiss, [Doc. 14], and Supplement, [Doc. 39]. The defendant raised several arguments: that (1) Title 38 United States Code section 511(a) precluded the Court's review of any benefit determination; (2) Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-116(a)(3), the statute of repose, barred the plaintiffs' action; (3) plaintiffs failed to file a certificate of good faith and the action should be dismissed pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-122 ; and (4) plaintiffs failed to properly demonstrate and plead compliance with Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121 and the action should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court granted the defendant's motion because the plaintiffs did not strictly comply with section 122 in filing a Certificate of Good Faith. [Doc. 61]. The Court did not address the section 511(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   or\n   section 121 arguments. The Court addressed, but did not decide, the statute of repose issue. The plaintiffs then filed a Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment and supplements, [Docs. 63, 68 and 70]. The Court denied the plaintiffs' motion, [Doc. 72], and the plaintiffs appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After oral arguments, the Sixth Circuit certified the question of whether section 122 could be satisfied with substantial compliance to the Tennessee Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    Eiswert v. U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356908\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/619/483/#p488\">\n    619 F. App'x 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488-89 (6th Cir. 2015). The Tennessee Supreme Court declined to answer the question because the section 121 argument had not been addressed and might be determinative of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eiswert v. U.S.\n   </em>\n   , 639 Fed. App'x 345, 347 (6th Cir. 2016). As such, the Sixth Circuit remanded the case to this Court to determine whether the Complaint satisfies section 121 and address \"any unresolved issues.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356908\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/619/483/#p488\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In a footnote, the Sixth Circuit noted that the statute of repose issue \"may also be dispositive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356908\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/619/483/#p488\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 348 n. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The issues before the Court after remand were whether (1) Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-116(a)(3), the statute of repose, bars the plaintiffs' action; (2) plaintiffs failed to file a certificate of good faith and the action should be dismissed pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-122 ; and (3) plaintiffs failed to properly demonstrate and plead compliance with Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121 and the action should be dismissed. Upon briefing these remanded issues, however, the defendant stated that section \"121 is no longer an unresolved issue that needs to be resolved by the Court.\" As such, the parties agree that there are only two issues this Court needs to address.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 84 at 7] (stating plaintiffs' issues for the Court to decide). They are whether the statute of repose,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2029-26-116\">\n    Tenn.

Ohio 1997). The importance of this distinction has to do with the nature of the Court's\n   consideration of the facts and allegations presented in connection with the Rule 12(b)(1) motion. If the motion presents a facial attack, the Court must construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and may not consider extrinsic materials.\n   <em>\n    Abdelkhaleq\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%203980339\">\n    2008 WL 3980339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The plaintiffs claim the period began when Mr. Eiswert committed suicide on May 16, 2008. Further, the plaintiffs assert that Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121(c) extended the statute of repose by 120 days. The defendant does not challenge the extension. Thus, the defendant argues that the plaintiff had until July 23, 2011, to file a health care liability suit. If the Court uses the plaintiffs start date of May 16, 2008, then the plaintiffs had until September 13, 2011, to file their action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In sum, Mr. Eiswert's last interaction with the VA was on March 25, 2008, and he tragically committed suicide on May 16, 2008. On April 20, 2010, Ms. Eiswert filed an administrative claim with the VA pursuant to the FTCA. The VA denied this claim on reconsideration on April 19, 2011, and informed Ms. Eiswert that she had six months to pursue her claim in federal court. The plaintiffs filed the instant action alleging medical malpractice on October 11, 2011. Again, the defendant argues that the plaintiffs should have filed their action in this Court prior to July 23, 2011.

Here, it is not a physical impossibility for the plaintiff to comply with both section 116(a)(3) and section 2401(b). The entire administrative process, including denial on reconsideration, was completed and suit could have been filed in federal court five months prior to the statute of repose deadline. However, this does not end the inquiry. The Court must now determine whether section 116(a)(3) stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress for section 2401(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Section 2401(b) states that an FTCA claim is barred unless action is begun within six months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented. Here, the VA's final denial was on April 19, 2011. According to section 2401(b), the plaintiffs had six months from this date to file the action in federal court. The statute of repose deadline set forth in section 116(a)(3) was prior to the conclusion of this six-month period. As such, contrary to the defendant's contention, the\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   process was not complete. Accordingly, section 116(a)(3) stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. This Court finds persuasive the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   and the concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   even though in those cases the administrative agency had not rendered a decision prior to the statute of repose deadline.

The Court has reviewed those cases and many others. None of the cases have held that\n   <strong>\n    section 122\n   </strong>\n   can be substantially complied with when no certificate of good faith has been filed in the first place.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hinkle v.

Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2012) (holding to the contrary but it predates\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ). It is true that\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   held section 122's requirement that a certificate disclose the number of prior violations does not require the disclosure of the\n   <em>\n    absence\n   </em>\n   of any prior violations.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6859015\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/465/570/#p574\">\n    465 S.W.3d at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, one might argue that the court allowed substantial compliance. However,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   \"was decided on grounds of statutory interpretation,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   substantial compliance.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Dustin Barnwell v.

Tenn. Apr. 10, 2018). The holding is not one that a plaintiff can satisfy all of section 122's requirements when the plaintiff has failed to file a certificate of good faith in the first place. Thus, the Court does not find the cases referred to by the Sixth Circuit, or any other case, as providing an avenue for the plaintiffs to maintain this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Instead, the Court will decide the case based on\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   and the plain language of the statute, and they both require dismissal with prejudice when a plaintiff fails to file a certificate of good faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court\n   notes that courts have allowed substantial compliance with section 121. Nevertheless, section 121 does not provide a penalty for noncompliance and section 122 does. These statutes were enacted together as part of the Tennessee Health Care Liability Act, and, therefore, the Court must interpret the sections together and must presume the Tennessee Legislature intended for them to carry different sanctions.\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

In sum, the Court holds that section 122 cannot be satisfied by substantial compliance when the plaintiffs fail to file a certificate of good faith along with the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court once again states its dissatisfaction with this outcome. \"But the Court must follow the dictates of the law; and 'it is the Tennessee legislature, and not this Court, that drafts the law of the state.' \"\n   <em>\n    Barnwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201733311\">\n    2018 WL 1733311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at * 5 (citations omitted). Furthermore, this Court followed the precedent of the Tennessee Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ellithorpe\n   </em>\n   , a court which refused to answer the very question at issue in this case.

Furthermore, on appeal, for what appears to be the first time, the plaintiffs argue that Rules 8 and 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure also preempt state law.
