Risperdal \u00ae\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Risperdal \u00ae\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is a prescription antipsychotic medication that was first approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") in 1993 for use in adults. (Defendants' Rule 56.1 Statement (\"Defs'. 56.1\"), Dkt 46-2, at \u00b6 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Risperdal is generically known as risperidone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2.) Since 1993, Risperdal's FDA-approved labeling has contained the following language regarding the risk of gynecomastia and galactorrhea, a medical condition involving the excessive or inappropriate production of breast milk, in the \"PRECAUTIONS\" section:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Hyperprolactinemia : As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, risperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia and/or neoplasia was observed in the\n   risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats (See CARCINOGENESIS ). However, neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3 (emphasis in original).) The 1993 Label also stated that the \"safety and effectiveness [of Risperdal ] in children have not been established.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Risperdal was first approved for pediatric use-for irritability associated with autistic disorder-on October 6, 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.) A subsection entitled \"Pediatric Use\" was added to the \"PRECAUTIONS\" section of Risperdal's label at that time. It states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The safety and effectiveness of RISPERDAL \u00ae in pediatric patients with schizophrenia or bipolar mania have not been established.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The efficacy and safety of RISPERDAL \u00ae in the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder were established in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials in 156 children and adolescent patients, aged 5 to 16 years (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Clinical Trials, INDICATIONS AND USAGE, and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Additional safety information was also assessed in a long-term study in patients with autistic disorder, or in short- and long-term studies in more than 1200 pediatric patients with other psychiatric disorders who were of similar age and weight, and who received similar dosages of RISPERDAL \u00ae as patients who were treated for irritability associated with autistic disorder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Hyperprolactinemia, Growth, and Sexual Maturation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Risperidone has been shown to elevate prolactin levels in children and adolescents as well as in adults (see PRECAUTIONS-Hyperprolactinemia ). In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of up to 8 weeks duration in children and adolescents (aged 5 to 17 years) 49% of patients who received risperidone had elevated prolactin levels compared to 2% of patients who received placebo.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   In clinical trials in 1885 children and adolescents with autistic disorder or other psychiatric disorders treated with risperidone, galactorrhea was reported in 0.8% of risperidone-treated patients and gynecomastia was reported in 2.3% of risperidone-treated patients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The long-term effects of risperidone on growth and sexual maturation have not been fully evaluated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2007, the label was changed, and the \"WARNINGS\" and \"PRECAUTIONS\" sections were merged. The label included the following language:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Hyperprolactinemia : As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, RISPERDAL \u00ae elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. RISPERDAL \u00ae is associated with higher levels of prolactin elevation than other antipsychotic agents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   * * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Risperdal Label 2007, Dkt. 52-18, at 1, 12.) The 2007 label contained the same information as the 2006 label about the clinical trial of 1885 children and adolescents, and the gynecomastia incidence rate of 2.3%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's Psychiatric History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff was born in 1996. (Defs'. 56.1 at \u00b6 6.) Plaintiff has a long history of psychological issues that began when he was six years old. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.) In June 2002, the Administration for Children's Services (\"ACS\") removed Plaintiff from his mother's home when his infant brother tested positive for marijuana at birth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.) Plaintiff was housed in seven different foster homes over the next month and showed aggressive behavior toward adults and other children during this period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.) In August 2002, Plaintiff was brought to the emergency room at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center (\"Lincoln\") because he was showing \"uncontrollable behavior\" toward his foster mother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) Plaintiff was released to the care of a new foster mother, but returned to Lincoln two days later for behavioral issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) A subsequent psychiatric consultation diagnosed Plaintiff with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (\"ADHD\") and Depressive Disorder, and indicated that he \"poses a danger to self and others.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.) Plaintiff was taking Adderall XR and Zoloft at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b620.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In February 2003, Plaintiff was hospitalized at St. Vincent's Hospital for a week after becoming \"physically aggressive at school.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.) Plaintiff was diagnosed with ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.) Plaintiff's doctor discontinued Zoloft, decreased Plaintiff's Adderall dosage, and prescribed Risperdal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.) A few months later, in August 2003, Plaintiff was brought to New York Foundling Hospital, where he was placed on Adderall 20 mg and Risperdal 0.75 mg, which was soon thereafter increased to 1.5 mg. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.) In September 2003, Plaintiff's social worker noted that Plaintiff had \"made a significant improvement in symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity and attention span\" and noted his \"positive response to the combination of psychotropic medication and routine, structure and consistent limit setting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) One of Plaintiff's doctors, Fatima Taylor, recommended that Plaintiff be placed in a residential treatment center and continue on psychotropic medications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In October 2003, Plaintiff was placed in The Children's Village in Dobbs Ferry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.) The psychiatrists at Children's village continued prescribing Plaintiff Adderall and Risperdal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.) In April 2004, Children's Village psychiatrist Dr. Mary Lincoln noted that Plaintiff was prescribed Adderall 30 mg and Risperdal 2 mg to treat his symptoms of ADHD and aggression. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.) Dr. Lincoln noted that Plaintiff's issues seemed to worsen in the absence of regular contact with his mother, and diagnosed Plaintiff with ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) Between August and October 2004, Plaintiff's aggression appeared to decline, so Plaintiff's doctor decreased Plaintiff's Risperdal dose to 0.5 mg. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.) But, in November 2004, Plaintiff's behavior deteriorated; his therapist noted that his behavior was \"explosive and unsafe.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.) In December 2004, Plaintiff was admitted to the Crisis Residence section of Children's Village for behavioral issues at a Thanksgiving dinner after he learned he could not visit his birth mother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39.) Progress notes from February 2005 state that Plaintiff's noncompliance with his medication was \"associated w[ith] dramatic behavioral deterioration\" and that Plaintiff's grandmother stated that Plaintiff \"kicked her and threw [a] tantrum\" on his last home visit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40.) Less than a year later, in January 2006, Plaintiff's grandmother stated that on a recent home visit, Plaintiff threw chairs, took the hinges off a door, grabbed her by the collar, and threatened to break her glasses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.) Children's Village\n   psychiatrists increased Plaintiff's Risperdal dosage to 2 mg per day to compensate for his behavior issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dr. Robert Miller, a child psychiatrist at Children's Village, treated Plaintiff between July 2005 and September 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44.) In November 2006, Dr. Miller observed that Plaintiff's general level of aggression might be increasing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.) Dr. Miller continued Plaintiff's maintenance medications of Risperdal 2 mg and Adderall 30 mg. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.) In February 2007, Plaintiff was admitted again to the Crisis Residence at Children's Village after learning that he might not be able to leave Children's Village in the custody of his grandmother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48.) Dr. Miller diagnosed Plaintiff with an adjustment disorder and when his symptoms did not improve, he was hospitalized on March 8, 2007 \"for safety concerns.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.) While hospitalized, Plaintiff's Risperdal was increased to 4 mg daily and he was also prescribed Prozac 20 mg. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.) Plaintiff's condition improved briefly in April 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52.) But, in June 2007, Plaintiff was again placed in the Crisis Residence for \"aggressive behavior.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53.) Dr. Miller continued Risperdal at 4 mg daily, along with Adderall 30 mg and Prozac 20 mg. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In July 2007, Plaintiff was hospitalized at Stony Lodge Hospital for a month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56.). Dr. Miller noted Plaintiff's new medication of Zoloft 100 mg, and continued prescribing Risperdal 4 mg and Adderall 30 mg. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In March 2008, Dr. Miller reduced Plaintiff's Risperdal dose from 4 mg to 3 mg. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65.) In July 2008, Dr. Miller noted that Plaintiff was doing well, but did not want to lower his medication in view of his upcoming discharge into the care of his grandmother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66.) That same month, Plaintiff's prolactin levels were measured and found to be 23.3 ng/mL, within normal range for a child. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In October 2008, Plaintiff was discharged from Children's Village into the care of his grandmother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67.) His medications at that time were Adderall 30 mg; Risperdal 3 mg; and Zoloft 100 mg. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On June 12, 2009, Plaintiff saw psychiatrist Dr. Robert Neal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102.) Plaintiff complained of enlarged breasts. Dr. Neal asked Plaintiff to lift his shirt and documented the breast enlargement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 103.) Dr. Neal noted that Plaintiff \"continues to have disabling psychiatric signs and symptoms,\" and recommended that Plaintiff discontinue Risperdal, which he observed was \"probably responsible for the breast enlargement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 105.) Dr. Neal also recommended Plaintiff discontinue Zoloft, but continue taking Adderall. Dr. Neal noted that he had been aware of the correlation between Risperidone and breast enlargement for several years prior to June 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 100.) In August of 2009, after Plaintiff had stopped taking Risperdal, his prolactin levels were measured for a second time and were found to be 6.75 ng/mL, within normal range. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 120.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff continued to see other doctors throughout 2009 and 2010. In December 2009, Dr. Rhonda Cambridge Phillip noted that Plaintiff was taking a new antipsychotic medication, Haldol, which could be contributing to his gynecomastia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 109.) In April 2010, Dr. Amish Nishawala stated that Plaintiff had stopped taking Haldol because of its \"potential effect on his gynecomastia,\" but that his behavior had worsened. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 111.) In December 2011, Plaintiff was hospitalized at Kings County Hospital after his grandmother reported that he had been violent at home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 112.) In January 2012, Dr. Neal reduced the prescribed amount of Seroquel, yet another antipsychotic, and added\n   lithium because Plaintiff was exhibiting noticeable weight gain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 113.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In February 2012, Plaintiff complained to Dr. Neal again about his enlarged breasts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 114.) Dr. Neal diagnosed Plaintiff with bipolar disorder and mania, and increased Plaintiff's lithium dose while maintaining his Seroquel and Depakote. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 115.) In March 2012, Dr. Neal saw Plaintiff for the last time and noted that Plaintiff complained that his breasts continued to enlarge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 116.) On May 7, 2012, Plaintiff's prolactin levels were tested for a third time and found to be 8.0 ng/mL, within normal range for a boy his age. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 121.) In September 2012, Plaintiff ceased taking any medication due to pancreatitis, which his physicians associated with lithium and Depakote. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In April 2014, Plaintiff underwent bilateral mastectomies to remove his enlarged breast tissue at Mount Sinai Hospital. (Plaintiff's Rule 56.1 Statement (\"Pl's. 56.1\"), Dkt. 53, at \u00b6 124.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff filed his complaint in this action on March 30, 2015 in Kings County Supreme Court. (Dkt. 1.)

Plaintiff Cannot Establish that Risperdal's Warning Was Inadequate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff's failure to warn claim alleges that Risperdal's labels, both before and after October 2006, the time at which Risperdal was approved for pediatric use, were inadequate because they insufficiently described the incidence rate of gynecomastia. Plaintiff, who began taking Risperdal in 2003 and began developing breasts in 2005, asserts that prior to October 2006, Defendants never issued a warning that Risperdal was for adult use only and attempted to \" 'downplay' the real risk associated with the drug.\" (Pl. Opp'n Mot., Dkt. 52, at 35.) Plaintiff argues it was not enough for Defendants to \"generally\" warn of the risks of gynecomastia and elevated prolactin levels on the label, because the drug was \"illegally marketed\" to children prior to 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Defendants allege, the drug's label did not contain any mention of gynecomastia, hyperprolactinemia, and/or precocious puberty under the \"WARNINGS\" or \"ADVERSE REACTIONS\" sections of the label. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 35.) Plaintiff claims that a drug company cannot provide an adequate warning by mentioning a significant risk \"in passing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Regarding Risperdal's post-October 2006 label, Plaintiff claims that Defendants omitted specific and important risk information and failed to timely update the information on the label when it had knowledge of the risks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.) In particular, Plaintiff cites two studies showing that gynecomastia incidence rates were between two and five times higher than the rate of 2.3% listed on Risperdal's post-October 2006 label. One study allegedly showed that gynecomastia incidence rates were 4.8% in children and adolescents, while the other study allegedly concluded that the rate was closer to 12.5%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.) Plaintiff argues that these rates were significantly higher than what Dr. Miller, Plaintiff's prescribing physician, thought they were at time, and that had Dr. Miller been advised by Defendants of the higher rates, he would have changed his prescribing decisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In their summary judgment motion, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not produced admissible evidence demonstrating that the warning on Risperdal's label was inadequate, which is fatal to his failure to warn claim. (Def. Mot. S.J., Dkt. 46-1, at 20.) Defendants note that since Risperdal's approval by the FDA in 1993, the risk of gynecomastia, in fact, has been communicated to physicians in the \"PRECAUTIONS\" section of the label. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Defendants argue that the only \"evidence\" Plaintiff offers to support his claim that the label did not adequately warn of the risk of gynecomastia are the two clinical studies that Plaintiff contends show a higher incidence of gynecomastia-a contention that is inadmissible without expert testimony. (Defs'. Reply, Dkt 49, at 9-10.) Defendants dispute Plaintiff's characterization and \"cherry pick[ing]\" of these studies, noting that the two were part of a group of eighteen clinical studies on the side effects of Risperdal that were considered by Defendants and the FDA when determining the appropriate incidence rate of gynecomastia to include on Risperdal's label. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As an initial consideration, the Learned Intermediary Doctrine as applied in this case precludes Plaintiff from recovering for any injuries sustained from the use of Risperdal unless he can show that the warnings were inadequate as to his prescribing physicians.\n   <em>\n    Davids\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3574464\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/857/267/#p286\">\n    857 F.Supp.2d at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff has offered Risperdal's FDA-approved labels as evidence of warnings provided to physicians contemporaneous with or predating Plaintiff's\n   use of Risperdal. These labels are from 1999, 2002, 2006, and 2007. Given that Plaintiff began taking Risperdal in 2003, the relevant warning labels are from 2002, 2006, and 2007. Under these circumstances, the Court takes judicial notice of the FDA-approved labels introduced by Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Becker v.

Gynecomastia is identified in the 2002 Risperdal label. (Defs'. Rule 56.1, at \u00b6 3.) The 2002 label, which was in effect at the time Plaintiff began taking Risperdal in 2003, included a detailed list of possible side effects-including gynecomastia, galactorrhea, and hyperprolactinemia, among others-under the \"PRECAUTIONS\" section of the label. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The FDA-approved label for Risperdal warns about the risk of gynecomastia and further explains that such conditions have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3819883\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/670/279/#p284\">\n    670 F.Supp.2d at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[P]rescription medicine warnings are adequate when, as here, information regarding 'the precise malady incurred' was communicated in the prescribing information.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wolfgruber v.

Second, to the extent Plaintiff is relying on the higher-than-2.3% incidence rates to make this argument, he runs into the same problem discussed earlier: he has no expert who can interpret or validate the two studies allegedly showing these higher incidence rates, thus making it improper to argue that Dr. Miller's prescribing practice would or should have been different had the label included these higher incidence rates. Put differently, because there is no basis for concluding that these higher rates are valid and that the Risperdal label therefore should have included them, it is again irrelevant that Dr. Miller would have changed his mind about prescribing Risperdal had he known of these higher rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Lastly, the fact that Plaintiff's guardian, according to her affirmation, would not have consented to the Risperdal prescription had Dr. Miller advised her of the risk of gynecomastia is irrelevant to Plaintiff's claims against Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salva v.

At oral argument, however, in response to the Court's questioning on this issue, Plaintiff's counsel suggested that because a 2.3% incidence rate translates into one out of every fifty children getting gynecomastia, it should have been included on all of Risperdal's labels. Plaintiff, however, has not offered any caselaw to support the conclusion that a 2.3% incidence rate is sufficient to trigger a duty to specifically warn about a rate of incidence, especially where the rate of incidence relates only to a sub-population, here, children, for whom the drug was not approved during the period at issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The first study ran clinical trials from 1997 to 2001, and the second study did so from 2000 to 2002.

(Defs'. Mot. S.J., at 20-21.) The Court has found that Plaintiff is unable to demonstrate specific causation because of his physicians' failure to read Defendants' label, their independent knowledge or belief about the risk of gynecomastia, and their failure to inform Plaintiff or his guardian of the risk, and therefore does not address Defendants' arguments about the deficiencies in the opinion testimony of Plaintiff's expert. The Court, however, notes that Plaintiff's argument that his expert is able to establish a link between Plaintiff's consumption of Risperdal and the change in his prolactin levels misses the point. The issue of whether Plaintiff's consumption of Risperdal caused Plaintiff's gynecomastia is not the same as whether Defendants' alleged failure to sufficiently warn about the risk of gynecomastia caused Plaintiff's gynecomastia, which is the only relevant issue here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
