Abdun-Nabi (\"Abdun-Nabi\"), Robert G. Kramer, and Adam R. Havey (\"Individual Defendants\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"). Emergent is a specialty biopharmaceutical company and sole provider of the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-licensed anthrax vaccine, BioThrax. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, ECF No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   23. The primary purchaser of BioThrax has been the United States Government via the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. In July 2010, the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority awarded a six-year contract to Emergent to expand its BioThrax manufacturing capabilities at a new facility, Building 55.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2011, Emergent obtained a five-year BioThrax procurement contract from the CDC for Emergent to supply up to 44.75 million doses of BioThrax for the Strategic National Stockpile (\"SNS\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. This contract was set to expire on September 30, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In August 2015, Defendants began discussions with the CDC about the renewal of the BioThrax contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that beginning on January 11, 2016, Defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions that made investors believe that the Government intended to purchase Emergent's newly increased production capacity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-57. On May 5, 2016, in a press release filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Emergent confirmed that the Government would award it a renewed BioThrax contract and described the new contract as requiring \"significantly increased deliveries in order to satisfy the U.S. government's stated requirements for a licensed anthrax vaccine in the Strategic National Stockpile\" as well as making other related statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55, 91.

Compl., ECF No. 1. On October 26, 2016, the Court granted Plaintiffs' Motion for Appointment as Lead Plaintiff and Approval of Selection of Lead Counsel (ECF No. 16), appointing Plaintiffs City of Cape Coral Municipal Firefighters' Retirement Plan (\"Cape Coral Fire\") and City of Sunrise Police Officers' Retirement Plan (\"Sunrise Police\") as Lead Plaintiffs and Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP (\"Robbins Geller\") as Lead Counsel pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) of 1995, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4 (2012).

ECF No. 23. On February 27, 2017, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint (\"Motion to Dismiss\"). ECF No. 36.

They seek to appoint themselves and Flagstad as Class Representatives. ECF No. 69 at 8. Cape Coral Fire and Sunrise Police are benefit pension plans that acquired 7,900 and 7,800 shares, respectively, of Emergent Common Stock during the proposed Class Period, but before May 5, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Flagstad is an individual who acquired 165 shares of Emergent Common Stock during the proposed Class Period, after May 5, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Lead Plaintiffs seek to appoint Robbins Geller, a law firm specializing in complex civil litigation cases and the current Lead Counsel, as Class Counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Here, Lead\n   Plaintiffs seek to proceed under Rule 23(b)(3), which requires that \"the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\" Fed.

The Class Period\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the parties dispute the appropriate timeframe of the Class Period, assuming the Class is certified. Lead Plaintiffs propose that the Class Period should be from January 11, 2016, the date Lead Plaintiffs claim the alleged material misstatements about the follow-on contract began, through June 21, 2016, the day before the alleged \"corrective\" disclosure. ECF No. 69 at 2. Defendants argue that the Class Period should only begin on May 5, 2016, the date they assert the first actionable statement under the PSLRA was made, to June 21, 2016. Defs.' Opp'n to Lead Pls.' Am. Mot. for Class Certification 16, ECF No. 78. Although the Court has not made any\n   <em>\n    final determinations\n   </em>\n   regarding the materiality and actionability of any of the specifically alleged misstatements, it does recognize, as it did at the July 6, 2017 hearing on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, that the May 5, 2016 statement by Abdun-Nabi calling the anticipated follow-on contract \"one big, beautiful package,\" at this stage in the litigation \"is where this case goes from puffery to fraud.\" Mots. Hr'g Tr. 97:20-21, ECF No. 79-3. Because the Court is required at the class certification stage to limit the proposed Class based on the alleged misrepresentations found to be actionable, the Court will at this time certify the proposed Class based on the shortened Class Period of May 5, 2016 to June 21, 2016 (\"shortened Class Period\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malone v. Microdyne Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509910\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/26/471/#p480\">\n    26 F.3d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 480 (4th Cir. 1994) (remanding case to district court to narrow and recertify the plaintiff class consistent with actionable statements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Certification of the Class for the shortened Class Period necessarily results in the Court finding that Lead Plaintiffs cannot be appointed Class Representatives at this time because they do not meet the adequacy requirement under Rule 23(a)(4). Accordingly, only Flagstad is eligible to be appointed Class Representative. It does not result, however, in any impact on Lead Plaintiffs' ability to continue to serve and fulfill their duties as Lead Plaintiffs. Lead Plaintiffs may remain in the case and retain their obligations under the PSLRA and Rule 23 even when they are not appointed class representatives.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lumen v.

Moreover, certification based on the shortened Class Period does not mean that the parties cannot at a later date move this Court to expand the Class Period to include statements made between January 11, 2016 and May 5, 2016, should they later be found to be actionable based on information obtained in discovery.

The Proposed Class Satisfies Rule 23(a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The proposed Class, based on the shortened Class Period, meets all four Rule 23(a) prerequisites. The first three prerequisites are easily met in this case and are undisputed by Defendants. For the sake of brevity, the Court will dispense with an in depth analysis and will find that the numerosity, commonality, and typicality prerequisites are satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The parties' dispute centers on the adequacy prerequisite. This prerequisite has two components: \"1) the interests of the plaintiff and other members of the class must coincide; and 2) it must appear that plaintiff and his attorney will vigorously prosecute the action.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Kirschner Med.

Bettencourt performed two empirical tests from which he concluded that there was a cause and effect relationship between the announcement of the follow-on contract on June 22, 2016 and the subsequent fall in price of the Emergent Common Stock later that day. ECF No. 70-1 at 26-43. Defendants submit, relying on a report from their own expert, Rene Stulz,\n   Professor at The Ohio State University, that the empirical tests Bettencourt performed were unreliable and accordingly inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   .

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Notwithstanding Defendants' contentions to the contrary, Lead Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that Bettencourt's empirical tests are reliable, and are thus admissible. Bettencourt performed an event study on June 22, 2016 to test the impact of the corrective disclosure of the follow-on contract as well as two collective tests on the six earnings and guidance dates issued by Emergent to determine whether the dispersion of the residual price movements of Emergent's stock on those dates was significantly greater than the dispersion of residual price movements on all other dates during the purported Class Period.

Bettencourt comes forth with sufficient evidence to show that both the event study and collective tests performed are accepted methods to test market efficiency and were reliably applied to the facts and theories of this case.

Defs.' Mem. in Support of Mot. to Exclude Expert Op. 4-9, ECF No. 82. Defendants' attempt to discredit Bettencourt's testimony by attacking his experience, however, is unconvincing. Bettencourt's education and experience are sufficient to qualify him as an expert under Rule 702.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 70-1 at 2-3 (listing Bettencourt's qualifications). Bettencourt has more than eight years of experience in applying economic, financial, and econometric analyses arising in securities and complex business litigation, and has worked on the expert opinions in a number of cases. ECF No. 70-1 at 2-3 (listing cases for which Bettencourt assisted in admitted expert testimony). The fact that his Report in this case is his first opinion as the lead expert is not fatal to the sufficiency of his credentials, nor does the fact that Defendants present a rebuttal expert who arguably has more impressive credentials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas J.

This argument, however, ignores the fact that Lead Plaintiffs' contention is premised on their allegation that because Defendants failed to disclose the truth about the follow-on contract during the proposed Class Period, Emergent's stock \"traded at artificially inflated prices,\" and thus the decline of approximately $8 per share in Emergent's Common Stock price from June 21, 2016 to June 22, 2016 is an appropriate measure of price impact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 87 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Halliburton II\n   </em>\n   made clear that a corrective disclosure is an appropriate landmark from which to determine price impact.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581622\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2398/#p2407\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This argument lacks merit. Bettencourt's Report goes into detail on how the out-of-pocket damages would be calculated, certainly more than a mere statement that an event study would be used. Bettencourt discloses that the exact calculations cannot be done until the close of discovery, but exact calculations are not necessary at this stage.\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697046\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/27/#p34\">\n    569 U.S. at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697046\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/27/#p34\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants next argue that this case, \"rather than being a typical stock-drop case (e.g., involving issues of accounting fraud), is akin to\n   <em>\n    BP II\n   </em>\n   ....\" because Lead Plaintiffs are asserting liability based on materialization of an understated risk, similar to the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    BP II\n   </em>\n   .

Accordingly, they argue, Lead Plaintiffs' proposed method for calculating damages-out-of-pocket per share damages-should similarly fail because the proposed method fails to account for the risk that existed at every point in time during the proposed Class Period due to the well-established uncertain nature of Government contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.

Defendants attempt to broaden\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   beyond its plain meaning.\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   was an antitrust case, and so it in no way announced a rule that plaintiffs in a securities fraud case must put forth any particular damages calculation methodology.\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   , therefore is of no use in critiquing Lead Plaintiffs' proposal that classwide calculation of out-of-pocket damages is possible and appropriate in this specific case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendants do not cite to a single Rule 10(b)-5 securities fraud case, and the Court could not find one, in which the court did not certify the proposed class based on the class's proposal of a sufficiently explained out-of-pocket damages model when the plaintiffs relied on a fraud-on-the-market theory of liability, which Lead Plaintiffs do here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 69 at 20-25; ECF No. 87 at 13-19. On the contrary, out-of-pocket damages calculations through an event study analysis as outlined in Bettencourt's Report have been recognized by courts as an accepted method for the evaluation of damages in securities fraud cases based on allegations similar to those made in this case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hatamian v.

Lead Plaintiffs make clear that they are alleging that because of Defendants' misrepresentations Emergent's stock was artificially inflated, and, as a result, investors suffered losses when the truth was revealed by the June 22, 2016 corrective disclosure. ECF No. 87 at 18. The amount of inflation resulting from the misrepresentations, therefore, would be same for each investor; regardless of their individual threshold for risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   A number of courts have rejected similar attempts by defendants to reframe plaintiffs' theory of liability in order to prevent class certification in Rule 10(b)-5 securities fraud cases relying on the fraud-on-the-market theory of liability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

The court, however, concluded that the\n   <em>\n    BP\n   </em>\n   cases were distinguishable because \"the proffered event study [in those cases] did not allow a determination as to whether a particular class member suffered an injury in fact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420058\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/103/#p139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420058\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/103/#p139\">\n    at 139-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   , however, the court found that because the plaintiffs premised their theory of liability on fraud-on-the-market, the proposed out-of-pocket damages methodology sufficiently tracked the theory of liability in that case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420058\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/103/#p139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420058\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/103/#p139\">\n    at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court similarly finds that Lead Plaintiffs' proposal of an event study to measure out-of-pocket per share damages meets their burden to show that damages can be calculated on a classwide basis. Because Lead Plaintiffs additionally have shown that the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance applies, the Court finds that the predominance prong of Rule 23(b)(3) is met. Accordingly, based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the proposed Class meets the predominance and superiority requirements under Rule 23(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Robbins Geller has been appointed class counsel in hundreds of securities class actions and has competently met its obligations under Rule 23 in those cases.

Because Lead Plaintiffs and Sponn all purchased their shares of Emergent Common Stock before May 5, 2016, the addition of Flagstad, who purchased his shares after May 5, would ensure that a proposed Class Representative met all of the class certification requirements should the Class be certified based on the shortened period.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Aside from the disqualifying fact that Lead Plaintiffs purchased their shares of Emergent Common Stock before the start of the shortened Class Period, the Court would find that Lead Plaintiffs meet the adequacy requirement under Rule 23(a)(4) for the same reasons it finds that Flagstad is an adequate representative.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Defendants do not contest that the proposed Class meets the \"superiority\" inquiry under Rule 23(b)(3).
