(Docket No. 52.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Master Link's motion to dismiss Marina's third amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action concerns Master Link's alleged breach of two contracts into which it entered with Marina-the Master Link Barge Agreement and the Fajardo Vessel Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Master Link Barge Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Marina provides wet slip and land storage services for ships. (Docket No. 47 at p. 2.) Master Link owns the M/V Master Link I, a barge and the\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   defendant in this litigation (\"Master Link Barge\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 22, 2013, Master Link entered into a Boat Space License Agreement with Marina (\"Master Link Barge Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Master Link agreed to pay a monthly fee of $2,848.50 to store the Master Link Barge at Marina's facility. (Docket No. 1, Ex. 3.) In the event of default, Marina reserved \"the right to retain the vessel as guarantee for payment and/or performance by Owner of any obligation under this agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Master Link has not paid any dockage, storage or other fees incurred by Marina associated with storing the Master Link Barge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. According to Marina, as of January 30, 2017, Master Link and the Master Link Barge, as an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   defendant, owe $36,980.19.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Master Link declined Marina's requests \"to meet in person to discuss [a] payment arrangement.\" (Docket No. 31 at p. 6.) The Master Link Barge remains stored at Marina's facility. (Docket No. 1, Ex. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Fajardo Vessel Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Maritime Transport Authority (\"MTA\") is a public corporation of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2. The MTA owns the M/V Fajardo II (\"Fajardo Vessel\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 1, 2012, the MTA entered into a Boat Space License Agreement with Marina (\"Fajardo Vessel Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. Marina agreed to store the Fajardo Vessel at its facility for a monthly fee, subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in the Master Link Barge Agreement. (Docket No. 1, Exs. 1 and 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As of January 30, 2017, Marina incurred $78,311.85 in costs associated with docking and storing the Fajardo Vessel. (Docket No. 47 at p. 4.) The Fajardo Vessel remains stored at Marina's facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. Marina asserts that \"Master Link expressly assumed and accepted responsibility for the payments to [Marina] under the [Fajardo Vessel Agreement] for the storage and services provided.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Master Link issued payments to Marina pursuant to the Fajardo Vessel Agreement for haul out, blocking, lay days and land storage, assuring \"[Marina] that it would be paying all amounts due as soon as it received an updated balance sheet.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Marina avers, Master Link is liable for all outstanding debts regarding the Fajardo Vessel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. Marina's collection efforts against Master Link concerning the\n   Fajardo Vessel proved unsuccessful. According to Marina, \"notice of the instant claim was anticipated to Master Link as well as the opportunity to address this matter within a reasonable time but, again, Master Link failed to pay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Marina pleads in the alternative that should the Court find that Master Link did not assume the MTA's obligations pursuant to the Fajardo Vessel Agreement, the MTA is consequently liable for the storage fees regarding the Fajardo Vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Master Link moves to dismiss the third amended complaint, adopting its motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. (Docket Nos. 30 and 52.) Similarly, Marina moves to adopt its opposition to Master Link's motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. (Docket No. 31.) The Court grants both requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The third amended complaint sets forth an admiralty and maritime cause of action within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(h). (Docket No. 47.)

Master Link contends that Marina's claims are time-barred because Marina commenced this action on March 2, 2017, more than one-year after Marina incurred expenses related to storing the Master Link Barge and the Fajardo Vessel. (Docket No. 30 at p. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Marina's Claims are Not Time-Barred\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Master Link's contention that the one-year period of limitations bars Marina's claim is unconvincing. The Puerto Rico Commerce Code is persuasive, not binding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pan Am.

Even pursuant to a one-year period of limitations, laches is inapplicable because this action commenced without unreasonable delay, and is not prejudicial to Master Link.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Master Link Failed to Demonstrate Unreasonable Delay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Marina commenced this action without unreasonable delay. Marina afforded Master Link ample time, notice and opportunity to address its default on the Master Link Barge Agreement and the Fajardo Vessel Agreement. (Docket No. 47 a p. 4.) Marina sent Master Link numerous written communications and invitations to meet in person to discuss payment issues to no avail. (Docket No. 31 at p. 6.) Marina resorted to civil litigation only after Master Link failed to pay outstanding balances pursuant to both agreements. Accordingly, the factual allegations in the third amended complaint demonstrate that Marina commenced this action without unreasonable delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Master Link Failed to Demonstrate Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The third amended complaint alleges that Master Link suffered no prejudice because the Master Link Barge and the Fajardo Vessel remain stored at Marina's facilities, despite Master Link's failure to pay for this service. (Docket No. 47 at p. 4.) Although Master Link concedes its failure to pay Marina, Master Link neglects to articulate how it would be prejudiced should this claim proceed. (Docket No. 30 at p. 7.) Accordingly, Master Link has failed to demonstrate that it suffered any prejudice suggesting that the period of limitations precludes Marina's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sedeco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3664225\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/570/60/#p63\">\n    570 F.3d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing admiralty claim where plaintiff offered no grounds for rebutting presumption of unreasonable delay and prejudice);\n   <em>\n    Benjamin Shipping\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1758409\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/829/281/#p283\">\n    829 F.2d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying laches where plaintiff offered no evidence suggesting that defendant was prejudiced).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The First Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   is illustrative. The\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   court addressed whether the relevant period of limitations barred crewmen from seeking lost wages dating back a period of eight years.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165319\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/331/#p334\">\n    513 F.3d 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After determining that \"the three-year limitation period for unpaid wage claims in Rhode Island law\" applied, the First Circuit Court of Appeals precluded the crewmen from \"pursu[ing] wage claims from the distant past and\" because \"it [would be] prejudicial to Defendants to be required to pay\n   over money to Plaintiffs that had already been distributed to the other crewmen.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165319\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/331/#p334\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165319\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/331/#p334\">\n    at 335-337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Contrary to the crewmen in\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   , Marina placed Master Link on notice regarding its financial obligations pursuant to both agreements, and continued to store the Master Link Barge and the Fajardo Vessel at Marina's facility prior to and throughout this litigation. Consequently, the doctrine of laches cannot sustain Master Link's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Assumption of Debts and Obligations Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Master Link contends that it did not assume the MTA's obligations pursuant to the Fajardo Vessel Agreement. (Docket No. 30 at p. 2.) Marina, however, alleges that Master Link expressly assumed and accepted responsibility for the MTA's outstanding payments and obligations pursuant to the Fajardo Vessel Agreement. (Docket No. 47 at p. 4.) Resolution of this issue is immaterial to the 12(b)(6) motion. The Court is satisfied that Marina complied with the pleading standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, and that Marina's claims are not time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Master Link's motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).
