The Report recommends granting Defendant Adventist Health System/SunBelt, Inc.'s (\"Adventist\") Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Sualeh Kamal Ashraf's Complaint for Failure to State a Claim (the \"Motion to Dismiss\") (ECF No. 6). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80.) Plaintiff objected to the Report on May 31, 2018. (ECF No. 21.) Defendant responded on June 14, 2018.

(Compl., ECF No. 1-1.) Plaintiff alleges that Adventist caused Plaintiff to be denied employment opportunities when it reported the revocation of his clinical privileges to the National Practitioner Data Bank (\"NPDB\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The NPDB maintains an informational data base about healthcare providers pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2011131\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et. seq.

The Florida court dismissed the suit as time-barred under Florida's statute of limitations.

It recommends granting Adventist's Motion to Dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80.) The Report explains that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on the Tennessee Supreme Court's policy principles enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   and post-\n   <em>\n    Swafford\n   </em>\n   decisions from other jurisdictions involving defamation claims arising from compelled adverse action reports to the NPDB, it is the conclusion of this court\n   that the Tennessee Supreme Court would not apply the multiple publication rule as set forth in the unpublished court of appeals decision in\n   <em>\n    Swafford\n   </em>\n   but would instead apply the single publication rule in this case.... Accordingly, under the single-publication rule, Dr. Ashraf's defamation claim accrued when Adventist Health reported the denial of Dr. Ashraf's clinical privileges to the NPDB on December 17, 2008. Therefore, Dr. Ashraf's claim is barred by Tennessee's one-year statute of limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 97-98 (citations omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 31, 2018, Plaintiff filed an objection to the Report.
