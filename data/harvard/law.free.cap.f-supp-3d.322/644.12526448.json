Wade BOOTH, Plaintiff,\n  <br/>\n  v.\n  <br/>\n  The INGLIS HOUSE CORP., Defendant.\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  CIVIL ACTION NO. 18-CV-3515\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  United States District Court, E.D. Pennsylvania.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  Signed September 4, 2018\n </decisiondate>\n <attorneys id=\"p-5\">\n  Colleen Gardner, Philadelphia, PA, pro se.\n </attorneys>\n <p id=\"p-6\">\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    MEMORANDUM\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-7\">\n   RUFE, District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Colleen Gardner filed this civil action on behalf of her brother, Wade Booth, against the Inglis House Corp. (ECF No. 1.) Documents attached to the Complaint reflect that Gardner holds a power of attorney for her brother. Both Gardner and Booth signed the Complaint, and Booth submitted a Motion to Proceed\n   <em>\n    In Forma Pauperis.\n   </em>\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court will grant Booth leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and will dismiss his Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The dismissal is without prejudice to Booth refiling this case in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Complaint raises claims against Inglis House, a facility in Philadelphia for individuals with disabilities, where Booth used to live. On October 26, 2016, Booth entered the lobby of his apartment building and encountered a man who was unknown to him. The security guard's desk was unattended at the time. The man, later identified as Shon Phillips, stabbed Booth in the head repeatedly and kicked him. Booth was taken to the hospital for his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the Complaint, Inglis Corp. only rents to disabled individuals and unauthorized persons are not permitted. However, Phillips \"was staying in his wheelchair bound mother['s] apt. even though he isn't disable[d].\" (Compl. at 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint also contends that employees of Inglis House were aware that Phillips was staying on the premises and that he had assaulted another individual prior to his assault on Booth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Phillips was charged criminally in connection with the assault and recently pled guilty to aggravated assault and related charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Phillips\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. CP-51-CR-0010506-2016 (Phila. Ct. of Common Pleas). Sentencing in the case has been set for October 24, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Booth, with the assistance of Gardner, filed this civil action against Inglis House seeking damages for injuries he sustained in the assault. Booth indicates he is raising contract claims, but the Complaint could also be construed to raise claims under tort law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court will grant Booth leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   because it appears that he is not capable of paying the fees necessary to commence this action. Accordingly,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii) requires the Court to dismiss the Complaint if it fails to state a claim. Whether a complaint fails to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is governed by the same\n   standard applicable to motions to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tourscher v. McCullough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11543283\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/184/236/#p240\">\n    184 F.3d 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (3d Cir. 1999), which requires the Court to determine whether the complaint contains \"sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v. Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (quotations omitted). Conclusory statements and naked assertions will not suffice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, \"if the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). As Booth is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , the Court construes his allegations liberally.\n   <em>\n    Higgs v. Att'y Gen.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828353\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/333/#p339\">\n    655 F.3d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339 (3d Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Booth's claims. The only independent basis for the Court's jurisdiction over state law claims is pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which grants a district court jurisdiction over \"all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between ... citizens of different States.\" Diversity jurisdiction requires \"complete diversity,\" which in turn requires that \"no plaintiff be a citizen of the same state as any defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Zambelli Fireworks Mfg. Co. v. Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5687112\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/412/#p419\">\n    592 F.3d 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 419 (3d Cir. 2010). An individual is a citizen of the state where he is domiciled, meaning the state where he is physically present and intends to remain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washington v. Hovensa LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759177\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/340/#p344\">\n    652 F.3d 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 344 (3d Cir. 2011). A corporation is a citizen of the state in which it was incorporated as well as the state where it has its principal place of business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Here, the Complaint indicates that the parties are not completely diverse. Booth appears to be a citizen of Pennsylvania and Inglis House Corporation's principal place of business is also in Pennsylvania. Accordingly, the Court must dismiss this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Booth leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and will dismiss his Complaint. As it appears that Booth cannot cure the defects in his claims, he will not be permitted to file an amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413914\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/293/103/#p114\">\n    293 F.3d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 114 (3d Cir. 2002). However, the dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is without prejudice to Booth refiling this case in the appropriate state court. The Motion for Appointment of Counsel submitted with the Complaint will be denied.

A non-attorney may not represent another individual\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    , even by virtue of a power of attorney.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Williams v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5746627\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/477/9/#p11\">\n     477 F. App'x 9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 11 (3d Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (\"Faison Williams's power of attorney for her father may confer certain decision-making authority under state law, but it does not permit her to represent him pro se in federal court.\"). However, the Court need not further address this issue, or any issues raised by Booth's lack of capacity, in light of the dismissal of this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
