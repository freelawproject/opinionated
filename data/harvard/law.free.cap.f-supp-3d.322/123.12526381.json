The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act assures parents that the public school system will teach their child with a learning disability, even if it means putting the child in a private school where his needs can be met. In this case, the District of Columbia Public Schools admits that it failed to provide the full number of hours of specialized education J.W. needed for two years; beyond that, however, an independent hearing officer decided that J.W.'s social maladjustment, not his disability, accounted for his refusals to attend classes regularly or to obtain behavioral counseling. A limited remedy was awarded. J.W.'s mother, Charon Wade, appeals, arguing that the hearing officer blamed her child for his own disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Ms. Wade advances two basic complaints about J.W.'s education at Dunbar High School. First, Dunbar failed to provide 27.5 hours per week of special education outside general education and second, it failed to provide a small and more structured educational environment, both of which were required by J.W.'s IEPs dated March 17, 2015, September 25, 2015, and March 18, 2016. Ms. Wade also complains that the IEP developed on January 17, 2017 was inappropriate because it reduced J.W.'s specialized instruction outside general education from 27.5 hours each week to 20 hours each week, because that was all Dunbar could provide. Further, Ms. Wade complains that Dunbar did not provide the behavioral counseling that J.W. needed, per his IEPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The hearing officer agreed in part and disagreed in part. He recognized that Dunbar had failed to afford J.W. the required hours of special education outside general education classes before January 2017 but attributed J.W.'s lack of academic progress to his social maladjustment and not to his disability. As to J.W.'s hours in class, he determined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [Dunbar] could not provide Student with 27.5 hours/week of specialized instruction outside general education. Special Education Coordinator acknowledged that [Dunbar] doesn't provide electives outside general education, so that [it] was out of compliance with Student's IEP, an understanding shared by Educational Advocate and [Community Based Intervention] Case Manager.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   HOD, AR at 7 (citations omitted). In the Location of Services letter, DCPS told J.W.'s mother that Dunbar \"has the programming in place to meet\" J.W.'s needs and that \"no IEP revisions\" were proposed when he entered Dunbar. LOS letter, AR at 144. However, Dunbar never fulfilled the requirements of J.W.'s IEP; his non-core classes were always taught in a general education setting. Despite J.W.'s specific need for 27.5 hours per week of specialized education, Dunbar apparently had no \"full-time, districtwide classrooms [to] provide specialized support to students\n   with 20 or more hours of specialized instruction outside of general education in their IEP,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Resource Guide, and therefore was never able to satisfy J.W.'s IEP until it dropped 7.5 hours of specialized education from his IEP in January 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   What cannot be overlooked is that J.W.'s IEP also required 240 minutes (4 hours) per month in behavioral counseling but J.W. increasingly became defiant and was unwilling to participate in such counseling in his second year at Dunbar. DCPS was attentive to this problem and changed his social worker in an effort to engage J.W., but to no avail. Hr'g Tr., B. Young, AR at 960-61 (Special Education Coordinator's testimony regarding change in social worker). J.W. told Dunbar: \"I told ya'll in that meeting my mother and lawyer came to, I am not going to counseling at all.\" Behavioral Support Service (BSS) Tracker, AR at 218. J.W. also increasingly absented himself from classes, wandering the halls or talking to friends in the cafeteria. Again, DCPS made multiple efforts to get J.W.\n   <em>\n    to school\n   </em>\n   (arranging for him to be transported) and\n   <em>\n    to class\n   </em>\n   but he would leave the classroom. The HOD attributed his poor grades to his voluntary failure to attend classes and not to the failure of Dunbar to fulfill the special education requirements of his IEP. HOD, AR at 13-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court understands the reasoning behind the HOD but respectfully disagrees. It is not possible on the record here to find that Dunbar was a correct placement for J.W. from the very beginning. It was predictable that Dunbar would never be able to satisfy the requirements of J.W.'s IEPs, either as to hours of special education outside a general education classroom or small class sizes for all courses. His needs for both were clearly stated. 3/17/15 IEP, AR at 101-18 (J.W. \"requires small group specialized instruction as he continues to struggle to master grade level material and standards.\"); 9/29/15 IEP, AR at 162-78 (J.W. \"requires small group specialized instruction as he continues to struggle to master grade level material and standards.\"); 3/18/16 IEP, AR at 282-303 (J.W. \"requires small group specialized instruction as he continues to struggle to master grade level material and standards.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court agrees with the hearing officer that DCPS denied J.W. a FAPE for the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 school years until January 17, 2017. In addition, the Court finds that DCPS failed to provide J.W. with a FAPE during the remainder of the 2016-2017 school year, during the dates J.W. was enrolled at Dunbar, due to the reduction of special education hours in J.W.'s January 17, 2017 IEP. In light of these findings, the Court will adjust the remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Claim One: Failure to Provide an Appropriate Educational Placement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Ms. Wade alleges that DCPS failed to make an appropriate educational placement for J.W. when it placed him at Dunbar, and that the hearing officer erred in providing only \"\n   <em>\n    de minimus\n   </em>\n   [sic] compensatory education.\" Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (Pl.'s Mot.) [Dkt. 8] at 9. When he entered Dunbar, J.W.'s IEP required 27.5 hours per week of specialized instruction outside of general education in a small-class setting where he could get one-on-one teacher attention. Instead, J.W. received 20 hours per week of specialized instruction and participated in electives in general education for the entirety of his enrollment at Dunbar. Mr. Young, Special Education Coordinator at Dunbar, testified that J.W. never received the full services prescribed in his 27.5-hour IEP until the IEP was changed on 1/17/17 because it was \"out of compliance.\" Hr'g Tr., B. Young, AR at 1026-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the HOD noted that \"DCPS considers 20 hours per week\n   of specialized instruction outside general education to be full-time and only provided 20 hours at [Dunbar], notwithstanding the 27.5 hours on [J.W.'s] IEP.\" HOD, AR at 14. DCPS provides no pedagogic basis to support this opinion. When its opinion conflicts with the specific terms of an IEP, especially when the IEP is ignored for years, what DCPS \"considers\" is irrelevant and must yield to the requirements of a child's education. In the past, other students in the District have had IEPs prescribing significantly more than 20 hours per week outside general education.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877842\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/962/263/#p265\">\n    962 F.Supp.2d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 265 (D.D.C. 2013) (student's IEP provided for 31 hours of specialized instruction);\n   <em>\n    G.B. v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265935\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/78/109/#p112\">\n    78 F.Supp.3d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112 (D.D.C. 2015) (student's IEP provided for 31 hours of specialized instruction);\n   <em>\n    Middleton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525357\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/312/113/#p122\">\n    312 F.Supp.3d at 123-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (student's IEP provided for between 25 and 27 hours of specialized instruction). One assumes they were not similarly capped at 20 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   What DCPS essentially admits, by considering 20 hours of specialized education to be \"full-time,\" is that the school system may regularly fail to fulfill the special needs of its children despite the hard work of IEP teams to identify those needs. If Dunbar cannot provide more than 20 hours of special education outside a general education setting, a fact that seems demonstrated on this record but as to which the Court makes no specific finding, DCPS cannot place students at Dunbar who have such needs. The Court adopts the Hearing Officer's determination that \"27.5 hours outside of general education differs substantially from 20 hours, and should not be treated as indistinguishable 'full-time' IEPs.\" HOD, AR at 14. However, this Court does not agree with the HOD's further conclusion that the absence of 7.5 hours of special education each week was a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The benchmark under IDEA for determining the appropriateness of a student's educational placement, and thus whether the student was provided a FAPE, is that DCPS \"must place the student in a setting that is capable of fulfilling the student's IEP.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877842\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/962/263/#p265\">\n    962 F.Supp.2d at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court concurs with the hearing officer's finding that DCPS placed J.W. at Dunbar even though Dunbar never met his IEP requirements at any time he was a student there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HOD, AR at 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   3/17/15 IEP, AR at 101-18; 9/29/15 IEP, AR at 162-78; 3/18/16 IEP, AR at 282-303. As the hearing officer explained, \"here, quite simply, [Dunbar] could not fully implement [J.W.'s] IEP.\" HOD, AR at 14. This failure was not \"an inconsequential, short term problem, but continued ... for nearly a year and a half.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877842\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/962/263/#p265\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   J.W. was denied a minimum of 7.5 hours per week of the specialized education mandated by his IEPs for the entirety of the 2015-2016 school year, and for the 2016-2017 school year until at least implementation of the 1/17/17 IEP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   While the Court agrees with the hearing officer's finding that DCPS denied J.W. a FAPE with respect to his educational placement at Dunbar and for the entire time he attended Dunbar, the relief ordered was inadequate to address the breadth and length of the denial of a FAPE that is shown and admitted by DCPS here. Compensatory education is an award of services \"to be provided prospectively to compensate for a past deficient program.\"\n   <em>\n    Reid ex rel. Reid v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3440240,9173870\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/516/\">\n    401 F.3d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 522-23 (D.C.

This means that DCPS failed to provide J.W. approximately 271 hours of specialized education to which he was entitled during the 2015-2016 school year, and another approximately 271 hours during 2016-2017 school year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   While the Court is cognizant that compensatory damages are not subject to a \"cookie cutter approach,\" or \"mechanical hour-counting,\" the \"ultimate award must be reasonably calculated to provide the educational benefits that likely would have accrued from special education services the school district should have supplied in the first place.\"\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3440240,9173870\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/516/\">\n    401 F.3d at 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The HOD explained that \"for a failure to implement claim, IDEA is violated only when a school district deviates materially from a student's IEP.\" HOD, AR at 15 (citing\n   <em>\n    Van Duyn ex rel.

The Court disagrees. Neither DCPS nor the hearing officer provides any support for the conclusion that the failure to implement 27% of J.W.'s IEP was immaterial or that electives are not \"of equal weight to the other 20 hours\" of J.W.'s coursework and should not have been instructed in special education classes with small groups and immediate teacher attention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.

The Court agrees with the hearing officer that \"DCPS appeared cavalier ... in not providing a placement to Student capable of providing the hours outside general education that were on his IEP for a year and a half.\" HOD, AR at 15.

The Court agrees. The hearing officer determined that J.W. \"has consistently refused BSS,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525357\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/312/113/#p122\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and that Dunbar \"changed Student's social worker to try to get him to accept services, without success.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The record indicates that J.W. attended his weekly one-hour sessions with a social worker throughout the 2015-2016 school year, as well as in August and September 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Service Tracker, AR at 197, 199, 200, 202, 203, 206, 208, 211, 213.

As with the attendance issues addressed later herein, the extent to which the inappropriate placement and failure to implement J.W.'s IEPs fully affected his access to BSS is difficult to discern, but it is implausible to say they are unrelated. Ms. Wade asserts that when J.W. began to refuse the sessions, he had already been denied an appropriate placement and IEP implementation for a full academic year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 27. Additionally, the record indicates that there was inconsistency in DCPS's maintenance of his behavior tracker. Hr'g Tr., E. Figueroa, AR at 839. The testimony that J.W.'s new social worker seemed to be unaware of the behavior tracker suggests that it was not monitored by Dunbar, at least for some period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 839-40. The fact that behavioral support services were offered, even if refused, does not ameliorate DCPS's failure to implement J.W.'s IEP as a clear denial of FAPE. However, the Court agrees with the hearing officer that J.W. refused behavioral support services although Dunbar\n   made good faith efforts to provide them. The Court finds that DCPS did not fail to implement behavioral support services and therefore did not deny J.W. a FAPE in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The hearing officer concluded that 20 hours per week of specialized instruction, as required by J.W.'s January 17, 2017 IEP, was \"sufficient to provide appropriate progress for Student in the circumstances,\" and thus DCPS had rebutted Ms. Wade's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence that the reduction in instructional hours denied a FAPE to J.W. HOD, AR at 17. As both parties note, the Supreme Court has held that \"to meet its substantive obligation under the IDEA, a school must offer an IEP reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child's circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610008\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/988/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   DCPS makes a series of representations to support the decrease in J.W.'s hours of special education, but the argument at its core is that J.W.'s lack of progress is a direct result of his poor classroom attendance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 18. This assertion is also at the heart of DCPS's response to the appropriateness of J.W.'s placement at Dunbar and the implementation of his IEPs while he attended school there. DCPS states that \"J.W.'s report cards generally show a correlation between reduced absences and higher grades.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610008\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/988/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 18 (citing 12/5/16 Student Support Team Meeting Attendance Plan, AR at 341-42; 12/6/16 Dunbar HS Report Card-Grade 11, AR at 354). While the argument makes common sense, it does not recognize that DCPS failed to place J.W. at a school that could implement the hours of special education and class sizes required by his IEPs. This may sound like a chicken-and-egg (which comes first?) problem, but the responsibility under the law lay with DCPS and it failed. The IEPs predicted that DCPS's failure to fulfill its requirements would lead to increasing difficulties in providing J.W. an education, which is demonstrably what happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   There is no doubt that J.W.'s behavior and class attendance increasingly suffered while he was at Dunbar. However, \"[c]ourts in this jurisdiction have assumed that a student may be denied a FAPE if his educational plan does not contain sufficient interventions to adequately address attendance issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Middleton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525357\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/312/113/#p122\">\n    312 F.Supp.3d at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . DCPS took some admirable steps to mitigate J.W.'s attendance problems,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Daily Attendance Tracker, AR at 145-153; 3/18/16 IEP, AR at 292; 5/18/16 Amended IEP, AR at 315 (adding transportation services to IEP), but it failed at the most important step: achieving an appropriate educational placement and fully implementing J.W.'s IEPs. DCPS may not fail to place a student at an appropriate school (even if a private school is needed), fail to implement that student's IEP fully, and then demand that the student shoulder the full responsibility for subsequent, likely related, behavior or attendance issues. If this were a situation in which DCPS had made an appropriate educational placement, fully implemented J.W.'s IEP including attempts to mitigate attendance issues, and J.W. had refused to show up for school or attend certain classes nonetheless, this case would require a different analysis. But that is not what happened. As the court in\n   <em>\n    Middleton\n   </em>\n   , this Court \"will not attempt to disentangle\n   the problem of [the student's] inappropriate placement from his issues with attendance; they are clearly linked.\"\n   <em>\n    Middleton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525357\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/312/113/#p122\">\n    312 F.Supp.3d at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   While Defendant's briefs spend significant space on J.W.'s attendance issues, for which it blames J.W., the record indicates that Dunbar reduced J.W.'s special education hours in January 2017 because the high school had never been able to provide the full hours of specialized instruction required by his successive IEPs,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 27.5. The notes from the resolution session and the testimony of Mr. Young, Special Education Coordinator at Dunbar, support the assertion that J.W.'s IEP hours were changed because the IEP was \"out of compliance.\" HOD, AR at 7; Resolution Form, AR at 450. Mr. Young testified, \"for whatever reasons [the IEP] was not put into compliance until we met in January [2017]\" and at that point J.W. \"still required a full time IEP out of general education which requires only 20 hours per week.\" Hr'g Tr., B. Young, AR at 1026. Frankly, this testimony is surprising: an IEP is not \"put into compliance\" until and unless it is implemented as written or changed for pedagogic reasons in a manner sufficient to provide appropriate progress for the student under the circumstances. DCPS offers nothing beyond Mr. Young's\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   that a \"full time IEP out of general education ... requires only 20 hours per week.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court appreciates that DCPS may not be able to provide more than 20 hours of specialized education per week in its regular schools. That limitation on the system's capacity does not excuse its failure to provide a free appropriate public education beyond 20 hours/week when a student has such needs, as does J.W. DCPS must place such students in a non-public school to fulfill its obligations under the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As IDEA applied here, DCPS had a responsibility to ensure that J.W. was provided with an educational placement that could fulfill all of his IEP requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877842\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/962/263/#p265\">\n    962 F.Supp.2d at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, DCPS placed J.W. in a school that could never accommodate his IEP and then changed the IEP to fit the placement. That series of events does not support a finding that DCPS tailored J.W.'s January 2017 IEP to meet his unique needs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rowley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636698\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/176/#p181\">\n    458 U.S. at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636698\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/176/#p181\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or that it was calibrated to support J.W.'s progress at Dunbar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610008\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/988/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court concludes that the 1/17/17 IEP was not reasonably calculated to enable J.W. to make progress appropriate in light of his circumstances when it reduced J.W.'s specialized instruction hours outside of general education from 27.5 to 20 per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Upon review of the administrative record, including the Hearing Officer Determination, the Court finds that: (1) DCPS denied J.W. a FAPE when it did not provide an appropriate educational placement; (2) DCPS denied J.W. a FAPE when it materially failed to implement his IEP; and (3) DCPS denied J.W. a FAPE when it reduced his special educational instruction hours without pedagogic support and in a manner not reasonably calculated to allow him to make progress. The Court will grant in part and deny in part Ms. Wade's Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 8. Summary judgment will be granted to Ms. Wade on all claims other than the behavioral support services claim. The Court will grant in part and deny in part DCPS's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 9. Summary judgment will be granted to DCPS as to the behavioral support services claim. Because Ms. Wade has advised the Court that J.W.'s circumstances have changed since the due process\n   hearing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice, the Court will set a status conference to discuss the issue of remedy.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    According to her Notice of Withdrawal, Ms. Wade is no longer seeking two forms of relief previously requested in her summary judgment motion: (1) an order specifying that the student requires an Individualized Education Program (IEP) and corresponding placement that provides at least 27.5 instructional hours per week outside general education and a Least Restrictive Environment at a separate special education day school; and (2) an order to place and fund J.W. at New Beginnings Vocational School, with transportation.
