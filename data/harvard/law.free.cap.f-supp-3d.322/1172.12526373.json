THOMAS MARTEN, JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Stephanie Esparza was injured in an auto accident while driving a rental car when she was in Wichita, Kansas, for job training. The original defendant, Ruben D. Baker, settled with Esparza under his insurance policy. Regent Insurance Company (\"Regent\") intervened and declined to substitute its funds because it concluded that Esparza was not an insured\n   entitled to underinsured motorist coverage under Regent's policy with Esparza's employer. This matter is before the court on the parties' cross motions for summary judgment on the issue of coverage (Dkts. 24, 27). Both parties seek a declaratory judgment in her/its favor. For the reasons provided below, the court declares that Esparza is an insured under Regent's insurance policy and is entitled to UIM coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Stipulated and Uncontroverted Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Regent issued a commercial auto policy to K.C. Bell, Inc. (\"K.C. Bell\"), No. CBA1228034, for the period of April 1, 2016, to April 1, 2017, which was a renewal of a prior policy. The policy provides uninsured (\"UM\") and underinsured motorist (\"UIM\") coverage with limits of $1,000,000 for specific vehicles identified and scheduled in the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 20, 2016, Esparza, a California resident, was in Wichita to complete 30 days of training as a manager for a new Freddy's Frozen Custard franchise in San Diego, California, which is owned by K.C. Bell, Esparza's employer. Esparza did not have a credit card and therefore, a K.C. Bell employee, Tyler Hoover, rented a car for her use while she was training in Wichita. The rental was a 2016 Ford Mustang (the \"rental car\") obtained from Budget Car and Truck Rental of Wichita, Kansas (\"Budget\"). K.C. Bell paid Budget for the rental car as a covered expense benefit to Esparza, however, she was not listed as a driver on the rental car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the last day of her training, Esparza was driving the rental car when it was struck by Baker's car. Baker carried an insurance policy with Farmers Insurance Company (\"Farmers\") containing a liability limit of $30,000. Farmers tendered its policy limit of $30,000 to Esparza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff proceeded pursuant to K.S.A 40-284(f) to give Regent the opportunity to substitute payment. Regent elected not to substitute its payment thereby allowing plaintiff to accept Farmers' policy limit and preserve her UIM claim against Regent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although plaintiff's accident occurred within the commercial policy's applicable period, Regent denied plaintiff's UIM claim based on provisions contained within the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed a workers' compensation claim pursuant to California law and some of her losses will be recovered in that proceeding. Plaintiff sustained personal injury damages because of the collision, however, the exact amount of damages plaintiff is entitled to recover is currently disputed and will be determined at a later date pending the outcome of a determination by the Court on the coverage issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Regent claims that Esparza was not an insured under the policy; Esparza disagrees and seeks a declaratory judgment, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2202, that the UIM provision extends to her as an insured. The parties agree that Regent's policy was issued in Kansas and the issue of coverage under the policy for UIM benefits is governed by Kansas law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Regent denied payment under the policy because Esparza was in a rental car, which, according to Regent, is not a covered auto licensed or principally garaged in Kansas. Regent refers to Item Two, Schedule of Coverages and Covered Autos, and asserts that UM and UIM coverage is limited to Category 6 Covered Autos, which does not include hired or rented autos. Regent contends that K.S.A. 40-284 does not mandate UIM coverage for rented autos, nor under the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On page one, Regent's policy states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Each of these coverages will apply only to those autos shown as covered autos. Autos are shown as covered autos for a particular coverage by the entry of one or more of the symbols from the covered auto section of the business auto coverage form next to the name of the coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Dkt. 23-1, at 2). Category 6 Covered Autos is listed for UM/UIM coverage, which is described as,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [o]nly those 'autos' you own that because of the law in the state where they are licensed or principally garaged are required to have and cannot reject Uninsured Motorists Coverage. This includes those 'autos' you acquire ownership of after the policy begins provided they are subject to the same state uninsured motorists requirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Dkt. 23-1, at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court finds that this provision is unambiguous. Regent limited its UIM coverage to Category 6 Covered Autos, which does not refer to hired or rented autos. However, because Category 6 includes autos subject to a compulsory uninsured motorists law, the court must determine whether Kansas requires UM/UIM coverage under these circumstances-coverage for an employee who has permission to drive a car rented by her employer to further its business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Kansas's UM/UIM Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"In Kansas, every policy of motor vehicle liability insurance is required to provide a minimum coverage for the uninsured motorist of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident, within certain exclusions and limitations of coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Ball By &amp; Through Ball v.

In the Business Auto Coverage Form, under Section II-Liability Coverage, Regent agreed to \"pay all sums an 'insured' legally must pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to which this insurance applies, caused by an 'accident' and resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered 'auto[.]' \" (Dkt. 23-1, at 14).

The court finds that Regent's Kansas Underinsured Motorists Coverage endorsement provides a more restrictive class of insureds for UIM coverage, and therefore, is void.
