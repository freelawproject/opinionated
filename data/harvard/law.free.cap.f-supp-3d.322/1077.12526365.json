Judge Beckerman recommended that the Court deny Petitioner's Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and dismiss the proceeding with prejudice. Judge Beckerman also recommended that the Court issue a Certificate of Appealability on the issue of whether cause exists to excuse Petitioner's procedural default of Ground Eight. The State objects to Judge Beckerman's finding that Ground\n   Eight is timely because it relates back to Ground Seven in Petitioner's original habeas petition, and to Judge Beckerman's recommendation that the Court grant a Certificate of Appealability. Petitioner objects to Judge Beckerman's general conclusion that habeas relief should be denied, to her conclusion that an evidentiary hearing was not necessary, to Judge Beckerman's findings on Grounds One and Six for the reasons stated in Petitioner's previous filings, and to Judge Beckerman's conclusion that cause does not exist to excuse Petitioner's procedural default of Ground Eight. The Court has reviewed Petitioner's original and amended habeas petitions, both sides' briefs before Judge Beckerman, Judge Beckerman's F &amp; R, and the parties' objections and responses. The Court adopts Judge Beckerman's Findings and Recommendation with respect to Grounds One through Seven, and with respect to the timeliness of Ground Eight. The Court concludes, however, that habeas relief is warranted based on Petitioner's Ground Eight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Under the Federal Magistrates Act (\"Act\"), the Court may \"accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

Indeed, the Advisory Committee Notes to Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b) recommend that \"[w]hen no timely objection is filed,\" the Court review the magistrate's recommendations for \"clear error on the face of the record.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Grounds One Through Seven\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Grounds One and Six\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Petitioner objects to Judge Beckerman's findings on Ground One and Ground Six for the reasons stated in Petitioner's previous filings. Petitioner provides no other specific objects to Judge Beckerman's Findings and Recommendation. The Court has reviewed Petitioner's previous arguments relating to Grounds One and Six and adopts Judge Beckerman's Findings and Recommendation with respect to these grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Grounds Two, Three, Four, Five, and Seven\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Petitioner also purports to object to Judge Beckerman's general conclusion that Petitioner's claim for habeas relief should be denied. A \"general\" objection to a Finding and Recommendation does not meet the \"specific written objection[ ]\" requirement of Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Velez-Padro v. Thermo King de Puerto Rico, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3261042\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/465/31/#p32\">\n    465 F.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"Conclusory objections that do not direct the reviewing court to the issues in controversy do not comply with Rule 72(b)\"). Thus, the Court construes Petitioner's arguments as objecting only to Grounds One, Six, and Eight. The Court reviews Judge Beckerman's findings on the remaining grounds for clear error and finds none. Thus, Judge Beckerman's Findings and Recommendation on these grounds is adopted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Evidentiary Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Petitioner also objects to Judge Beckerman's recommendation that the district court deny an evidentiary hearing. Petitioner argues that, at a minimum, this Court should hold an evidentiary hearing on the alleged procedural default of Ground Eight. The Court concludes that no evidentiary hearing is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Ground Eight\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The State objects to Judge Beckerman's finding that Ground Eight is timely because it relates back to Ground Seven in Petitioner's original habeas petition. The Court has reviewed this finding\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and adopts Judge Beckerman's Findings and Recommendation on this ground. The State also objects that Ground Eight is futile; as discussed below, the Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Relevant Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At trial, Noelle Gibson, a nurse at the Children's Center of Clackamas County, testified that she examined the alleged victim in this case, C.Y. ECF 19-1 at 166-201. Nurse Gibson testified that the primary role and function of the Children's Center is to complete a medical evaluation of children suspected to be victims of abuse, to conduct an interview, and to make treatment recommendations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3261042\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/465/31/#p32\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3261042\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/465/31/#p32\">\n    at 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nurse Gibson conducted a physical examination of C.Y., and was also present during an interview in which C.Y. indicated that she had inappropriately been touched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The portions of Nurse Gibson's direct examination relevant to this dispute are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. ... Have you become familiar when you've worked both at OHSU and at the Children's Center in your professional capacity about manners or mechanisms to which children disclose, younger children disclose sexual abuse?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. Okay. Is it uncommon for children to disclose incrementally?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. No, it's not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q. Okay. And when I say disclose incrementally what does that mean to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A.

Okay. And is this phenomenon unusual or controversial in your field?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A. It's not unusual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q. Okay.

Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Q.

Yes, we did.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Q. Okay.

Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   ECF 19-1 at 193-195 (emphasis added). On cross-exam, Nurse Gibson testified that she did not know for sure, in C.Y.'s case, whether C.Y. was in fact \"testing the waters\" by incrementally disclosing. Nurse Gibson also testified that she found\n   <em>\n    no physical evidence of abuse.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 196.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In Ground Eight, Petitioner argues that trial counsel was inadequate for failing to object to Nurse Gibson's testimony regarding incremental disclosures, and to Nurse Gibson's testimony that she recommended that C.Y. undergo \"counseling to deal with the issue of sexual abuse.\" Petitioner argues that this latter testimony implied that Nurse Gibson had concluded that C.Y. was sexually abused, thereby improperly \"vouching for\" or \"bolstering\" C.Y.'s credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Martinez v.

Petitioner submits evidence that attorneys at the Oregon State Public Defender's office (\"OSPD\") believed\n   <em>\n    Trager\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided by the Oregon Court of Appeals and that the issue was ripe for review by the Oregon Supreme Court.

The OCDLA Listserve, Petitioner's evidence suggests, is widely followed among Oregon criminal defense attorneys. ECF 29-1 at 9. According to one attorney employed, at the time of her statement, by the Office of Public Defense Services' Appellate Division, she \"and other attorneys in the State Public Defender's office continued to believe that the issue of whether a diagnosis of sexual abuse in the absence of physical corroborating evidence constituted an impermissible opinion was a viable issue that should continue to be raised at every available opportunity.\" ECF 29-1 at 28. \"[I]t was the consensus among Oregon criminal defense practitioners that ... the issue that eventually prevailed in [\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   ] should be vigorously pursued until the Oregon Supreme Court addressed the issue.\" ECF 29-1 at 2. In short, Petitioner's evidence suggests that criminal defense attorneys in the State \"did continue to raise and preserve th[is] issue until the Supreme Court allowed review in\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   and addressed it.\" ECF 29-1 at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The State does not present any contrary evidence.

The court held that appellate counsel had not acted unreasonably in not raising the issue, based on the fact that counsel had raised \"claims worthy of appeal,\" trial counsel had not preserved the objection, and appellate counsel was operating \"during a time when the Oregon Court of Appeals had repeatedly rejected the argument that ultimately prevailed in\n   <em>\n    Southard.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476301\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/259/#p288\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Trager\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ). Although\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   provides some support for the argument that\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   changed the law in Oregon,\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   also applied a different standard of review, looking specifically at the actions of appellate counsel on direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The State also notes that one affidavit relied upon by petitioner was made by an attorney who is currently suspended. Petitioner explains that this appears to be referring to Rankin Johnson, who was appellate counsel in\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Cruz\n   </em>\n   and whose affidavit Petitioner relies upon. Petitioner notes that Mr. Johnson's suspension \"is not based on a claim that he lacked an understanding of the law.\" The government's assertion that some unnamed attorney whose affidavit is included among several attached as evidence of a prevailing norm in 2008 is currently suspended does not persuade the Court that any particular affidavit should be disregarded on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The State also notes that two affidavits incorrectly state that \"with respect to the admissibility of a diagnosis of sexual abuse, [\n   <em>\n    Trager\n   </em>\n   ] was the only published Oregon case.\" The State cites to the docket in a different case,\n   <em>\n    Saunders v. Nooth\n   </em>\n   , 2:15-cv-48-YY, for this proposition. The two statements in the affidavits to which the State refers in the\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   docket are also included in the affidavits attached by Petitioner in this case.\n   <em>\n    Compare Saunders\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 13, \u00b6 26,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF 29-1 at 13, \u00b6 26; and\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 31-32, \u00b6 6,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF 29-1 at 31-32, \u00b6 6. The State does not explain how the statements in the affidavits are incorrect. The Court presumes that the State refers to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   on the issue of the admissibility of a child sexual abuse diagnosis, which predated\n   <em>\n    Trager.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State argues that these two statements demonstrate that the attached attorney affidavits are inadequately researched and reflect a misunderstanding of the issues at play in\n   <em>\n    Trager.\n   </em>\n   Because\n   <em>\n    Trager\n   </em>\n   dealt with whether a diagnosis was \"scientific evidence,\" rather than whether it constituted improper vouching, which was the issue in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , the Court is not persuaded that these affidavits misstate the relevant case law to the extent that they must be disregarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The State also argues that Petitioner's evidence does not establish a prevailing norm, and that the relevant standard is not whether an attorney's conduct merely\n   <em>\n    diverged\n   </em>\n   from the prevailing professional norm, but whether it was\n   <em>\n    unreasonable\n   </em>\n   under that norm. The State has presented no evidence, however, to contradict Petitioner's evidence of an existing prevailing\n   norm at the time of Petitioner's trial. The State also offers no evidence to establish that trial counsel's performance conformed to prevailing professional norms. Similarly, the State does not cite any cases, or provide any specific argument, to support its suggestion that counsel may have\n   <em>\n    deviated\n   </em>\n   from the prevailing norms but not acted\n   <em>\n    unreasonably\n   </em>\n   under those norms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, the State argues that Petitioner's assertion-and evidence-that the prevailing professional norm was to object to medical diagnoses of sexual abuse is inconsistent with the Oregon Court of Appeals' statement in\n   <em>\n    Volynets-Vasylchenko\n   </em>\n   that it had \"issued written opinions in dozens of cases involving unpreserved claims of error under\n   <em>\n    Southard.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215035\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/246/632/#p638\">\n    246 Or.

As Petitioner argues, the State essentially asks the Court to determine the prevailing professional norm based on the lowest common denominator. Although, as Petitioner acknowledges, not all criminal defense attorneys were objecting to\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   -type testimony, Petitioner's evidence demonstrates that an attorney, to perform competently, was required to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Petitioner has presented persuasive evidence that it was the prevailing professional norm, at the time of Petitioner's trial, to object on\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   -type grounds to the admissibility of diagnoses of child sexual abuse absent physical evidence. The State's asserted reasons for disregarding this evidence are unpersuasive, and the State puts forward no contrary evidence of its own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   There are three remaining issues to address regarding Petitioner's evidence of a prevailing professional norm. First, the evidence is that criminal defense attorneys were objecting to the admission of\n   <em>\n    diagnoses\n   </em>\n   of child sexual abuse, but Nurse Gibson did not directly and explicitly testify about a diagnosis in Petitioner's trial. Specifically, Nurse Gibson did not\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   state that she made a diagnosis of sexual abuse. At trial, Nurse Gibson indicated only that she recommended \"counseling to deal with the issue of sexual abuse.\" If Nurse Gibson's statement did not amount to a diagnosis of sexual abuse, then there is no evidence that it was objectionable under the prevailing professional norm, or that it would be inadmissible under\n   <em>\n    Southard.\n   </em>\n   One could imagine that a nurse, examining a child claiming to be a victim of sexual abuse, might recommend \"counseling to deal with the issue of sexual abuse\" regardless of whether or not that nurse made an actual diagnosis of sexual abuse (and, in fact, in this case Nurse Gibson assessed C.Y. only as \"highly concerning for sexual abuse,\" a characterization that, Petitioner explains, is made when an evaluator does not have enough information to conclude that a child has been sexually abused).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. Volynets-Vasylchenko\n   </em>\n   , a doctor testified that one of the treatment recommendations made for a child alleged to be a victim of sexual abuse is that, among other things, the child \"be entered into individual age appropriate therapy, and that the therapist be skilled in working with children who have been victims of abuse.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215035\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/246/632/#p638\">\n    246 Or.

In the pending case, although Nurse Gibson's recommendation that C.Y. engage in therapy \"to deal with the issue of sexual abuse\" may be slightly less explicit than the statement in\n   <em>\n    Volynets-Vasylchenko\n   </em>\n   , it mirrors the recommendation held inadmissible in\n   <em>\n    Volynets-Vasylchenko\n   </em>\n   and implies that a diagnosis has been rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The second question is whether the evidence presented to the Court sufficiently establishes that all\n   <em>\n    competent\n   </em>\n   attorneys at the time of Petitioner's trial would have objected to an\n   <em>\n    implicit\n   </em>\n   diagnosis of sexual abuse as well as an\n   <em>\n    explicit\n   </em>\n   diagnosis. Although none of the attorney affidavits expressly state as much, in light of\n   <em>\n    Voynets-Vasylchenko\n   </em>\n   's characterization of this as an obvious proposition, the Court concludes that Petitioner's evidence demonstrates that the prevailing professional norm would have been to object to the type of statement that Nurse Gibson made as a diagnosis of child sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The third potential issue with Petitioner's evidence of a prevailing norm is that several of Petitioner's affidavits explain that the prevailing norm was to object to\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   -type statements on the grounds that diagnoses had\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   been inadmissible under Oregon law, properly understood, and that decisions of the Oregon Court of Appeals holding otherwise were incorrectly decided. As discussed above, the Court disagrees with these two underlying assumptions. Ninth Circuit case law does not require a lawyer \"to file a motion which he knows to be meritless on the facts and the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Lowry v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11311124\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/21/344/#p346\">\n    21 F.3d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346 (9th Cir. 1994). Based on the Court's interpretation of Oregon law, an objection on these grounds would have been unmeritorious. To find trial counsel inadequate for failing to raise it, therefore, may seem counterintuitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   There is evidence, however, that the split court in\n   <em>\n    Trager\n   </em>\n   and the fact that\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Cruz\n   </em>\n   quickly overturned\n   <em>\n    Trager\n   </em>\n   's holding that diagnoses were not scientific evidence presented an area that was ripe for review. Additionally,\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Cruz\n   </em>\n   arguably left open the question of whether a diagnosis with no corroborating physical evidence would be admissible, because in\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Cruz\n   </em>\n   there was physical evidence. Further, the evidence is that, regardless of the reason, the Oregon criminal defense bar recognized this as an area of potentially changing law and made a practice of objecting in the interest of defendants. This approach succeeded in\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   , very shortly after Petitioner's trial. As such, the Court finds Petitioner's evidence of a prevailing professional norm compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

The State has not persuasively disputed that evidence. The Court concludes,\n   therefore, that by failing to object to Nurse Gibson's testimony, trial counsel failed to provide \"reasonably effective assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p690\">\n    466 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p690\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, Petitioner's trial took place on March 11-12, 2008, and the Oregon Supreme Court granted review in\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   on April 16, 2008. Petitioner's underlying ineffective assistance of counsel claim is therefore substantial and, as such, Petitioner has established \"prejudice\" for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Martinez.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As discussed above, in order to prevail on a procedurally defaulted claim, Petitioner must also show that \"\n   <em>\n    post-conviction\n   </em>\n   counsel's performance was deficient, and [that] there was a reasonable probability that, absent the deficient performance, the result of the\n   <em>\n    post-conviction\n   </em>\n   proceedings would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    Pizzuto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148202\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/783/1171/#p1178\">\n    783 F.3d at 1178-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2015) (emphasis added). Here, Petitioner filed a formal petition for post-conviction relief in 2012, after the Oregon Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Southard.\n   </em>\n   ECF 18-1 at 69-74. Had post-conviction counsel raised the challenge Petitioner now raises to trial counsel's failure to object to Nurse Gibson's testimony, there is a reasonable probability that Petitioner's post-conviction proceedings would have been different. Although the Oregon Court of Appeals held in\n   <em>\n    Umberger\n   </em>\n   that trial counsel was not inadequate for failing to make a\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   -type objection prior to\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Umberger\n   </em>\n   court did not engage with evidence of a prevailing professional norm, as Petitioner has presented to the Court in this case. Further, had Oregon courts denied Petitioner's request for post-conviction relief, Petitioner may have brought his\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   claim to federal court, and the claim would not have been procedurally defaulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court concludes that under\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

Nurse Gibson's testimony about incremental disclosures was therefore not intertwined with any impermissible vouching. Furthermore, the impermissible vouching with which the testimony was intertwined in\n   <em>\n    Lupoli\n   </em>\n   -a sexual abuse diagnosis without physical evidence-had not been held inadmissible at the time of Petitioner's trial. It is too far attenuated to\n   suggest that trial counsel was inadequate not only for failing to object to a\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   -type diagnosis, to which other attorneys were consistently objecting, but also for failing to object to testimony that was arguably related to testimony that-although not yet held inadmissible-was arguably so.
