LAWSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2012, the State of Michigan's Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) implemented a new automated system to detect and punish individuals who submitted fraudulent unemployment insurance claims. By most accounts, the system did not work well, as it lacked human oversight, it detected fraud by certain claimants where none existed, it provided little or no notice to the accused claimants, it failed in many instances to allow administrative appeals, and it assessed penalties and forfeitures against individuals who were blameless. The plaintiffs are members of a putative class of unemployment insurance claimants who wrongfully were subjected to these false fraud determinations made by the State's automated fraud detection system. They contend that they are collateral damage in the State's war on fraud, and they have sued the companies and individuals whom they believe the State enlisted as its soldiers and officers in that battle. They have asserted a number of theories under federal and state law. In another case brought by different plaintiffs, this Court found flaws in the State's robo-fraud-detection system, and eventually approved a settlement agreement in which the State agreed, among other things, to suspend all collection activity under the automated system (and Michigan enacted new legislation that prohibits fraud determinations based solely on computer-identified discrepancies).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zynda v.

That case addressed prospective relief only against the State.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346847\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/175/791/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346847\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/175/791/\">\n    at 800-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs in this case seek damages for the past harm visited on them by the computer-driven fraud detection system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   All of the defendants have filed motions to dismiss, based on various theories, and the Court heard oral argument on the motions. There is no question these contracted companies and individuals, working along side State officials, played some role in implementing a defective system that placed a significant financial burden on unemployment beneficiaries, and they acted under color of state law when doing so. However, many (but not all) of the claims alleged have little basis in law or are unsupported by pleaded facts necessary to survive dismissal. For the reasons discussed below, each motion to dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts come from the amended complaint and the relevant documents referenced\n   in it that were attached to the motion papers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A. The Plaintiffs\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The amended complaint names five class representatives. Patti Jo Cahoo contends that she was falsely charged with filing a fraudulent claim in 2014 after receiving unemployment benefits, but did not learn of the determination until 2015 when she was denied benefits upon reapplying. She was subsequently evicted from her home and suffered other emotional distress as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Kristen Mendyk was accused of making a fraudulent claim after receiving unemployment benefits in 2009, but was not notified of the determination until November 2016. As a result, she filed for bankruptcy and suffered emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Khadija Cole, a year after receiving unemployment benefits, received a letter notifying her-for the first time-of a fraud determination and assessing a penalty of $29,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Michelle Davison's 2015-2016 state and federal income tax refunds were seized based on false fraud determinations, which she was unaware of until she received a letter from the IRS informing her of the seizure. She was not given prior notice, 60 days to present evidence to oppose the seizure, or consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Hyon Pak's 2012-2014 federal income tax refunds also were seized based on false fraud determinations. He similarly was deprived of notice and opportunity to present evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B. The Automated Fraud Detection Systems\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sometime around 2012, the UIA implemented a \"system rewrite\" that was based primarily on a computer program to detect and control alleged unemployment insurance fraud. The platform-known as the Michigan Integrated Data Automated System (MiDAS)-was created to search for discrepancies in the records of unemployment compensation recipients. As part of the new system, the UIA coordinated collection procedures with employers, other state agencies, and the federal government. MiDAS's electronic \"cross-checking\" mechanism alerted the UIA when income was reported for claimants or when some activity affected a claimant's eligibility for benefits. MiDAS, using an \"income-spreading\" formula, would calculate a claimant's weekly income based on an average of total income received over a quarter, and then \"spread\" the income over each week in the quarter, regardless of whether a claimant truthfully reported no income in one or more weeks. If the system identified a discrepancy between an employer record and corresponding information in the claimant's application, the claimant's file was flagged as a potential case of misrepresentation. MiDAS would then initiate an automated process that could have resulted in termination of benefits, the imposition of restitution and penalties, and criminal prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Once a claim was \"flagged\" as potentially fraudulent, the UIA's system automatically transmitted questionnaires to the claimant, seeking a response within ten days. The questionnaires posed multiple choice questions that resulted in a robo-determination of fraud if a triggering answer were selected. (E.g., \"Did you intentionally provide false information to obtain benefits you were not entitled to receive? Yes/No\"). Although the questionnaires were prompted by a computerized \"suspicion\" of fraud, the notice to the claimant did not include the UIA's basis for that suspicion or grounds for potential disqualification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However, not every person alleged to have made a fraudulent claim received a questionnaire. The questionnaires were to be shared with claimants via their Michigan\n   Web Account Management System (MiWAM) accounts, but in some instances, the system failed to send the questionnaires, or the questionnaires were sent to dormant MiWAM accounts. And because MiDAS reviewed claims from the six preceding years, questionnaires were sent to claimants whose benefits had expired already. The system did not provide any other means of notifying claimants of the questionnaire's existence. Unless a questionnaire actually was sent to a claimant and that claimant regularly checked her MiWAM account, that claimant received no notice of the alleged fraud determination. Failure to respond to the questionnaire within ten calendar days as well as selecting one of the triggering answers in the questionnaire resulted in a default determination that the claimant knowingly and intentionally misrepresented or concealed information to receive benefits unlawfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Once a default determination was made, an initial letter demanding repayment and assessing penalties and interest was to be issued to the claimant. There was no opportunity to appeal or otherwise contest the finding at that point in the process. The statement sent to claimants indicated that penalties for non-payment may include interception of the claimant's state and federal income tax refunds, garnishment of wages, and legal collection activity through a court of law. The punitive assessments regularly totaled between $10,000 and $50,000 and sometimes exceeded $187,000. As was the case with the questionnaires, in some instances, the letters were never mailed to the claimants or were sent to incorrect addresses. The UIA did not verify that the addresses on record were the claimants' current addresses. Moreover, many attempts by claimants to appeal or assert procedural rights were ignored. Some of those claimants who tried to reach the UIA by writing received no acknowledgment that their appeals were received or considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to the initial notification letter, the UIA sent claimants a letter entitled \"Notice of Determination\" that alerted them to the fraud allegation. The letter informed claimants that their actions intentionally misled or concealed information to obtain benefits that they were not entitled to receive, but did not provide any factual basis for that determination. It also announced that benefits were terminated on any active claims and required claimants to pay the amount assessed in an attached document titled \"Restitution (List of Overpayment).\" The amount included repayment of actual benefits paid as well as a statutory penalty for fraudulent misrepresentation of four times that amount. The penalty could have been assessed even if the claimant never actually received benefits from the UIA and without regard to the circumstances of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the second notification letter was issued, the claimant was entitled to appeal a determination of fraud to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) within 30 days. But because of the errors in notifying claimants noted above, many claimants often did not become aware of their assessment until after the appeal deadline passed. When claimants received actual notice, they were told by UIA employees that the lapsed deadline foreclosed their right to appeal. It likely was not until this stage of the process that actual UIA agents took part in evaluating fraud determinations. According to the plaintiffs, the Michigan Auditor General determined that well over 90% of appeals-related calls made to the UIA were never answered, including the last 50,000 calls made to the Agency at the time of the audit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreover, even if claimants were granted an appeal, the plaintiffs say that the UIA's record-keeping practices made it all\n   but impossible to rebut the charges. For instance, when MiDAS became operational, all claim information was stored in a \"legacy\" system and hard copies were not maintained. Although the State, through MiDAS, could access claimant information to make automated fraud determinations, individuals had no access to the materials and were often not provided copies of the information upon which MiDAS relied to make those determinations. Furthermore, the UIA began a practice of sending\n   <em>\n    ex-parte\n   </em>\n   communications to ALJs who heard the post-deprivation appeals, in which the UIA set forth the basis for its fraud determination. When some ALJs expressed concern over those practices and over the high rate of invalid-albeit untimely-fraud appeals, they were removed from hearing fraud cases by defendant McMurtry and other state officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The use of a \"robo-adjudication\" system had significant consequences. In the years material to this suit, the UIA largely did not employ any human review in making these automated determinations. Between October 2013 and August 2015, MiDAS made all fraud determinations. After August 2015, the UIA continued to use MiDAS, but made use of agency personnel to exercise some oversight in the process. However, those personnel exercised no more discretion than their MiDAS counterpart. Moreover, the UIA's contingency fund swelled by approximately $152,000,000 between late 2012 and October 2016. Some claimants submitted payments to the UIA of $250 per month, in perpetuity, to satisfy their assessed debts, even though the Michigan Auditor General eventually determined that of the 22,427 robo-adjudications reviewed, over 93% did not involve fraud at all. Claimants also were automatically ineligible for hardship waivers and deprived of their right to a free advocate under Michigan's Advocacy Assistance Program operated by the UIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   C. The Defendants\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The complaint alleges that three sets of private defendants designed, created, implemented, or maintained the automated system employed by the UIA in adjudicating fraud determinations. The plaintiffs allege there was input and feedback between all private defendants and state officials at every stage of the process, and they all agreed to continue the process even after the defective attributes of the system became widely known. The plaintiffs also allege that these defendants opposed the discharge of a claimant's restitution and penalty debt in bankruptcy with full knowledge that the underlying fraud determinations were invalid and false. According to the amended complaint, the defendants, respectively, engaged in the following conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   1. FAST\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   FAST Enterprises, LLC is a software company with its principal place of business in Centennial, Colorado. Around August 2011, FAST contracted with the State to design, create, implement, configure, control and maintain the MiDAS software used by the Agency to administer unemployment insurance, including fraud investigation, overpayments, collections, and tax intercepts. The amended complaint names the following FAST agents, sued in their individual capacity:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   a. Jeremy Gragg, lead implementation consultant who worked on determination and compliance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   b. Jennifer Tuvell, senior project manager;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   c. Kristen Araki-Tokushige, senior business architect;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   d. Mike Patterson, implementation manager; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   e. Allison Forgie-McClurg, test manager.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2. SAS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   SAS Institute Inc. is a software company with its principal place of business in Cary, North Carolina. Around December 2012, SAS Institute Inc. contracted with the State to design, create, implement, maintain, configure and control the Enterprise Fraud Detection Software (EFDS) used by the Agency to make unemployment insurance fraud determinations. According to the contract, SAS agreed to provide a product that utilized data from the Department of Technology, Management, and Budget (DTMB)'s Data Warehouse in the development of UIA Benefit and Tax fraud detection analysis, and the results of that analysis would be integrated with MiDAS. The contract describes the scope of the project in the following categories: requirements definition, functional design, configuration, testing, implementation, warranty, and maintenance. The contract expired in December 2017. SAS Project Manager Andrew Phillips is sued in his individual capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   3. CSG\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   CSG is a consulting company with its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois. Around January 2010, CSG contracted with the State to run and administer the Project Control Office, charged with oversight responsibility for all aspects of MiDAS. CSG continues to provide full-time, on-site management to oversee MiDAS production, support, and additional initiatives including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   a. Collections, recoupments, and intercepts;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   b. Integrity initiative for EFDS;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   c. Implementation of the Interstate Reciprocal Overpayment Recovery Agreement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   d.

Development of standard operating procedures for the UIA Tax Office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The complaint names the following CSG agents, sued in their individual capacity:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   a. Richard Staten, senior program manager;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   b. Rebecca Rosier, senior program manager;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   c. Dana Rowe, senior business analyst;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   d. Tim Palmer, senior project manager;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   e. Steve Goodhall, senior project manager; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   f. Paul Pluta, senior project manager.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   4. UIA Employees\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The complaint names seven UIA employees, sued in their individual capacity. Steve Geskey was a high ranking supervisor at UIA, set policy, and directed subordinates to pursue false fraud claims against claimants, the plaintiffs allege, despite knowing that those claims were invalid. Shemin Blundell was the head of the UIA's Fraud Unit where she allegedly directed subordinates to pursue false fraud claims against claimants despite knowing that those claims were invalid. Doris Mitchell was head of the UIA's Friend of the Court and Bankruptcy Unit where she directed subordinates to oppose discharge of claimants' debt in bankruptcy proceedings that were based on allegedly false fraud claims despite knowing that the claims were invalid. Clayton Tierney was the UIA projected manager for the integrated system rewrite. Debra Singleton was the head of the Benefit Overpayment Collection Unit at the UIA, where she directed subordinates to pursue aggressive collection activities. Sharon Moffet-Massey was the head of the UIA at all relevant times and pursued the defective and unconstitutional policies alleged. The amended complaint does not state Julie McMurtry's\n   position, but it alleges she removed some ALJs from hearing fraud appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   D. The Plaintiffs' Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint for damages on March 2, 2017. It was amended once, and now states seven counts under state law and six counts under federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The state law claims, brought against the SAS and FAST defendants, are for negligent production (Count 1), breach of implied warranty (Count 2), gross negligence/actual knowledge (Count 3), breach of express warranty (Count 4), and failure to warn (Count 5), as well as one count under state law as to the CSG defendants for negligence (Count 6) and one count under state law as to all defendants for civil conspiracy (Count 13). The federal claims are directed against all defendants. They are for denial of procedural due process (Count 7), equal protection (Count 8), and substantive due process (Count 9), and violations of the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause (Count 10), the Fourth Amendment (Count 11), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206402\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) (Count 12). In their response briefs, the plaintiffs agreed that Count 10 is not ripe for adjudication and consented to its dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   II. Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The four groups of defendants each have filed motions to dismiss; many of their arguments parrot each others, and they can be categorized into attacks on jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), challenges to the merits under Rule 12(b)(6), and failure to join the State as a necessary party under Rule 12(b)(7). SAS Project Manager Andrew Phillips also alleges that the Court has no personal jurisdiction over him, moving for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(2). The UIA defendants also contend that they are entitled to qualified immunity from the federal claims alleged against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A. Joinder of Necessary Party\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The FAST, SAS, and CSG defendants all argue that the amended complaint must be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(7), because the plaintiffs failed to join the State of Michigan as a defendant, which, the defendants contend, is a necessary and indispensable party to the case. Joining the State in a suit for money damages would be problematic for the plaintiffs, of course, because the State enjoys sovereign immunity. But that problem is not presented here, because the State is neither a necessary nor indispensable party to the plaintiffs' surviving claims against those defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The joinder rules compel plaintiffs to sue all persons who are necessary and indispensable to the adjudication of the case.\n   <em>\n    Local 670 v.

Indispensability means that \"(1) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among existing parties,\" or, as relevant here, \"(2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject matter of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person's absence may ... leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1)(A), (B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The FAST, SAS, and CSG defendants all argue that the State, and the UIA in particular, is a necessary party because it is the entity with whom these defendants contracted, and it controls the system that the plaintiffs allege deprived them of their rights. They argue that in the absence of the UIA, it is impermissible to adjudicate the legality of the State's actions in administering the unemployment insurance fraud detection system, and that the UIA should be the party to defend the constitutionality of its program. The defendants also contend that the UIA's absence may subject them to multiple or inconsistent obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Those arguments ignore the reality that UIA employees are parties to the case in their individual capacities, and they have ample motive to defend the constitutionality of their actions. The defendants contend that any ruling that their products and services violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights would affect the defendants' contracts with the UIA, which has an irrevocable license to use the offending software. They believe that the Court cannot accord complete relief because the UIA would not be bound to any judgment, and it has a right to continue using the products and services under the contracts if it so chooses. But the plaintiffs are not seeking prospective relief; they seek damages for past conduct. And, as the defendants point out, the UIA apparently has agreed to discontinue its past robo-fraud determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The defendants' citation of\n   <em>\n    Downing v. Globe Direct LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4170962\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/806/461/\">\n    806 F.Supp.2d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. 2011), does not alter that analysis. In that case, the court held the State of Massachusetts was a necessary party to a class action against a contracting company that mailed registration renewal notices on behalf of the Registry of Motor Vehicles, which the plaintiffs alleged violated the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act (DPPA).

Instead, they seek money damages for past violations of their common law and constitutional rights. Any favorable judgment rendered would not affect the State's irrevocable license to use the products under the contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The defendants relatedly argue that a victory for the plaintiffs may subject the defendants to inconsistent obligations under their contracts with the State. They reason that if their software products are\n   found to play a role in depriving the plaintiffs of their procedural rights and subject them to erroneous fraud determinations, the defendants could be exposed to continuing liability if the UIA continues to use the products, as its contract entitles it to do. That certainly would be a problem for the defendants-although an unlikely one-but it has little to do with affording \"complete relief\" to the parties on the backward-looking claims the plaintiffs have pleaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The UIA's decision to use or discontinue use of the defendants' software products and services is largely governed by the settlement agreement in\n   <em>\n    Zynda v. Arwood\n   </em>\n   . That agreement requires, among other things, the UIA to revamp its policies to comply with federal law, including Department of Labor regulations prescribing procedures that affect fraud determinations and their consequences. Its failure to do so might provoke a new claim or an action to enforce the settlement agreement. But it would not have an impact on what's been done already. A decision on the plaintiffs' constitutional or common law tort claims here would address only the defendants' past conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The SAS and FAST defendants mention in their reply brief that the plaintiffs have failed to explain how joint and several liability factors into Rule 19 analysis, and that liability here is several, not joint. Those observations are not helpful to the defendants. If liability is several, no other parties are necessary to decide an individual defendant's case. And, as the Sixth Circuit has explained, \"[i]n a suit against one joint tortfeasor, a judgment for monetary relief can be completely satisfied without the presence of any other defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Laethem Equip.

The plaintiffs cite terms of CSG's contract to describe the managerial authority delegated to it by the State. Among the deliverables outlined in the contract, CSG's Project Management Office was required to \"support the State-and the State's application development and implementation vendor-in meeting the timely delivery of quality information technology services for all stakeholders of the UI System Modernization project.\" It was also understood that the System Integration Project team would be comprised of both CSG's Project Management Office and the State of Michigan DIT and UIA staff. \"[CSG] is responsible for utilizing and mentoring these State staff.\" These terms support the plaintiffs' allegations that CSG, acting in concert with the State, was \"entwined\" with the UIA in administering and maintaining the robo-fraud-adjudication system that deprived the plaintiffs of their constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The plaintiffs adequately have pleaded state action with respect to CSG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   b. SAS Institute\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The amended complaint alleges that SAS designed, created, implemented, maintained, configured and controlled the EDFS used to make unemployment insurance fraud determinations. It also alleges that SAS received significant encouragement from the State when it designed, implemented, and maintained the defective and unconstitutional fraud detection systems. SAS insists, however, that it was\n   merely an independent contractor that provided software to the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   But SAS's contract also provides additional facts that support the plaintiffs' allegation that SAS maintained the system used to make fraud determinations, and justify the inference that SAS's actions are fairly attributable to the State.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs have alleged SAS implemented and maintained the system that aided in the administration of unemployment benefits.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , SAS's contract suggests it was \"entwined\" with the State and played a non-negligible role in the automated system. The contract requires SAS to schedule, coordinate, and perform all system testing activities to validate that the product will operate in its intended environment, satisfies all user requirements, and is supported with complete and accurate operating documentation. \"The State will provide assistance and input to assist [SAS] with the development of appropriate test data.\" But SAS was responsible for correcting defects discovered during testing and collaborating with the State to improve the system. With respect to system maintenance, the agreement states SAS is responsible, among other obligations, for providing EDFS performance tuning and defect repair. Moreover, SAS was to carry out this project under the direction and control of DTMB and UIA Project Managers. These terms support the plaintiffs' allegations in the complaint and suggest SAS acted \"under color of law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   2.

The individual defendants (including UIA employees) all contend that the amended complaint falls short of that mark. As to the individual employees of SAS, FAST, and CSG, the Court agrees. Not so with the individual UIA employees, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   a. SAS, FAST, and CSG individual defendants\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The amended complaint initially identifies the individually-named SAS, FAST, and CSG employees as agents of their companies and describes their respective positions in paragraphs 12, 13, and 15. What follows, though are merely collective references to them in Counts 7-13-the 1983 claims-without any distinction as to what acts are attributable to whom. Paragraphs 12 and 13 of the complaint include a generic recitation that the SAS and FAST defendants \"designed, created, implemented, maintained, configured and/or controlled\" their respective software programs, and that general description is followed by a brief reference to one or more agents and their job titles. Paragraph 14 states that CSG continues to provide full-time, on-site management to oversee MiDAS production, support, and additional initiatives, and similarly lists job titles of six CSG employees. And paragraph 20 clarifies that all subsequent references to \"Defendants\" means \"all Defendants unless otherwise indicated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Significantly, nowhere else in the complaint do the plaintiffs allege personal involvement of any of the SAS, FAST, and CSG employees or attempt to distinguish their conduct in any way with respect to the constitutional claims. Count 7 makes specific references to the State defendants, but ultimately alleges that \"Defendants' actions and omissions constitute a deprivation\n   of property without due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\" \u00b6 152. Count 8 similarly makes categorical reference to \"Defendants' actions and omissions\" in alleging an equal protection violation. \u00b6 157. Count 9, like Count 7, cites specific conduct by some of the State defendants, but ultimately categorically alleges \"Defendants' conduct was arbitrary and capricious and shocking to the conscience\" to support a substantive due process claim. \u00b6\u00b6 175, 178. In fact, it is not clear whether the plaintiffs, in making references to certain State defendants' conduct in Count 9, intended \"Defendants\" to mean only those State defendants. Moreover, Count 11 (as renumbered) collectively refers to \"Defendants\" in alleging an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, without alleging facts specific to any individual defendant. \u00b6 192. Count 12 states \"at least one of these Defendants participated in the seizure of the tax refunds\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206402\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)'s due process requirements. \u00b6 196. Finally, Count 13-assuming it is brought under \u00a7 1983 -states there was an agreement between \"Defendants\" and \"each Defendant, individually or through its agents\" entered into a conspiracy to eliminate procedural guarantees. \u00b6\u00b6 199.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Collective references to the defendants by themselves does not satisfy\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   's individualized pleading requirement.\n   <em>\n    Marcilis v.

That case is no help to them, however, because there was evidence in that record that the supervisor failed to \"adopt[ ] and implement[ ] an operating procedure that would require a review of the inmate's files before authorizing the transfers in the face of actual knowledge of a breakdown in the proper workings of the department.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7409505\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/69/76/#p81\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here at the pleading stage, no such analogous individualized facts are alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court will grant the motions to dismiss the federal claims against the individually named SAS, FAST, and CSG employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   b.

The Court does not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The complaint names seven State defendants-although the section introducing the \"Defendants\" only provides descriptions of four of them-and includes slightly more detail about their involvement in the fraud adjudication system:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   16.

These plaintiffs were subject to a process that flagged them as potentially fraudulent claimants, where there was no subsequent confirmation that the classification was warranted. The plaintiffs also allege that the practices were arbitrary and not rationally related to administering benefits for the welfare of the State's citizens. The amended complaint indicates that all claimants whose accounts were flagged by a defective computerized\n   system were subject to an automated fraud determination that lacked any human oversight. The plaintiffs describe in sufficient detail how these fraud determinations were made without any factual basis or legitimate investigation by the UIA. There is no conceivable rational basis for terminating benefits based on a defective system and continuing to do so even after discovering the defect.

Subsection (g) explicitly forbids federal court review of the propriety of the diversion. At the same time, however, the statute makes clear that Congress did not intend to immunize the demanding State or its minions from suits by taxpayers to recover wrongfully-seized refunds. To be sure, subsection (f) prescribes notice and hearing obligations on the State, which can be said to establish minimum due process requirements the State must afford the taxpayer before it can resort to diversion of tax refunds. Those obligations plainly are binding on the State. Looking only at subsection (f), one might infer that furnishing those procedural protections approaches \"rights-creating language.\" But\n   that inference is negated by subsection (g)'s divestment of the power to review the diversion. The State can be sued for wrongfully seizing a taxpayer's refund, but authority for that suit will be not found in section 6402 ; the taxpayer must look elsewhere for his legal theory, as the plaintiffs successfully have done in their amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Section 6402 does not prevent a \"legal, equitable, or administrative action against the ...

The State defendants' argument that the plaintiffs have not identified a causal connection between their conduct and the plaintiffs' injury is unpersuasive. The State defendants are agents of the State; the amended complaint alleges that they implemented the programs that caused injury to the plaintiffs. Taking these allegations as true, the State defendants' actions are fairly traceable to the plaintiffs' alleged injuries. The same can be said for the other defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   2. Personal Jurisdiction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   SAS employee Andrew Phillips argues that he did not have the requisite minimum contacts with this forum, and therefore the Court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over him. He also points out that he has never been served with\n   process in this case. The Court agrees that both grounds support a dismissal of defendant Phillips for want of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   As an initial matter, contrary to the plaintiffs' position, defendant Phillips did not waive his right to assert personal jurisdiction in his motion. The pending motion to dismiss is his first Rule 12(b) motion, and he has not otherwise filed a responsive pleading in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   It does not appear that service of process has been effectuated on defendant Phillips. SAS was served process on March 6, 2017, but defendant Phillips was not added as a party to this suit until the plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on July 7, 2017. A summons was issued then, but because no record of service upon Phillips can be found, and more than 90 days have elapsed, the Court \"must dismiss the action against him without prejudice.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Service upon SAS does not satisfy the requirement to serve process on an individual defendant. The Sixth Circuit has explained that when agents of a corporation are sued in their individual capacity, they must be accorded proper service separate from the service effectuated on the corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King v.

It is not enough to serve process on the corporation if the agent is sued individually, \"for without proper service of process ... a court may not exercise personal jurisdiction over a named defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523346\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/650/#p655\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The complaint states that defendant Phillips was a Project Manager for SAS and is sued in his individual capacity. But because he has not been served with process, all counts against him will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   D. State Law Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The SAS, FAST, and CSG defendants also argue that the state law claims against them-based on theories of negligence, breach of warranty, and civil conspiracy-must be dismissed as a matter of law. Those claims (save the conspiracy claim) attempt to stake out causes of action under Michigan's product liability jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   1. Negligence Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Michigan law recognizes claims for defective products under several theories: (1) negligent design; (2) negligent manufacture; (3) failure to warn; and (4) breach of an express or implied warranty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sedgwick Ins. v. F.A.B.E. Custom Downstream Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4268406\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/81/582/#p590\">\n    81 F.Supp.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 590 (E.D. Mich. 2015) (citations omitted). The plaintiffs attempt to include most of those theories, raising five state law claims against SAS Institute and FAST Enterprises: negligent production (Count 1); breach of implied warranty (Count 2); gross negligence/actual knowledge (Count 3); breach of express warranty (Count 4); and failure to warn (Count 5). There also is a negligence claim against CSG (Count 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   The defendants' arguments, taken together, posit that they owed no duty to the plaintiffs under products liability or negligence law because there was no legal relationship with the plaintiffs that triggered a duty, but if there was, the duty cannot extend to economic loss claims. As a corollary, they contend that the plaintiffs have not alleged that the defendants' conduct proximately caused their claimed injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Counts 1 through 3, and 5 and 6, posit that the defendants carelessly designed and maintained a defective automated fraud detection system that yielded inaccurate results, which falsely accused them of fraud, leading to dire economic consequences, coupled with stress and suffering. These claims, particularly the claim for negligent \"production,\" incorporate the separate theories under Michigan law based on manufacturing defect, design defect, and failure to warn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20600.2945\">\n    Mich.

A common thread among those legal theories is the need to establish that a defendant owed a legal duty to the injured person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hammons v.

Mich. 2009) (collecting cases). In\n   <em>\n    Glittenberg v. Doughboy Recreational Industries\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Michigan Supreme Court reiterated that \"[m]anufacturers have a duty to warn purchasers or users of dangers associated with the intended use or reasonably foreseeable misuse of their products.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2014049\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/441/379/#p387\">\n    441 Mich. 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=491%20N.W.2d%20208\">\n    491 N.W.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 211 (1992). The court traced the contours of that duty to the principles laid down in section 388 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   One who supplies directly or through a third person a chattel for another to use is subject to liability to those whom the supplier should expect to use the chattel with the consent of the other or to be endangered by its probable use, for physical harm caused by the use of the chattel in the manner for which and by a person for whose use it is supplied ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 388 (1965).

Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   There is no basis to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to join a necessary or indispensable party. The plaintiffs have not pleaded viable federal claims against\n   the individual employees of defendants SAS, FAST, and CSG. However, they have alleged sufficient facts to support a claim of state action against those companies, and have stated viable claims for deprivation of their rights to procedural due process, equal protection, and freedom from unreasonable seizures of property, except as to UIA employee defendant Clayton Tierney. They have not stated a claim for denial of substantive due process, and there is no private right of action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206402\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs concede that their claim for unlawful taking of property under the Fifth Amendment is not ripe for adjudication. The plaintiffs have not established personal jurisdiction over defendant Andrew Phillips, but they have shown that they have standing to sue and the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the surviving claims. The remaining defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity. And the plaintiffs have not stated viable claims based on state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the motions to dismiss by defendants CSG [dkt. # 55], FAST [dkt. # 58], SAS [dkt. 61], and the UIA employee defendants [dkt. # 104] are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Counts 1 through 6, 9, 10, 12, and 13 of the amended complaint are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the amended complaint is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE IN ITS ENTIRETY\n   </strong>\n   as to defendants Jeremy Gragg, Jennifer Tuvell, Kristen Araki-Tokushige, Mike Patterson, Allison Forgie-McClurg, Richard Staten, Rebecca Rosier, Dana Rowe, Tim Palmer, Steve Goodhall, Paul Pluta, and Clayton Tierney, only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the amended complaint is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN ITS ENTIRETY\n   </strong>\n   as to defendant Andrew Phillips, only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that counsel for the parties appear for a case management conference on\n   <strong>\n    April 3, 2018 at 3:00 p.m.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
