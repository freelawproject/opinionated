Homere and Gerald Jean Baptiste (\"plaintiffs\") bring this action against the Incorporated Village of Hempstead (\"the Village\") and Stephanie Valder (\"Valder\" and, with the Village, \"defendants\"). Plaintiffs allege that, from 2008 through 2017, the Village conspired with Valder and other individuals to harass plaintiffs and to deprive plaintiffs of residential property. The first amended complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appears to assert claims against the Village for (1) malicious prosecution; (2) malicious abuse of process; (3) double jeopardy; (4) violations of substantive due process; (5) conspiracy; and (6) fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to Valder, the complaint appears to assert claims for conspiracy and fraud. On August 14, 2017, the Village moved to dismiss the complaint. (ECF No. 22.) Shortly thereafter, on August 18, 2017, Valder moved to dismiss the complaint as well. (ECF No. 23.) On October 18, 2017, the Court referred the motions to the Magistrate Judge Tomlinson.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   3 Having reviewed the full record and the applicable law, and having reviewed the R&amp;R\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , the Court adopts the thorough and well-reasoned R&amp;R in its entirety. As an initial matter, Magistrate Judge Tomlinson properly disregarded the materials attached to plaintiffs' oppositions to defendants' motions to dismiss, (R&amp;R 10), and the Court likewise declines to consider those materials. To the extent those materials contain facts pertinent to successfully alleging claims against defendants, plaintiffs should incorporate those facts in their second amended complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Claims against the Village\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   45 As a threshold matter, Magistrate Judge Tomlinson correctly explained that, in order to state a claim against the Village, a municipal corporation, plaintiffs must allege (1) the existence of a municipal policy, practice, or custom (2) that caused the deprivation of their constitutional rights. (R&amp;R 14-15.) Magistrate Judge Tomlinson concluded that plaintiffs have failed to allege either element. (R&amp;R 16-20.) Plaintiffs object, and point to their allegations that \"[t]he three main movers (Judge Brantley, Village Attorney DiSalvo, and Special Prosecutor Feinberg) of the Village of Hempstead have collaborated in what is stated in the Plaintiff's complaint.\" (Pls.' Obj. 8.) However, as correctly explained by Magistrate Judge Tomlinson, (R&amp;R 16-20), such conclusory allegations are insufficient for this Court to conclude that it is plausible that a municipal policy, practice, or custom existed. Further, plaintiffs' objections fail to point to any factual allegations to support a plausible claim that the Village deprived them of their constitutional rights. Accordingly, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege that the Village had a policy, practice, or custom that resulted in the deprivation of their constitutional rights, and dismisses the claims against the Village on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   67 Magistrate Judge Tomlinson also determined that plaintiffs' claims suffer from additional pleading deficiencies. With respect to the malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims, Magistrate Judge Tomlinson concluded that the complaint failed to allege a lack of probable cause (for the malicious prosecution claim) or an excuse or justification (for the abuse of process claim). (R&amp;R 20-21.) In objecting, plaintiffs point to an allegation that states, \"Without probable cause - we were subjected to years of harassment by the Court.\" (Pls.' Obj. 11.) However, simply including the phrase \"without probable\n   cause\" is insufficient, and plaintiffs cannot point to any factual allegations to support a plausible claim that there was a lack of probable cause or a lack of an excuse or justification. With respect to the malicious prosecution claim, Magistrate Judge Tomlinson further concluded that the complaint does not allege that the prosecution ended favorably to plaintiffs. In response, plaintiffs point to allegations that the charges against them were dismissed in April 2014. (Pls.' Obj. 10.) However, as plaintiffs point out in their objections (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), the complaint also includes allegations that a trial on the charges against them \"took place and ended on April 11, 2016 and as of today no decision has been received.\" Accordingly, the Court agrees with Magistrate Judge Tomlinson that the complaint fails to plausibly allege that the prosecution against plaintiffs ended favorably to plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   8 With respect to plaintiffs' claims for double jeopardy violations, Magistrate Judge Tomlinson concluded that plaintiffs \"have failed to plead facts that plausibly support the theory that they have been either acquitted or convicted of criminal charges in the Village Court, that they have been prosecuted a second time following any conviction or acquittal, or that they have suffered multiple punishments for the same offense.\" (R&amp;R 22-23.) The Court agrees. Plaintiffs' objections again fail to point to any factual allegations in the complaint that sufficiently allege double jeopardy violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   9 As for the conspiracy claim against the Village, Magistrate Judge Tomlinson concluded that the claim should be dismissed because the supporting allegations are \"entirely speculative and conclusory.\" (R&amp;R 25.) The Court again agrees. Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege that there was any agreement between the Village and a private party to act in concert to inflict constitutional injury on plaintiffs. In their objections, plaintiffs point to the exact allegations that Magistrate Judge Tomlinson correctly found insufficient to establish a Section 1983 conspiracy claim. Accordingly, the conspiracy claim against the Village is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs also appear to assert violations of their substantive due process rights. Magistrate Judge Tomlinson concluded that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for substantive due process violations because the allegations, even taken as true, do not allege conduct that shocks the conscience. The Court agrees. Plaintiffs' objections are purely rhetorical, and fail to point to any allegations in the complaint. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the claims asserting violations of plaintiffs' substantive due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   10 Finally, Magistrate Judge Tomlinson recommends that, to the extent plaintiffs assert state law claims against the Village, those claims should be dismissed for failure to serve a notice of claim. Plaintiffs' objections simply state that \"Judge Tomlinson is wrong about Plaintiffs['] failure to file a Notice of Claim,\" but fail to establish that plaintiffs in fact served a notice of claim on the Village. Accordingly, to the extent plaintiffs attempt to allege state law claims against defendants, those claims are dismissed for failure to serve a notice of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Claims against Valder\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   11 As noted above, plaintiffs appear to assert claims for conspiracy and fraud against Valder. With respect to the conspiracy claim, Magistrate Judge Tomlinson correctly concluded that plaintiffs have failed to allege that Valder conspired with the Village to inflict constitutional injuries on the plaintiffs. (R&amp;R 27-28.) The Court agrees. In objecting, plaintiffs reassert arguments considered and correctly rejected by Magistrate Judge Tomlinson. In any event, the allegations upon which plaintiffs\n   rely-for example, that Valder was the only stenographer assigned to their case (Pls.' Obj. 19-20)-fail to plausibly allege that Valder conspired with the Village to deprive plaintiffs of constitutional rights. Accordingly, the Court dismisses plaintiffs' conspiracy claim against Valder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, Magistrate Judge Tomlinson concluded that \"[p]laintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to plausibly show any of the elements of common law fraud.\" (R&amp;R 28-29.) The Court agrees. Plaintiffs' objections to this conclusion are largely irrelevant, and fail to point to any allegations supporting a claim for fraud against Valder. (Pls.' Obj. 20.) Accordingly, the Court dismisses the claim for fraud against Valder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   12 Although plaintiffs have not requested leave to amend, the Court has considered whether plaintiffs should be given an opportunity to re-plead. Under Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \"court should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). The Second Circuit has emphasized that district courts should not dismiss\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaints \"without granting leave to amend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication that a valid claim might be stated.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuoco v. Moritsugu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11239681\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/99/#p112\">\n    222 F.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112 (2d Cir. 2000) ;\n   <em>\n    Gomez v. USAA Fed. Sav. Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11638568\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/171/794/#p795\">\n    171 F.3d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 795 (2d Cir. 1999). In light of plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status, and because the Court is unable to determine at this juncture that amendment would necessarily be futile, the Court grants plaintiffs leave to amend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the foregoing reasons and the reasons set forth in the R&amp;R, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Court adopts the thorough and well-reasoned R&amp;R in its entirety. Accordingly, the first amended complaint is dismissed. The Court grants plaintiffs leave to submit a second amended complaint, which must be filed within 45 days from the date of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court certifies pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) that any appeal from this Order would not be taken in good faith, and, therefore,\n   <em>\n    in forma pauper is\n   </em>\n   status is denied for the purpose of any appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coppedge v.

Homere and Gerald Jean Baptiste (\"Plaintiffs\") bring this action against Defendants Incorporated Village of Hempstead (\"the Village\") and Stephanie Valder (\"Valder\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"). Plaintiffs allege that between 2008 and 2017, the Village, in collusion with Valder and other private individuals, engaged in harassing conduct towards Plaintiffs for the ultimate purpose of depriving them of their residential property. Plaintiffs allege this conduct amounted to, among other things, malicious prosecution, fraud, abuse of process, and conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint (\"Am.

Allegations Against the Village\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the chronology of Defendants' alleged conduct is somewhat difficult to discern, the Court has distilled Plaintiffs' allegations against the Village as follows. Plaintiffs owned property located at 196 Long Beach Road in the Village of Hempstead, New York (\"the Property\"), where they were residential landlords.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. at 3. In 2008, Plaintiffs became subject to a \"constant barrage of harassment by a housing inspector George Foster with the acquiescence of his superior Assistant Superintendent Joseph Simone. They colluded with a Section 8 tenant (Janice Henderson) to create [building code] violations for us to be charged with.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. According to Plaintiffs, there is evidence that these building code violations were fraudulent based on the fact that \"none were reported to Section 8.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Plaintiffs assert that in December 2009, they shared their grievances with the Mayor of the Village, Wayne Hall, who promised to assist them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. As a result of a request from Mayor Hall to Arthur Chenault, Superintendent of the Building Department, Plaintiffs learned on January 27, 2010 that close to fifty violations were dismissed by Matthew Feinberg, the special prosecutor for the Village.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Feinberg conveyed this news to Plaintiffs himself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In October 2013, Plaintiffs allege they \"were brought back to Court to address the same charges that were dismissed by the special prosecutor on January 27,\n   2010.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. According to Plaintiffs, this was a \"new round of harassment as a means to gain leverage,\" which Village officials commenced when they \"realiz[ed] they were exposed because [Plaintiffs] had retained an attorney and [ ] the charges would have to be dismissed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.

Although the Court could potentially overlook\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' failure to recite the specific language associated with Section 1983 municipal liability, namely, that the Village maintained an \"official policy, practice or custom,\" Plaintiffs' allegations, even when viewed in the most favorable light, do not plausibly allege any of the circumstances through which a plaintiff can establish the existence of a municipal policy, practice, or custom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As noted above, for Section 1983 municipal liability to attach, Plaintiffs' allegations must sufficiently set forth a deprivation of a constitutional right based on the existence of at least one of four factors: (1) a formal, officially endorsed policy; (2) actions taken by official municipal policymakers; (3) a widespread municipal practice so pervasive that supervising policymakers must have been aware; or (4) a failure by policymakers to provide adequate training or supervision to subordinates to such an extent that it amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of those who come into contact with the municipal employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tieman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201379652\">\n    2015 WL 1379652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *13 (citation omitted). The essence of Plaintiffs' claims against the Village is that its officials, in collusion with third parties, (including Plaintiffs' Section 8 tenants and a stenographer), concocted a \"broad[ ] scheme to keep [Plaintiffs] distracted and preoccupied in order to facilitate the complete takeover of [their] property by Mr. Levy, an official in the treasurer's Office in the Village.\" Am. Compl. at 3. In this context, Plaintiffs allege that Village officials committed several discrete illegal acts: (1) Village attorneys made misrepresentations to either the Court and/or Plaintiffs regarding the judicial proceedings against them,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2; (2) a Village official manipulated tax records for the purpose of taking ownership of Plaintiffs' property,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3; and (3) Village officials in collusion with a private individual fabricated a transcript for a court proceeding that never took place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 4-6. However, Plaintiffs have not set forth that any of this conduct constituted a formal, officially endorsed policy or practice of the Village. Nor are Plaintiffs able to show they suffered at the hands of official policymakers. Indeed, the only official policymaker referenced in the Amended Complaint, Mayor Hall, purportedly\n   <em>\n    assisted\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

Plaintiffs' ability to allege the existence of a Village policy, practice,\n   or custom necessary for Section 1983 municipal liability would therefore depend on their ability to plausibly demonstrate either a widespread municipal practice or a failure by policymakers to provide adequate training or supervision. Plaintiffs' assertions are too speculative and conclusory to plausibly convey the existence of either of these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The allegations of the Amended Complaint constitute a theory of conspiracy and harassment founded on little more than speculation.

Similarly, Plaintiffs allege that \"when Ms. Brantley the Village Justice, created the document referred to as [the] transcript, she was giving cover to the prosecutor (Mr. Feinberg) that fabricated records to validate our prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.
