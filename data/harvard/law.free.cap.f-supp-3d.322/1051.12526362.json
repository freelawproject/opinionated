INTRODUCTION.\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Fredrick R. Honig bought land on Maui zoned for agricultural use. Honig leased the land to Plaintiff Spirit of Aloha Temple, which, in turn, applied for a Special Use Permit to build a church and hold religious events on the land, uses not allowed without a Special Use Permit in the agricultural zone in which the land was located. After the requested Special Use Permit was denied, Plaintiffs filed this action, asserting religious discrimination.

With respect to the Paia-Haiku Community Plan and County of Maui zoning, the property was designated for agricultural use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 183-3, PageID # 2584. Honig knew the property was designated for agricultural and conservation use when he purchased it. Honig Depo. at 43. In fact, Honig had asked his realtor to locate agricultural land for him to purchase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2003, Honig transferred the property to the Trustee of The Frederick R. Honig Revocable Living Trust Dated October 1, 1996. The document stated that Honig was also known as Swami Swaroopananda.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 183-2, PageID #s 2503-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In July 2002, Honig, on behalf of Well Being International, applied for the trade name of Maui Gay Weddings, stating that the nature of the business was \"Counseling and commitment ceremonies.\" ECF No. 183-2, PageID # 2518. In April 2003, Honig renewed the Maui Gay Weddings trade name on behalf of Well Being International.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 2520. At the same time, Honig, on behalf of Well Being International, applied for the trade name of A Marriage Made in Heaven, again stating that the purpose of the business was \"Counseling and commitment ceremonies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 2522. A little more than a month later, Honig, on behalf of Well Being International, applied for the trade name of Maui Wedding Planners, this time stating that the nature of the business was\n   \"Wedding Planning &amp; Services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 2524. In July 2007, Honig, on behalf of Well Being International, renewed the trade name of A Marriage Made in Heaven.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 2525. Honig admits that these trade names were created so that Well Being International could advertise for weddings or sacred unions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Honig Depo. at 73, ECF No. 183-2, PageID # 2439. Between September 8, 1996, and December 5, 2015, over 500 weddings were performed on Honig's property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 183-16, PageID #s 3037-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In November 2005, Honig signed a lease of the Haumana Road property to Well Being International on behalf of himself as lessor and as the president of the lessee. The lease rent was $3,400 per month and the lease ran through September 30, 2010. The lease provided that use of the property was \"To Be in accordance with Agricultural zoning and Maui County ordinances.\" ECF No. 183-2, PageID #s 2550-56. At the time the lease was signed, the property was apparently owned by the Trustee of The Frederick R. Honig Revocable Living Trust Dated October 1, 1996, not Honig individually.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 183-2, PageID #s 2503-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September 2007, Spirit of Aloha Temple, Inc., was incorporated; Honig was listed as its Senior Minister.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID #s 2557-72; Decl. of Frederick R. Honig \u00b6 4, ECF No. 185-1; PageID # 3123. Honig and Spirit of Aloha Temple practice \"Integral Yoga,\" which \"integrates the eight branches of Yoga into a holistic approach to experiencing Unitive Consciousness.\" Honig Decl. \u00b6 5, ECF No. 185-1; PageID # 3123. For purposes of the present motions, the County of Maui does not contest the validity of Honig's religion or the sincerity of his beliefs. Thus, William Spence, of the County of Maui, stated during his deposition that the County was expressing no opinion as to the sincerity of Plaintiffs' religious beliefs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition of William Spence at 130, ECF No. 185-5, PageID # 3206. He did note, however, that some of the proposed uses might not be religious in nature, such as a commercial wedding business or helicopter flights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131-32, PageID #s 3207-08. The number of weddings held on the property causes the County of Maui to characterize Plaintiffs as conducting a commercial wedding venture on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The County of Maui also believes that the Special Use Permit was not actually sought for church functions. For example, the County of Maui points out that Honig's sister, Meenakshi Honig, who testified that she is a board member of Spirit of Aloha Temple, has never seen the lease for the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No 183-10, PageID #s 2925, 2932. She further testified that there are no regular congregations of church members on the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 2936. She also testified that performimg weddings is \"not essential to the belief system\" of Integral Yoga.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 2937.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 12, 2007, Spirit of Aloha Temple, through Honig, applied for a Special Use Permit for the property to be used for a \"Church, church operated bed and breakfast establishment, weddings, special events, day seminars, and helicopter landing pad.\" ECF No. 183-3, PageID # 2592. The application stated that the property was currently being used for a \"Botanical Garden &amp; Agriculture.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On June 30, 2008, Spirit of Aloha Temple amended the Special Use Permit application to include the development of the Spirit of Aloha Temple, stating, \"Church activities would include a weekly service, classes, special events, day programs and weddings.\" ECF No. 183-3, PageID # 2593. The court notes that, at the time of the 2007 application, the property appears to have been leased to Well Being International,\n   not Spirit of Aloha Temple.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 183-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 28, 2008, the County sent the Special Use Permit application out for agency comment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Concise Statement \u00b6 12; Plaintiff's Concise Counter Statement, ECF No. 193, PageID # 3799 (admitting same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 30, 2010, the Planning Commission for the County of Maui held a hearing on the Special Use Permit application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision and Order of Maui Planning Commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 183-3, PageID # 2583. The Maui Planning Commission voted 5 to 3 to deny the application, reasoning that a proposed heliport was not allowed under the Maui County Code, that many of the buildings on the property lacked permits, and that agricultural property was not intended for commercial purposes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID #s 2586-87; 2590.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 17, 2010, Plaintiffs unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of the denial of the Special Use Permit, arguing that the denial violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 and proposing that the permit be amended to include only a church and related church activities.\n   <em>\n    Id..\n   </em>\n   PageID # 2587-88; 2590.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In December 2011, Honig, as Trustee of The Frederick R. Honig Revocable Living Trust, leased the property to Spirit of Aloha Temple, Inc., for $5,000 per month through December 1, 2019. ECF No. 183-2, PageID # 2575-78. The lease stated that the property was to be used \"As a Botanical Garden[ ] in accordance with Agricultural zoning and Maui county ordinances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 2575. Honig says that Spirit of Aloha Temple did not look at any other properties before leasing the Haumana Road property. According to Honig, the property is sacred and is the world's \"most perfect property.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Honig Depo. at 142-43, ECF No. 183-2, PageID # 2456; Honig Decl. \u00b6 27, ECF No. 185-1; PageID # 3128 (\"The Property itself is uniquely sacred to me and the Spirit of Aloha Temple.\").

This spiritual activity includes religious services, sacred events such as weddings and baptisms, and classes on spiritual beliefs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31, PageID # 3129. In addition, the founder of Integral Yoga, Sri Swami Satchidananda, blessed the property in 1997.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23, PageID # 3127.

The County of Maui ordered Honig to cease and desist the conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 183-8, PageID #s 2877-78. The County of Maui and Honig ultimately settled these matters.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID #s 2877-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 21, 2012, Spirit of Aloha Temple, through Honig, submitted a second Special Use Permit application to use the property for church activities. ECF No. 183-6, PageID #2803. Spirit of Aloha Temple sought to use the property for a classroom on weekdays; a weekly church service; and educational, inspirational, and spiritual events, including \"Hawaiian Cultural Events, such as Hula performances, Seminars on Hawaiian Plant Based Nutrition, Cultural Music Performances, and Spiritual commitment ceremonies including Weddings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 2811.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Maui Planning Department issued a report to the Maui Planning Commission that recommended approving the 2012 Special Use Permit application with conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 183-7, PageID # 2842-62. The staff report examined the applicable statutes and regulations, noting that the proposed use was not permitted in a state agricultural district.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 2849.

These \"guidelines\" were set forth in Hawaii Administrative Rules \u00a7 15-15-95. The staff report examined all of the \"guidelines.\" In relevant part, the staff report indicated that the proposed use satisfied the second and third guidelines, and that the proposed uses would not affect surrounding properties or unreasonably burden public agencies by requiring provision of roads, sewers, water, drainage, school improvements, or police and fire protection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID #s 2854-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The staff report ultimately recommended granting the requested Special Use Permit with conditions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Classroom\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   - Events permitted for a total of 24 attendees (including employees/staff) and that classes shall be limited to four (4) per week usually between 10 AM and 4 PM\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Church Service\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   - Events permitted for a total of 24 attendees (including employees/staff) and that a church service shall be limited to one\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) per week usually between 10 AM and 2 PM on Saturdays\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Church Related Special Events Such as Weddings/Inspirational Events Shall be Limited by the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Maximum number of church related events per year - 48\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   - 24 events out of a total of 48 events may have a total of between 25 to 40 participants including employees/staff\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   - Events permitted for a total of 25 to 40 participants are limited to two (2) per month\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   - The remainder of 24 church related events shall be limited for up to 24 people, including employees/staff\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   - In no case may there be more than four (4) church related events per month\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   - Shuttles must be employed to transport participants for events with 25 or more people\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   - Church related events shall be held between 10 AM and 8 PM\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742101\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/1059/#p1066\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 2844.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Maui Planning Commission then examined the 2012 Special Use Permit request, receiving testimony supporting and opposing it. Concerns were raised with respect to the limitations and dangers of Haumana Road, pedestrian and child safety, weddings, parties, and alcohol on the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Concise Statement \u00b6 35; Counter Concise Statement \u00b6 35 (admitting same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Specifically, the Maui Planning Commission's Findings of Facts and Minutes noted that: (1) Jessica Caudill had expressed concern that the proposed uses would dramatically increase traffic on Haumana Road (where cars have to pull off the road to let other cars pass), would have negative effects on pedestrian safety, and raised child safety concerns by bringing strangers to the area; (2) Antonio Piazza had expressed concern that Plaintiffs had been using the property for unpermitted commercial wedding operations even after Honig's earlier\n   request to conduct weddings on the property had been denied, increasing traffic in the area and creating danger because partygoers drank alcohol; (3) Nancy Gilgoff had expressed concern that, because alcohol was being served at events, there was increased traffic and an increased likelihood of vehicle and pedestrian accidents; (4) Stephanie Gilgoff had expressed concern with respect to increased traffic, road safety, and the impact on the quiet neighborhood; (5) William Knowlton had recalled that earlier cliffside weddings had blocked ocean access, and there were past illegal commercial weddings, transient vacation rentals, and yoga classes; and (6) Daniel Mizner had noted that the proposed uses were inconsistent with the agricultural zoning and had expressed concern about roadway safety because the road was only 10 feet wide at points. Lani Starr, on the other hand, supported the proposed permit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 185-9, PageID #s 3280-82; ECF No. 183-9, PageID #s 2905-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Robbie Naish, Plaintiffs' neighbor, told the Planning Commission in March 2010 that low-speed accidents occurred on the road all the time, that he had had near misses, and that he had personally seen two overturned cars on the narrow Haumana Road. He complained that people drove too fast on the road and noted that there was no place to pull off the road. ECF No. 183-4, PageID #s 2708-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Various departments also commented on Plaintiffs' Special Use Permit application. For example, although the Maui Police Department did not object to the issuance of the permit, it noted that the road to the Haumana Road property was \"narrow with no lane markings and no street lights.\" It further noted that the road was so narrow that it \"could not accommodate two vehicles to pass through the road at the same time.\" The Police Department recommended that the road be widened because, if cars parked on the road, emergency vehicles would not be able to pass them and reach the property. It also suggested that street lighting be installed. ECF No. 183-9, PageID # 2894-95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Land and Natural Resources also commented on the 2012 Special Use Permit application, noting that its approval was needed before any of the proposed activities began.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 183-9, PageID # 2898-99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The State of Hawaii Department of Health, Safe Drinking Water Branch, noted that it had been dealing with Honig for several years. It stated that, if the average daily number of people visiting the proposed temple over 60 days was 25 or more, the temple would be required to comply with all requirements for public water systems. That is, such requirements would be mandatory if the temple had more than 60 events in a year with 25 or more attendees. ECF No. 183-9, PageID # 2900-01.

The proposal calls for non-agricultural uses. In addition, business uses may bring additional traffic to the property. These non-agricultural uses will eventually impact the existing botanical garden activities, since the school, weddings, and other commercial performances may be more profitable than the botanical garden activities on-site.

The commission finds that granting the Application would adversely affect the health and safety of residents who use the roadway, including endangering human life. The Commission finds that the health and safety of the residents' and public's use of Haumana Road is a compelling government interest and that there is no less restrictive means of ensuring the public's safety while granting the uses requested in the Application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   ECF No. 185-9, PageID # 3288-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Like the staff report, the Maui Planning Commission noted that section 205-6 of Hawaii Revised Statutes allows certain \"unusual and reasonable uses\" within agricultural and rural districts, in addition to uses for which the property is classified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3289. The Maui Planning Commission stated that, to determine whether a proposed use is an \"unusual and reasonable use,\" section 15-15-95 of Hawaii Administrative Rules sets forth \"guidelines.\" Those guidelines address whether the proposed use \"would not adversely affect surrounding property\" and \"would not unreasonably burden public agencies to provide roads and streets, sewers, water, drainage, and school improvements, and police and fire protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3290 (quoting Haw.

Specifically, the Commission said that the proposed uses \"would adversely affect the surrounding properties\" given concerns about the safety of Haumana Road, and that the proposed uses would increase traffic and burden public agencies in charge of roads and streets, and in charge of police and fire protection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3290.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Commission then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The Religious Land Use and Institutional Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(a)(1), requires that a state or local government may not impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or institution unless the government demonstrates that the burden is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is\n   the \"least restrictive means\" of furthering that interest. The Commission found that the county has a compelling interest in protecting the health, lives, and safety of the public. The Commission further found that Haumana Road did not meet the standard requirements regarding width of agricultural or rural roads, and additionally that it was one lane in sections and winding, which impaired sight distance and accessibility. The Commission further found that there were compelling public health and safety issues implicated by the likely significant increase in traffic attributable to the uses proposed by the Application, creating conditions that would be foreseeably dangerous or potentially deadly to drivers and pedestrians, including children walking on the road to and from the bus stop at the top, using the small rural roadway. The Commission found that inclement weather would increase the likelihood of accidents and human injuries or death. The Commission found that these compelling public health and safety issues could not be adequately addressed by the implementation of any permit condition or use restriction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   ECF No. 185-9, PageID # 3291.

It appears that the County of Maui may have been raising res judicata or collateral estoppel when it argued that Hawaii's circuit court had already determined that the denial of the permit was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion and that the compelling interest test was satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 182-1, PageID # 2392. While this court does not require the incantation of \"magic words\" like \"res judicata\" or \"collateral estoppel,\" the County of Maui may not prevail by simply raising the issue without any analysis of the law or any discussion of how the specific facts of this case fit within that law. The Maui Planning Commission denied the Special Use Permit application,\n   concluding that it did not violate RLUIPA. Plaintiffs appealed that decision to Hawaii's circuit court, which determined that the Maui Planning Commission did not err in its legal conclusions and did not abuse its discretion. Without knowing whether claims and/or issues in this case were or could have been raised in the appeal to Hawaii's circuit court, this court cannot determine whether it is or is not giving full effect to the state-court decision. For that reason, the motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Even turning to the merits of the claims, the court concludes, for reasons discussed in the present order, that no party has demonstrated entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In 2011, after its initial Special Use Permit application was denied, Spirit of Aloha Temple entered into an agreement to lease the property from Honig. It arguably knew or should have known that it might not get a Special Use Permit for the proposed temple. Spirit of Aloha Temple may have reasonably believed that it would nevertheless receive the permit because it was amenable to any reasonable condition and it actually orally amended the permit application to have fewer events and to end most of those events during daylight hours. But whether it was reasonable for Spirit of Aloha Temple to expect that it would get the Special Use Permit under these circumstance or whether it created its own burden are questions of fact not resolvable on the present record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Given issues of fact, this court has no reason to rule on whether the County of Maui satisfies the strict scrutiny test. The court does, however, recognize that the County of Maui has asked this court to rule that, even if it did impose a substantial burden, it had a compelling interest in the health and safety of its citizens and used the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. On the present record, the court cannot determine that, as a matter of law, the County of Maui used the least restrictive means in denying the permit application. Whether viable less restrictive\n   means were available is yet another question of fact. For example, Randall S. Okaneku posits that sight lines along Haumana Road could have been improved by cutting back vegetation or widening the road.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Randall S.

This is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated be treated the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    High Tech Gays v. Defense Indus. Sec.

In addition to the res judicata and/or collateral estoppel issue discussed earlier, there is a factual issue as to whether the County of Maui treated secular groups more favorably than Spirit of Aloha Temple. The Maui Planning Commission granted a Special Use Permit to Ali'i Kula Lavender Farm to conduct tourism activities, including agricultural classes and workshops, to operate a gift shop, to conduct wedding ceremonies, and to have catered receptions and other special events. See ECF No. 185-13, PageID # 3402. It also granted a Special Use Permit to Hale Akua Garden Farm Retreat Center for a well-being education operation with overnight accommodations. See ECF No. 185-16, PageID #s 3470, 3484, 3494. Interpreting the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the court concludes that the County of Maui has not shown that differences with these other businesses would preclude a reasonable jury from finding discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   All three groups sought to use agricultural land for nonagricultural purposes. Ali'i Kula Lavender Farm and Hale Akua Garden Farm Retreat Center received permits for nonagricultural activities, while Spirit of Aloha Temple did not. But this court cannot tell whether the reason Spirit of Aloha Temple was denied the permit was because of religious discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Accordingly, the court denies the County of Maui's motion for summary judgment with respect to the religious discrimination claims asserted in Counts II and VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Count IV--Equal Terms Under RLUIPA.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Both parties seek summary judgment with respect to Count IV of the Complaint, which asserts a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(b)(1). That section prohibits government entities from imposing or implementing \"a land use regulation in a manner that treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution.\" The Ninth Circuit has stated that the elements of a \u00a7 2000cc(b)(1) violation are: (1) there must be an imposition or implementation of a land-use regulation, (2) by a government, (3) on a religious assembly or institution; (4) on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Centro Familiar Cristiano Buenas Nuevas v.

Ali'i Kula Lavender Farm and Hale Akua Garden Farm Retreat Center received permits for nonagricultural activities, while Spirit of Aloha Temple did not. The Maui Planning Commission said it was denying Spirit of Aloha Temple's permit because of concerns about increased traffic on the Haumana Road. Although Ali'i Kula Lavender Farm and Hale Akua Garden Farm Retreat Center had access roads that were also narrow, those roads appear to have been wider than Haumana Road. The road to the Ali'i Kula Lavender Farm may be 18 feet wide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 185-14, PageID # 3412; ECF No. 185-5, PageID # 3229. Alternatively, it may range from from 12 to 20 feet wide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Randall S. Okaneku \u00b6 27, ECF No. 185-2, PageID# 3144. The road to Hale Akua Garden Farm Retreat Center is approximately 20 feet wide, with short stretches that are narrower.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754463\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/1163/#p1170\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3473; ECF No. 185-5, PageID # 3225. This differs from Haumana Road, which is on average about 15 feet wide, narrowing to 10 feet at many spots, making it too narrow for two cars to pass in many places.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 183-4, PageID # 2708; ECF No. 185-9, PageID #s 3282. Thus, there are differing road sizes for the religious and secular groups.

The exception applicable here is a Special Use Permit granted by a county planning commission, as set forth in section 205-6 of Hawaii Revised Statutes. In considering whether to grant or deny Plaintiffs' Special Use Permit application, the Maui Planning Commission was guided by Maui County Code, Title 19, Article II, Chapter 19.30A.\n   <em>\n    https://library.municode.com/hi/county of maui/codes/code of ordinances?nodeId=TIT19ZO ARTIICOZOPR CH19.30AAGDI 19.30A.060SPUS\n   </em>\n   .

Those subsections state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Certain \"unusual and reasonable\" uses within agricultural and rural districts other than those for which the district is classified may be permitted.

In particular, this court is concerned about the effect, if any, that should be given to the state court order and judgment that determined that the Maui Planning Commission did not abuse its discretion in denying the permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   On November 17, 2016, the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit, State of Hawaii, affirmed the Maui Planning Commission's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 183-14. In relevant part, the court ruled that it \"cannot find clear error in the Maui Planning Commission's factual findings or error in its legal conclusions. Moreover, the Commission's decision does not appear to be arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266981\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/1214/#p1222\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3005. No appeal was taken. To the extent Plaintiffs are now arguing that the Maui Planning Commission's decision is unconstitutional in that the Maui Planning Commission exercised unbridled discretion, such a challenge may well be something that could have been litigated in state court, which examined whether the county had abused its discretion. Because the parties did not sufficiently address the state court administrative appeals process in their briefs, this court cannot tell whether it should give the state court judgment preclusive effect as to Count V. At this point, this court denies the motion for summary judgment with respect to Count V. The court leaves Count V for later proceedings in which the court can discern the applicability or inapplicability of the res judicata and collateral estoppel doctrines or the waiver of those doctrines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In so ruling, the court recognizes that, at the hearing, Plaintiffs pointed to their reservation of right to bring their prior restraint argument. However, this court cannot tell whether that representation is correct or affects the res judicata and/or collateral estoppel analysis, as no party briefed what effect should be given to the state-court ruling in connection with Count V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The court also notes that, under Rule 5.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, when a party files a pleading, written motion, or other paper that questions the constitutionality of a state statute, the party must file a notice of constitutional question\n   and serve the notice on the state attorney general. While Plaintiffs are challenging the constitutionality of an administrative rule promulgated by the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, rather than a state statute, the court, under the circumstances presented here, orders Plaintiffs to file a Notice of Constitutional Question that specifically identifies the constitutional issue being raised with respect to the administrative rule. Plaintiffs must then serve a courtesy copy of the notice, the Complaint, and this order on the attorney general for the State of Hawaii, along with a cover letter that explains why these documents are being sent to the attorney general.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

Maui Planning Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9325080\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/229/1056/#p1073\">\n    229 F.Supp.2d 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1073 (D.

While\n   <em>\n    Hale O Kaula Church\n   </em>\n   is factually analogous in that it involved a denial of a Special Use Permit, this judge is bound by subsequent Ninth Circuit precedent, specifically,\n   <em>\n    San Jose Christian College v. City of Morgan Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164220\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/1024/#p1034\">\n    360 F.3d 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <em>\n    San Jose Christian College\n   </em>\n   involved a free exercise of religion challenge to land use regulations. The city had denied a request by the Christian College to rezone a property for educational use. The college asserted a Free Exercise of Religion Clause challenge. The Ninth Circuit explained that \"a free exercise violation hinges on showing that the challenged law is either not neutral or not generally applicable.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164220\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/1024/#p1034\">\n    360 F.3d at 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit then stated that three principles of First Amendment law may be distilled from case law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   If the zoning law is of general application and is not targeted at religion, it is subject only to rational basis scrutiny, even though it may have an incidental effect of burdening religion. If such a law burdens the free exercise of religion and some other constitutionally-protected activity, there is a First Amendment violation unless the strict scrutiny test is\n   satisfied (i.e., the law is narrowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest). This type of First Amendment claim is sometimes described as a \"hybrid rights\" claim. Similarly, if the zoning law is not neutral or generally applicable, but is directed toward and burdens the free exercise of religion, it must meet the strict scrutiny test. Finally, if the zoning law only incidentally burdens the free exercise of religion, with the law being both neutral and generally applicable, it passes constitutional muster unless the law is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164220\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/1024/#p1034\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164220\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/1024/#p1034\">\n    at 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Neither the County of Maui nor Plaintiffs meet the initial movant's burden on a motion for summary judgment of demonstrating entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. The motions do not sufficiently discuss the res judicata or collateral estoppel doctrines in the context of the Free Exercise of Religion claim. It may well be that this case involves neutral zoning regulations of general application such that Count V should be reviewed under the rational basis test, even in the face of at least an incidental burden on Plaintiffs' religion. But parties must do more than spot issues and conflate arguments to be entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Counts VII and VIII--State Constitutional Claims for Violations of Free Exercise of Religion and Equal Protection.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The County of Maui moves for summary judgment with respect to Counts VII and VIII without any meaningful discussion of the applicable Hawaii constitutional provisions. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, seek summary judgment with respect to Count VII but not Count VIII, arguing only that strict scrutiny should be applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 184-1, PageID # 3088. Given the paucity of the arguments, as well as the failure to discuss the res judicata and collateral estoppel doctrines, neither party meets its initial burden of demonstrating that there are no material facts in issue and that judgment as a matter of law is appropriate. Summary judgment is therefore denied with respect to Counts VII and VIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
