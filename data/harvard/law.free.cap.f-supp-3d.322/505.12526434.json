Pursuant to these provisions of the Master Installation Agreement, Stoncor brought a cross-claim against Surfacesys in the Arias Action on the ground that Surfacesys must indemnify Stoncor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shyer Decl. \u00b6 16; Surfacesys's Notice of Motion and Affirmation, dated Dec. 1, 2017 (annexed as Ex. 5 to Shyer Decl.) (\"Surfacesys's State Court Motion\"), at Affirmation \u00b6\u00b6 54-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Stoncor brought the instant declaratory judgment action against Peerless in 2016, claiming that by virtue of the Master Installation Agreement, Stoncor was an additional insured under the Policy that Peerless was obligated to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless in the Arias Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, filed June 16, 2016 (Docket # 1), \u00b6\u00b6 10-12, 14; Am.

Notice of Motion, filed May 15, 2017 (Docket # 37). Peerless cross-moved for summary judgment, seeking to have plaintiffs' amended complaint dismissed, and seeking a declaration that \"Peerless does not have a duty to defend or indemnify\" Stoncor in the Arias Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Motion for Summary Judgment, filed May 15, 2017 (Docket # 38). One ground that Peerless raised in its motion is that Surfacesys did not execute the \"Master Installation Agreement\" prior to Arias's injury, and Stoncor thus was not an additional insured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Peerless Insurance Company's Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, filed May 15, 2017 (Docket # 40), at 3-11. Another issue raised was whether Stoncor's and Surfacesys's operations were complete at the time of the accident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-22. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, the district judge in this case, denied these motions by Order dated, March 29, 2018, stating \"[t]he record reflects triable issues of fact as to whether an executed agreement existed between Stoncor ... and Surfacesys, ... and as to whether Stoncor's and Surfacesys' operations were complete, in each case prior to the incident underlying\" the Arias Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, filed Mar. 29, 2018 (Docket # 69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both Stoncor and Surfacesys have also moved for summary judgment in the Arias Action.

Of particular relevance to the instant motion, Surfacesys seeks summary judgment as to Stoncor's cross-claim on the ground that Arias's injury occurred both after Surfacesys had completed installation of the floor and before Surfacesys executed the Master Installation Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Affirmation \u00b6\u00b6 54-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 22, 2018, Peerless filed the instant motion to stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

In its reply brief, it asserts that Stoncor's declaratory judgment action is \"unripe\" as to the duty to indemnify, and insists that \"the federal abstention doctrine is irrelevant to this issue.\" Def. Reply at 2. Given this lack of clarity, we will examine both the ripeness and federal abstention doctrines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Stoncor seeks a declaration from this Court that Peerless has a duty to both defend Stoncor in the Arias Action, and to indemnify Stoncor for any liability incurred in that action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.
