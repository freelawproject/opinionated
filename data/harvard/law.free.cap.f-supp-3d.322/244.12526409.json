(\"7-Eleven\") in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiffs allege\n   that 7-Eleven and two 7-Eleven market managers, Mary Cadigan and Andrew Brothers (collectively \"the individual defendants\"), 1) misclassified its franchisee convenience store workers in Massachusetts as independent contractors instead of employees in violation of the Massachusetts Independent Contractor Law, M.G.L. c. 149 \u00a7 148B, 2 ) violated the Massachusetts Wage Act, M.G.L. c. 149 \u00a7 148 and 3) violated the Massachusetts Minimum Wage Law, M.G.L. c. 151 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court are plaintiffs' motion to remand, 7-Eleven's motion to dismiss, the individual defendants' motion to dismiss and plaintiffs' emergency motion to enjoin defendant from obtaining releases from putative class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The named plaintiffs are residents of Massachusetts who acquired 7-Eleven franchises and work as store managers and convenience store clerks in Massachusetts. They also bring claims on behalf of all other individuals who have acquired 7-Eleven franchises and performed services as store managers and convenience store clerks in Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   7-Eleven is a Texas corporation with its principal place of business in Texas. The company is a convenience store chain that utilizes a franchise model. Plaintiffs allege that 7-Eleven dictates how franchisees do their jobs, including requirements with respect to uniforms, specific training and monitoring the workplace remotely through the use of in-store cameras. 7-Eleven also determines store hours, controls the payroll system and requires that franchisees make daily monetary deposits into an account that it controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to plaintiffs, they perform services exclusively for 7-Eleven, are misclassified as independent contractors instead of employees and therefore have been deprived of benefits to which employees are entitled under Massachusetts law, including a minimum wage and protection from improper wage deductions. Plaintiffs allege that Mary Cadigan and Andrew Brothers, two 7-Eleven market managers who reside in Massachusetts, \"exercised extensive control over the plaintiffs' work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their statutory claims with the Office of the Attorney General and received a right to sue letter, as required by M.G.L. c. 149 \u00a7 50. Thereafter they filed this action in Massachusetts Superior Court for Middlesex County and Defendants promptly removed the case to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 15, 2018, 7-Eleven distributed 2019 franchise renewal contracts to all Massachusetts franchisees, including franchisees who do not have agreements expiring in 2019. On page 208 of that 641-page document, the contract contains a \"Release of claims and termination\" section that requires renewing franchisees to release their claims in this case. On June 29, 2018, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion seeking to enjoin 7-Eleven from soliciting those releases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Motion to remand\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that removal was improper because the individual defendants defeat diversity jurisdiction and the \"local controversy\" exception to the Class Action Fairness Act (\"CAFA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(4), applies such that no federal question jurisdiction exists.

Plaintiff Safdar Hussain describes a specific week in which that occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The complaint further alleges that 7-Eleven deducts certain fees and payments from plaintiffs' wages. Accordingly, the plaintiffs maintain, the combination of long hours and unjustified deductions from pay results in a wage below that allowed by Massachusetts law.
