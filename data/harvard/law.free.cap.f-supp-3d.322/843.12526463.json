Finchum has filed a Motion to Stay (Docket No. 30), to which Doe has filed a Response (Docket No. 36), and Finchum has filed a Reply (Docket No. 39).

BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Matthew 25 is a Nashville-based nonprofit that receives federal funding to provide training and education services. (Docket No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) Doe is an African-American woman and was, at all times relevant to this case, employed by Matthew 25. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Finchum was hired as Matthew 25's executive director on March 3, 2016, a position from which he voluntarily resigned on January 11, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 25.) Finchum, who was the highest ranking executive at Matthew 25, persistently made comments to Doe regarding her physical appearance, telling her that she reminded him of a black woman that he used to date and describing aspects of the sexual activities he had engaged in with that woman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.). Doe also describes Finchum \"cornering [her] in his office with the door closed and physically touching her.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finchum would also frequently call Doe's cell phone when she was not at work and ask her if she was in the bathroom or was taking a bath. Doe objected to Finchum about his behavior, but he continued. Throughout this time period, Finchum displayed an explosive temper and routinely yelled at and berated Doe and other female employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2016, Doe asked a member of Matthew 25's board of directors, Karen Baggett, to lunch at a restaurant. While there, Doe told Baggett that she was afraid of Finchum and asked Baggett for help. Baggett responded by telling Doe\n   that \"it would be ok,\" but Baggett took no corrective action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December 2016, Finchum called Doe into his office, began massaging her shoulders, placed her hand on his groin, exposed his penis to her, and masturbated to the point of ejaculation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 14.) In April 2017, Finchum pressed his genitals into Doe's body from behind \"and hunched his private parts against her buttocks until the front of his pants were wet.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 15.) In October 2017, Doe told her coworkers that Finchum had been harassing her, after which her coworkers began making an effort to prevent Doe from being left alone with Finchum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 29, 2017, Doe attempted\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to send an email to Finchum, which she copied to all members of the Matthew 25 board of directors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   This letter [is] to inform you, Jim[,] to let you know that your inappropriate behavior toward me is unwanted and to inform all the Board Members:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   I am being subjected to sexual comments and advances from Jim/CEO. The CEO has gone as far [as] to expose himself to me. These advances, comments and all sexual behaviors are unwelcomed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I don't want any problems. I just want this to stop, so I can do my job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Doe's complaint prompted Matthew 25 to hire an outside consulting group, HR Compass, to investigate Finchum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) While the investigation was ongoing, Finchum remained in his capacity as the highest ranking executive at Matthew 25. In order to avoid having to work alongside Finchum, Doe used accrued leave time for part of the period of the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) On January 8, 2018, Doe was interviewed by an employee of HR Compass. Doe detailed Finchum's actions toward her, and the HR Compass employee suggested that Doe file a police report. The next day, Doe filed a complaint regarding Finchum with the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department (\"MNPD\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) Two days later, Finchum resigned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Doe claims to have suffered severe emotional injuries based on Finchum's actions, for which she has incurred medical expenses. In her Complaint, she states that she \"asked to report her severe emotional injuries as a work-related injury and her request was denied.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Matthew 25, however, has filed a Declaration of Hal E. Sauer, the president of its board of directors, explaining as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In February 2018, [Doe] asked me if her counseling expenses might be covered by workers compensation insurance. I did not know the answer, so I contacted Matthew 25's workers compensation insurance carrier on February 7, 2018. While I spoke with the insurance representative, he initiated a claim with the information that I was able to provide him over the phone, including [Doe's] contact information. I believed the insurer would contact [Doe] for additional information.... I informed [Doe] by email on February 8, 2018 that a workers compensation claim had been initiated on her behalf.... Since then, through her counsel, [Doe] has been provided with the claim number, the claim, and contact information for Matthew 25's workers compensation insurer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Docket No. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.) Doe has since provided a letter, dated June 21, 2018, from Matthew 25's workers' compensation carrier, Eastern Alliance Insurance Group, denying workers compensation coverage for\n   Doe's injuries because her \"claim did not arise out of her employment.\" (Docket No. 32-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 20, 2018, Doe filed her Complaint in this case. She pleads five counts: Count I is for common law assault and battery; Count II is for sexual harassment under the Tennessee Human Rights Act (\"THRA\"); Count III is for retaliation under the THRA; Count IV is for sex discrimination in a federally funded education program or activity, in violation of Title IX,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and Count V is a claim for race discrimination, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , on the ground that Doe \"is an African American and was singled out for harassment on the basis of her race and sex,\" while \"White employees were not subjected to the type of assault and battery [Doe] was.\" (Docket No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 32-56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 27, 2018, Finchum filed a Partial Motion to Dismiss directed at Counts I and V. (Docket No. 12.) On May 21, 2018, Matthew 25 filed a Partial Motion to Dismiss, or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment, directed at Counts I, III, and V. (Docket No. 18) On June 26, 2018, Finchum filed a Motion to Stay (Docket No. 30), asking the court to stay all matters in this case, as related to him, in light of Doe's having filed a criminal complaint against him and the possibility that there is an ongoing criminal investigation regarding his alleged wrongdoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

Finchum has produced no evidence that charges against him are imminent or even that investigative activities are ongoing.

Doe concedes that common law assault claims based on any acts prior to March 2017 would be untimely and, therefore, the only specific incident in her Complaint pursuant to which she has raised a timely claim of assault is Finchum's alleged April 2017 unwanted pressing his genitals into her from behind until his pants became wet.

Based on the information provided, however, and construing the allegations in the light most favorable to Doe, she has alleged an assault that would fall outside the bounds of Tennessee workers' compensation law and, therefore, could permissibly give rise to a tort claim without running afoul of the exclusive remedy bar. Matthew 25's suggestion that the court, in the alternative, consider its motion under Rule 56 does nothing to change that analysis. The additional evidence that Matthew 25 has provided establishes that Doe did, in fact, have the opportunity to attempt to avail herself of the workers' compensation process. However, the determinative issue, under the exclusive remedy provision, is not whether she had the opportunity to seek workers' compensation but whether her injury, as a legal matter, is of the type reached by workers' compensation law. As alleged, it appears that it likely is not-and, indeed, Matthew 25's workers' compensation carrier appears to agree. The court, accordingly, will not dismiss the assault claim against Matthew 25 based on the April 2017 incident on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    2.

To establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of retaliation under the THRA, a plaintiff must show: (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) the exercise of protected rights was known to the employer; (3) the employer took a materially adverse action against the plaintiff, and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.\n   <em>\n    Goree v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795406\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/413/#p434\">\n    490 S.W.3d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2015),\n   <em>\n    appeal denied\n   </em>\n   (Mar. 23, 2016). Matthew 25 does not dispute that Doe's complaining about Finchum's behavior was a protected activity or that Matthew 25 was aware of that behavior. It argues, instead, that she cannot satisfy the third and fourth prongs, because she has not identified an adequate adverse action taken against her that bears a causal connection to her protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Doe identifies four alleged adverse actions that, she argues, are sufficient to support her retaliation claim: (1) she \"has been ostracized\" within Matthew 25; (2) \"her job duties [were] reduced, including her role in implementing a federal grant through the U.S. Veterans Administration\"; (3) she \"utilized her accrued paid time off during part of the investigation period so that she would not have to work next to Finchum at the office\"; and (4) \"[a]s a result of the severe emotional distress she has endured from the unsafe work environment she experienced, [she] has taken an extended sick leave from her employment.\" (Docket No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 22, 30-31.). The third and fourth examples-Doe's use of paid leave to avoid Finchum and her use of sick time due to her injuries-are not sufficient to form the basis of a retaliation claim, because neither is an action taken by her employer. The fact that Doe would feel the need to use accrued leave just to avoid Finchum and the fact that her psychological injuries ultimately required her to take sick leave are both unfortunate, but neither reflects an action by Matthew 25. Doe's use of sick leave was a consequence of the initial alleged harassment against her, not an instance of retaliation. Matthew 25's decision not to give Doe additional leave time to use during the investigation is simply the continuation of the status quo that would have prevailed if Doe had never engaged in a protected activity. After all, if she had not reported Finchum, Matthew 25 would not have given her extra leave time either.

Matthew 25 does not, at this stage, dispute that the resulting harassment was sufficiently severe and pervasive as to affect a term, condition, or privilege of employment, nor does Matthew 25 dispute any other factor in the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for harassment under Title VII. Matthew 25 argues only that Doe cannot proceed under \u00a7 1981, because Finchum's harassment was sexual in nature and \u00a7 1981 does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Matthew 25's argument assumes that, because \u00a7 1981 does not outlaw sexual harassment in and of itself, then Finchum's sexual harassment must have been permissible under the statute. Matthew 25's conclusion, though, does not follow from its premise. Section 1981 prohibits racial discrimination in contracts, including sufficiently severe workplace racial harassment; it does not matter whether the means of discrimination and harassment are, in and of themselves, independently prohibited. For example, \u00a7 1981 does not prohibit using e-mail, but it prohibits using e-mail to engage in harassment on the basis of race. It does not prohibit one-on-one meetings, but it prohibits using one-on-one meetings as an opportunity to engage in harassment on the basis of race. And, although \u00a7 1981 admittedly does not prohibit unwanted sexual comments or contact, Matthew 25 has identified no reason to doubt that the law prohibits using unwanted sexual comments or contact to engage in harassment-and, therefore, discrimination-on the basis of race.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Doe\n   had been singled out based on her race and harassed in a manner that was not sexual, but was equally hostile, there would be little doubt that she had pled a claim under \u00a7 1981. The introduction of a sexual element does not negate her otherwise sufficient allegations. The court, accordingly, will not dismiss Doe's \u00a7 1981 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV.

Here, in contrast, Doe's race appears to have been central to her receiving Finchum's sexual attention in the first place. While Matthew 25 will certainly have the opportunity to argue and seek to establish that Finchum's racial comments were merely incidental to a purely sexual pattern of behavior, the allegations of the Complaint, read in the light most favorable to Doe, allege significantly more than merely a pattern of sexual harassment in which race was mentioned; they allege a pattern of racial harassment through sexual attention.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
