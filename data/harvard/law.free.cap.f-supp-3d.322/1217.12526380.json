KALLON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This products liability action arises from injuries Shannon Wayne Garrison sustained from the accidental discharge of his Ruger \"Blackhawk\" revolver. Following his accident, Garrison filed suit against Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company (Ruger), the revolver's manufacturer, alleging negligence (Count I), breach of the Alabama Extended Manufacturers' Liability Doctrine (AEMLD) (Count II), breach of the implied warranty of merchantability (Count III), and strict liability (Count IV).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ruger has now moved for summary judgment, doc. 36, arguing primarily that its \"old-model\" single-action revolver was not a defective product, and that its alleged failure to adequately warn Garrison was not the proximate cause of his accident. That motion is now fully briefed, docs. 37; 40; and 42, and ripe for review. After careful consideration of the parties' excellent briefs, Alabama law, and the entirety of the record, the court finds that Ruger's motion is due to be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Summary judgment is proper \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The Accident of September 21, 2014\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 21, 2014, Garrison was checking several game cameras he had placed at the Capsy Hunting Club in Winston County, Alabama while riding his ATV through the property. Doc. 41-6 at 3. Garrison was carrying his fully loaded Ruger \"Blackhawk\" revolver in a holster on his right hip with the firearm's hammer in the full down position, the hammer position he believed was designed to allow for the safe carrying of the weapon. Docs. 41-1 at 9, 15; 31-4 at 17. While driving over an unpaved road, the revolver fell from the holster and discharged upon striking the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, 15-16. The bullet struck Garrison's right ankle and traveled upward through his body, seriously injuring him and causing him to fall from the ATV.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 16-18; Doc. 41-6 at 4. Despite his injuries, Garrison managed to use the ATV to return to his truck and then drove to a nearby home for assistance in guiding first responders to his remote location. Doc. 41-1 at 7-8. Garrison was subsequently airlifted to an area hospital where he underwent extensive medical treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. To this day, Garrison continues to receive medical treatment for his injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The Mechanical Operation of the Revolver and Alternative Designs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Ruger Blackhawk at issue here is part of a line of Ruger \"old-model\" single-action revolvers. Doc. 37-2 at 3-4. Ruger intended this product line to replicate the look and feel of an iconic firearm, the Colt Model 1873 Single-Action Army Revolver. Docs. 41-3 at 3; 37-4 at 34-35; 37-8 at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While Ruger largely retained the aesthetics and basic mechanical functioning of this classic firearm, it used modern materials in constructing the revolver and altered the dimensions and types of some of the gun's mechanical components. Docs. 41-3 at 3; 37-4 at 34; 37-8 at 50. Ruger manufactured its \"old-model\" single-action revolvers from 1953 until 1973 selling nearly 1.3 million units, including the revolver at issue in this case, which was originally purchased in 1969. Docs. 37-2 at 3-4; 37-8 at 50. The Ruger \"old-model\" single-action revolver had several distinctive characteristics including its single-action firing mechanism, which requires the user to manually pull the hammer back into firing position before discharging the weapon. Docs. 37-4 at 35-36, 42, 51. In contrast, double-action revolvers do not require the user to manually \"cock\" the hammer before firing. Doc. 37-4 at 36, 42; 37-8 at 20. The Ruger \"old-model\" single-action revolver also incorporated a loading gate, a loading mechanism in which the cylinder remains attached to the frame of the gun and is rotated to individually load cartridges. Doc. 37-4 at 33-34; 37-8 at 17, 23. Other styles of revolver use different loading methods. For example, in a \"top-break\" revolver, the gun's frame is hinged to enable the barrel to be pushed down thereby opening the cylinder and allowing the user to rapidly load the weapon. Docs. 37-4 at 36; 37-8 at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Ruger \"old-model,\" like its historical predecessor, has an external hammer with four possible resting positions: (1) full-down; (2) safety-notch; (3) loading notch; and (4) fully cocked. Doc. 37-3 at 13. In the full-down position, the hammer rests directly on the firing pin, the mechanism in the revolver which actually strikes the primer on the rear of the bullet causing the gun to discharge. Doc. 37-3 at 13; 37-8 at 29. There is no dispute that, in this configuration, a blow to the back of the hammer can cause the gun to fire accidentally, even if the trigger is never pulled. Doc. 37-3 at 13; 37-4 at 26. Similarly, there is no dispute that placing the hammer in the \"safety\" position does not fully alleviate the risk of accidental discharge in the event that a sufficiently powerful blow to the hammer is sustained. Docs. 37-3 at 13; 37-4 at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ruger sold each of its \"old-model\" single-action revolvers with an instruction manual. Doc. 37-2 at 3. The manual outlined the various hammer positions and explained that \"when the hammer is resting in the safety-notch, the gun may be safely carried loaded under all normal conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The manual also provided bolded precautions for the use of \"the older types of single action revolvers\" namely that \"[t]he gun should never be carried with the hammer resting on the firing pin and a loaded cartridge in the chamber that is aligned with the barrel\" because of the danger of accidental discharge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The parties agree that Garrison did not receive an instruction manual when he acquired the revolver from a second-hand purchaser, and that Garrison subsequently made no effort to either acquire a manual or to learn about the firearm's safety features and operating characteristics. Docs. 40 at 11; 41-1 at 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties also agree that several \"passive\" safeties capable of alleviating the risk of accidental discharge in the event a fully-loaded firearm was dropped were in use prior to 1970. Doc. 40 at 14-15. One suggested alternative, a \"transfer bar\" safety, primarily entailed the insertion of a steel bar between the hammer and the firing pin. Docs. 37-8 at 51-52; 41-3 at 4. When the trigger is pulled, the bar raises for the hammer to strike and then transfers the energy of the blow to the firing pin. Doc. 41-3 at 4. Without the bar in place, the hammer is unable to strike the pin to discharge the weapon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The other alternative,\n   a rebounding hammer and hammer block safety, uses a spring to physically force the hammer away from the frame and then seals the hammer in position using a block or a plate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The block only disengages when the trigger is pulled, again effectively preventing the hammer from striking the firing pin in other circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. While these \"passive\" safety features would have prevented Garrison's injuries, no evidence has been presented to indicate that they were actually available for use in fixed cylinder, single-action revolvers sharing the characteristics of a Ruger \"old-model\" revolver in 1969.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 37-4 at 38, 41-42; 37-8 at 52; 40 at 9 (arguing that a \"rebounding hammer and hammer block design was available for\n   <em>\n    implementation\n   </em>\n   into the subject revolver\") (emphasis added). It was not until 1973 that Ruger developed and patented a transfer bar safety for use in a single-action revolver. Doc. 37-8 at 51-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The complaint pleads four substantive counts related to the revolver. Garrison has conceded that one of these counts-strict liability (Count IV), is due to be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40 at 19 n.7. Therefore, the court will only address the first three counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. AEMLD and Negligence Design Claims-Count I and II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To establish liability under the AEMLD, Garrison must show that \"(1) he suffered injury or damages to himself or his property by one who sells a product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the plaintiff ..., if (a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and (b) it [reaches]the user ... without substantial change in the condition in which it [was] sold.\"\n   <em>\n    Casrell v.

In response, Garrison notes that alternative designs existed, at least as evidenced by other classes of firearms, and that a factual dispute exists with regard to the safety expectations of a reasonable consumer in 1969. The court will first address the question of consumer expectation before turning to the issue of whether a safer alternative design existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Did the Subject Revolver Meet the Reasonable Safety Expectations of an Ordinary Consumer in 1969\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties' arguments on this point are easily summarized. In essence, Ruger contends that (1) the subject revolver was state-of-the-art for its time, (2) that no other fixed-cylinder, single-action revolver available in 1969 possessed safety features that would have alleviated the risk of accidental discharge indisputably posed by the firearm at issue here, and (3) that the weapon had existed, in substantially the same form, since the 1950s when it first entered the market. Moreover, Ruger contends that responsible gun owners are uniformly aware that it is unsafe to carry a single-action revolver of this type fully loaded with the hammer down. Ruger maintains that these facts establish that the revolver in question, despite the drop-fire hazard it posed, met the safety expectations of an ordinary consumer at the time of its manufacture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Garrison counters that in 1969 other types of firearms, such as double-action revolvers, utilized \"passive\" safety features which largely eliminated the risk of accidental discharge without a trigger pull. Garrison also points out that Ruger specifically targeted lay consumers in its marketing campaigns which repeatedly referred to this type of revolver as a \"Single-Six\" suggesting that it was safe to carry fully-loaded. Finally, Garrison argues that similar drop-fire accidents involving the Ruger \"old-model\" single action revolver have injured 273 people and killed 34 individuals, doc. 40 at 19,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   revealing that the firearm was dangerous beyond the expectation of an ordinary consumer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[U]nder Alabama law, a jury ordinarily evaluates a plaintiff's claims that a product is defective,\"\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541429\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/903/1505/#p1507\">\n    903 F.2d at 1507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or \"the dangerousness of a product.\"\n   <em>\n    Tillman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9276033\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/871/28/#p35\">\n    871 So.2d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although much\n   of evidence in this case is undisputed, the \"reasonable\" inferences arising from the evidence are not.

In this regard, Ruger's primary argument has considerable force. It is true that there is no evidence before the court indicating that fixed cylinder single-action revolvers sold at the time possessed a \"passive\" safety capable of reducing the risk of discharge without a trigger pull prior to 1970. Docs. 37-4 at 38, 41-42; 37-8 at 52. Instead, all the guns in the subject revolver's class, at the time, possessed a similar risk of accidental discharge if a blow directly to the hammer of a fully-loaded weapon was sustained. Doc. 37-8 at 50-51. Given the prevalence of this type of firearm-Ruger sold over 800,000 \"old-model\" single action revolvers by 1969, doc. 37-2 at 14-and the uniform lack of passive safety-features among firearms falling into this category, it certainly appears likely that an ordinary consumer would have known of the hazard of accidental discharge and acted accordingly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   However, at this stage of the proceeding, the court may not \"weigh conflicting evidence,\"\n   <em>\n    Mize\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7635466\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/93/739/#p742\">\n    93 F.3d at 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and it must draw \"all justifiable inferences\" in favor of the nonmovant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    477 U.S. at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that light, Garrison has put forward enough evidence to create a justifiable inference that the subject revolver would have failed to meet the ordinary safety expectations of a consumer in 1969. First, although Ruger notes that \"passive\" safety features were not available on single-action revolvers, these types of safeties were routinely used in other classes of firearms, including double-action revolvers, and had existed in some form since the nineteenth century. Docs. 41-3 at 4-5; 37-8 at 52. Moreover, there is no dispute that these \"passive\" safeties would have essentially eliminated the risk of accidental discharge without a trigger pull. Docs. 37-4 at 11, 26; 41-5 at 46. While the parties' respective experts have done a great job in explaining the difference between a double-action and a single-action revolver to this court, neither side has indicated that an ordinary consumer, without the benefit of the tutorial provided by these experts, would be able to easily distinguish between the two types of weapons. In such an instance, a consumer might reasonably assume that these distinct\n   classes of revolver incorporated similar safety features, and, accordingly, that the risk of accidental discharge within each class was correspondingly low.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This inference is further strengthened by Ruger's marketing scheme. As Garrison points out, Ruger marketed the firearm as a \"single-six,\" commonly referred to the revolver as a six-shooter, and expressly designed it to capture the \"Wild West\" aesthetic popular during the 1950s and 60s. Docs. 37-8 at 14, 49-51; 41-23 at 2. This marketing and design philosophy suggests that Ruger marketed the gun, at least in part, to first time gun owners and other neophytes who might assume that the revolver was safe to carry fully-loaded. Therefore, in the absence of expert testimony establishing consumer safety expectations in 1969, the court finds that Garrison has done enough to create an inference that, based on the availability of \"passive\" safety features in double-action revolvers and other types of firearms, a reasonable consumer in 1969 would have assumed that similar safety features were also incorporated into the subject revolver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Was a Feasible, Safer Alternative Design for the Revolver Available in 1969\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To prove defectiveness, however, Garrison must also show that \"a safer, practical, alternative design was available to the manufacturer at the time it manufactured the [product].\"\n   <em>\n    Beech\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7501365\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/584/447/#p450\">\n    584 So.2d at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). The parties' contentions with respect to this issue are essentially identical to their consumer expectations arguments. Basically, Garrison avers that the existence of passive safety features on other classes of firearms at the time of manufacture, and the undisputed safety advantage of those designs, suffice to establish the availability of an alternative product design. Ruger counters that its \"old-model\" single-action revolver product line is a distinct firearm, targeted at a niche market, and that no comparable safety features existed on that particular class of weapons at the time of manufacture. After careful consideration of the record, the court concludes that, as a matter of law, no alternative design was available to Ruger at the time of manufacture, and, consequently, Garrison is unable to sustain his AEMLD and negligence claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Under Alabama law, Garrison bears the burden of proving product defectiveness and, necessarily, the existence of a safer, practical, alternative design.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gen. Motors Corp. v.

Civ. App. 2010) (affirming summary judgment on an AEMLD claim when plaintiff failed to show the existence of a specific, alternative design). To meet his burden, Garrison cites two alternative designs: (1) a \"transfer-bar safety design[ ];\" and (2) a \"rebounding hammer and hammer block safety design.\" Doc. 40 at 14. Ruger does not dispute that these designs would have prevented Garrison's injuries or that once developed implementing either design would have been feasible. Therefore, the sole question before the court is whether either design was \"available\" to Ruger for use in its \"old-model\" single-action revolver in 1969.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Critically, there is no evidence before the court to indicate that any firearm manufacturer had applied either of the proposed safety features to a revolver sharing the essential features of a Ruger \"old-model\" single-action prior to 1970. With respect to the transfer-bar safety system, Ruger patented such a design, as applied to an \"old-model\" single-action revolver, in 1973, years after it manufactured the revolver at issue here. Doc. 37-8 at 51-52.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While Garrison's expert noted that these safety features were in use prior to 1970, the expert was subsequently unable to identify, in either his deposition or his report, any single-action revolvers sharing the characteristics of a Ruger \"old-model\" single-action that incorporated either a \"transfer-bar\" or a \"rebounding hammer\" prior to 1970. Doc. 37-4 at 35, 38, 41-42. This testimony by Garrison's expert belies Garrison's contentions that the two designs he proposes were available to Ruger at the time it manufactured the subject revolver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Additionally, Garrison's contentions regarding the \"rebounding hammer and hammer block\" design fail for a separate reason. Although the \"rebounding hammer\" safety design was utilized on single-action revolvers prior to 1970, the undisputed evidence is that this type of safety was only viable when incorporated into a \"top-break\" or \"break action\" revolver. Doc. 37-8 at 23. That is, a revolver with a hinged frame enabling the cylinder to separate from the gun frame for loading purposes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036926\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/50/458/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the Ruger \"old-model\" single-action, and other similar revolvers, no such hinge exists, and the cylinder is latched to the hammer. Doc. 37-4 at 33-34; 37-8 at 17, 23. Consequently, the unique features of the Ruger \"old-model\" single-action revolver prevent the use of a \"rebounding hammer\" design because it would cause the cylinder to unlock as the gun fired potentially exposing the user to the hot gases generated by the firing process. Doc. 37-8 at 52. In other words, the rebounding hammer design is not a feasible alternative for the type of firearm at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The evidence submitted by Garrison in support of the existence of these proposed alternative designs is generally inapposite. First, Garrison's reliance on deposition testimony given by William Ruger in 1982 is misplaced. Although William Ruger testified that certain passive safeties were available for use during the 1950s, he added that this type of safety was not \"available, not for a single action,\" and that \"there was no safety for single-action ... until [he] invented one [in 1973].\" Doc. 41-13 at 27 Ruger's current vice-president Kevin B. Reid, supported this testimony. Garrison is certainly correct that Reid indicated that aesthetic calculations factored into the development of a \"passive\" safety for the Ruger revolver at issue. Doc. 41-5 at 52. However, Reid also explained the mechanical difficulty of incorporating a \"rebounding hammer\" safety system into the \"old-model\" revolver, and indicated that the technology enabling the incorporation of a \"transfer-bar\" safety into the firearm did not exist until the 1970s.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46-47, 52; Doc. 37-8 at 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Similarly, the December 1973 letter drafted by an expert witness for Ruger in a separate product liability action, and relied on by Garrison here, does not establish the availability of alternative designs in 1969. Although the letter references attempts by other manufacturers to incorporate various safety features into single-action revolvers to prevent the risk of accidental discharge, it never specifies when\n   those design changes went into effect, and, indeed, the letter affirmatively indicates that the referenced design changes were not implemented before 1970. Doc. 41-19 at 3. The closest the letter comes to establishing the availability of a \"passive\" safety on a single-action revolver, prior to 1970, is its reference to the incorporation of a \"rebounding-hammer\" into a revolver designed by Savage Industries in the 1950s.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. However, this model was \"experimental\" and there is no indication that it ever went into commercial production.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, both of the patents Garrison points to as demonstrating the existence of the \"transfer-bar\" and \"rebounding hammer\" safeties prior to 1969 were never applied to revolvers sharing the features of a Ruger \"old-model\" single-action revolver. Doc. 37-4 at 41-42; 45-46; 37-8 at 52. Instead, the evidence shows that due to the distinct trigger mechanism and loading functionality of the various classes of revolver neither safety could be directly incorporated into a firearm like the Ruger \"old-model\" single-action revolver at issue here. Doc. 37-4 at 36, 41-42; 37-8 at 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Based on this record, Garrison has failed to identify a single firearm, of the same product line as the Ruger \"old-model\" single-action revolver, possessing either suggested type of \"passive\" safety before 1970. Perhaps in recognition of the evidence against him on this issue, Garrison contends alternatively that the mere existence of these designs, in conjunction with Ruger's undisputed awareness of the risk of accidental discharge posed by the \"old-model\" single-action revolver, sufficiently establish that Ruger could have adapted a \"passive\" safety of some type for use in the firearm by 1969.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court agrees generally that the record does, at the least, support an inference that a sufficiently dedicated engineer could have adapted one of Garrison's proposed alternative designs for use in a Ruger \"old-model\" single-action revolver prior to 1970.

This contention is unavailing, however, because Garrison has entirely failed, as explained, to demonstrate that an alternative design for the Ruger \"old-model\" single-action revolver existed in 1969. Moreover, as Garrison's expert admits, the Ruger \"old-model\" single-action, or \"Colt-type\" revolver at issue here is not the same product as the double-action or top-break revolvers that Garrison relies on to demonstrate the feasibility of his proposed safety-features. Doc. 37-4 at 34-36. The Ruger \"old-model\" single-action was designed to replicate the look and feel of a historical revolver, the Colt Single Action Army, and, to that end, it incorporated the major design features from that firearm. Docs. 41-3 at 3; 37-4 at 34-35; 37-8 at 50. Both guns were single-action with external hammer notches and both included a rotating cylinder with a fixed loading gate. Doc. 37-4 at 33-36. The record indicates that a variety of manufacturers, American and European, designed and built similar single-action, fixed cylinder revolvers during the 1950s and 1960s to capitalize on a distinct market of gun enthusiasts who prized the look and feel of the Colt Single-Action Army revolver. Doc. 37-8 at 23-25, 49-51. Despite the popularity of this type of revolver, however, even Garrison's expert testified that he could not identify any successful attempts to create a safer firearm by incorporating a \"transfer-bar\" or a \"rebounding-hammer\" into the gun prior to 1970. Doc. 37-4 at 35, 38, 41-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Although the question of \"whether a proposed alternative design in an AEMLD case is sufficiently similar to the allegedly defective product to be considered an actual alternative design ... is generally a question of fact for the jury ... there are necessarily some circumstances where a court can\" decide the issue as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Hosford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12365582\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/223/199/#p208\">\n    223 So.3d at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).

Moreover, Garrison, just like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Burleson\n   </em>\n   , was an experienced gun user and should have known of the \"self-evident\" danger of handling a firearm \"with a live cartridge chambered in line with the hammer and the firing pin.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8403260\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/981/1109/#p1114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8403260\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/981/1109/#p1114\">\n    at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Second, the court need not resolve whether the provided warning was necessary\n   or adequate, because Garrison did not read the instruction manual containing the warning in the first instance.

The undisputed evidence is that Garrison, who acquired the revolver second-hand, neither read nor sought to obtain the instruction manual, which was available both online and directly from Ruger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 37-2 at 4-5; 40 at 11; 41-1 at 33-34.

Indeed, Garrison only read the instruction manual for one of his 18 guns, a Charles Daly 12-gauge semi-automatic shotgun. Docs. 37-7 at 4-5; 41-1 at 33.

Garrison also cites the existence of \"passive\" safeties capable of preventing drop-fire incidents in other types of weapons, arguing that, despite its awareness that its \"old-model\" single-action revolver lacked such protections, Ruger continued production of the firearm anyway. This argument fails for two independent reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   First, Garrison has failed to show, as he must, that his injuries would \"likely or probably\" result from Ruger's actions or omissions.\n   <em>\n    Essary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8199925\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/992/5/#p9\">\n    992 So.2d at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Docs. 40 at 18-19; 37-2 at 4. As the Eleventh Circuit applying Alabama law has held, when the \"\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   incidence\" of a particular risk is \"probably slightly less than one percent,\" it does not qualify as a likely event for purposes of a finding of wantonness.\n   <em>\n    Toole v.

However, that decision is readily distinguishable. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Duke\n   </em>\n   presented evidence showing that the manufacturer conducted internal testing prior to the plaintiff's accident, and \"had subsequently added a second safety to adult model shotguns in 1970 but had not added a second safety in the youth model shotguns until 1979.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7507080\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/598/856/#p859\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7507080\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/598/856/#p859\">\n    at 856-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff's accident occurred using a youth shotgun without the additional safety and purchased years after the manufacturer had begun adding a second safety to its adult model shotguns.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7507080\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/598/856/#p859\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court does not read\n   <em>\n    Duke\n   </em>\n   as contradicting the threshold probability requirement established by the Eleventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Toole I\n   </em>\n   . Instead,\n   <em>\n    Duke\n   </em>\n   turned on the evidence showing that the manufacturer took particular actions to alleviate a recognized danger and neglected to uniformly apply those changes to all the firearms posing a danger. Here, there is no evidence that Ruger made any changes to its \"old-model\" single-action revolver until 1973 when it first developed a \"passive\" safety for use on the product and uniformly employed the new design in its revolvers. On this record, the court declines to find that Garrison has put forward sufficient evidence to meet his minimal burden of showing that his injury was more than one percent likely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, even if Ruger knew that manufacturing the Ruger \"old-style\" single-action was likely to result in the injuries suffered by Garrison, his wantonness claim for punitive damages still fails. The Eleventh Circuit, when applying Alabama law, has \"repeatedly held that the issue of punitive damages should not go to the jury when a manufacturer takes steps to warn the plaintiff of the potential danger that injured him; such acts bar a finding of wantonness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Richards v.

Accordingly, an ordinary consumer would have known that carrying a fully-loaded revolver with a chambered round posed a risk of danger, and the gun would have otherwise met such a consumer's ordinary expectations of safety. As Ruger argues, the subject revolver operates as intended and is perfectly safe when used for its intended purpose.
