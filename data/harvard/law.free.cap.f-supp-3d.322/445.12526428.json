DANIELS, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff Rod Wheeler brings this action asserting claims for defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   and, in the alternative, defamation and libel\n   <em>\n    per quod\n   </em>\n   , against Defendant Fox News Network LLC (\"Fox News\"), its parent company, Defendant Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (\"21st Century Fox\" and, with Fox News, \"Fox\"), Fox News investigative journalist Defendant Malia Zimmerman (with Fox, \"the Fox Defendants\"), and Fox News contributor Defendant Ed Butowsky. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., ECF No. 56,) Plaintiff's allegations principally arise out of Fox News's coverage of his investigation into the murder of Seth Rich, a former Democratic National Committee (\"DNC\") employee who was rumored to have leaked sensitive, private emails from DNC servers to WikiLeaks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's lawsuit in its entirety for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Nos. 74 and 78.) Butowsky also moves for sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's former counsel pursuant to Rule 11. (ECF No. 43). Both Butowsky and Plaintiff request an award of attorneys' fees and costs in connection with the Rule 11 motion. (Mem. in Supp. of Butowsky's Mot. for Sanctions (\"Sanctions Mem.\"), ECF No. 44, at 4; Pl. Mem. in Opp'n to Butowsky's Mot. for Sanctions (\"Sanctions Opp'n\"), ECF No. 57, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants' motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim are GRANTED. Butowsky's motion for sanctions and Butowsky's and Plaintiff's requests for attorneys' fees and costs are DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 10, 2016, Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee (\"DNC\") staff member, was murdered. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 77.) The Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (\"MPDC\") believed that the murder occurred in the course of a botched robbery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the weeks after the murder, some individuals theorized that Rich was the source of DNC emails leaked to the media organization WikiLeaks during the primaries for the 2016 presidential election, and that his murder was related to the leak. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.) However, others believed that Russian hackers leaked the emails to WikiLeaks in an attempt to sway the election in favor of then-candidate Donald Trump, and that Rich's murder was unrelated to the emails. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-78, 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Butowsky, a Fox News contributor, spoke with Seymour Hersh, an investigative journalist, who claimed that he had received information regarding an FBI report about Rich's murder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) Though he had not seen the report, Hersh said he had learned from \"somebody on\n   the inside\" that the FBI report stated the MPDC had obtained a search warrant for Rich's home and recovered Rich's computer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87-88.) According to Hersh, the report indicated that the FBI, at the MPDC's request, accessed the contents of Rich's computer and found Rich submitted a series of DNC emails to WikiLeaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 23, 2017, Butowsky contacted Plaintiff, who has his own private investigative consulting company, and explained that the Rich family wanted to hire an investigator to conduct an independent investigation of Rich's murder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 82-83.) On February 28, 2017, Plaintiff met Butowsky and Zimmerman, an investigative journalist for Fox News who had been investigating Rich's death for several months, to discuss Plaintiff's possible investigation of Rich's murder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.) According to Plaintiff, if the investigation confirmed Rich was murdered for leaking the emails, Butowsky and Zimmerman hoped to use the information to discredit theories that Russians had done so to influence the 2016 presidential election. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff had multiple conversations with the Rich family over several weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.) On March 14, 2017, the Rich family and Plaintiff entered into a written agreement that Plaintiff would conduct his own independent investigation \"with regards to the official police investigation surrounding the death of Seth Rich.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.) The agreement expressly stated that Butowsky would pay the costs of the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.) Thereafter, Plaintiff began interviewing Rich's relatives, co-workers, and friends. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.) Plaintiff also reviewed evidence made available to him through the MPDC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While conducting his own investigation, Plaintiff kept Butowsky and Zimmerman informed of the steps he was taking, the people he had spoken to, and what records he had reviewed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 25, 2017, Plaintiff met with Detective Joseph Della-Camera of the MPDC, who stated that he believed Rich's murder was the result of a botched robbery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108.) Della-Camera said he had no information indicating Rich's murder was related to the DNC emails and no knowledge of any FBI involvement with the murder investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 10, 2017, Butowsky and Zimmerman informed Plaintiff that they had a source at the FBI who confirmed emails were sent between Rich and WikiLeaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112.) On May 11, 2017, Zimmerman sent Plaintiff a draft of an article regarding Rich's murder (the \"Article\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113.) The draft did not contain any quotes from Plaintiff suggesting that Rich had sent emails to WikiLeaks or suggesting that the DNC, Democratic Party, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, or former president Bill Clinton were involved in a cover-up of Rich's murder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On Monday, May 15, 2017, Zimmerman emailed Plaintiff that the Article would be published imminently. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119.) Plaintiff told Zimmerman that he was traveling and would be unable to review drafts of the Article that she sent him throughout the day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120.) However, at Zimmerman's request, Plaintiff sent Zimmerman quotes for the Article. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A text message containing one of Plaintiff's quotes read, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Joe said that when I called the [MPDC] right after that Donna Brazil[e] called him and was asking him why was I snooping around asking questions about the death of Seth [Rich] .... I also spoke with another source today who informed me that not only was Donna Brazil[e] snooping around ... but also ... Debbie Wasserman Schultz was snooping around wanting to know how much it was I [was] learning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Decl. of David B. Harrison in Supp. (\"Harrison Deck\"), Ex. 6, ECF No. 80-6, at 4-5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) The text message also stated, \"you can add that I do strongly believe that the answers to who murdered [Rich] sits on his computer on a shelf at the [MPDC] or FBI headquarters!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   That evening, the news program Fox 5 interviewed Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Joseph M. Terry in Supp. (\"Terry Decl.\"), Ex. 5, ECF No. 76-5.) During the Fox 5 Interview, when asked, \"You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information ... that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?\" Plaintiff responded, \"Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.\" (Terry Decl., Ex. 5, at 3:17-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the same Fox 5 Interview, Plaintiff stated that neither \"[t]he [MPDC] nor the FBI have been forthcoming; they haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving [Rich's] death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or ... the FBI.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:10-15.) Plaintiff further explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   I have a source inside the [MPDC] that has looked me straight in the eye and said, 'Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can't share any information with you.'... I don't think it comes from the Chief's office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the Mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that's going to come out tomorrow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:23-4:8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The next day, Fox published the Article as the lead story on the FoxNews.com homepage. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 126.) The Article, entitled\n   <em>\n    Seth Rich, Slain DC Staffer, Had Contact with WikiLeaks, Say Multiple Sources\n   </em>\n   , listed Zimmerman as the author. (Am. Compl., Ex. A (\"Article\"), ECF No. 56-1, at 1.) The Article stated, among other things, \"A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report ... detailing the contents [of] Rich's computer said he made contact with WikiLeaks,\" and quoted the investigator as stating, \"I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Article noted that the FBI investigator's \"revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) In discussing Plaintiff's findings, the Article attributed a quote to Plaintiff (the \"Email Quote\") stating, \" 'My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,' Wheeler said. 'I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sit[ ] on his computer on a shelf at the [MPDC] or FBI headquarters.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Another quote attributed to Plaintiff in the Article (the \"Murder Investigation Quote\") stated, \" 'My investigation shows that someone within the D.C. government, Democratic National Committee or Clinton team is blocking the murder investigation from going forward.' Wheeler told Fox News. 'That is unfortunate. Seth Rich's murder is unsolved as a result of that.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following the publication of the Article, the Rich family issued a statement condemning both the Article and Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145.) In response, Zimmerman sent an email to Joel Rich, Seth Rich's father, which included the statement (the \"Email Statement\"), \"As you know, much of our information came from ... Rod Wheeler, who we understand was working on behalf\n   of you.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff learned of the Email Statement and told Zimmerman and Butowsky it was inaccurate because \"much of the information did not come from me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146.) Zimmerman responded, \"Not the part about the emails. Not the part about, I mean, about the connection to WikiLeaks, but the rest of the quotes in the story did. A lot of the quotes in the story did.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the same conversation, Butowsky told Plaintiff, \"[O]ne day you're going to win an award for having said those things you didn't say.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In a different conversation, when Plaintiff read Butowsky the Email Quote, Butowsky stated, \"Well I know that's not true.... I've never heard you say that\" and \"if I'm under oath, I would say I've never heard him say that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 23, 2017, Fox News retracted the Article and issued a statement that said, in part, \"the May 16 [Article] was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. Upon appropriate review, the [A]rticle was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.... We will continue to investigate this story and will provide updates as warranted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On June 23, 2017, Plaintiff informed Defendants of his intent to seek legal counsel and assert claims against Defendants based upon the Article. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 174.) On June 26, 2017, Butowsky used the social networking platform Twitter to send a tweet (the \"DNC Tweet\") stating, \"Fox News story was pulled because Rod Wheeler said [he] didn't say a quote .... How much did DNC pay him?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 175.) Later that day, Butowsky sent another tweet (the \"Truth Tweet\") stating, \"This shows Rod Wheeler has a major battle with the truth. Everyone needs to hear this. He says the precise words he swears he didn't say???\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the criticism he faced from Butowsky's tweets and from the media and general public regarding the Article have caused him emotional distress, and his professional and personal contacts have ostracized him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168.) Plaintiff also alleges that 21st Century Fox and Fox News have prevented Plaintiff from making further appearances on Fox News programs as a contributor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168.) In addition, Plaintiff alleges his work as a private investigator has also declined, as the negative attention he received has discouraged his existing and potential clients from working with him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 169.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First, the Email Quote is not materially different from the statement that Plaintiff acknowledges making in the Fox 5 Interview \"confirm[ing] that a 'source' ... had information that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 122.) Plaintiff contends his statement in the Fox 5 Interview differs from the Email Quote because the statement in the Fox 5 Interview was referring to \"Zimmerman's and Butowsky's alleged source,\" rather than information he had learned personally. (Pl. Opp'n to Butowsky Mot. to Dismiss (\"Pl. Opp'n to Butowsky\", ECF No. 85, at 18.) But Plaintiff drew no such distinction in the Fox 5 Interview itself. In fact, Plaintiff answered affirmatively when asked if \"\n   <em>\n    you\n   </em>\n   have sources\" indicating there was information linking Rich to WikiLeaks. (Terry Decl., Ex. 5 at 3:17-23 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff also asserts that the reference in the Email Quote to what Plaintiffs \"investigation ... shows\" would lead a reader to conclude Plaintiff \"had personal knowledge or concrete evidence,\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 238), or that his \"personal investigation had conclusively established\" and \"independently\n   confirm[ed] that Mr. Rich sent ... emails to WikiLeaks.\" (Pl. Mem. in Opp'n to Fox Defs. Mot. to Dismiss (\"Pl. Opp'n to Fox\"), ECF No. 84, at 18.) However, while an investigation may be based on personal knowledge or independently corroborated facts, an investigation may also be based upon sources. And the Email Quote-unlike the quote attributed to the \"federal investigator\" in the Article, which stated the investigator had \"seen and read the emails\"-does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   state or imply that Plaintiff personally reviewed any emails between Rich and WikiLeaks as part of his investigation. (Article at 2.) Because Plaintiff cannot show that the Email Quote had a different effect on the reader than his actual statements in the Fox 5 Interview produced, the Email Quote is not provably false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For similar reasons, Plaintiff has also failed to allege that the Murder Investigation Quote is false, because it is not materially different from the statements Plaintiff made in a text message he sent Zimmerman, and the statements he made during the Fox 5 Interview. Plaintiff alleges that he \"provided a quote\" to Zimmerman \"regarding Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Donna Brazile, two former chairs of the DNC who apparently called Detective Della-Camera to inquire as to why Mr. Wheeler was investigating the Rich murder.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 120.) In the text message providing the quote to Zimmerman, Wheeler stated that \"Donna Brazil[e] ... was asking [Della-Camera] why was [Plaintiff] snooping around asking questions about the death of Seth [Rich]\" and that \"Debbie Wasserman Schultz ... want[ed] to know how much it was [Plaintiff] was learning.\" (Harrison Decl., Ex. 6 at 4-5.) Plaintiff contends that the text message differs from the Murder Investigation Quote because it does not \"suggest an attempt to ... block the investigation of Seth Rich's murder.\" (Pl. Opp'n to Fox at 19.) But it would make little sense for officials at the DNC to contact the MPDC and ask about Plaintiff unless they were concerned about what Plaintiff might find. In particular, Plaintiff's statement that Wasserman Schultz's inquired into \"how much\" Plaintiff was learning implies that there was some quantity of information she wished to ensure that Plaintiff did not learn. (Harrison Decl., Ex. 6 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff further discussed the MPDC's investigation during the Fox 5 Interview, noting that \"a source inside the [MPDC]... said, 'Rod, we were told to stand down on this case.\" (Terry Decl., Ex 5 at 3:23-4:1.) In the same interview, Plaintiff also stated that he \"believe[d] there is a correlation between the Mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that's going to come out tomorrow.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:6-8.) Plaintiff argues that\n   his statements in the Fox 5 Interview differ from the Murder Investigation Quote because his statements in the Fox 5 Interview do not suggest that the D.C. government or DNC was directly responsible for telling the MPDC to \"stand down\" in investigating Rich's murder. (Pl. Opp'n to Fox at 19.) But Plaintiff's reference to a \"correlation\" between the D.C. Mayor's office and DNC implies that he believes the D.C. government and DNC may have been involved in preventing the investigation from progressing, even if neither spoke to the MPDC directly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff also notes that his statements in the text message to Zimmerman and in the Fox 5 Interview did not expressly refer to the \"Clinton team.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But Plaintiff acknowledges in his Amended Complaint that Hillary Clinton was closely affiliated with the DNC and Democratic Party. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 75 (alleging leaked emails sent by DNC officials \"indicat[ed] bias on the part of the Democratic Party ... in favor of Hillary Clinton\"). The reference to the \"Clinton team\" was, at most, an \"alteration\" of Plaintiff's actual words that did not \"materially change[ ] the meaning\" of his statements.\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Pub. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2029206\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/339/285/\">\n    661 A.2d at 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because none of the differences Plaintiff identifies demonstrate that the Murder Investigation Quote had a different effect on the reader than his actual words in the text message to Zimmerman and the Fox 5 Interview produced, the Murder Investigation Quote, like the Email Quote, is not provably false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even if the quotes in the Article were capable of being proven false, neither could form the basis for a defamation claim, because neither is defamatory\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    per quod\n   </em>\n   . The quotes are not defamatory\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   because they simply state what Plaintiff's \"investigation shows.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 129-30 (quoting Article at 2-3).) It is impossible to ascertain, without comparing Plaintiff's investigation to extrinsic facts (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the findings of other investigators), whether the findings attributed to Plaintiff reflect a lack of competence as an investigator. Nor are the quotes defamatory\n   <em>\n    per quod\n   </em>\n   . The Article expressly states that Plaintiff's findings regarding the email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks were \"consistent with\" the findings of an unnamed \"federal investigator.\" (Article at 2.) The Article also impliedly presents the theory that the murder investigation is being blocked as consistent with the findings of \"sources close to the [MPDC]\" who stated that the \"[MPDC] has no suspects and no substantial leads.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Thus, the quotes are not defamatory, because they do not impugn Plaintiff's skills as an investigator or otherwise tend to expose him to contempt or ridicule. To the contrary, they suggest that Plaintiff's conclusions regarding Rich's murder are consistent with those of other investigators.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Email Statement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In the Email Statement, Zimmerman told Joel Rich \"much of our information came from ... Rod Wheeler, who we\n   understand was working on behalf of you.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 145,) The facts as alleged in the Amended Complaint indicate that Plaintiff is a private investigator who was hired by the Rich family to investigate Rich's murder, and that Plaintiff provided Zimmerman with quotes and information about his investigation for the Article. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 95-97, 105, 120.) Nonetheless, Plaintiff claims the Email Statement is false because \"much\" of the information in the Article did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   come from Plaintiff. (PL Opp'n to Fox at 5; see also Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 246-47.) But Zimmerman's assessment of what amount of information qualifies as \"much\" is a \"subjective view.\"\n   <em>\n    Gallardo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202143011\">\n    2008 WL 2143011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.

The facts alleged in the Amended Complaint indicate that Plaintiff \"informed various media outlets that he had been misquoted\" in the Article, and that Fox subsequently retracted the Article. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 141, 150.) Thus, Butowsky's statement in the DNC Tweet that the Article was \"pulled b/c Rod Wheeler said [he] didn't say a quote,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 175), is Butowsky's \"interpretation,... theory, conjecture or surmise\" based on publicly available facts-i.e., Plaintiff's statements to media outlets and Fox News's retraction.\n   <em>\n    Biospherics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11710010\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/180/#p186\">\n    151 F.3d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
