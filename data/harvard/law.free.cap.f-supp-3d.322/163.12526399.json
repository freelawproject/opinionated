The Court will address these threshold arguments first, before turning to the merits of the parties' competing summary judgment motions on Moore's hostile work environment claim under the ADEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. MOORE'S THRESHOLD ARGUMENTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     HUD Did Not Constructively Admit the Allegations in Moore's Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, Moore claims that he is entitled to summary judgment against some or all of the defendants because, for various reasons, the defendants constructively admitted the allegations in the complaint. For example, Moore claims that HUD has admitted all of the allegations in his complaint because it failed to file a proper responsive pleading. Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 4. He claims that the answer filed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Sroka on behalf of HUD is \"legally unauthorized\" because Sroka is not a member of the Bar of this Court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205783\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/574/#p587\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 4-5 (citing Local Civ. R. 83.2(c)-(e) ). However, Local Civil Rule 83.2(e) permits an attorney \"who is employed or retained by the United States\" to \"practice in this Court on behalf of the United States ... irrespective of\" limitations based on local Bar admission, so this claim is without merit. Moore also asserts that the nine individual defendants named in his Amended Complaint failed to respond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. But this Court has already dismissed all claims against them, eliminating the need for a further response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121905\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/192/18/#p31\">\n    192 F.Supp.3d at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Moore contends that HUD conceded the allegations in his motion for summary judgment by failing to file an opposition and \"[i]nstead fil[ing] [a] cross-motion for summary judgment twice ... to substitute it as an Opposition.\" Pl.'s Reply at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 11-12. But HUD filed a consolidated opposition and motion for summary judgment, as the Court directed in its October 30, 2017 Scheduling Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 30, 2017 Scheduling Order [ECF No. 101]. In sum, because no defendant has conceded Moore's allegations, he is not entitled to summary judgment on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     HUD Properly Relied on Moore's Deposition Transcript\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Moore also contends that the government cannot rely on his deposition because he was \"never notified by the court reporter that the deposition transcript was available to review\" and because the \"first and only time [he] had an opportunity to review it\" was after HUD filed its cross-motion. Pl.'s Opp'n at 9. Thus, he asks the Court to strike the deposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121905\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/192/18/#p31\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(e) provides that, \"[o]n request by the deponent or a party before [a] deposition is completed, the deponent must be allowed 30 days after being notified ... that [a] transcript ... is available in which ... to review the transcript.\" Fed.

However, even assuming that the court reporter improperly failed to notify Moore that the transcript was available for review, Moore has not shown that the deposition should be stricken. Contrary to Rule 30(e)'s instructions, Moore has neither \"list[ed] the changes\" he would make to the transcript nor stated \"the reasons for making them\"; rather, he simply states that he \"does not agree with every transcription in the deposition.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Because the exhibits before the Court do not demonstrate severely abusive conduct and neither mention nor even allude to Moore's age, they are insufficient to support his claim of a hostile working environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266681\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/80/218/#p226\">\n    80 F.Supp.3d at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that \"allegations 'of disparaging remarks and other negative comments do not sufficiently demonstrate a significant level of offensiveness'\" (citation omitted) );\n   <em>\n    McKeithan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4162849\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/803/63/#p70\">\n    803 F.Supp.2d at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing case where plaintiff \"allege[d] only that he suffered as a result of [a supervisor]'s hostile behavior\" and \"[t]he Court is left to infer that each act was discriminatory ... simply based on the fact' that he is over sixty\").

Moore has shown neither. He therefore has not met his burden to establish the existence of a hostile work environment based on his age.

Moore Dep. at 78:2-3 (\"Q. And you told us that you were behind in the training? A. Yes.\").

Without more evidence of hostility, and without some nexus between the pressuring emails and Moore's age, a reasonable jury could not find for Moore on his claim of hostile work environment in violation of the ADEA. Moore has therefore failed to demonstrate the existence of any severe or pervasive hostility, age-based or otherwise, and has failed to support his motion for summary judgment. The absence of any evidence of severe and pervasive abuse, or abuse related to Moore's age, instead supports HUD's cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the Court will deny plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and will grant defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment.
