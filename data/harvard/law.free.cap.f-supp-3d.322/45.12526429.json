KSA timely removed the action to this Court. Pending before the Court is KSA's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   . Upon careful consideration of KSA's motion, the response and reply thereto, the applicable law, and for the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   KSA's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of a contractual dispute between DSCI and KSA. DSCI and KSA entered into a contract that provided for performance between August 2013 and April 2015. Compl., ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6 4. The contract was entered into in Saudi Arabia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. DSCI performed under the contract and KSA paid DSCI on a monthly basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. At the same time DSCI was performing under its contract with KSA, DSCI was awarded another contract, the details of which are not relevant to this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   DSCI breached the other contract and was terminated for failure to timely post a bond required by that contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because of that termination, DSCI became insolvent and surrendered control of its assets to Bank of America, its secured creditor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Bank of America appointed a restructuring officer to wrap up DSCI's affairs and resolve its outstanding debts and receivables.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In reviewing its outstanding debts, DSCI discovered two invoices for work completed on the KSA contract that had not been previously invoiced or collected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Accordingly, DSCI submitted invoices for this work, but KSA has refused to pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8, 9. DSCI filed suit against KSA to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , recoup the funds it alleges KSA owed to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Several provisions of the contract\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   between DSCI and KSA are relevant to this motion to dismiss. The contract provides that \"its interpretation, performance and enforcement shall be governed and construed by and in accordance with the applicable laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\" Mot. to Dismiss, Attach., ECF No. 10-1 at 25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, \"Arabic language shall be the approved language in interpreting and executing [the] contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45. Although the parties were permitted to use a \"foreign language in writing the contract ... [i]n cases of discrepancy between the Arabic text and the foreign language's text, the Arabic text shall supersede.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The contract also provides that \"[t]he consultant and its employees shall commit to all regulation, laws and customs prevailing in [Saudi Arabia] including labor law, residence and other related laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The contract designates Saudi Arabia as the place where the contract was to be performed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75-76. The contract required DSCI to keep all \"books and all accounts and documents related to this cont[r]act locally in Arabic ... certified by a chartered accountant licensed to work in [Saudi Arabia].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46. Saudi Arabian currency was the form of payment under the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. Finally, the forum-selection clause provides that \"[t]he grievance council shall be assigned for settlement of any disputes or claims arising from the execution of this cont[r]act, or related to this contract, or resulting from its dissolution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46. Although not defined in the contract, the \"grievance council\" refers to the Board of Grievances in Saudi Arabia, an administrative court, which has jurisdiction over government contract claims brought against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The forum-selection clause is mandatory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In opposing the motion to dismiss, DSCI does not contend that the forum-selection clause is invalid or unenforceable, but rather argues that: (1) the forum-selection clause is permissive and therefore it is not prohibited from bringing its claims in this Court; and (2) the Board of Grievances is not an adequate forum to resolve this dispute.

DSCI argues that the provision is permissive, rather than mandatory, because it does not contain language that excludes all other forums. Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 13 at 1-3. For this proposition, DSCI relies on\n   <em>\n    Stone &amp; Webster, Inc. v.

The forum-selection clause in that case stated: \"[The parties] agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for any legal proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055947,4010996\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/614/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055947,4010996\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/614/\">\n    at 615-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the D.C. Circuit found no error in the district court's finding that the forum-selection clause was permissive or in the district court's dismissal of the District of Columbia action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The forum-selection clause in DSCI's contract with KSA, however, is distinguishable from the provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, the provision in\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   explicitly stated that the United States District Court for the District of Columbia would be the \"non-exclusive jurisdiction\" for any disputes.\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055947,4010996\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/614/\">\n    779 F.3d at 615-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, the forum-selection clause here provides that the \"grievance council\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     shall\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   be assigned for settlement of any disputes or claims arising from the execution of this [contract].\" Mot. to Dismiss, Attach., ECF No. 10-1 at 46. (emphasis added). In\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   , the parties made it clear that the District of Columbia was one, but not the only, option.\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055947,4010996\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/614/\">\n    779 F.3d at 615-616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, there is no comparable language in the forum-selection clause to support DSCI's claim that the Board of Grievances would have non-exclusive jurisdiction over contract-related claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   DSCI's argument that the forum-selection clause in the contract is permissible because it does not explicitly exclude other forums also fails because there is no such requirement in this Circuit. In\n   <em>\n    Marra v. Papandreou\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit characterized as mandatory a nearly identical forum-selection clause and dismissed the\n   case in favor of adjudication in Greece.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674642,11219036\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/216/1119/\">\n    216 F.3d 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1120-21 (D.C.

The clause at issue in\n   <em>\n    Marra\n   </em>\n   stated, any \"dispute or disagreement ... arising from the application of this license, the interpretation or performance of its terms ... and in general any matter that may occur concerning a license, shall be settled by the Greek courts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674642,11219036\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/216/1119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Notably, the D.C.
