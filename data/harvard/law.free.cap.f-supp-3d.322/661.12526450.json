Revised Second Superseding Indictment, ECF No. 88-2. Prior to trial, the Government filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , in which it sought a pretrial ruling precluding Bailey from \"eliciting on cross-examination of law enforcement agents certain potentially exculpatory statements Bailey made during his [recorded] interviews with law enforcement on May 5, 2016.\" Gov. Mot. 1, ECF No. 62. In a nutshell, the Government argued that anything Bailey told the agents during his recorded interview\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that it intended to introduce during its case in chief would be admissible non-hearsay (as an admission by a party opponent under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A) ), but that anything exculpatory that Bailey told them that he intended to elicit under cross examination or otherwise would be inadmissible hearsay, unless\n   he was prepared to testify about it and be subject to cross examination. Gov. Mot. 2. Bailey filed an opposition. Def.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On May 12, 2017, I held a telephonic hearing with counsel during which I advised that without knowing the specific portions of Bailey's statements that the Government intended to introduce, I was not able to issue a definitive pretrial ruling on the record pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 103(b), but I nonetheless gave them guidance regarding the approach I would take at trial. I also told them that I planned to issue a written opinion to memorialize my thinking because the issues raised by the Government are recurring in nature, and there is a scarcity of helpful decisional authority in this circuit to guide courts and counsel in resolving the sometimes complicated issues the Government's Motion raises. This Memorandum Opinion provides that guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Whether the defendant in a criminal trial may compel the Government to introduce his exculpatory statements at the same time that it introduces his inculpatory ones implicates a number of evidentiary rules, including Rules 102 (which instructs judges to interpret the rules of evidence in order to insure fairness, ascertain the truth, and to secure a just determination), 106 (the so-called \"rule of completeness\"), 401 (relevance), 403 (probative value versus danger of unfair prejudice or confusion); 611(a) (court control over the examination of witnesses and presentation of evidence); and 802 (the rule against admissibility of hearsay, and its exceptions). But where the inculpatory statements given by the defendant to the government were not written or recorded, common-law principles of evidence also apply. As will be seen, although there is no shortage of case law and treatise analysis on this subject, the law is far from settled, and courts and commentators have reached starkly different results by applying a variety of approaches, resulting in an evidentiary landscape that is unclear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   It is not my aim in this opinion to untangle the many nuances of the Gordian knot raised by the Government's Motion, but rather to identify the key elements that a court should examine to make an appropriate ruling, consistent with the Rules of Evidence and the still-viable common law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The starting place is the common law evidentiary principle known as the \"doctrine of completeness\" (which is partially codified as Fed. R. Evid. 106 ), and its impact on the adversary system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Common-Law Origins of Rule 106\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The relationship between Rule 106 and the common-law doctrine of completeness has been explained by one respected evidence treatise this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Rule 106 arises from the common law completeness doctrine. Both the common law and Rule 106 presume two tenets of the adversary system. First, under the principle of party presentation of evidence, parties-not the court-bear the responsibility to produce evidence of their respective factual claims. An important corollary of party presentation\n   holds that neither party has any obligation to produce evidence that favors the adversary. Second, a principal of sequential procedure, sometimes called \"stage preclusion\", provides that the trial of an issue of fact follows a sequence of proof and counterproof whereby at each stage the parties alternate roles in presenting and challenging evidence.... The two tenets that give rise to Rule 106 are also embodied in Rule 611.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   21A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Kenneth W. Graham, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5072 (2d ed. 2005) (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The back-and-forth presentation of evidence in a criminal case usually works fairly smoothly, but problems arise when one party's artful phrasing of a question calls for a response that is technically accurate, but incomplete, altering the meaning of the original statement. A classic example is when the prosecutor elicits from a law-enforcement witness that, when the defendant was interviewed in connection with a homicide investigation, he admitted that he owned the gun used to commit the murder but omits that the defendant also said that he sold the gun three months before the shooting. Quoting the defendant out of context presents a misleading picture for the jury. In such circumstances, if the defendant is required to wait until his case in chief, or even until cross examination, to put his statement to the government witness in its proper context, it might be too late to counteract the impression left with the jury that the defendant, having admitted to owing the murder weapon, was the one who shot the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Common-Law Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The common law responded to these abuses of the adversary system by a limited restriction on party control of the cases that ... [is called] 'the completeness doctrine.' \" 21A Wright &amp; Graham,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 5072. Wigmore's description of the rule of completeness was that \"[i]n evidencing the tenor of an utterance material or relevant, made in words, whether written or oral in original or in copy, the whole of the utterance on a single topic or transaction must be taken together.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting John Henry Wigmore,\n   <em>\n    Code of Evidence\n   </em>\n   371 (3d ed. 1941) ). The influential Field Code codified the common law rule of completeness in this manner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   When part of an act, declaration, conversation or writing is given in evidence by one party, the whole on the same subject may be inquired into by the other; when a letter is read, the answer may be given; and when a detached act, declaration, conversation or writing is given in evidence, any other act, declaration, conversation or writing, which is necessary to make it understood, may also be given in evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting N.Y.

Another important feature of the common-law doctrine of completeness was that it allowed the introduction of otherwise inadmissible evidence to give proper context to the incomplete and misleading evidence offered by the original proponent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5072 (\"Thus, the opponent can introduce what would otherwise be hearsay to complete a truncated statement offered by the proponent.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

Less clear was whether the party seeking to complete the record regarding what was said in a writing\n   or conversation could require the proponent to include the content necessary for completeness at the time the incomplete version was presented to the jury or had to wait until his case in chief or cross examination to do so. Most common-law courts would not allow this \"acceleration of completeness,\" but some courts, including the Supreme Court, did.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711894\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/212/183/#p201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711894\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/212/183/#p201\">\n    212 U.S. at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711894\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/212/183/#p201\">\n    29 S.Ct. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Rule 106\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The common-law doctrine of completeness has been partially codified by Fed.

R. Evid. 106 (emphasis added). The italicized words highlight several important features of Rule 106. First, it applies only to writings and recorded statements, not to conversations or other oral statements that have not been memorialized in some written or recorded form (hence, Rule 106 only\n   <em>\n    partially\n   </em>\n   incorporates the common law rule). Second, when the Rule applies, it permits the party against whom the incomplete information has been introduced to require the introduction of completing information at the same time (the so called \"acceleration clause\"). Third, the rule only requires the introduction of the completing information when fairness requires that it be considered at the same time as the incomplete information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Advisory Committee Note to Rule 106 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The rule is based on two considerations. The first is the misleading impression created by taking matters out of context. The second is the inadequacy of repair work when delayed to a point later in the trial. The rule does not in any way circumscribe the right of the adversary to develop the matter on cross-examination or as part of his own case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   For practical reasons, the rule is limited to writings and recorded statements and does not apply to conversations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Fed.

And, although the Advisory Note states that the rule only applies to writings and recorded statements (and not to conversations) for \"practical reasons,\" it does not explain what\n   those practical reasons are, or how courts should deal with the problem created when one party introduces a misleadingly incomplete portion of an oral statement or conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Application of Rule 106\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Independent Admissibility\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Split of Authority\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the absence of guidance from the Rule or the Committee, courts and commentators have been left to answer these questions on their own, with conflicting results.

This hardly lives up to the aspirations of Rule 102 that the rules of evidence should be construed to the \"end of ascertaining the truth and securing a just determination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But not all courts have been so quick to restrict Rule 106 to independently admissible evidence, even at the expense of fairness.

Its analysis is worth quoting at length:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Rule 106 explicitly changes the normal order of proof in requiring that ... evidence [within the scope of the Rule] must be \"considered contemporaneously\" with the evidence already admitted. Whether Rule 106 concerns the substance of evidence, however, is a more difficult matter. The structure of the Federal Rules of Evidence indicates that Rule 106 is concerned with more than merely the order of proof. Rule 106 is\n   found not in Rule 611, which governs the \"Mode and Order of Interrogation and Presentation,\" but in Article I, which contains rules that generally restrict the manner of applying the exclusionary rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.

DOJ \"prosecutors argued that amending the Rule would allow defense counsel to make bogus claims that the evidence was taken out of context so that they could get inadmissible evidence before the jury.\" 21A Wright &amp; Graham,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 5071. Fair enough. But it is just as much of an abuse of the adversary system for the prosecution to paint a misleading picture to the jury by introducing out-of-context inculpatory statements by the defendant as it is for a defense attorney to assert \"bogus\" claims that prosecution evidence was taken out of context as a pretext to \"correct\" the record by introducing otherwise inadmissible evidence. And it does not answer to prevent the later abuse but permit the former. Moreover, proper application of the \"fairness\" requirement of Rule 106 should prevent the abuses that the Department of Justice feared because judges should restrict application of Rule 106 to those situations where misleading information actually was introduced by the prosecution and allow only such correcting evidence as is necessary to counteract it. In this regard, courts and commentators have identified various factors that go a long way towards preventing any abuse of Rule 106 that might occur if inadmissible evidence is allowed to complete the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To begin with, Rule 106 should never come into play unless misleading evidence has been introduced that requires clarification or explanation-otherwise there is no unfairness that needs correction.\n   <em>\n    Wilkerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793507\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/692/#p696\">\n    84 F.3d at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Thus, the rule of completeness ... would not appl[y] ... where there was no partially introduced conversation that needed clarification or explanation.\"). And, judges need not take at face value exaggerated claims that a partially introduced statement requires completion unless it can be shown with some precision just how the incomplete evidence is taken out of context. The Seventh Circuit has identified a four-part test to determine when this has happened:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Our case law interpreting Rule 106 requires that the evidence the proponent seeks to admit must be relevant to the issues in the case. Even then, a trial judge need admit only that evidence which qualifies or explains the evidence offered by the opponent. The test is conjunctive. Once relevance has been established, the trial court then must address the second half of the test, and should do so by asking (1) does it explain the admitted evidence, (2) does it place the admitted evidence in context, (3) will admitting it avoid misleading the trier of fact, and (4) will admitting it insure a fair and impartial understanding of all the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

They include: (1) Is the proffered evidence taken out of context (does what is missing change the meaning of what was introduced)? (2) Does the lack of context make the evidence misleading (does the admitted evidence \"invite\" or \"permit\" a false premise)? (3) Can the misleading impression be dispelled by other means (for example, by instructing the jury not to draw the misleading inference, or by permitting introduction of completing evidence at a later time, such as during cross examination or the defense case, so as not to interrupt the presentation of the prosecution's case)? (4) How much evidence is needed to dispel misleading effects (lawyers should be precise in identifying the information actually needed to correct the misleading impression created by the incomplete evidence, and judges should be skeptical about allowing expansive introduction\n   of lengthy excerpts from writings or recordings under the guise of \"correcting\" a misimpression)? (5) How strong is the evidence admitted and omitted (how does the strength of the admitted evidence compare to the strength of the omitted evidence-a minor discrepancy does not require \"correction\" with a massive introduction of information of little probative value)? (6) How long will repair be delayed if not accelerated (if the completing information is not introduced during the prosecution's case, can the defendant effectively dispel any misleading impression during cross examination or during his case in chief, or will the damage, once done, be irremediable if not immediately addresses)? (7) What is the consequential fact to be proved (if the misimpression goes to an essential element of the prosecution's case-such as the defendant's motive or intent-then there is a more exigent need to insure immediate correction than exists if the incomplete information is primarily relevant to a less critical issue, such as an assessment of a witness's credibility)? (8) How much will completion disrupt or prejudice the proponent (the more disruptive the immediate completion will be of the proponent's case, the more cautious the court should be before allowing it at that time)? And (9) does truncation or completion implicate constitutional rights (if the prosecution introduces incomplete portions of a defendant's confession that, if not completed by introducing other parts of the confession, would require the defendant to waive his Fifth Amendment right not to testify)? 21A Wright &amp; Graham,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 5077.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Consideration of these factors should be sufficient for any careful judge to determine whether (and if so, how much) completeness is required by Rule 106, and eliminate much of the concern expressed by those who resist the idea of permitting inadmissible evidence to complete the record when fairness legitimately requires it. Unfortunately, to date few cases (especially those that hold that inadmissible information may not be used for completion purposes) have taken the opportunity to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Oral Statements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   A final vexing issue raised (but not answered) by Rule 106 and the enigmatic language of the Advisory Committee Note is what courts should do with regard to oral statements or conversations that have not been memorialized by a writing or recording-particularly when the unwritten or unrecorded statement is the defendant's confession to a law-enforcement officer. On its face, Rule 106 is limited to \"writings\" and \"recorded statements,\" and the Advisory Committee Note states that for (unnamed) \"practical reasons\" the rule does not apply to conversations. Fed. R. Civ. P. 106 &amp; advisory committee's note to 1972 proposed rules. Many courts have taken this to mean that in a criminal case, the prosecution may elicit a law-enforcement officer's testimony about inculpatory statements made by the defendant because they are admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(A) as admissions. But they have also held that, during cross examination of the officer, the defendant may not elicit non-inculpatory statements the defendant made during the same interview because (a) Rule 106 does not apply to oral statements and (b) even if it did, the defendant's exculpatory statements (even if necessary to dispel the misleading, out-of-context impression left by the officer's direct examination) are inadmissible hearsay.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ortega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11486263\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/675/#p682\">\n    203 F.3d at 682-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Even if the rule of completeness did apply, exclusion of Ortega's exculpatory statements was proper because these statements would still have constituted inadmissible hearsay.\");\n   <em>\n    Wilkerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793507\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/692/#p696\">\n    84 F.3d at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that Rule 106 did not apply to unrecorded conversation between\n   defendant and FBI agent, and defendant's exculpatory statements to the agents were not admissible under the hearsay rules).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   While the \"practical reasons\" why oral conversations are excluded from Rule 106 undoubtedly include the need to avoid \"he said, she said\" disputes about the content of an unrecorded or unwritten statement, those concerns do not justify creating an environment in which the prosecution may be able to introduce the defendant's out-of-context inculpatory oral statements, but where the defendant is powerless to do anything at that time because Rule 106 does not reach oral statements. And if there is legitimate concern about the difficulty in establishing what was said in oral conversations, the factors described above provide a judge with the analytical tools to determine whether to allow the evidence during the proponent's case or thereafter during cross examination or during the adversary's case in chief on a case by case basis. A blanket rule of prohibition is unwarranted, and invites abuse. Moreover, if the content of some oral statements are disputed and difficult to prove, others are not-because they have been summarized (for example, in a FBI agent's form 302 summary of the defendant's confession), or because they were witnessed by enough people to assure that what was actually said can be established with sufficient certainty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Residual Common-Law Completeness Doctrine\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   But there is an even more fundamental reason why court decisions that hold that Rule 106 does not apply to oral statements or conversations should not prevent a party from completing the record (at the time the misleading evidence is introduced or thereafter during cross examination or the opposing party's own case) to prevent abuse of the adversary system when a proponent introduces a misleadingly incomplete part of a conversation or oral confession. The reason is that, as the Supreme Court itself appears to have recognized, Rule 106 only\n   <em>\n    partially\n   </em>\n   codifies the common law doctrine of completeness, and for situations beyond the reach of Rule 106, the common law still applies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Beech Aircraft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1493414\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/153/#p171\">\n    488 U.S. at 170-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1493414\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/153/#p171\">\n    109 S.Ct. 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 1 Kenneth S.

The adversary system finds its most important application in the trial of a criminal case. The government has nearly unlimited resources to investigate and bring charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   With that power comes the obligation to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. We take pains to instruct criminal juries that the government bears the entire burden of proof. The defendant is presumed to be innocent, and is not required to prove anything, or even testify. We admonish juries to draw no adverse inference when a defendant elects not to testify in his case. We also esteem the defendant's right not to be compelled to incriminate himself and take precautions to avoid the chilling effect that comes with any comment in front of the jury that suggests that they should take note of the fact that he chose not to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   If a prosecutor introduces an incomplete version of the defendant's written or oral statement to the investigating officers by eliciting only the inculpatory portions, while leaving out exculpatory ones that, in fairness, would paint a more complete picture and dispel a misleading impression that the jury may have reached having heard only the incomplete portions, then the defendant is at a serious disadvantage. If he is unable to introduce the parts of his statement that the government omitted at the same time that the incomplete version is presented to the jury (or instead very shortly thereafter on cross examination, or even later during his own case) because the court rules that the omitted parts are inadmissible hearsay or (if the statement was an oral one) that Rule 106 is inapplicable to oral statements, then he has only two remaining options: (1) allow the misleading version to stand unchallenged; or (2) waive his rights against self-incrimination and testify-but only after the government has completed its case. This is a high price to pay to correct misleading information. If one accepts, as the language of the Rule requires, that Rule 106 may only be invoked in the first place to correct an unfair presentation of incomplete information, then construing Rule 106 the way that many courts have done countenances an abuse of the adversary system that the common-law rule of completeness was designed to prevent. That is why the better-reasoned cases have held that, where necessary to redress an unfairly incomplete rendition of a written, recorded or oral statement, evidence that would otherwise be inadmissible may be introduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, the goal of Rule 106 and the common-law rule of completeness is to level the playing field, not tilt it in favor of the defendant. For that reason, it should only come into play when it is clear that the incomplete version of a written, recorded or oral statement is unfairly misleading. And only information that is essential to dispel the misleading impression should be admitted. This is especially true if, as the better-reasoned cases have concluded, inadmissible evidence may be used for this purpose. For this reason, judges have an obligation to carefully examine both the assertedly misleading information and the proffered completing information to insure that the evidence that was introduced requires clarification or explanation, and the proffered evidence is essential to clarify or explain. Careful consideration of the factors that courts and commentators have developed will allow a judge to strike the right balance, and offset any concern about the use of inadmissible evidence where necessary to correct unfairly incomplete evidence.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 II.A.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Third, there is little persuasive justification for not applying the same principles to oral statements that Rule 106 applies to written or recorded ones. A misleading oral statement is no less unfair that a written one. And the cases that have allowed the use of Rule 611(a) to achieve this result seem better reasoned than the ones that have not.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 II.B.2. Similarly, it seems ill-advised to conclude, as some courts have done, that only admissible evidence\n   may be used under Rule 106 or the common law rule of completeness without first considering the underlying purpose of the rule, which is to prevent an abuse of the adversary system.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 II.A.1. One can hardly claim the moral high ground through a willingness to accept an unfair result in the name of evidentiary purity. As the D.C. Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    Sutton\n   </em>\n   , \" Rule 106 can adequately fulfill its function only by permitting the admission of some otherwise inadmissible evidence when the court finds in fairness that the offered evidence should be considered contemporaneously. A contrary construction raises the specter of distorted and misleading trials, and creates difficulties for both litigants and the trial court.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3611276,10552204\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/801/1346/\">\n    801 F.2d at 1368-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, if a trial court is compelled by reason of the governing circuit authority to restrict Rule 106 to writings and recorded statements (and precluded from using Rule 611(a) to adopt the protections of Rule 106 for oral statements), or is prevented from admitting inadmissible evidence when necessary to dispel an unfairly misleading version of a written or oral statement introduced by the prosecutor, the court should carefully consider Rule 403.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 II.B.3. If the incomplete version offered by the government would cause unfair prejudice to the defendant, or tend to mislead the jury, then the court-unable because of restrictions imposed by circuit authority to redress the prejudice-should prevent the government from introducing the unfairly misleading evidence to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The ultimate conclusions that I reach in light of the foregoing discussion are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (1) Rule 106 only covers writings or recordings, but its codification does not preempt the application of the common-law rule of completeness for oral statements and conversations. If the common-law rule is applied to oral statements and conversations, the court should consider the factors discussed at \u00a7 II.A.2 to determine whether the completing information is required at the same time that the incomplete information is introduced or whether it should be admitted at cross examination or later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (2) As an alternative means of dealing with oral statements or conversations, Rule 611(a) allows the trial judge to apply the same underlying logic of Rule 106.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (3) Neither Rule 106 nor the common-law rule of completeness is triggered unless some clearly identifiably unfairness would exist without allowing the party that would be prejudiced the opportunity to offer information that would clarify or explain. The trial judge must carefully examine both the incomplete and completing information to insure that fairness does require the correction, and limit the correcting information to that actually needed to eliminate the unfairness. The factors discussed in \u00a7 II.A.2 should be used by the judge in conducting this analysis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (4) When the fairness principles that underlie Rule 106 and the common-law rule of completeness require application of the doctrine, both admissible and inadmissible information should be available to set the record straight. While there is Fourth Circuit authority holding that inadmissible evidence may not be used,\n   <em>\n    Hassan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071009\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/104/#p134\">\n    742 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   134-35 ;\n   <em>\n    Wilkerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793507\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/692/#p696\">\n    84 F.3d at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , there also is authority holding that it may,\n   <em>\n    Gravely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549400\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/840/1156/#p1163\">\n    840 F.2d at 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and until this split in authority has been resolved, a court may allow\n   inadmissible evidence under the completeness doctrine, subject to the restrictions mentioned in my third conclusion above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (5) If the Fourth Circuit should clarify that inadmissible evidence is not available to complete the record under Rule 106, the common law, or Rule 611(a), then the trial court should carefully consider Rule 403, and if the unfairness that would result from the proponent's introduction of the incomplete information cannot adequately be addressed by other means, exclude the misleading information pursuant to Rule 403.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    I previously denied Bailey's Motions to Suppress, ECF No. 52, the two Mirandized statements that he gave to Government agents on May 5, 2015, the day a search and seizure warrant was executed at his residence, which led to the discovery of the evidence that led to the charges pending against him.
