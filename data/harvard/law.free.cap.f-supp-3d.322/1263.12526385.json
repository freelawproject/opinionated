Defendant's Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Objections to Report and Recommendations (Doc. 34), filed June 6, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With briefing complete, the matter is ripe. Upon consideration, Plaintiff's Motion for Entry of Judgment is due to be denied and the case dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This case involves a disputed insurance claim for water damage to a building. Defendant, United Specialty Insurance Company (\"\n   <strong>\n    United\n   </strong>\n   \"), issued an all-risks insurance policy (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Policy\n   </strong>\n   \") to Plaintiff, J.P.F.D. Investment Corporation (\"\n   <strong>\n    JPFD\n   </strong>\n   \"), for a piece of real property owned by Plaintiff. (Doc. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3; Doc. 11-1). The property sustained water damage on January 20, 2017. (Doc. 2, \u00b6 2). Plaintiff immediately reported the loss to Defendant. (Doc. 31-2, \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties then embarked on a months-long endeavor to resolve the water damage claim on the Policy. Defendant conceded throughout the claims process that the water damage is covered under the Policy. The only dispute has been the amount of damages. Indeed, Defendant agreed to pay a water extraction firm $152,262.52 for preliminary water extraction services on April 6, 2017. (Doc. 11-2). Less than a month later, Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff $91,080.97 in undisputed replacement costs pursuant to a \"preliminary and partial\" proof of loss submitted by Plaintiff. (Docs. 11-4, 11-6). Because of the continuing\n   disagreement over coverage, Defendant selected an appraiser on June 20, 2017, and formally invoked its right to an appraisal in a letter to Plaintiff dated June 26, 2017. (Doc. 31-2, \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 23, 2017, Plaintiff initiated this action by filing the Complaint in Florida state court. (Doc. 2). Defendant was served with the Complaint on July 3, 2017-a week after Defendant invoked its appraisal rights. (Doc. 31-1, p. 2). On August 1, 2017, Defendant removed the Complaint to this Court. (Doc. 1). On October 17, 2017, the Court directed the parties to obtain an appraisal pursuant to Defendant's motion. (Doc. 25). On January 5, 2018, Plaintiff received a $249,228.96 appraisal award, which Defendant promptly paid. (Doc. 30, \u00b6 10; Doc. 30-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 2, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion requesting the Court enter judgment confirming the appraisal award and award Plaintiff attorneys' fees pursuant to \u00a7 627.428. (Doc. 30, p. 18 (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Motion\n   </strong>\n   \") ). Magistrate Judge Gregory J. Kelly submitted a R&amp;R dated May 9, 2018, recommending the Court deny the Motion and dismiss the case. (Doc. 32). Judge Kelly recommends denial because: (1) there was never a \"failure to pay\" by Defendant under the Policy; and (2) Defendant never denied coverage under the Policy and was working toward resolving the claim when Plaintiff filed suit, thus the Court should not award attorneys' fees or enter a judgment confirming the arbitration award. (Doc. 32, pp. 6-9). Plaintiff objects to the R&amp;R. (Doc. 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   1 When a magistrate judge has been designated to decide a matter that is dispositive in nature, the magistrate judge must issue a report to the district judge specifying proposed findings of fact and the recommended disposition. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(1). Any party who disagrees with the magistrate judge's decision has fourteen days from the date of the decision to seek the district judge's review by filing objections to those specific portions of the decision with which the party disagrees. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). The district judge must then make a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   determination of each issue to which objection is made. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).\n   <em>\n    De novo\n   </em>\n   review \"require[s] independent consideration of factual issues based on the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Jeffrey S. v.

The district judge may then accept, reject, or modify the magistrate judge's recommendation, receive additional evidence or briefing from the parties, or return the matter to the magistrate judge for further review.

Because this case is before the Court pursuant to diversity jurisdiction (Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 4-10), the Court applies the law of the forum state, Florida.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erie R.R.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff makes two arguments in its Objection to the R&amp;R: the Magistrate Judge erred in finding (1) that Defendant did not deny Plaintiff benefits; and (2) that attorney's fees under Florida Statutes \u00a7 627.428 were not warranted in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Omega Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186738\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/1207/\">\n    200 So.3d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2016). (Doc. 33, pp. 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendant Did Not Deny Plaintiff Benefits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff first argues that Defendant denied Plaintiff benefits owed to Plaintiff under the Policy, necessitating the instant suit. In support, Plaintiff cites Defendant's rejection of Plaintiff's March 28, 2017,\n   proof of loss, and Defendant's failure to pay the appraisal award within 30 days as required by the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 7-8). This objection is due to be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff's first argument in support of this objection seemingly ignores the Policy. Specifically, the Policy states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Loss Payment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   34...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   g. We [United] will pay for covered loss or damage within 30 days after we receive the sworn proof of loss, if you [JPFD] have complied with all of the terms of this Coverage Part, and: (1) We have reached agreement with you on the amount of loss; or (2) An appraisal award has been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Doc. 11-1, p. 58). Contrary to Plaintiff's assertions, the Policy does not vest Plaintiff with an unfettered right to full payment of a sworn proof of loss. Payment is contingent upon (1) the filing of a sworn proof of loss, and (2) either agreement as to the loss amount, or an appraisal award. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). When Defendant refused to pay Plaintiff's March 28, 2017, proof of loss, the parties had neither agreed on the amount of loss nor obtained an appraisal. Further, Defendant paid the undisputed portion of Plaintiff's request and was working toward a resolution when this suit was filed. Accordingly, Defendant's refusal to pay the March 28, 2017, proof of loss did not constitute a denial of benefits under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court does not reach Plaintiff's second argument-that Defendant's failure to pay the appraisal award within thirty days constituted a denial of benefits-because it was not presented to the Magistrate Judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v. McNeil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3384135\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/1287/#p1292\">\n    557 F.3d 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1292 (11th Cir. 2009) (\"[A] district court has discretion to decline to consider a party's argument when that argument was not first presented to the magistrate judge.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff is Not Entitled Fees Pursuant to \u00a7 627.428\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff next asserts Magistrate Judge Kelly erred in relying upon cases decided before\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Omega Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186738\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/1207/\">\n    200 So.3d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2016), in finding that a formal \"denial of coverage\" is a pre-requisite to recovering attorneys' fees under Florida Statutes \u00a7 627.428. This objection is likewise due to be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff maintains that Magistrate Judge Kelly improperly relied upon numerous cases decided before\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , which controls the present case. This objection has no merit for three reasons. First, Magistrate Judge Kelly squarely addressed\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , finding that case distinguishable because it involved a \"wrongful denial of coverage.\" (Doc. 32, p. 8). Second, Plaintiff's argument suggests, without support, that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   overruled or modified the decisional law cited in the R&amp;R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Third and finally,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   does not support Plaintiff's request for fees pursuant to \u00a7 627. 428. \"Section 627.428 provides that an incorrect denial of benefits, followed by a judgment or its equivalent of payment in favor of the insured, is sufficient for an insured to recover attorney's fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186738\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/1207/\">\n    200 So.3d at 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As explained in Section III.A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Defendant did not incorrectly deny Plaintiff benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff is neither entitled to attorneys' fees under \u00a7 627.428, nor a judgment confirming the arbitration award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   1.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The matter before the Court is an insurance dispute. Doc. No. 2. Plaintiff owns property (the \"Property\") located in Orlando, Florida.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. Defendant issued an all-risks insurance policy (the \"Policy\") providing coverage for any damage to the Property caused by direct physical loss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. On January 20, 2017, the Property suffered water damage. Doc. No. 30 at \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On January 25, 2017, Defendant, through an independent insurance adjuster, inspected the Property to determine the scope of water damage. Doc. No. 31-2 at \u00b6 4. After the inspection, Eric Osking of Advanced Building Assessment, Inc. notified Defendant that he was Plaintiff's representative as to the loss on the Property and stated that he would be preparing an estimate of damages, but that such estimate would take some time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On January 25, 2017, Defendant met with representatives from DryFast Recovery Systems, LLC (\"Dryfast\"), a water extraction company selected by Mr. Osking, to begin water extraction at the Property. Doc. No. 31-2 at \u00b6 6. On January 31, 2017, Dryfast submitted a direction to pay signed by Plaintiff's corporate representative and an estimated invoice for water extraction services rendered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. On April 6, 2017, Defendant paid Dryfast the full amount of its invoice, subject to a $2,500 deductible, for a total amount of $152,262.52.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On March 28, 2017, Plaintiff submitted a proof of loss for $302,272.46. Doc. No. 31-2 at \u00b6 8. On April 26, 2017, Defendant sent correspondence stating that it disagreed with the scope of damages in Plaintiff's proof of loss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Defendant also advised Plaintiff that it was retaining a\n   building specialist from Dryfast to provide another damage estimate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On May 2, 2017, Defendant sent an estimate stating that the Property incurred $112,716.90 in building repair costs and $154,762.52 in water extraction costs for a total replacement cost of $267,479.42. Doc. No. 31-2 at \u00b6 11. Defendant then subtracted $21,635.93 in recoverable depreciation, the prior payment to Dryfast of $152,262.52, and the $2,500.00 deductible for a remaining payment of $91,080.97.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On May 3, 2017, Defendant received a \"preliminary and partial\" proof of loss from Plaintiff for $91,080.97, which Defendant paid. Doc. No. 31-2 at \u00b6 12. On May 25, 2017, Defendant received from Dryfast a comparative estimate for remaining damages to the Property in the amount of $96,397.47.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. On June 15, 2017, Defendant sent correspondence to Plaintiff's public adjuster about Dryfast's comparative estimate and attempted to contact Mr. Osking to discuss the estimate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. On June 20, 2017, after receiving no response from Mr. Osking, Defendant selected an appraiser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On June 23, 2017, Plaintiff filed a complaint (the \"Complaint\") in Florida state court. Doc. No. 30 at \u00b6 7. On June 26, 2017, Defendant formally demanded appraisal pursuant to the Policy. Doc. No. 31-2 at \u00b6 15. Defendant formally demanded appraisal due to the parties' disagreement about their respective damages calculations, but Mr. Osking never responded to the same.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.

No. 11. In the motion to compel, Defendant argued that coverage was admitted, and the only dispute was over the amount of loss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On October 17, 2017, United States District Judge Paul G.

Doc. No. 30-2. Such amount is the sum of the $249,228.96 appraisal award less the $91,080.97 payment Defendant made after receiving Plaintiff's partial and preliminary proof of loss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On February 2, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion (the \"Motion\") requesting that the Court: 1) enter judgment confirming the appraisal award; and 2) awarding Plaintiff reasonable attorneys' fees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.428\">\n    Fla.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Motion is unavailing for three reasons. First, under the terms of the Policy, there was never a failure to pay on the part of Defendant. Plaintiff's argument centers on two provisions in the Policy:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    Loss Payment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   g.\n   <em>\n    We will pay for covered loss or damage within 30 days after we receive the sworn proof of loss, if\n   </em>\n   you have complied with all of the terms of this Coverage Part, and:\n   <em>\n    (1) We have reached agreement with you on the amount of loss; or (2) An appraisal award has been made.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    SERVICE OF SUIT CLAUSE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   This endorsement modifies insurance provided by the policy to which this form is attached.\n   <em>\n    It is agreed that in the event of the failure by us to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder, we will, at your request, submit to the jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction within the United States of America.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Doc. No. 30 at 3-4 (emphasis added). Thus, the Policy's loss payment provision states that Defendant will pay for covered loss or damage within thirty days after receipt of a sworn proof of loss, provided that Defendant agrees on the amount of loss or an appraisal award has been made.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The Policy's service of suit clause states that Defendant submits to the jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a failure by Defendant to pay any amount claimed to be due.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   At the time Plaintiff filed the Complaint, Defendant paid $91,080.97 in response to Plaintiff's preliminary and partial proof of loss, but the parties were still in dispute as to the amount of loss beyond that amount. Doc. No. 31-2 at 3-5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, an appraisal award was not made at the time Plaintiff filed the Complaint in Florida state court. Doc. No. 30 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Second, Defendant never denied coverage under the Policy, and it appears that it was in the process of resolving the matter through appraisal when it was served with the Complaint. After receiving another estimate from Dryfast regarding the total amount of loss, Defendant attempted to contact Mr. Osking, but it did not receive a response from him. Doc. No. 31-2 at 4-5. Defendant formally demanded appraisal under the Policy one week before being served with the Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. No. 31-1 at 2; Doc. No. 31-2 at 4. Furthermore, Defendant hired an appraiser three days before Plaintiff filed the Complaint in Florida state court. Doc. No. 30 at \u00b6 7; Doc. No. 31-2 at 4. Thus, Defendant already paid a portion of the loss and was in the process of attempting to resolve the remaining dispute through the appraisal process before having notice of the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, the Florida Supreme Court cases Plaintiff cites,\n   <em>\n    Ivey v.

The insurer later conceded that benefits were due under the insurance policy, and the Florida Supreme Court found that the insured was entitled to attorneys' fees under Section 627.428.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186738\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/1207/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186738\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/1207/\">\n    at 1218-1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Ivey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , Defendant never denied Plaintiff's claim for coverage. Doc. No. 31-2 at 5. Instead, Defendant hired an appraiser before the Complaint was filed and formally demanded appraisal prior to being served with the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The parties' only dispute was over the amount of loss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. The parties have participated in an appraisal; an award was issued; and Defendant paid the remaining amount due under the award. Doc. No. 30 at 4; Doc. No. 30-2; Doc. No. 31-2 at 5. Thus, Plaintiff's filing of the Complaint was not necessitated by Defendant's actions, and any judgment confirming the appraisal award and awarding attorneys' fees to Plaintiff would not be consistent with the purpose of Section 627.428. Because the parties have resolved their dispute through appraisal, the award has been paid, and there is no other\n   dispute before the Court, it is recommended that the Court deny the Motion and dismiss the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
