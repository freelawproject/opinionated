(\"Marvel\"), LucasFilm Ltd, LLC, and LucasFilm Entertainment Company Ltd. LLC (together with LucasFilm Ltd. LLC, \"LucasFilm\") bring this copyright and trademark infringement action against Defendant Characters for Hire, LLC (\"CFH\") and its principal, Defendant Nick Sarelli. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. (\"SAC\"), ECF No. 51.) Plaintiffs assert multiple claims against Defendants under federal and New York common law, principally alleging that Defendants infringed on Plaintiffs' intellectual property rights by marketing and operating a party services and entertainment business that uses Plaintiffs' copyrighted works and trademarks without authorization. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 33-37, 39-42, 44-17, 49-52, 54-57, 59-64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs move pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure seeking partial summary judgment with respect to their federal claims for copyright and trademark infringement, as well as\n   their claim for trademark dilution under Section 360-1 of New York's General Business Law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl's.' Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pls.' Mot\"), ECF No. 59, at 1; Pls.' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pls,' Mem. in Supp.\"), ECF No. 60, at 13 n.4.) In addition, Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on the issue of willfulness. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. at 1.) Defendants also move under Rule 56, seeking summary judgment dismissing all claims asserted in the SAC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. for Summ, J. (\"Defs.' Mot.\"), ECF No. 66, at 1.) They argue, among other things, that Plaintiffs' alleged copyrighted works are based on prior works that are part of the public domain and that their use of Plaintiffs' trademarks is protected by the nominative fair use defense. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. in Supp. of Summ. J. (\"Defs.' Mem.\"), ECF No. 67, at 5-6, 7-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing Plaintiffs' claims for (i) trademark infringement, (ii) unfair competition, and (iii) false designation of origin is GRANTED. However, Defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing Plaintiffs' claims for (i) trademark dilution, and (ii) copyright infringement is DENIED. Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on its claims of (i) trademark infringement, (ii) copyright infringement, and (iii) trademark dilution is similarly DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs are large, related entertainment companies responsible for creating and bringing to life popular characters through comic books, animated series, motion picture films, video games, and theme parks. (Pls.' 56.1 Stmt, ECF No. 61, \u00b6 1.) Plaintiffs claim intellectual property rights with respect to these characters, as well as their brands, titles, and properties, and those of its affiliates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Disney claims that it is the owner of federally-registered trademarks and copyrights in the \"Mickey Mouse\" and \"Minnie Mouse\" characters, among others, as well as the \"Elsa\" and \"Anna\" characters featured in the Disney motion picture film \"Frozen.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-25, 41-47.) Marvel claims ownership of federally-registered trademarks and copyrights in the \"Avengers\" characters, including \"Captain America,\" \"Hulk,\" and \"Iron Man.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-32, 48-56.) LucasFilm claims that it owns federally-registered trademarks and copyrights in several characters featured in the \"Star Wars\" motion picture films, including the \"Stormtrooper,\" \"Darth Vader,\" \"Darth Maul,\" \"Chewbacca,\" \"Luke Skywalker,\" \"Princess Leia,\" \"Han Solo,\" \"Obi-Wan Kenobi,\" and \"Yoda\" characters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-40, 57-62.) Although Plaintiffs and their affiliates engage in licensed merchandising of their intellectual property, they maintain quality and other controls over authorized uses of those rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 9.) Such authorized uses include live appearances and meet-and-greet opportunities with Plaintiffs' characters at theme parks located in Florida and California, among other places. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant CFH is in the business of advertising, promoting, producing, and selling themed entertainment party services for private parties and corporate events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12; Defs.' 56.1 Stmt, ECF No. 71, \u00b6 2.) Defendant Nick Sarelli, who uses the pseudonym \"Avi Lieberman,\" is CFH's sole owner and managing director. (Pls.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 15.) As part of its business, CFH provides its customers with a wide variety of costumed characters for entertainment purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 2.) CFH promotes its business through its own website, as well as on several social media accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Alleged Infringing Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that CFH copied and used the images, likenesses, personas, and names of Plaintiffs' characters, as well as Plaintiffs' trademarks, to promote and advertise its services online. (Pls.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 63.) For instance, Plaintiffs claim that promotional videos on CFH's website and YouTube and Facebook pages depict costumed individuals portraying Disney's Mickey and Minnie Mouse characters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-66.) Plaintiffs also claim that CFH advertised \"Frozen Theme[d] Parties\" on their website and social media sites, offering \"Anna and Elsa [to] delight your children as they sing their favorite songs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Louis S. Ederer dated Oct. 13, 2017 (\"Ederer Decl.\"), Ex. T, ECF No. 62-31, at DEI00009368-69.) The advertisements contained videos and/or hyperlinks to videos of costumed actors portraying the Elsa and Anna characters singing songs from the Disney motion picture film Frozen. (Pls.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 68, 72;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ederer Decl., Ex. X at DEI00009367.) One such advertisement included the caption \"Delight your children as they watch the Frozen Snow Queen Elsa and her sister, Princess Anna[,] tell their story in this professional adaptation.\" (Pls.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 73.) Another read, \"Frozen themed kids party entertainment: Bring these professional musical theatre performers to your next kids [sic] birthday party as they retell the story of two sisters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) Plaintiffs claim that CFH posted photographs on its Facebook page of costumed actors dressed in full costume\n   as the Elsa and Anna characters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that CFH's website also advertised \"Avenging Team\" themed parties, with images of several costumed actors portraying the Marvel franchise's Captain America, Hulk, and Iron Man characters described as \"The Soldier,\" \"Man of Iron,\" and \"Big Green Guy,\" respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-79.) One such advertisement offers \"the most amazing premium entertainment\" featuring \"high flying action and incredible acrobatic stunts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.) Another notes that CFH's actors \"are very authentic and remain in character throughout [the] event\" and that \"[s]ome of [CFH's] actors have even been trained by the actual Avengers stunt team.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   CFH's website similarly advertised \"Star Battles\" events, with images of characters from the Star Wars motion picture series, as well as images of costumed actors portraying LucasFilm's characters such as Luke Skywalker (\"Young Luke\"), Darth Vader (\"The Dark Lord\"), Chewbacca (\"Smugglers Co Pilot [sic]\"), and Princess Leia (\"The Princess\"), and Obi-Wan Kenobi (\"Old Ben\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87-88;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ederer Decl., Ex. A, ECF No. 62-1, at 4.) In addition, CFH's website featured a video entitled \"Star Wars Episode VII Themed Birthday Party,\" which portrayed various Star Wars characters dressed in full costume and CFH's \"Special Effects, Robotics, and Lighting\" design services, (Pls.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 89.) CFH also posted promotional videos on its Yelp, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram webpages featuring actors depicting various Marvel and LucasFilm characters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-86, 90-96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Defendants infringed their trademarks and copyrights not only with respect to CFH's advertising and marketing materials, but also by providing customers with the live costumed actors portraying Plaintiffs' copyrighted and trademarked characters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-210.) To support this claim, Plaintiffs point to several dozen, largely unsigned CFH event contracts offering various \"party packages.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ederer Decl., Exs. N-P.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) One such contract purports to book an event at which CFH was to provide the \"Captain America, Iron Man, [and] Hulk\" characters, among others, who would perform an \"Avengers Stage Combat Stunt Show\" and run an \"Avengers Camp.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. O at CFH000194.) Another contract requires CFH to provide the \"Darth Vader\" and \"Luke Skywalker\" characters for a \"Meet and Greet Plus\" party, with CFH providing \"Jedi Training, [an] Interactive Stage Show, [and] Darth Vader Combat\" services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. P at CFH000188.) A different event contract had CFH providing the \"Captain America\" and \"Iron man [sic]\" characters for an \"Interactive Theatrical Performance,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. O at CFH000198), while another purports to book an event with CFH providing the \"Princess Anna\" and \"Snow Queen\" characters\n   for a \"Meet and Greet with 3 songs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. N at CFH000232.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs' claim that evidence of Defendants' bad faith and willful infringement can be inferred from the standard form language in CFH's event contracts. They cite, for example, language added to CFH's contracts in or about November 2013 stating that, \"[f]or copyright reasons, costumes may vary from design, pattern &amp; color &amp; will not be the same exact costume seen on the internet, movies[,] or other media format [sic].\" (Pls.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 218 (quoting Ederer Decl., Ex. O at CFH000206).) In or about March 2014, the contracts were amended to add, \"CFH does not and will not use trademarked or licensed characters.\" (Pls.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 219 (quoting Ederer Decl., Ex. P at CFH000215).) CFH amended the form language in their event contracts yet again in or about January 2015 to state the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Client understands that costumed characters are generic/inspired and are NOT affiliated, licensed or associated with any copyright or trademark. It is not our intention to violate any copyright laws. The characters that we offer are NOT name brand copyrighted characters, and Characters for Hire, LLC costumed characters are named of our own creation. Any resemblance to nationally known copyrighted characters is strictly coincidental. We DO NOT offer nor do we present any licensed and/or copyrighted characters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Pls.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 220 (quoting Ederer Decl., Ex. P at CFH000258).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Notwithstanding these disclaimers, Plaintiffs claim that CFH's customers remained confused as to whether the services CFH offers are sponsored, endorsed, or otherwise affiliated with Disney, Marvel, and/or LucasFilms. For instance, Plaintiffs point to customer reviews posted on CFH's website that reference Plaintiffs' characters by their real, trademarked names rather than the fake, generic ones used by CFH. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 224-29.) Plaintiffs' claim that this confusion is detrimental to their brands because of CFH's allegedly poor reputation. They note, for example, that three customer complaints have been filed with the Better Business Bureau (\"BBB\") against CFH since 2014, resulting in the BBB giving CFH an \"F\" rating. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 231.) In addition, Plaintiffs claim, CFH has at least seventeen unfavorable reviews on its Yelp webpage commenting on Defendants' allegedly rude and unprofessional treatment of its customers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 232-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs' Cease-and-Desist Letters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 24, 2015, Plaintiffs mailed Defendants a cease-and-desist letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 212;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ederer Decl., Ex. F-1, ECF No. 61-7, at 3.) The letter, addressed to Sarelli, advised that CFH was \"engaged in selling and offering for sale live party entertainment services featuring .... character impersonations as well as themed movie and television ... characters that reproduce\" Plaintiffs' intellectual property. (Ederer Decl., Ex. F-1 at 4.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs demanded that CFH \"immediately cease and desist all sale, advertising,\n   marketing, promotion[,] and/or provision\" of the infringing services, as well as remove any infringing marketing materials from its website and other online platforms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs' letter attached various printouts from CFH's website containing the allegedly infringing images and videos and asked for a response from Defendants within seven days. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-16; Ederer Decl., Ex. F-2, ECF No. 61-8, at 1-16; Ederer Decl., Ex. F-3, ECF No. 61-9, at 1-16.) When no response came, Plaintiffs sent Defendants a second cease-and-desist letter on December 9, 2015. (Pls.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 213; Ederer Decl., Ex. G-1, ECF No. 61-10, at 3.) Plaintiffs advised that if they did not receive a response within five days, they would take further action, including filing a lawsuit in federal court to enforce their intellectual property rights. (Ederer Decl., Ex. G-1 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 10, 2015, Plaintiffs' counsel received an email signed by \"Avi Lieberman,\" indicating that \"all images ... pertaining to\" Plaintiffs' intellectual property were removed from CFH's website. (Pls.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 214; Ederer Decl., Ex. PI, ECF No. 61-14, at 3.) The email further stated that CFH did not \"inten[d] to disregard [Plaintiffs'] intellectual property rights ... and meant no harm in doing so.\" (Ederer Decl., Ex H, at 3.) However, on January 28, 2016, Plaintiffs sent a third cease-and-desist letter stating that not all infringing materials were removed from CFH's website and demanding that Defendants completely disable access to the website accordingly. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ederer Decl., Ex. I-1, ECF No. 62-15, at 3-4.) When Defendants failed to do so, Plaintiffs filed this action, asserting claims against Defendants under federal and New York law for trademark infringement and copyright infringement, unfair competition and false designation of origin, and trademark dilution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 33-37, 39-12, 44-47, 49-52, 54-57, 59-64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs now seek summary judgment on their federal trademark and copyright infringement claims, as well as their claim under New York law for trademark dilution. (Pls.' Mot. at 1.) In addition, Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on the issue of willfulness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants also move for summary judgment, seeking to have the entire lawsuit dismissed. (Defs,' Mot. at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
