According to Rodriguez, if he is returned to El Salvador, he would be perceived as a gang member and face a substantial risk of being tortured or killed because he has a variety of artistic tattoos on his body. For the past fourteen months, Rodriguez has been detained in immigration custody while the immigration courts adjudicate\n   his application for withholding of removal. Throughout this detention, Rodriguez has never received an individualized bond hearing because respondents believe that his 2011 conviction for felony grand larceny, for which Rodriguez served a prison sentence of 30 days, renders him subject to mandatory detention under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this habeas petition filed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Rodriguez challenges his continued detention in immigration custody without a bond hearing as a violation of due process.

On May 31, 2018, the BIA sustained ICE's appeal, finding that the IJ's decision was clearly erroneous because the proposed social group was not cognizable, Rodriguez had not established a likelihood of persecution on account of his membership in the proposed social group, and Rodriguez had not established that the Salvadoran government was unwilling or unable to protect him.

This distinction is important because \u00a7 1231 provides for mandatory detention, but \u00a7 1226 generally provides for bond hearings, with the caveat that \u00a7 1226(c) requires the detention of certain \"criminal aliens.\" Accordingly, in\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   , which was certified as a class action habeas petition, the Court ordered ICE to provide bond hearings for all class members who were not subject to mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c) and to provide hearings under\n   <em>\n    In re Joseph\n   </em>\n   , 22 I. &amp; N. 799 (BIA 1999), for all class members who ICE determined were subject to \u00a7 1226(c)'s mandatory detention provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   During oral argument on the present motions, ICE counsel advised the Court that approximately ten class members had been released on bond after receiving this individualized bond review.

After this 6-month period, once the alien provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing. And for detention to remain reasonable, as the period of prior postremoval confinement grows, what counts as the \"reasonably foreseeable future\" conversely would have to shrink. This 6-month presumption, of course, does not mean that every alien not removed must be released after six months.

In particular, the Court observed that \u00a7 1226(c) detention has a \"definite termination point\"-the end of removal proceedings-and\n   that statistics show that the average detention time under \u00a7 1226(c) is only approximately 47 days when the alien does not appeal and five months when the alien does appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    at 529-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court concluded that the detention of an alien under \u00a7 1226(c)\"for the limited period of his removal proceedings\" is constitutionally permissible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Justice Kennedy concurred in\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   , explaining that in his view, \"a lawful permanent resident alien such as respondent could be entitled to an individualized determination as to his risk of flight and dangerousness if the continued detention became unreasonable or unjustified.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring). In particular, Justice Kennedy observed that if there were \"an unreasonable delay by the INS in pursuing and completing deportation proceedings, it could become necessary then to inquire whether the detention is not to facilitate deportation, or to protect against risk of flight or dangerousness, but to incarcerate for other reasons.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    at 532-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   , as the Court made clear, the \"special justification\" that outweighed the liberty interest at stake was the interest in ensuring that the alien would be successfully removed if a final order of removal were eventually entered. In addition, the Court believed that the liberty interest at stake in\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   was substantially curtailed because the proceedings were typically relatively short: approximately a month in the vast majority of cases, and approximately five months if the alien chose to appeal.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , where the government's interest in ensuring the aliens' successful removal was severely diminished because it appeared that the government would not be able to deport them in the reasonably foreseeable future, the withholding-only proceedings in this case are ongoing. Although there does not appear to be a specific timeline to guide those proceedings, there is a definite termination point to them and the government maintains an interest in ensuring Rodriguez's deportation if it is successful in defeating his withholding-only claim. On the other hand, unlike the detentions referenced by the Court in\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   , Rodriguez's detention has stretched considerably longer than the averages cited in that opinion, including the six months Kim served which the majority described as \"longer than the average.\"\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    538 U.S. at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, neither\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   fully answers the question of how to balance the interests at stake, leaving this Court to engage in its own balancing of the government's interest in detaining Rodriguez without a bond hearing to ensure his\n   appearance at future proceedings and to protect the community against Rodriguez's liberty interest in not being subject to extensive civil detention without having had an individualized bond review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This Court has previously \"surveyed the analysis employed in other circuits\" and identified \"five factors that recur across these cases\" that \"bear on the reasonableness of an alien's detention\" without being afforded a bond hearing.\n   <em>\n    Haughton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205899285\">\n    2016 WL 5899285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Although these factors were originally adopted in the context of reading an implicit reasonableness limitation into \u00a7 1226(c), they also represent a reasonable framework for balancing the due process interests at stake in this petition. The five factors are: \"(1) the duration of detention, including the anticipated time to completion of the alien's removal proceedings; (2) whether the civil detention exceeds the criminal detention for the underlying offense; (3) dilatory tactics employed in bad faith by the parties or adjudicators; (4) procedural or substantive legal errors that significantly extend the duration of detention; and (5) the likelihood that the government will secure a final removal order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205899285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To begin with the first factor, which \"is the most important,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *9, Rodriguez has already been detained in ICE custody for more than fourteen months. Although the duration inquiry does not admit of \"hard and fast parameters, courts seem to agree that the constitutional case for continued detention without inquiry into its necessity becomes more and more suspect as detention continues past [the one and a half month average and five month maximum] thresholds cited by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original). This approach also aligns with the concerns expressed in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   about detention in excess of six months. Moreover, at least one other court has contemplated the \"outer limit of reasonableness\" and determined that \"a criminal alien's detention without a bond hearing may often become unreasonable by the one-year mark, depending on the facts of the case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Sopo v. United States Att'y Gen.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324686\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/1199/#p1217\">\n    825 F.3d 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1217 (11th Cir. 2016),\n   <em>\n    vacated as moot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517009\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/952/\">\n    890 F.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2018). Accordingly, Rodriguez's fourteen-month detention weighs heavily in his favor as a prolonged and substantial burden on his liberty interest. This finding is enhanced by the potential for significant additional proceedings, which the parties conservatively estimated at oral argument will take at least six additional months, given the BIA's recent determination that the IJ's initial decision was clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The second factor, which compares the duration of detention in ICE custody to the length of time served on the criminal sentence, also weighs in Rodriguez's favor. For the criminal conviction on which his current mandatory detention rests, Rodriguez was sentenced to three years imprisonment but had two years and eleven months suspended and, therefore, he ultimately served one month in prison.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haughton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205899285\">\n    2016 WL 5899285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (examining the time that the alien actually spent in criminal custody rather than just the full length of the sentence imposed). Accordingly, Rodriguez has now been civilly detained as a result of his criminal conviction for more than fourteen times as long as he was criminally detained for that same conduct, and this factor weighs in his favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The third factor considers any dilatory tactics by the parties or the adjudicators. This factor does not appear to favor either party. Although the proceedings have been ongoing for a relatively long time, the delays do not appear to have been unreasonable. The only substantial continuance was ordered by the IJ\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , apparently because the IJ who was initially presiding over the case was transferred to a different Immigration Court and the IJ to whom the case was reassigned simply rescheduled the hearing on the first available date on her docket. Resp. Reply 9-10. Accordingly, neither party nor the adjudicator appears to have engaged in unreasonable or bad faith delays.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The fourth and fifth factors, which examine potential legal and factual errors in the proceedings and the likelihood of a final removal order, both weigh somewhat in favor of the government. At this point, nearly half of the time Rodriguez has been detained occurred while the government appealed the IJ's initial decision to the BIA, and the BIA ultimately held that the IJ's decision was in error. As a result, the IJ's apparent legal errors in Rodriguez's favor contributed to some of his detention. In addition, although there will be additional proceedings in front of an IJ, as well as further appeals to the BIA and possibly an appeal to the Fourth Circuit, the current prospects for Rodriguez to succeed on his application for withholding of removal do not appear especially strong. Accordingly, these factors weigh in favor of the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Taken together, the factors are almost evenly split between the two parties when weighing Rodriguez's due process liberty interest against the government's legitimate, nonpunitive interest in ensuring that he can be successfully deported if his application for withholding of removal is denied. That being said, this Court and other courts have described the first factor, which looks at the length of detention, as the most important, and Rodriguez has been detained for significantly longer than the one-, five-, and six-month boundaries described in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   . Moreover,\n   the government's interest in guarding against Rodriguez's flight can be substantially protected even if Rodriguez is given an individualized bond hearing and released on bond because a critical factor that the IJ will be forced to consider is whether Rodriguez is a flight risk and whether there are conditions of release that could reasonably secure his future appearance. Accordingly, the balance of these interests weighs in favor of Rodriguez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Once the Court has determined that due process demands that Rodriguez receive an individualized inquiry into whether his continued detention fulfills the purposes of the statute, the question remains as to what procedures apply to the bond hearing. In\n   <em>\n    Haughton v. Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271082\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/712/#p714\">\n    221 F.Supp.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 714 (E.D. Va. 2016), this Court determined that, in light of the ongoing infringement of the alien's liberty interest and the strong tradition that the burden of justifying civil detention falls on the government, the \"balance between individual and government interests requires that the burden of justifying petitioner's continued detention falls upon the government,\" which had to \"demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that petitioner's ongoing detention is appropriate to protect the community and ensure petitioner's appearance at future proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271082\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/712/#p714\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271082\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/712/#p714\">\n    at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This decision remains good authority\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and is, in any event, persuasive on the merits. Accordingly, at the bond hearing, the government must demonstrate that Rodriguez is either a flight risk or a danger to the community by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Lastly, in his petition, Rodriguez requests that the Court maintain jurisdiction to review the result of any bond hearing. This Court has previously decided similar habeas petitions without maintaining jurisdiction over the matter.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Haughton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271082\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/712/#p714\">\n    221 F.Supp.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
