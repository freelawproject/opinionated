This litigation consists of three actions pending in the Northern District of California, the Northern District of Florida, and the Northern District of Illinois, as listed on Schedule A. Plaintiffs in all three actions on the motion do not oppose centralization, but suggest the Northern District of Illinois as the transferee district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On the basis of the papers filed and the hearing session held, we conclude that centralization is not necessary for the convenience of the parties and witnesses or to further the just and efficient conduct of the litigation. Where only a minimal number of actions are involved, the proponent of centralization bears a heavier burden to demonstrate that centralization is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Transocean Ltd. Sec. Litig. (No. II)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267189\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/753/1373/#p1374\">\n    753 F.Supp.2d 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1374 (J.P.M.L. 2010). Defendants have not met that burden here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This litigation involves some common factual questions relating to an alleged defect in Samsung plasma televisions that resulted in those televisions randomly turning off and on, to the point of becoming unusable, as well as defendants' alleged failure to make replacement parts available to repair these televisions. These common factual issues are not particularly numerous or complex. These actions also involve distinctly separate and non-overlapping putative classes. The only putative nationwide class asserted pertains to warranty claims against Best Buy, a defendant in the action pending in the Northern District of Illinois. Thus, there is no threat of conflicting class certification rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As there are only three actions before the Panel, and plaintiffs in all three are represented by the same counsel, alternatives to transfer exist that can minimize whatever possibilities there might be of duplicative discovery or inconsistent pretrial rulings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Eli Lilly &amp; Co. (Cephalexin Monohydrate) Patent Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3992303\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/446/242/#p244\">\n    446 F.Supp. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 244 (J.P.M.L.1978) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth, \u00a7 20.14 (2004). Counsel for plaintiffs indicated in his papers and at oral argument his willingness to coordinate with defendants with respect to discovery and pretrial proceedings to avoid duplication. We encourage all the parties in this litigation to engage in such efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the motion for centralization of these actions is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    SCHEDULE A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   MDL No. 2853 -\n   <strong>\n    IN RE: SAMSUNG PLASMA TELEVISION PRODUCTS LIABILITY LITIGATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Northern District of California\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   BRONSON v.

The motion is now moot as to those two defendants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
