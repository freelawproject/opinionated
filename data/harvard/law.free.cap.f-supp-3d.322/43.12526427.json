Plaintiff attaches a partially\n   executed and undated consent decree with hand-written notes scattered throughout the document.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-11. Plaintiff states that defendants have failed to abide by its terms, but does not provide any other details or context to articulate this claim, nor does he define the parties' respective responsibilities or relationships to this consent decree.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The ambiguous and rambling allegations comprising the complaint fail to provide adequate notice of a claim. While plaintiff cites a litany of federal law, he fails to describe any specific wrongdoing committed by these defendants, apart from his overarching conspiracy theory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 \u00b6 2; 3 \u00b6 3. The causes of action, if any, are completely undefined. The complaint also fails to set forth allegations with respect to this Court's jurisdiction over the plaintiff's entitlement to relief or a valid basis for an award of damages as pled. In fact, it is unclear what actual damages, if any, plaintiff has suffered. Therefore, this case will be dismissed.
