Resp. at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Commerce contests the court's jurisdiction and argues that Kangtai's complaint should be dismissed.

The Department requested both sales and entries during AR 10. When Kangtai failed to report its entries-choosing instead to rest on its prior reporting in AR 9 of the sales of those entries-Commerce determined that only the entries identified in AR 10 would be subject to the lower rate. Accordingly, those entries that remained unidentified were assessed the higher PRC rate. The propriety of such a decision may be challenged, but under section 1581(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    B. A Remedy Under Section 1581(c) Is Not Manifestly Inadequate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because the court finds that Kangtai could have brought suit under section 1581(c), Kangtai's claim of jurisdiction under section 1581(i) can only survive if the section 1581(c) remedy would have been \"manifestly inadequate.\" Because that remedial path was available to-but declined to be taken by-Kangtai, jurisdiction under section 1581(i) is defeated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The party seeking to establish jurisdiction has the burden of showing that relief under a different subsection of section 1581 would be manifestly inadequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller &amp; Co. v.

Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Kangtai has failed to demonstrate that a 1581(c) claim would be an \"exercise in futility.\" Kangtai claims that it \"dutifully reported its sales\" and \"[t]here was nothing to appeal\" as it had no indication \"that the Department's plan was to disregard its specific review of a subset of reported sales and assign an arbitrary antidumping margin to them, unmoored from\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   specific review of those sales.\" Pls.' Resp. at 11. Kangtai's naked assertion that it had no means by which to comprehend that Commerce would calculate the rate based on entries is a false one. Before Kangtai filed its complaint, it was certainly on notice that CBP would \"assess[ ] antidumping duties on all appropriate\n   <em>\n    entries\n   </em>\n   covered by [the] review.\" AR 9 Final Results, 81 Fed. Reg. at 1,168 (emphasis added). Thus, a remedy under section 1581(c) was available in the form of a complaint challenging the results of AR 9 and any resulting remedy could have addressed Commerce's consideration of sales/entries. Kangtai's failure to file such a complaint does not grant it an opportunity to pursue its section 1581(c) claim under section 1581(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Count IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Kangtai's final count, that CBP's 15-day policy is unlawful, stands on somewhat different footing. Whereas Kangtai's other arguments are properly grounded in section 1581(c), a challenge to the 15-day policy is commonly brought under section 1581(i).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jinan Farmlady Trading Co. v.

But where a plaintiff cannot make out a claim that alleges such an injury, its challenge to CBP's 15-day policy shall not be maintained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because Kangtai cannot assert an injury, it has neither standing to bring its claim nor has it met the pleading requirements of Rule 12(b)(6).

Rather, Kangtai obtained its liquidation injunction as part of its separate section 1581(c) case and filed the instant action more than ten months after Commerce issued the Final Results.

Rather, the true nature of the injury alleged arises from Commerce's assessment that some of Kangtai's entries should be liquidated at the PRC rate based on Kangtai's failure to report those entries in AR 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kangtai alleges not that the 15-day policy led to unlawful liquidation; rather, its challenge remains directed at the rate Commerce assigned certain entries based on the Department's distinction between sales and entries. Thus, the 15-day policy cannot be said to have imposed an injury on Kangtai.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Consequently, Count IV of Kangtai's complaint does not allege any injury whatsoever and is therefore dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, the Government's motion to dismiss all counts in Kangtai's complaint under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It is hereby:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Government's motion to dismiss is granted; it is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that final judgment is entered for Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    And unlike cases in which a party seeks to challenge a determination and claims that the 15-day policy unfairly rushes this challenge, Kangtai itself claims that it was only put on notice of the alleged issue by the act of liquidation itself. Whether subject merchandise was set to be liquidated on day 15 or day 115, Kangtai would presumably be making the same challenge. Therefore, the 15-day policy did not cause Kangtai any injury here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
