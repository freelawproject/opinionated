WILSON, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case was filed in early 2016 and has now reached summary judgment. The individual Plaintiffs are scheduled for trials that span from November 2017 and into December 2017. DirecTV has claimed for years that the Installers it hires through Contracting Companies are independent contractors, not employees. The Installers claim that they are employees as a matter of law, and are eligible for various California and Fair Labor Standards Act statutory protections. Both parties ask this Court to determine the Installers' status as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court finds that the Installers are DirecTV's employees under both FLSA and California Law, and that DirecTV cannot claim a 207(i) exemption based on the facts. The Court also finds that, under the facts provided, only three of the nine Installers have a separate claim for minimum wage violations under FLSA. None of the Installers have a viable gap time claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court determines that the statute of limitations for this case is two years, not three, as DirecTV's FLSA violation is not willful. And the Court provides guidance regarding how to calculate overtime wages, although the final calculation remains a question for the fact-finder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In coming to this decision, the Court recognizes the risks that corporations face when hiring a subcontractor. Corporations like DirecTV should-and do-have the right to contract with subcontractors and set parameters to ensure efficiency and quality. And corporations should be able to do so without having to qualify as a joint-employer. But here, DirecTV has gone well beyond setting parameters for efficiency and quality. In asking this Court to find that the Installers are independent contractors and not employees, DirecTV asks this Court to prioritize form over substance. DirecTV asks this Court to consider DirecTV's legal arrangements with various Contracting Companies, but to essentially ignore the actual work environment for the Installers working at those Contracting Companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For a jury to find for DirecTV, it would have to conclude that the Installers were not employees under either FLSA or California law. To reach this conclusion, the jury would have to ignore the substantial control DirecTV exerted over the Installers. The jury would have to ignore the hiring guidelines DirecTV established, guidelines that far exceeded any guidelines provided by the Contracting Companies. The jury would have to ignore how DirecTV was the only customer for many of these Contracting Companies, effectively setting the rate of payment for each Installer. And they would have to ignore the Contractor Agreement, which stated that the Contracting Companies were not allowed to work for other cable or television installation companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DirecTV asks this Court to believe that these Contracting Companies were not shell corporations. But even if the Court does believe that, the Court can still draw only one conclusion. DirecTV's influence over the Contracting Companies, its ability to hire and\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   fire Installers, its ability to schedule shifts and supervise Installers, and its control over even minute aspects of the Installers' work environment\n   all show an employer-employee relationship. And DirecTV cannot show a genuine dispute over any material fact that would demonstrate otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   DirecTV provides subscription direct broadcast satellite television service to customers nationwide. A DirecTV subscription requires the installation and activation of the DirecTV satellite dish, affixed to the customer's home or office, and a DirecTV box, connected to the television. Plaintiff's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts (\"PSUF\") \u00b6 7. In some locations, DirecTV provides DirecTV \"owned and operated\" installation services. PSUF \u00b6 11. In other locations, it sub-contracts all installation work to various contracting companies (\"Contracting Companies\"). PSUF \u00b6 14. These Contracting Companies and DirecTV contract through a Service Provider Agreement (\"SPA\"). PSUF \u00b6 21. The Contracting Companies then engage and train installer-technicians (\"Installers\") to render installation services for DirecTV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Installers have brought this case alleging that DirecTV violated the FLSA by repeatedly paying employees less than the federal minimum wage; failing to pay employees who worked in excess of 40 hours per week at a rate of one-and-a-half times the regular rate at which they were employed; and failing to keep and preserve accurate records of employees and the wages, hours, and other conditions of employment maintained by them since 2010. Plaintiffs allege that DirecTV is a joint employer of the Contracting Companies and is therefore liable under the FLSA. Plaintiffs allege that DirecTV also misclassified the Installers under California wage and employment laws. Plaintiff seek to recover unpaid minimum wage and overtime compensation and liquidated damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

This is not a typical case. Here, the DirecTV hired Contracting Companies, who in turn hired the Installers. Under the formal understanding of this set-up, the Installers provided a service to the Contracting Companies, who then provided that service to DirecTV. DirecTV claims that the principal question is whether DirecTV, as opposed to just the Contracting Companies, is a joint employer of these Installers. DirecTV claims that the Plaintiffs retain the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that DirecTV was a joint employer.\n   <em>\n    Rios v.

Cal. 2017). DIRECTV has no response and does not dispute the fact. Instead, DIRECTV argues that the Contracting Companies could reassign the work orders whenever it was necessary. But this possibility is not material to the analysis because the factor does not preclude others from also having some supervision or control over the Installers. Even if reassignments occurred daily, the evidence is that the Contracting Companies did not change a significant percentage of the routes. Furthermore, DIRECTV directed certain routes as disciplinary measures (PSUF \u00b6 97), and had the right to reject any reassignments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court must also consider the frill scope of DirecTv's control over the day-to-day conditions of employment.

Defendants state that the Installers were paid by the job and the system incentivized Installers to undertake more orders and work more efficiently. The evidence shows that DirecTV used a payment-per-job scheme to pay the Contracting Companies. While a jury could find that this factor supports finding an independent contractor relationship, \"payment may be measured by time, by the piece, or by successful completion of the service, instead of a fixed salary, and still constitute employee wages if other factors indicate an employer-employee relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Germann,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=176%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20868\">\n    176 Cal.Rptr. at 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   As discussed in Section IV above. DirecTV's payments to the Contracting Companies effectively capped how much each Installer could make per work order.

Plaintiffs counter by arguing that, at the outset, the Plaintiffs lacked knowledge of how broadly and pervasively DirecTV would actually control the particulars of their working lives once they were in the job.

No. 30, DirecTV moved to dismiss the FLSA minimum wage claims because Plaintiff's complaint pled facts that demonstrated the Plaintiffs were paid well above minimum wage. In calculating the regular rate, DIRECTV employed the following formula:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Weekly Wage-Chargebacks-Business Expenses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    (40 hours + 1.5 (# overtime hours)\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   When the Court granted DirecTV's motion to dismiss the minimum wage claims in\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   , it stated that this calculation was correct and Plaintiffs did not oppose this calculation. \"Free and clear\" payment as explained in 29 C.F.R. 531.35 supports this formula:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   Whether in cash or in facilities, \"wages\" cannot be considered to have been paid by the employer and received by the employee unless they are paid finally and unconditionally or \"free and clear.\" The wage requirements of the Act will not be met where the employee \"kicks-back\" directly or indirectly to the employer or to another person for the employer's benefit the whole or part of the wage delivered to the employee. This is true whether the \"kick-back\" is made in cash or in methods other than cash. For example, if it is a requirement of the employer that the employee must provide\n   tools of the trade which will be used in or are specifically required for the performance of the employer's particular work, there would be a violation of the Act in any workweek when the cost of such tools purchased by the employee cuts into the minimum or overtime wages required to be paid him under the Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the weekly expenses and chargebacks should be deducted from the weekly pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   DirecTV also claims that the calculations should utilize the allegations in the complaint because allegations in a pleading are considered judicial admissions that conclusively bind the party who made them.

Furthermore, DirecTV provides no rationale for why all evidence of payment should not be considered at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Under the calculations above, Plaintiff Varas has a minimum wage claim because the evidence shows that he was paid only $4.66 per hour.

Overtime gap time claims seek compensation for unpaid hours worked under 40 hours a week-in the weeks the plaintiff has worked overtime-as part of the plaintiff's overtime damages. This distinction is incorrect. Plaintiffs admit that they are not entitled to minimum wage for unpaid work as long as their-average rate\n   of pay is more than the minimum wage. Plaintiffs lack authority for their argument that the unpaid work somehow becomes compensable when a Plaintiff works more than 40 hours in a week. As DirecTV correctly notes, under Plaintiffs' logic, an employee who worked 40 hours in a week of which 15 were unpaid would be entitled to no gap time pay, while an employee who worked 41 hours of which 15 were unpaid would be entitled to 15 additional hours of pay.

Cal. 2017). Under DIRECTVs theory, employers can undermine the legislative purpose of \u00a7 207 simply by refusing to pay for certain activities during the normal work-week. The regulations interpreting \u00a7 207 and the purpose of the FLSA allow\n   this Court to find, as a matter of law, that \"regular rate\" calculations do not include non-productive time for which DirecTV did not actually pay the Installers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Overtime Damages Are A Question of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   As discussed above, a worker must be paid 1.5 times the regular rate for overtime hours. If the employee has already been paid the regular rate for the overtime hours, his damages are only the additional half-time premium for overtime hours. When, however, the employee has not been paid at all for overtime hours, his overtime damages include all unpaid hours under 40 (at the regular rate) and all unpaid overtime hours (at 1.5 times the regular rate). The parties disagree over how many instances exist where DirecTV did not pay Installers for both regular hours and overtime hours; the Court does not have enough information to resolve such a dispute. Therefore, the Court denies summary judgment on this issue. This is a question of fact for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   VIII.\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on both the FLSA claims and California law claims, finding as a matter of law that DirecTV did employ the Plaintiffs. The Court DENIES DirecTV's motion for partial summary judgment with regard to Plaintiffs Varas, Le, and Nault and GRANTS the same motion with regard to all other Plaintiffs. The Court GRANTS DirecTV's motion for summary judgment on the gap time claims. The Court DENIES DirecTV's motion for summary judgment and finds that DirecTV cannot meet the 207(i) FLSA exemption. The Court DENIES DirecTV's motion regarding the FLSA notice requirement, finding that DirecTV' did have actual or constructive notice of potential FLSA violations. The Court GRANTS DirecTV's motion, finding the appropriate statute of limitations in this case is two years; however, the state of limitations did not start running again in 2016. The Court GRANTS Plaintiff's motion regarding the calculation of overtimes wages with regard to non-productive time; however, the Court leaves the specific calculation of overtime wages to the fact-finder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   The matters left for the fact-finder involve the specific calculations and statutory penalties afforded to Plaintiffs under both FLSA and California Law.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-235\">\n    The Motions do not directly address some of the other remaining FLSA claims, such as: overtime pay, accurate record-keeping, improper deduction claims, statutory damages, and more.

This Court holds that DirecTV bears the burden of disproving the employment relationship.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    DirecTV claims that\n    <em>\n     Perez v. Lantern Light Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203451268\">\n     2015 WL 3451268\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (W.D. Wash. May 29, 2015), finding DirecTV to be a joint employer, is clearly distinguishable. DirecTV argues that\n    <em>\n     Perez\n    </em>\n    is different because the\n    <em>\n     Perez\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs were employees of the Contracting Company, not independent contractors. Contrary to DirecTV's assertions, the analysis in\n    <em>\n     Perez\n    </em>\n    does not seem heavily influenced by this fact. More importantly. DirecTV concedes that the SPA in\n    <em>\n     Perez\n    </em>\n    is materially the same as the one here. PSUF \u00b6\u00b6 22-25. DirecTV also claims that\n    <em>\n     Perez\n    </em>\n    is a departure from the prevailing view that installation technicians are not jointly-employed by the company whose equipment they install. The cases that DirecTV cites for the prevailing view are distinctly different from the case before the Court. As the analysis in the next two sections will show, DirecTV had for more control and supervision over the Installers than the cases DirecTV asks this Court to consider. Also. DirecTV subjected its employee installation-technicians to the same standards as the Installers in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    DirecTV claims that these measures are simply quality control measures; however, the Court holds that argument to be incorrect\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    in Section IV.b.ii below (page 10).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-239\">\n    DirecTV required that all Contracting Companies follow these guidelines in hiring. DirecTV supervised this process by requiring each company to provide the requisite information before adding the Installer to any work order. While DirecTV claims that it did not require this of any specific Installer but only of the Contracting Companies, that argument does not create a material dispute. These requirements affected each Installer individually and the Contracting Companies were contractually bound by the agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    The SPA gives DirecTV the absolute right to prevent any technician from working on DirectTV work orders in its sole discretion. (Ex. 29, SPA Exhibit 2.c P B. (\"DirecTV, in its sole discretion and upon notice to Contractor, may terminate the subcontractor status of any such third party or subcontractor and Contractor may not engage or otherwise utilize such third party or subcontractor in the performance of Services as set forth herein unless and until DirecTV, in writing, reinstates such third party or subcontractor, if ever.\") Even if DirecTV only did this in certain circumstances, the factor analyzes whether DirecTV had the power to do so, not if DirecTV actually did.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-241\">\n    DirecTV claims that certain individual Plaintiffs, namely Lasater, performed work for other satellite and internet companies. D. Statement of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 50-59. While this fact is relevant, it does not create any genuine dispute of material fact. Even if the Court finds these facts to be entirely true, DirecTV still had the power to stop technicians like Lasater from working on other orders. DirecTV still had the ability to remove an Installer's Tech ID, constructively discharging an Installer. Seeing as the Contracting Companies served DirecTV exclusively, this would effectively fire an Installer from the Contracting Company. PSUF \u00b6 93 (undisputed).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-242\">\n    DirecTV claims that deactivating an Installer's Tech ID would not prevent the Installer from doing other work for the Contracting Company; however, the Installer could not work for any other cable companies or companies with similar products because of the SPA. The Installer would most likely have to leave his current Contracting Company to continue the work for which he received training and certification, both required by DirecTV.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    DirecTV claims that it did not actually specifically assign work to installers; however, DirecTV cannot change the facts by simply relabeling the assignments and saying it only \"soft-assigned\" the orders. A \"soft-assign\" is still an assignation of duties, which leads to a showing of supervision under\n    <em>\n     Torres-Lopez.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-244\">\n    According to DirecTV, in other FLSA cases involving potential joint employment between cable providers and their contractors, Court rely most heavily upon this factor in finding against joint employment.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Thornton v.

DirecTV turns the Court's attention to\n    <em>\n     Jacobson\n    </em>\n    , where a vertical employer's maintenance of employment records did not prove an alleged joint-employment relationship. The Court declines to rely on\n    <em>\n     Jacobson,\n    </em>\n    where the record was not as developed as it is in this particular case.\n    <em>\n     Jacobson\n    </em>\n    mistakenly applied\n    <em>\n     Herman v.
