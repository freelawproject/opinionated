At the time that he filed the complaint in August 2015, plaintiff was an inmate in the custody of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (\"DOCCS\"). He alleges that defendants violated his constitutional rights in various ways during plaintiff's confinement at Wende Correctional Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff has sued five defendants: Correction Officer D. Heer, Counselor C. Zaluski, Captain E. Meyer, Wende Superintendent John Lempke, and Director of Special Housing Unit/Inmate Disciplinary Program Donald Vennetozzi. In general, plaintiff alleges that defendants have violated his rights under the First, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss certain claims pursuant to Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and have moved for summary judgment in lieu of an answer as to other claims, pursuant to Rule 56.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. # 24.) Plaintiff has responded to the motion. (Dkt. # 35.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's claims arise out of a series of events that occurred in 2015. The gist of his claims is that on May 9, 2015, when plaintiff was attending a visit from his wife, Heer made some lewd comments, and after plaintiff objected, Heer cut the visit short. Plaintiff alleges that Heer then filed a false misbehavior report against plaintiff, accusing him of sexual misconduct with his wife and other violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After a hearing before defendant Meyer, plaintiff was found guilty of all charges. He was initially sentenced to 180 days' confinement in the Special Housing Unit (\"SHU\") and loss of certain privileges, as well as 365 days' loss of visitation rights. On administrative appeal, the term of SHU confinement and loss of privileges was reduced to 90 days, although the loss of visitation rights was kept at 365 days. Dkt. # 24-2 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In this action, plaintiff has brought the following claims: (1) a claim that Heer violated plaintiff's First Amendment, Eighth Amendment, and due process rights, and that Heer defamed plaintiff and filed a false misbehavior report against him; (2) a claim that Zaluski (who had been assigned to assist plaintiff in connection with the disciplinary proceeding) violated plaintiff's due process rights by failing to provide him adequate assistance; (3) a claim that Meyer violated plaintiff's First Amendment, Eighth Amendment, and due process rights in connection with Meyer's conduct of the disciplinary proceeding; and (4) claims that Lempke and Venettozzi violated plaintiff's First Amendment, Eighth Amendment, and due process rights by failing to overturn the guilty finding against plaintiff. Plaintiff has sued all five defendants in both their individual and official capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For relief, plaintiff requests: an injunction ordering Venettozzi and Lempke to release him from \"punitive segregation,\" to restore his rights and privileges, and to expunge his disciplinary conviction; compensatory damages in the amount of $100,000 against each defendant; and punitive damages ranging from $100,000 to $200,000, against the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants have moved under Rule 12 to dismiss the official-capacity claims against Heer, Zaluski and Meyer, the defamation claim against Heer, and all the Eighth Amendment claims. They have moved for summary judgment dismissing the official-capacity claims against Lempke, and dismissing as moot plaintiff's claims for injunctive relief against Venettozzi, insofar as plaintiff seeks an end to his \"punitive segregation\" and the restoration of his rights and privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss the official-capacity claims against defendants Heer, Zaluski and Meyer, on the ground that plaintiff seeks only money damages from those defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants' motion is granted. Plaintiff's claims for damages against individual defendants acting in their official capacities are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ying Jing Gan v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513330\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/996/522/#p529\">\n    996 F.2d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 529 (2d Cir. 1993) (\"To the extent that a state official is sued for damages in his official capacity, such a suit is deemed to be a suit against the state, and the official is entitled to invoke the Eleventh Amendment immunity belonging to the state\");\n   <em>\n    Severino v. Negron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518725\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/996/1439/#p1441\">\n    996 F.2d 1439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1441 (2d Cir. 1993) (\"[I]t is clear that the Eleventh Amendment does not permit suit [under Section 1983 ] for money damages against state officials in their official capacities\"). Since plaintiff does not seek injunctive relief against those three defendants, there is no basis for an official-capacity claim against them. In fact, although the caption of the complaint states that all the defendants are\n   sued in both their individual and official capacities, his claims for damages are explicitly brought against the defendants in their \"individual and unofficial capacities.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 45-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff has requested injunctive relief against the other two defendants, Lempke and Venettozzi. Plaintiff has asked that he be released from \"punitive segregation\" and that certain privileges be restored to him, which were taken away from him following his disciplinary hearing. He has also requested that the disciplinary charges of which he was convicted be expunged from his record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Those claims are now moot, with one exception. As to plaintiff's claims concerning his disciplinary penalties, by the terms of plaintiff's disciplinary sentence, the penalties in question have all run their course and expired. In addition, plaintiff was released on parole in February 2018. He has informed the Court of that fact,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 51, which is confirmed by the DOCCS Inmate Lookup page,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    http://nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov/\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff's claims for equitable relief concerning his confinement and loss of privileges are therefore moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Marks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=722%20Fed.%20Appx.%20106\">\n    722 Fed.Appx. 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106 n.1 (2d Cir. 2018) (stating that because plaintiff had been released from incarceration, his claims for declaratory or injunctive relief were moot) (citing\n   <em>\n    Beyah v. Coughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573935\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/789/986/#p988\">\n    789 F.2d 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 988-89 (2d Cir. 1986) ). Since the relevant facts are clear and undisputed, defendants are entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's claim concerning expungement of his record stands on a different footing. In their brief in support of their motion-which was filed prior to plaintiff's release on parole-defendants conceded that plaintiff's request for expungement of his record was not moot, at least at that time. Dkt. # 24-4 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In advance of his release, plaintiff informed the Court that he would be residing at a particular street address in Brooklyn. (Dkt. # 51.) In May 2018, however, he notified the Court that he is now at the Manhattan Detention Center in New York City. It is not clear what led to his confinement there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   It is not apparent from the record whether plaintiff's disciplinary conviction carries with it any consequences now, given his current detention; if so, his request for expungement of his disciplinary record may not be moot. There is also some authority that such a claim is not necessarily mooted by a prisoner's release from custody.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Senkowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"893313\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/260/830/#p830\">\n    260 A.D.2d 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"893313\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/260/830/#p830\">\n    688 N.Y.S.2d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Dep't 1999) (\"although petitioner has been released from custody, this issue cannot be considered moot as petitioner is entitled to have an institutional record free from improperly obtained findings of disciplinary rule violations\") (internal quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants contend that plaintiff's request for equitable relief against Lempke should be dismissed, because Lempke is now retired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kevin Brown Decl. (Dkt. # 24-2) \u00b6 4. Defendants argue that Lempke is therefore not in a position to grant plaintiff any equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To the extent that Lempke is sued in his official capacity, however, it is immaterial whether he has retired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brodheim v. Cry\n   </em>\n   , No. 02-cv-0573,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203943558\">\n    2010 WL 3943558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D.Cal.

But it is evident from the Court's discussion of that issue that the Court was not referring to whether any particular defendant had retired, or still held the position in question. The issue was simply whether the current holder of that position, whoever it might be, would have the ability to grant the equitable relief sought by the plaintiff. In addition, the Court in\n    <em>\n     Barnes\n    </em>\n    actually\n    <em>\n     denied\n    </em>\n    (without prejudice) the defendants' motion to dismiss the official-capacity claims, since it was unclear at that point which, if any, defendants might be empowered to grant the requested relief.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179246\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/760/296/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nevarez v.
