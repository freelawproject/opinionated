The parties' dispute over his base offense level is based on their disagreement regarding whether Defendant's two prior offenses under Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 21a-277(a) qualify as \"controlled substance offenses\" under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   dOn August 28, 2017, in New Haven, Connecticut, Mr. Epps was involved in the unlawful sale of a firearm and ammunition, namely a Smith and Wesson .223 caliber AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle, a C Products Defense rifle magazine containing nine Remington .223 caliber rounds, and a Brownell's rifle magazine containing thirty Remington .223 caliber rounds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 9.) The Government represents that this weapon had been stolen one month earlier and that Mr. Epps knew or had reasonable cause to know that the firearm was stolen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Inasmuch as Defendant does not dispute this representation, the Court has not explored the basis for that knowledge. At the time that he possessed this firearm and ammunition and engaged in this transaction, Mr. Epps had sustained multiple prior felony convictions, and was barred from legally possessing a firearm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Government maintains that Mr. Epps' base offense level is 26 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(1) because he committed the instant offense after sustaining two\n   felony convictions of a controlled substance abuse: (1) Possession of Narcotics with Intent to Sell, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 21a-277(a), on December 4, 2012; and (2) Possession of Narcotics with Intent to Sell, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 21a-277(a), on January 11, 2012. Mr. Epps, however, asks this Court to find that these two convictions are not qualifying controlled substance offenses, and therefore to find that his base offense level is 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

First, he claims that the list of actions set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 21a-277(a) prohibits conduct not prohibited under federal law (thereby failing to satisfy the categorical approach) and that these actions are alternative means of committing the offense (thereby rendering unavailable the modified categorical approach). Second, Defendant argues that the state scheme prohibits controlled substances not prohibited under federal law (thereby failing to satisfy the categorical approach) and that these drugs are alternative means of committing the offense (thereby rendering unavailable the modified categorical approach).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Actions Prohibited by Conn. Gen. Stat. Section 21a-277(a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(1) provides for a base offense level of 26 if (A) the offense involved a semi-automatic firearm capable of accepting a large capacity magazine (which is undisputed here) and (B) \"the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\" In turn, Application Note 1 provides that a controlled substance offense \"has the meaning given that term in \u00a7 4B1.2(b) and Application Note 1 of the Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2.\" Under \u00a7 4B1.2(b), a controlled substance offense is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [A]n offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On the other hand, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 21a-277(a) imposes specified penalties on: \"Any person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, or a narcotic substance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Government does not dispute that this state statute casts a wider net than its federal counterpart. In\n   <em>\n    Savage\n   </em>\n   the Second Circuit determined that a violation drawn from the same list of alternative actions in Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 21a-277(b) does not qualify categorically as a \"controlled substance offense\" because \"the Connecticut statute, by criminalizing a mere offer to sell, criminalizes more conduct than falls within the federal definition of a controlled substance offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3840956\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/959/#p964\">\n    542 F.3d at 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit found that the statute of conviction was overly inclusive, and therefore it applied the modified categorical approach\n   to determine whether the Government established that the defendant's plea necessarily rested on the elements of a predicate offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3840956\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/959/#p964\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However,\n   <em>\n    Savage\n   </em>\n   predated\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , and Defendant argues that Section 21a-277(a) lists alternative means of triggering liability, and not distinct elements of the crime, thereby requiring that the court apply only the categorical, and not the modified categorical approach. Given the Government's acknowledgement that Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 21a-277(a) is broader than the definition of a controlled substance offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(1), if the Court determines that\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   precludes application of the modified categorical approach, Defendant's two prior offenses would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   constitute predicate offenses under the categorical approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The question then, is whether the list of actions in Section 21a-277(a) are alternative elements of that offense, in which case the Court is required to apply the modified categorical approach, or rather, are alternative means, which would preclude the Court from applying the modified categorical approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under the Government's view, the list of alternative actions in Section 21a-277(a) must be deemed elements of the offense, not means, because under Connecticut law the jury must be unanimous in finding that a defendant committed one of these alternative actions. (Gov't Memo. [Doc. # 22] at 10.) The Government contends that \"[s]uch unanimity is the hallmark of an element,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13) citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   , in which the Appellate Court of Connecticut determined that \"an examination of the statutory definitions of 'sale' and 'dispense' [in Section 21a-277(a) ] would ordinarily require a conclusion that they are conceptually distinct from each other, and that therefore, a specific unanimity charge on each of them would be required.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1969120\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/13/288/#p293\">\n    13 Conn.

The Government claims that in\n   <em>\n    Mierez\n   </em>\n   \"the evidence was sufficient for a conviction based on possession with intent to sell, [but] it was not sufficient for a conviction based on sale\" and that \"[i]f the alternative actions were merely means of committing the offense, then the defendant would have violated Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 21a-277(a) and his sufficiency challenge would have failed.\" This Court does not read\n   <em>\n    Mierez\n   </em>\n   to suggest that there was sufficient evidence to proceed on an alternative theory. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Mem. at 14.) Rather, it would seem that the appellate court's point was that where the state chose to proceed under a particular theory of liability under the statute, and did not present sufficient evidence to prevail on that theory, the jury's verdict could not be upheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While Connecticut state courts do not require that a defendant be charged with a specific\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   under \u00a7 21a-277(a), the actions are only means of triggering liability, not distinct elements of the crime.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Cavanaugh\n   </em>\n   (noting that \"the state charged the defendant ... with conspiring to distribute, sell or otherwise dispense a narcotic substance in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277a,\" not specifying one act in particular). Given this language, and applying the rule of lenity,\n   the Court concludes, while recognizing this to be a very close question, that the actions listed in the statute are indivisible and define only a single crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Substances Penalized Under Conn. Gen. Stat. Section 21a-277(a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant's second, independent argument is that the statute is overly broad because it lists two drugs which are undisputedly not included in the federal drug schedule, and the type of substance at issue is part of the means, not a separate element, meaning the Court is not permitted to apply the modified categorical approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.2(b) defines a \"controlled substance offense\" as \"an offense under federal\n   <em>\n    or state law\n   </em>\n   , punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\" (emphasis added). The Government argues that the plain language of the Guidelines provision encompasses substances controlled by a state even if those substances do not appear on the federal schedules, and therefore this has no bearing on whether Defendant's convictions under Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 21a-277(a) qualify as controlled substance offenses. (Gov't Mem. at 15, 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Government relies on\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The\n   <em>\n    Barrow\n   </em>\n   court noted that \"[s]everal courts of appeals have held that state laws which ban substances that are not listed in the schedules of the federal Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\") are categorically broader than the generic Guidelines 'drug trafficking offense.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269021\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/230/116/#p124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269021\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/230/116/#p124\">\n    at 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases).
