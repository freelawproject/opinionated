The following day, Horowitz attended a forty-five minute spinning class at the Ritz Carlton's fitness center. (Docket No. 19 at p. 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 7, 2011, Horowitz notified Ritz Carlton personnel that he suffered from soreness and experienced difficulty walking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4. An on-call physician treated Horowitz at his hotel room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That same night, Horowitz visited the emergency room at Ashford Presbyterian Community Hospital (\"Ashford Presbyterian\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 4-5. Horowitz received medical treatment until August 8, 2011, \"discharging [himself] against the advice of [his] attending physician.\" (Docket No. 60, Ex. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Horowitz suffers from rhabdomyolysis, a medical condition allegedly resulting from his participation in the August 7, 2011 spinning class. (Docket No. 19 at p. 5.) During Horowitz's vacation in Puerto Rico, he experienced \"excruciating pain and a great deal of discomfort.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 8. He purportedly continues to endure bilateral weakness, bilateral intermittent pain, and bilateral discomfort.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Horowitz seeks $1,250,000.00 in economic damages from Luxury Hotels, litigation costs, and attorney's fees pursuant to Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, sections 5141\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . (\"Article 1802\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Luxury Hotels moves for summary judgment because, it argues, Horowitz \"lacks adequate, credible, expert evidence to establish the alleged industry standards and deviations.\" (Docket No. 60, Ex. 5 at p-. 1-2.) Horowitz opposed summary judgement, and Luxury Hotels replied. (Docket Nos. 69 and 74.) After retaining new counsel, Horowitz moved to amend his statement of uncontested material facts \"in the interest of factual accuracy.\" (Docket Nos. 80 and 81.) The proposed amendments to his statement of uncontested material facts are inconsequential. For instance, Horowitz initially admitted that he arrived at Ashford Presbyterian \"at around 11:00 p.m.\" (Docket No. 60, Ex. 1 at p. 3; Docket No. 69, Ex. 1 at p. 2.) The proposed statement of uncontested material facts states that the \"[a]rrival time was actually earlier than 11 p.m.\" (Docket No. 81 at p. 2.) Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Horowitz's motion to amend his statement of uncontested material facts because the proposed amendments are insignificant, and the amendment would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Luxury Hotel's motion for summary judgment hinges on whether the evidence submitted by Horowitz is sufficient pursuant to an unduly narrow duty of care. In its motion for summary judgment, Luxury Hotels cites medical malpractice cases for the proposition that \"courts recognize matters as being so technical or specialized in nature that expert evidence is required of the party bearing the burden of proof to be able to sustain a decision by the trier of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20P.R.%20Dec.%20806\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at p. 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bradley v.

Horowitz sets forth two divergent duties of care. (Docket No. 19.) First, Horowitz alleges that Luxury Hotels deviated from a litany of standards pertaining to indoor cycling. (Docket No. 19 at pp. 5-7.) According to Horowitz, Luxury Hotels is negligent because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (a) they never screened [Horowitz] to assess [Horowitz's] suitability or level of expertise in spinning; (b) never informed [Horowitz] of any of the risks to which he was about to be exposed, including the very serious risk (as a first-time spinner) of rhabdomyolysis ; (c) even though [Horowitz] had never previously engaged in any spinning at all, [Luxury Hotels] placed [Horowitz] in a non-beginner class along with much more advanced spinners; and (d) ... placed [Horowitz] in a 45-minute class, which was 50 percent longer in duration than the 30-minute limit which spinning provides/professionals had been cautioned and urged to adhere to for first-time spinners.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 7.

Second, Horowitz, adopts a more generalized duty of care, claiming that Luxury Hotels \"owed [Horowitz] the basic duty of care that an innkeeper owes it guests.\" (Docket No. 19 at p. 7.) This Court concurs with the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Luxury Hotels and Horowitz's contention that the applicable duty of care is specific to the spinning industry is misguided. In actions involving complex subject matters, such as negligent design defect and medical malpractice cases, plaintiffs must set forth expert testimony establishing the applicable duty of care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prado \u00c1lvarez v.

Horowitz cites no statute or regulation suggesting that the duty of care for fitness centers offering spinning classes requires expert testimony. Luxury Hotels named Douglas Baumgarten (\"Baumgarten\") as an expert in exercise science because he is \"quite familiar with Spinning and other forms of indoor cycling exercise.\" (Docket No. 69, Ex. 4 at p. 2.) Baumgarten asserts that \"there are virtually no statutes regarding exercise instruction, as there are myriad types of exercise programs and many different ways of instruction or coaching participants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. The parties present no reason to hold Luxury Hotels liable for negligence because it allegedly deviated from the standards set forth in indoor cycling publications including \"Spinning Instructor News\" and \"wwww.spinning.com.\" (Docket No. 19 at p. 6.) Citation to trade magazines and websites for spinning enthusiasts does not establish the obligatory duty of care for indoor cycling classes within the meaning of Article 1802.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The duty of care in the context of a spinning class need not correspond to technical, industry-specific standards.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gass v.

(Docket No. 70.) Horowitz designated Ullucci as an expert witness on March 24, 2018, more than a week after the deadline to do so. (Docket No. 49 at p. 6; Docket No. 55 at p. 2.) Accordingly, the Court granted Luxury Hotels' motion to strike Ullucci, holding that Horowitz \"is precluded from utilizing Dr. Paul Ullucci, Jr. as an expert witness or otherwise at trial.\" (Docket No. 56.) Horowitz named Eichner as an expert before the conclusion of discovery, but subsequently withdrew Eichner's expert witness designation. (Docket No. 62 at p. 2.) Luxury Hotels requests that the Court broaden its previous order by \"precluding Dr. Cardona-Cancio, [Horowtiz], or any of the witnesses ... from making any direct or indirect reference to the opinion of Ullcci and Eichner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The comprehensive preclusion of any reference to Ullucci and Eichner is unwarranted. Luxury Hotels provides no basis for the Court to expand its previous ruling regarding the exclusion of Ullucci, or to preclude any reference to Eichner. The Court's order prohibiting Horowitz from utilizing Ullucci as an expert at trial is sufficient. (Docket No. 56.) Luxury Hotels' request to preclude Horowitz's designated expert, N\u00e9stor Cardona-Cancio (\"Cardona\"), from \"making any direct or indirect reference to the opinions of Drs. Ullucci, Jr. and Eichner\" is unnecessary. (Docket No. 70 at p. 4.)
