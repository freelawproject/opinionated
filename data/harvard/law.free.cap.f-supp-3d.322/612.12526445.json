ROBRENO, District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The same criminal defense attorney currently represents the defendants in both of the above-captioned cases. Each defendant was charged with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine in separate cases but are members of the same conspiracy. One defendant was convicted after a jury trial and is now appealing his sentence; the other defendant pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation plea agreement with the Government and is awaiting sentencing. The Third Circuit remanded the first defendant's appeal to this Court for the limited purpose of determining whether there is an actual or serious potential conflict of interest created by the representation by the same lawyer of one defendant on appeal from a conviction, while the sentencing of the other defendant is still pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that there is a serious potential conflict of interest, and that it is not waivable with respect to one of the two defendants. Under these circumstances, the attorney is disqualified from the further representation of either or both defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Andrew Carr was convicted, following a jury trial, of one count of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. The Court sentenced him to 132 months of imprisonment, and he is now appealing his sentence. Client No. 1 pleaded guilty, pursuant to a cooperation plea agreement with the Government, to an information charging him with one count of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, and is now awaiting sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although Carr and Client No. 1 were charged separately in different cases, they are each alleged to have been members of the same conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine (the \"Trombetta methamphetamine conspiracy\"). Client No. 1, a cooperating witness, has provided information to the Government regarding that conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   John J. Griffin, Esquire, is a criminal defense lawyer. He represented Client No. 1 during the Government's investigation of Client No. 1's case, and at Client No. 1's arraignment and plea hearing. Griffin currently represents Client No. 1 and is expected to do so at his upcoming sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Griffin represented Client No. 1 at his arraignment and plea hearing, Carr retained Griffin as his appellate counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Should Carr's appeal be successful and a re-trial ordered, Client No. 1 could be a potential witness against Carr on any re-trial. Further, given that Client No. 1 has a cooperation plea agreement with the Government (concerning a conspiracy in which Carr was a member), the nature and\n   extent of his cooperation will be at issue during his sentencing hearing. As a result, the legal interests of the two defendants may diverge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Both Carr and Griffin have agreed that, should a re-trial be ordered, Griffin will not represent Carr at the re-trial. Griffin contends that, under this agreement, he will never be exposed to having to cross-examine a former client (Client No. 1) during the Carr re-trial. Moreover, Griffin has represented that, at sentencing, he will not make an argument highlighting Client No. 1's cooperation as it pertains to Carr's participation in the conspiracy. Therefore, under these circumstances, he believes there is no serious potential conflict of interest created by his representation of Carr on appeal while continuing to represent Client No. 1 at the sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In Carr's appeal before the Third Circuit, the Government filed a motion to remand the case to this Court for the limited purpose of conducting a hearing on the actual or serious potential conflict of interest created by Griffin's concurrent representation of both Carr and Client No. 1. The Third Circuit then remanded the case to this Court to determine whether there is a serious potential conflict of interest that disqualifies Griffin from undertaking Carr's representation on appeal, and if so, whether the conflict is waivable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court held separate hearings with Carr and Client No. 1, at which each defendant was represented by conflicts counsel appointed by the Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to consider the potential conflict and whether the potential conflict, if one existed, could be waived by both Carr and Client No. 1. The Government takes no position on these issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The nature and usefulness of any information that Client No. 1 provided to the Government regarding the Trombetta methamphetamine conspiracy will be relevant to the Court in determining how much credit Client No. 1 will receive for his cooperation. Griffin's duty of loyalty to Carr would prevent him from making certain arguments regarding the usefulness of Client No. 1's information. For example, making arguments regarding the seriousness of the offenses committed by the Trombetta methamphetamine conspiracy, and the danger that the members of the conspiracy pose to the public, may require Griffin to reveal confidential information obtained during his representation of Carr.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=207%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2081.4\">\n    207 Pa.

Carr and Griffin have agreed that, in the event Carr is retried, Griffin will not represent Carr at his retrial. The adverse consequences of needing to retain a different attorney for a retrial following a successful appeal, and any associated delays, are outweighed by Carr's right to counsel of his choice.

Client No. 1 pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation plea agreement with the Government, and he has not yet been sentenced. Griffin represented Client No. 1 during his arraignment and plea hearing, and intends to represent Client No. 1 at sentencing. Due to Griffin's duty of loyalty to Carr, Griffin would not be able to make certain arguments at Client No. 1's sentencing hearing regarding the usefulness of any information that Client No. 1 may have provided to the Government about Carr, or about any illegal activities involving Carr, or about the Trombetta methamphetamine conspiracy, of which Carr was also a member.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2081.4\">\n    204 Pa.

The Court finds that Griffin's inability to make these arguments at sentencing may violate Client No. 1's right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. Further, Client No. 1's informed consent to the representation is not sufficient to allow Griffin to continue to represent him under the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct or the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, because there is a concurrent conflict of interest and Griffin will not \"be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=207%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2081.4\">\n    207 Pa.

Such representation not only constitutes a breach of professional ethics and invites disrespect for the integrity of the court, but it is also detrimental to the independent interest of the trial judge to be free from future attacks over the adequacy of the waiver or the fairness of the proceedings in his own court and the subtle problems implicating the defendant's comprehension of the waiver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Wheat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212318\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/153/#p164\">\n    486 U.S. at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212318\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/153/#p164\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"918117\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/570/1177/#p1184\">\n    570 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1184 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Therefore, the Court will not accept Client No. 1's waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Griffin is Disqualified From Representing Both Carr and Client No. 1\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As explained above, because the Court will not accept Client No. 1's waiver of the conflict of interest created by Griffin's concurrent representation of Carr and Client No. 1, Griffin is disqualified from further concurrent representation of both clients. Whether Griffin may separately represent either defendant in lieu of the other raises a different question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As to Client No. 1, Griffin was retained by Carr and began working on Carr's case prior to bringing this matter to the attention of the Court. Due to that representation, which has already begun, Griffin owes a duty of loyalty to Carr, and that duty continues even if Griffin were to terminate his representation of Carr.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2081.4\">\n    204 Pa.

Thus, Griffin cannot \"cure\" his inability to adequately represent Client No. 1 at sentencing, even if he were to cease his representation of Carr. Therefore, Griffin is disqualified from representing Client No. 1 at his sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As to Carr, the Court accepts Carr's waiver of the serious potential conflict of interest to the extent it impacts Carr's right to conflict-free representation. Under ordinary circumstances, Griffin could continue to represent Carr on appeal. However, here Griffin represented Client No. 1 before he was retained by Carr. Griffin's decision to commence representation of a second client, Carr, which prevents him from effectively representing his first client, Client No. 1, is a violation of Griffin's duty of loyalty to Client No. 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2081.4\">\n    204 Pa.

This case is a cautionary tale: an attorney who undertakes a subsequent representation that creates a concurrent conflict of interest with respect to his representation of the first client does so at his peril, as he may be disqualified from representing either client or both, notwithstanding the informed consent of both clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that there is a serious potential conflict of interest created by Griffin's concurrent representation of Carr and Client No. 1. The Court accepts Carr's waiver of the conflict, but does not accept Client No. 1's waiver. Because the Court does not accept Client No. 1's waiver, Griffin is disqualified from representing Client No. 1, either concurrently with Carr or alone. Griffin is also disqualified from representing Carr alone, because permitting Griffin to jettison Client No. 1, his first client, in order to represent Carr, his second client, would violate the ethical standards of the legal profession and the fairness of these legal proceedings. Under these circumstances, Griffin is disqualified from further representation of either or both defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this\n   <strong>\n    20th\n   </strong>\n   day of\n   <strong>\n    August, 2018\n   </strong>\n   , for the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that John J.
