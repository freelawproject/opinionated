No. 7); and the \"Motion to Strike or, Alternatively, Response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, or, Alternatively, Motion to Amend Complaint\" filed by Plaintiffs Dora Salia Maldonado, Dora L. Munoz, Rogelio Cazares, Jr., Jorge A. Salazar, Palmira Munoz, Chris Yates, and Santos Leal (Dkt. No. 9). Plaintiffs are seven former County employees allegedly fired by Rodriguez because they (and in one case, a family member) supported Rodriguez's opponent, longtime former District Attorney Rene Guerra, in the 2014 election campaign. (Dkt. No. 1). Plaintiffs assert claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for political retaliation in violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants now move to dismiss Plaintiffs' action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, on the following grounds: (1) Plaintiffs' claims against the County and Rodriguez in his official capacity should be dismissed because Plaintiffs' positions are ones that legitimately require political affiliation or loyalty; and (2) Rodriguez in his individual capacity is entitled to qualified immunity. (Dkt. No. 7). In their response, Plaintiffs move to strike certain statements in Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and also ask that they be given leave to amend their pleading should the Court determine that their current allegations are insufficient to state a claim against Defendants. (Dkt. No. 9). Upon consideration of the Motions and the parties' responsive briefing (Dkt. Nos. 7, 9, 13), the Court finds that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss must be denied and Plaintiffs' Motions to Strike and for Leave to Amend are moot, for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

According to Defendants, these provisions rendered the investigator Plaintiffs capable of exposing Rodriguez to personal liability. (Dkt. No. 7).\n   <em>\n    Gunaca\n   </em>\n   found the cited provisions dispositive of the first two ADEA personal staff exception factors-whether a Texas DA has plenary powers of appointment and removal, and whether investigators are personally accountable only to the DA-not the reverse question of whether the DA may be held personally liable for his investigators' official acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gunaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411779\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/65/467/#p469\">\n    65 F.3d at 470-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Gunaca\n   </em>\n   lends no direct support to Defendants' argument.

Here, the Texas statutory provision making the DA \"responsible\" for the official acts of his investigators does not explicitly subject him to civil liability for acts taken in contravention of the DA's directives,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Court has located no authority indicating that \u00a7 41.109(b) serves as a source of any such liability. Therefore, Rodriguez cannot rely on his alleged personal liability for the official acts of the investigator Plaintiffs in contending that they are employees lawfully subject to dismissal for their political support of the former DA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court therefore turns to the broader question of whether, as Defendants submit, all of the Plaintiffs otherwise occupied confidential positions and/or positions for which political allegiance to Rodriguez was an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of their jobs. (Dkt. No. 7). Although Defendants group Dora Munoz, Yates, Salazar, and Leal together as \"investigators,\" each held a different title at the time of firing: Dora Munoz was employed as Commander of HIDTA, Yates as Assistant Commander of HIDTA, Salazar as a Hot Checks Division Investigator, and Leal as an Investigator who also helped out with HIDTA. The remaining Plaintiffs held varied positions: Maldonado was employed as an Administrative Assistant III, Cazares as Human Resources (\"HR\") Coordinator, and Palmira Munoz as an Intelligence Analyst. The Court first\n   notes that no existing precedent directly holds that any of these jobs are subject to political dismissals. Although the terminated employee in\n   <em>\n    Gunaca\n   </em>\n   was an investigator for a Texas DA, the Court there was concerned only with whether the DA was entitled to qualified immunity from First Amendment liability, discussed more fully\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , not whether a constitutional violation had actually occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gunaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411779\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/65/467/#p469\">\n    65 F.3d at 473-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In arguing that the Court may nonetheless hold that Plaintiffs' jobs were confidential in nature or otherwise of the type justifying political dismissals, Defendants rely heavily on allegations that may not be considered at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage-namely, formal job descriptions not contained in or reasonably encompassed by Plaintiffs' pleading. Looking only to Plaintiffs' pleaded allegations, the Court concludes that it cannot make an affirmative legal determination that Plaintiffs fall within that \"exceptional class of public servants of whom political allegiance may be demanded.\"\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1344507\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/145/691/#p704\">\n    145 F.3d at 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Garcia v.

Further, the extent to which managerial employees such as Munoz and Yates had the power to advance or undermine the DA's policies is relevant to the determination of whether they fall within the excepted class of public employees, and cannot be determined from Plaintiffs' pleading alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gentry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9106679\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/481/#p485\">\n    337 F.3d at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (at summary judgment stage, determining that county road manager and county administrator could be fired for their support of political opponent of president of county board of supervisors, in part because plaintiffs' \"critical managerial roles in county government\" enabled them \"to advance the board's policies, if they act[ed] faithfully, or to undermine those policies by overt or covert opposition,\" creating \"strains that could easily disrupt and prevent the effective performance of public services\");\n   <em>\n    Kinsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524959\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/950/988/#p993\">\n    950 F.2d at 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v.

Moreover, the Court notes that even if Dora Munoz was subject to a political dismissal, Plaintiffs\n   have also pleaded that Rodriguez reported to the State that Munoz was \"dishonorably discharged.\" Whether this is the type of adverse action that, if taken against Munoz by reason of her political support of the former DA, could give rise to a First Amendment claim, is a question that Defendants' Motion does not address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   With respect to the other Plaintiffs, the Court cannot determine from the pleaded allegations whether they occupied confidential roles with respect to the policymaking process; although each may have had access to documents and materials considered \"confidential,\" the relevant inquiry is whether those documents were ones \"embodying policymaking deliberations and determinations\" to the extent that loyalty to Rodriguez was necessary for the effective delivery of the public services provided through their jobs.
