Importantly, both informed Sandoval of his administrative appeal rights.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Hardy Decl. at 3-4; Rodgers Decl. at 6-7. According to the sworn agency affidavits, Sandoval never filed an appeal of his requests.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Hardy Decl. at 5; Rodgers Decl. at 13.

Sandoval has not argued that the documents produced to him by the Office are unresponsive, or that the Office's search could have been better tailored to find the most responsive documents; rather, he simply argues the Office should have produced more documents. But Sandoval indicated he wanted only the 100 free pages to which he was entitled under FOIA and did not wish the Office to search further.
