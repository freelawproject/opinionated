(Docket No. 80). J.A.M.A. did not file an opposition that admits, denies, or qualifies each of Bautista Cayman's facts with reference to each numbered paragraph, as Local Rule 56 requires. In its response memorandum, J.A.M.A. merely claims that uncertainty exists as to the amounts owed and a broken tract of loan holders. (Docket No. 82 at 2). Hence, Bautista Cayman correctly points out in its reply that J.A.M.A. failed to deny any of its statements of uncontested material facts. (Docket No. 94 at 2). In an effort to correct its mistake, J.A.M.A. filed a sur-reply where it accepted, qualified, or denied Bautista Cayman's SUMF with reference to each numbered paragraph. However, J.A.M.A. sprinkled each with legal argumentation, and still deprived many assertions of citations to the record. See Docket No. 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court deems Bautista Cayman's SUMF as uncontroverted. First, Local Rule 56 clearly states that J.A.M.A. had to submit his admissions, qualifications, or denials \"with its opposition,\" not its sur-reply. L. Cv. R. 56(c). Even if the Court considered its sur-reply as a valid opposition to Bautista Cayman's SUMF, the Court would still be compelled to disregard it. The opposition must \"support\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   denial or qualification by a record citation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3115677\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/1/#p7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Yet J.A.M.A. frequently fails to provide a citation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 101 at \u00b6 19. Moreover, the denials or qualifications also \"must be strictly limited to the issue therein raised.\"\n   <em>\n    Natal Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523471\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/215/#p219\">\n    291 F.Supp.3d at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, J.A.M.A. intermingles factual disputes with arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 101 \u00b6 21 (\"The agreement referred to as the Bill of Sale falls absolutely short of being all Bautista Cayman needed to acquire the rights of all contract, credit facilities, and collateral documents mentioned by Bautista Cayman in its MSJ, except for the negotiable instruments.\"). Hence, J.A.M.A. did not comply with the rules once, but twice. Therefore, as allowed by Local Rule 56(e), the Court shall deem Bautista's SUMF as admitted because they were improperly controverted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523471\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/215/#p219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Under Mortgage Act of 1979, a mortgage creditor has three options for collecting a debt: (1) a personal collection action with an attachment to the debtor's real property; (2) the Summary Procedure; or (3) the ordinary procedure.\n   <em>\n    P.R.

There is no genuine issue of material fact: J.A.M.A. entered into a loan agreement, signed two promissory notes, constituted a mortgage on the two properties at issue, and defaulted on its obligations. Molina-Machargo and Rivera-Cano owe 50% of the obligations each under two guarantees. The obligations, in turn, were endorsed to Bautista Cayman. Hence, as the rightful beneficiary of J.A.M.A.'s obligations, Bautista Cayman is\n   entitled to collect monies owed and execute the mortgaged properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   J.A.M.A., however, challenges the amounts due. It states that determining the amount \"requires a detailed loan payment history itemizing the application of the payments accrued as well as the payments received and their concept application ... based [on] appropriate financial accounting records admissible in evidence.\" (Docket No. 82 at 2). J.A.M.A. cites no source to support its assertion as a matter of law. And if this assertion is intended to pass as a denial of amounts owed under Local Rule 56, it constitutes an inappropriate denial per the discussion above. As Bautista Cayman argues, it provided the loan agreement and promissory notes, which state that they accrue interest, and an unsworn statement under penalty of perjury detailing the amounts owed once that interest is accounted for. Docket No. 94 at 4). There is no dispute of material fact as to the total sums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   J.A.M.A. also challenges the chain of loan holders and argues that Bautista does not own the notes at issue. The argument stems from a bill of sale between the FDIC and Bautista Finance Holdings (BFH). (Docket No. 94-1). The confusion arises because the bill of sale states that the FDIC \"does hereby sell, assign, convey to Bautista REO PR. Corp.\n   <em>\n    with regard to the real estate\n   </em>\n   described in Exhibit A, except those that are not real estate related, and Bautista Cayman Asset Company, with regard to\n   <em>\n    only those assets described in Exhibit A that are not real estate\n   </em>\n   related ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8809728\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pr-dec/123/231/#p243\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Hence, J.A.M.A. argues that the FDIC transferred the relevant notes to Bautista REO, and not Bautista Cayman (Plaintiff), because, according to J.A.M.A., they were real estate related. But Bautista Cayman disagrees. It correctly points out that (1) the bill of sale conveyed assets to Bautista Cayman and (2) the notes appear endorsed to Bautista Cayman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 94-1; 94-2; 94-3. As Bautista Cayman argues, the evidence \"clearly shows that the Bill of Sale, along with the endorsed notes, contemplated transfers to Bautista Cayman.\" (Docket No. 104 at 3). And indeed, the evidence shows that the notes were endorsed to Bautista Cayman, placing them in Bautista Cayman's possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
