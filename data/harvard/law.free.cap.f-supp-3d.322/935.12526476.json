Jackley, in his capacity as Attorney General of the State of South Dakota (the defendants), alleging his incarceration violates his constitutional right to due process. Doc. 1. The defendants moved to dismiss Blakney's petition without prejudice because they believe eight of the ten grounds for relief are unexhausted. Doc. 7. For the reasons stated below, this Court grants in part and denies in part the defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 30, 2011, Christopher Blakney pleaded guilty to aggravated assault in South Dakota's Second Judicial Circuit. Doc. 8-3. He received a thirteen-year suspended sentence, subject to fourteen conditions. Doc. 8-3. These conditions included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. That the defendant sign and abide by the standard supervised probation agreement with the Court Services Department for twenty-four (24) months....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   11. That the defendant complete any evaluation, counseling, anger management, or participation in 24/7 program as directed by the Court or the Court Services Officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   12. That the defendant commit no Class I misdemeanors or greater for a period of ten (10) years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   13. That the defendant commit no violent offenses for a period of ten (10) years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Doc. 8-3 at 1-2. The first condition meant that Blakney was also subject to the standard conditions of adult probation. The standard conditions of Blakney's adult probation required that he \"obey all federal, state, and tribal laws and municipal ordinances\" for the duration of his 24 month probation period. Doc. 8-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 14, 2012, the State moved to revoke Blakney's suspended sentence based on a Violation Report asserting that Blakney violated Condition 11 of his sentence by failing to comply with the Court Service Officer's directive to verify that he had undergone a sex offender evaluation. Doc. 8-5 at 3. The state court entered an Order Revoking Suspended Sentence, and Blakney was incarcerated. Doc. 8-6. Blakney appealed the revocation of his suspended sentence to the Supreme Court of South Dakota, which reversed the Second Judicial Circuit's decision because sex offender treatment was not expressly required by Condition 11 or otherwise as part of the sentence. Doc. 8-11. The Second Judicial Circuit vacated its previous revocation of Blakney's suspended sentence on July 30, 2014. Doc. 8-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The State again moved to revoke Blakney's suspended sentence on November 7, 2014, a week after Blakney was arrested in Lincoln County, South Dakota for simple assault and driving with a revoked license. Doc. 8-16. The Second Judicial Circuit entered an Order Revoking Suspended Sentence\n   on June 30, 2015. Doc. 8-21. Again, Blakney appealed to the Supreme Court of South Dakota, which summarily affirmed the revocation of Blakney's suspended sentence on November 14, 2016. Doc. 8-22; Doc. 8-23; Doc. 8-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Blakney filed this timely\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   federal habeas petition on February 16, 2017. Doc. 1. Blakney's petition raised ten grounds for granting the writ of habeas corpus, all of which allege violations of Blakney's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process. Doc. 1 at 5-18. The defendants now move to dismiss Blakney's federal habeas petition because they believe that he has exhausted only two of the ten asserted grounds in the petition and that stay and abeyance is inappropriate. Doc. 7. Blakney believes that he has exhausted all ten of his claims in state court and that his federal habeas petition may proceed in this Court in its entirety without returning to state court.

To avoid such an outcome, the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the\n   <em>\n    Lundy\n   </em>\n   rule which allows federal district courts to stay a mixed petition \"and hold it in abeyance while the petitioner returns to state court to exhaust his previously unexhausted claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/#p275\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/#p275\">\n    at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/#p275\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Court made clear that \"stay and abeyance should be available only in limited circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/#p275\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/#p275\">\n    at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/#p275\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Thus, this Court initially must determine which of Blakney's claims are exhausted and whether any of the claims are unexhausted. If, as Blakney argues, he has already exhausted each claim presented in his federal habeas petition, then his petition to this Court may proceed in its entirety. If there are any unexhausted claims in the petition though, the petition is a mixed one and cannot proceed in federal court until it contains only exhausted claims. If Blakney's petition is mixed, this Court must decide whether to grant the defendants' motion to dismiss without prejudice, whether to allow Blakney the opportunity to purge his petition of unexhausted claims and proceed on the exhausted claims only, or whether to grant stay and abeyance to allow Blakney to return to state court to exhaust his unexhausted claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Doc. 8 at 1. This Court will address those eight claims in Blakney's petition individually. Of course, when addressing whether certain claims are exhausted, this\n   Court by no means is passing judgment on the merits of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Ground One\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Blakney's first ground in his habeas petition alleges violation of his right to due process stemming from a \"[l]ack of [j]urisdiction\" due to the absence of a \"finding [of] probable cause at the preliminary hearing\" in November of 2014. Doc. 1 at 5. Blakney claims to have exhausted this ground by raising it in his brief to the Supreme Court of South Dakota. Doc. 10 at 1. Blakney's brief to the Supreme Court of South Dakota raised and exhausted a related issue which is the subject of Ground Four of Blakney's petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 at 11; Doc. 8-23 at 22. However, Blakney's brief to the Supreme Court of South Dakota did not argue that the alleged absence of a finding of probable cause at his preliminary hearing caused an absence of state jurisdiction. Blakney did not raise the claim in Ground One in a manner to present the factual and legal issue to the Supreme Court of South Dakota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smittie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10543409\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/843/295/#p297\">\n    843 F.2d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Blakney attacked jurisdiction on this basis in his brief to the Supreme Court of South Dakota, arguing that the period of incarceration served on the initial revocation of his suspended sentence (later reversed by the Supreme Court of South Dakota) should not have tolled his probation period. Doc. 8-23 at 27-30. According to Blakney's argument, because the supervised probation period should have continued to run while Blakney was improperly imprisoned, his probation ended nearly a year before the events leading to his arrest on October 31, 2014, so the Second Judicial Circuit lacked jurisdiction to revoke his suspended sentence. The defendants argue that Blakney, when raising this issue during his state court appeal, failed to \"assert the circuit court's alleged lack of jurisdiction violated the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\" and thus that his federal habeas petition states a new, unexhausted claim. Doc. 8 at 13. However, claims that a court acted in spite of jurisdictional deficiencies are inevitably claims that due process has been abridged.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.

This is not sufficient evidence for a revocation [sic] of the implied condition of good behavior.\"). As discussed above, an insufficiency of evidence argument is an argument that due process has been violated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Douglas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173015\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/430/#p432\">\n    412 U.S. at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173015\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/430/#p432\">\n    93 S.Ct. 2199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Satter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518393\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/1259/#p1262\">\n    977 F.2d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Condition 12 of Blakney's suspended sentence required that he \"commit no Class I misdemeanors or greater for a period of ten (10) years.\" Doc. 8-3 at 2. In his brief to the Supreme Court of South Dakota, Blakney argued that in order to violate Condition 12 of the sentence, he would first have to be convicted of a Class I misdemeanor or worse before his suspended sentence could be revoked, and because he has not been convicted of a Class I misdemeanor or worse since his\n   suspended sentence began, he has not violated Condition 12. Doc. 8-23 at 36-39. Blakney merely repeats this argument in his federal habeas petition, simply making explicit that such an alleged error is inconsistent with due process. Doc. 1 at 16. Again, arguing that a probation revocation was based upon insufficient evidence amounts to arguing that due process has been violated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Douglas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173015\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/430/#p432\">\n    412 U.S. at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173015\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/430/#p432\">\n    93 S.Ct. 2199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Satter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518393\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/1259/#p1262\">\n    977 F.2d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Any challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to convict in a state prosecution is necessarily a due process challenge to the conviction.\").

Blakney's brief to the Supreme Court of South Dakota included an argument that the facts of his case were insufficient to show that he had committed a violent offense during his suspended sentence. Doc. 8-23 at 39-41. Again, Blakney's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence relied upon by the state court when it revoked his suspended sentence was a due process challenge.\n   <em>\n    Satter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518393\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/1259/#p1262\">\n    977 F.2d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Doc. 1 at 18. In his brief to the Supreme Court of South Dakota, Blakney asserted a right to recuse a trial judge when the judge permits the addition of new allegations into a sentence revocation hearing in a state case, citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

He now avers that he has a federal due process right to recuse the trial judge given the circumstances, but he did not make that claim to the state court.

Doc. 1 at 5. According to this theory, lack of a finding of probable cause for Blakney's alleged violation stripped the court of jurisdiction over him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/#p275\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But jurisdiction over Blakney did not hinge on a preliminary finding of probable cause, but on his status of being on state probation and under a suspended imposition of sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-18.5 (\"Any court granting probation or a suspended execution of sentence retains jurisdiction to revoke the probation or suspended execution of sentence for violation of its terms and conditions\"). Blakney has not identified any deficiency in SDCL \u00a7 23A-27-18.5 which makes it incompatible with due process, nor has this Court found any reason to doubt the statute's constitutionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ground Five is also meritless. Ground Five alleges that an internal contradiction in Blakney's sentence amounts to an unconstitutional disregard for his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process. Doc. 1 at 12-13. According to Blakney, the first condition of the probation, which required him to \"obey all federal, state, and tribal laws and municipal ordinances,\" contradicted Condition 12 of the suspended sentence, which required him to \"commit no Class I misdemeanors or greater for a period of ten (10) years.\" Doc. 8-4; Doc. 8-3 at 2. Blakney in essence argues that Condition 12 of the sentence permits him to commit lesser misdemeanors during the ten-year period. Notwithstanding Blakney's arguments, the suspended imposition of sentence terms are not incompatible with his probation terms. Condition 12 renders it a violation of conditions of his suspended imposition to commit a Class I misdemeanor or worse crime. It does not follow that commission of a Class II misdemeanor could not possibly have consequences such as being a probation violation or other violation of terms of the suspended imposition. Thus, Condition 12 is wholly compatible with a condition like Condition 1 of his probation which further restricts acceptable behavior. Ergo, Blakney's allegation in Ground Five that the court violated due process by imposing a self-contradictory sentence upon him is groundless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Ground Ten, alleging denial of a Due Process right to \"excuse the trial judge,\" also lacks merit. Doc. 1 at 18. Although the Due Process Clause does require that judges recuse themselves under certain circumstances, nothing about Blakney's case and nothing that occurred during the revocation process required that the presiding judge recuse herself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tumey v.
