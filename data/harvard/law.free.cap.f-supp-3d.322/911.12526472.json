MDL ECF No. 1113. This allowed Plaintiffs to become potential second bellwethers for this MDL.

MDL ECF No. 1282. For the reasons below, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' Lexecon waiver retractions are invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Few courts have addressed the validity of retractions of Lexecon waivers. But every court to do so agrees that a party may retract a Lexecon waiver only for \"good cause.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zimmer Durom Hip Cup Prods. Liab.

Their retractions are therefore invalid as unsupported by good cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The remaining Plaintiffs all provide identical reasons for retraction. First, they cite \"the Court's ruling in the\n   <em>\n    Gareis\n   </em>\n   matter choosing the law of a plaintiff's state of residence rather than Minnesota law as\n   the substantive law to be applied to plaintiff's claims, amongst other ruling.\" 16-cv-2144 (\n   <em>\n    Pearlie Partlow v. 3M Co.\n   </em>\n   ), ECF No. 9; 16-cv-4159 (\n   <em>\n    Ada Trombley v. 3M Co.\n   </em>\n   ), ECF No. 10; 17-cv-459 (\n   <em>\n    Terry Arnold v. 3M Co.\n   </em>\n   ), ECF No. 10; 17-cv-511 (\n   <em>\n    Nancy Axline v. 3M Co.\n   </em>\n   ), ECF No. 12. Plaintiffs allege that these rulings have \"collectively resulted in a material difference in the posture of the case\" and, on that basis, Plaintiffs seek to retract their Lexecon waivers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186232\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/815/649/#p653\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, Plaintiffs declare that the \"waiver[s were] made without consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186232\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/815/649/#p653\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, Plaintiffs claim that, although included in the bellwether pool, their cases have \"not been selected as ... trial pick[s] and no additional motion practice or depositions have occurred to move the case[s] forward.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186232\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/815/649/#p653\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Fourth, Plaintiffs assert that \"Defendants have never affirmatively waived\n   <em>\n    Lexecon\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186232\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/815/649/#p653\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This is not enough. As to the first reason, Plaintiffs mention no grounds for reasonably expecting a contrary choice-of-law ruling, making it unclear why Plaintiffs believe that the choice-of-law ruling caused a \"material difference\" in the case. And it is unclear what \"other rulings\" caused a \"material difference in the posture of the case.\" This uncertainty prevents the Court from finding good cause for retraction. Regardless, it is unlikely that a \"material difference in the posture of the case\" even amounts to \"good cause\" for retraction. If it did, any MDL party who disliked a court's rulings could simply issue a Lexecon retraction and undo months of work performed in reliance on the Lexecon waiver. The prospect of these unilateral retractions would undermine the bellwether trial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs cite no authority for their claim that a lack of consideration justifies retraction of a Lexecon waiver. At any rate, consideration clearly exists-Plaintiffs waived venue objections in exchange for moving to the front of the line to try their cases. Again, no good cause exists for retraction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs seem to argue that retraction would not unduly inconvenience the parties and the Court. This is wrong. The\n   <em>\n    Bair Hugger\n   </em>\n   MDL has progressed for the past few months in reliance on Plaintiffs' Lexecon waivers. Changing course now would waste the resources expended in advancing the current list of Bellwethers and would delay the more than 4,500 cases in this MDL by many months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Fourth, Plaintiffs again cite no authority for their contention that Defendants' failure to file a Lexecon waiver justifies the retraction of Plaintiffs' Lexecon waivers. At the Status Conference on July 19, 2018, Defendants argued that it is unclear whether Defendants must file a Lexecon waiver given that Defendants reside in Minnesota, but if a Lexecon waiver is required, Defendants agreement to try the bellwether cases in Minnesota constitutes a Lexecon waiver. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the above-captioned Plaintiffs failed to provide good cause to retract their Lexecon waivers. The attempted retractions are invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    At the Status Conference before the Court on July 19, 2018, Plaintiffs argued that\n    <em>\n     In re DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275230\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/345/#p348\">\n     870 F.3d 345\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (5th Cir. 2017) supports the retraction of their Lexecon waivers. But in\n    <em>\n     In re DePuy Orthopaedics\n    </em>\n    , the Fifth Circuit held that the district court abused its discretion in finding the existence of Lexecon waivers.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275230\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/345/#p348\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275230\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/345/#p348\">\n     at 348\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating that a \"majority holds ... that so-called\n    <em>\n     Lexecon\n    </em>\n    objections were not waived and that the district court abused its discretion in finding waiver\"). The court said nothing about grounds for retracting existing Lexecon waivers.\n    <em>\n     In re DePuy Orthopaedics\n    </em>\n    is thus irrelevant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
