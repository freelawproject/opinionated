Because Plaintiffs' claims are time-barred, the Court grants the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. THE ORIGINS OF THE DISPUTE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action arises out of the Ponzi scheme perpetrated by R. Allen Stanford, his associates, and various entities under his control for several years. The facts associated with Stanford's scheme are well established,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Janvey v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556295\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/185/#p188\">\n    712 F.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 188-89 (5th Cir. 2013), and are not recounted in great depth here. At root, the scheme was based on Stanford's sale of fraudulent certificates of deposit (\"CDs\") through an offshore bank located in Antigua, known as Stanford International Bank Limited. While Stanford represented to investors that the CD proceeds were invested only in low-risk, stable funds, in reality the proceeds were funneled into speculative real estate investments and used to support Stanford's lavish lifestyle. Stanford's scheme finally came to public light on February 17, 2009 when the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") issued a report charging Stanford and his entities with fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs here are former investors in Stanford's Ponzi scheme. They filed this suit against Pershing, a financial services firm that they allege served as clearing broker for Stanford Group Company, on November 20, 2013. The allegations in this suit are similar to those previously raised in the class action against Pershing titled\n   <em>\n    Turk v. Pershing, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:09-CV-2199-N,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012717194\">\n    2014 WL 12717194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Tex. filed Nov. 18, 2009) (the \"Turk Suit\"). Initially filed in the Southern District of Florida, the instant case was subsequently transferred to this Court for pretrial proceedings as part of the Stanford multidistrict litigation. Plaintiffs assert two claims in this action: one for fraud and another for participation in a breach of a fiduciary duty. Because both claims are time-barred, the Court grants Pershing's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Dist. Ct. App. 2013). Although claims generally begin to accrue when the last element of the cause of action occurs, Florida applies the delayed discovery doctrine to fraud claims.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Thus, absent any tolling, this action is timely if, at the earliest, Plaintiffs first discovered, or reasonably should have discovered, the facts giving rise to their fraud claim on November 20, 2009. On one hand, Pershing argues that Plaintiffs' fraud claim began accruing on February 17, 2009 when the SEC first publicly reported Stanford's scheme. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that they neither discovered nor reasonably should have discovered Pershing's role in the scheme until November 18, 2009 when the Turk Suit was filed. But, even assuming Plaintiffs' fraud claim did not begin accruing until November 18, 2009, their claim is still two days untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a result, Plaintiffs resort to tolling doctrines in an attempt to render their fraud claim timely. In particular, Plaintiffs offer three such doctrines: tolling under\n   <em>\n    American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. v. Utah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716351\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/538/\">\n    414 U.S. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716351\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/538/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716351\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/538/\">\n    38 L.Ed.2d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974) ; tolling while the Turk Suit was stayed pending an appeal; and equitable tolling due to fraudulent concealment.

Here, Plaintiffs invoke\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling from November 18, 2009, the date the Turk Suit was filed before this Court, to June 25, 2010, the date the class definition in the Turk Suit was modified to exclude Plaintiffs.

And none of the enumerated grounds for tolling applies to the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Despite this clear statutory language, the parties still disagree about whether\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling can apply to Florida state law claims.

Here, the Florida legislature has clearly spoken on the issue and this Court is bound by its language.\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling hence does not apply here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. The Stay of the Turk Suit Did Not Affect Plaintiffs' Claim.\n    </em>\n    -\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs next argue that the statute of limitations was tolled from September 30, 2011 to May 21, 2012 while the Turk Suit was stayed pending an appeal in a related case. Allowing this nearly eight-month period of tolling would render Plaintiffs' fraud claim timely. But, as an initial matter, such tolling due to a stay is not included on the exclusive list in section 95.051 of the Florida Statutes. As a result, for the same reason that\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling is inapplicable here, so too is this tolling theory. Moreover, even if such tolling was allowed in Florida, Plaintiffs were not subject to the stay. Plaintiffs themselves concede that they were no longer members of the proposed class in the Turk Suit as of June 25, 2010. It would be nonsensical for Plaintiffs to be entitled to tolling based on a stay that did not apply to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Perhaps recognizing the futility of their argument, Plaintiffs misleadingly characterize the scope of the stay at issue. In their response, Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    United States v. Brichat\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that a \"stay or other legal proceeding that prevents a party from exercising a legal remedy can be held to toll the operation of a statute of limitations.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6487872\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/129/235/#p238\">\n    129 B.R. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238 (D. Kan. 1991). However, the stay here was not of \"all Stanford [multidistrict litigation] proceedings\" as Plaintiffs claim, Pls.' Resp. 39 [130-1], but instead only of the Turk Suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order [69] in the Turk Suit. During the pendency of the stay, Plaintiffs were therefore not prevented from \"exercising any legal remedy,\"\n   <em>\n    Brichat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6487872\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/129/235/#p238\">\n    129 B.R. at 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , such as filing a new lawsuit, thereby undercutting the tolling rationale they proffer. Because the stay in the Turk Suit did not impact Plaintiffs' claim, they are not entitled to tolling on the basis of that stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Plaintiffs Were Too Late Even If Equitable Tolling Based on Fraudulent Concealment Applied.\n    </em>\n    -\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs finally contend that, even if their fraud claim accrued on February 17, 2009 when the SEC first publicly reported Stanford's scheme, the statute of limitations was tolled for nine months because Pershing fraudulently concealed its involvement in the scheme. In support of this argument, Plaintiffs point to an allegedly misleading affidavit Pershing provided the SEC on February 12, 2009. Although Plaintiffs do not state the exact end date of this equitable tolling period, it would have ended no later than November 18, 2009 when, as Plaintiffs claim, they became aware of Pershing's involvement in Stanford's scheme when the Turk Suit was filed. But, even if this equitable tolling applied, Plaintiffs' fraud claim, first filed on November 20, 2013, would be untimely by two days. The Court thus need not determine whether Plaintiffs are entitled to equitable tolling due to Pershing's fraudulent concealment. Either way, Plaintiffs' fraud claim is foreclosed as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Plaintiffs' Participation in a Breach of a Fiduciary Duty Claim is Time-Barred\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The parties agree that claims for participation in a breach of a fiduciary duty in Florida are subject to a four-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Home Assur. Co. v. Weaver Aggregate Transp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316370\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/990/1254/#p1271\">\n    990 F.Supp.2d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1271 (M.D. Fla. 2013) (\"Claims for breach of fiduciary duty in Florida are subject to a four-year statute of limitations ....\"); FLA. STAT. \u00a7 95.11(3)(o) (1991) (stating that \"any other intentional tort\" shall be commenced within four years). The parties disagree, however, as to whether such claims are subject to the delayed discovery rule. On the one hand, Pershing argues that the delayed discovery rule does not apply and thus Plaintiffs' participation in a breach of a fiduciary duty claim began accruing on\n   February 17, 2009 when the SEC first publicly reported Stanford's scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Persh.'s Mot. 14-15 [129-2]. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that the delayed discovery rule applies and therefore Plaintiffs' participation in a breach of a fiduciary duty claim did not begin accruing until November 18, 2009 when Plaintiffs first discovered Pershing's role in the scheme with the filing of the Turk Suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp. 36 [130-1]. But, even assuming Plaintiffs are correct that the delayed discovery doctrine applies to this claim and it hence did not begin accruing until November 18, 2009, their claim-filed on November 20, 2013-is still two days untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As a result, Plaintiffs require a tolling doctrine to render their participation in a breach of a fiduciary duty claim timely. To this end, Plaintiffs offer three such doctrines:\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling, tolling while the Turk Suit was stayed pending an appeal, and equitable tolling due to fraudulent concealment. But, as explained previously, each of these tolling doctrines is unavailing in the instant case.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   sections III(A)(1)-(3). Plaintiffs' participation in a breach of a fiduciary duty claim is therefore also foreclosed as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Because both of Plaintiffs' claims in this case are time-barred, the Court grants Pershing's motion for summary judgment. By separate document of this same date, the Court issues final judgment for Pershing.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Because each concerns Pershing's alternative grounds for summary judgment, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file notice of supplemental authority [138], Pershing's motion for leave to file first notice of supplemental authority [146], and Pershing's motion for leave to file second notice of supplemental authority [150]. Accordingly, the Court also denies as moot Plaintiffs' motion to strike Pershing's motion for leave to file first notice of supplemental authority [147].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Even if\n    <em>\n     American Pipe\n    </em>\n    tolling did apply to Florida state law claims, it would not apply here, where Plaintiffs seek cross-jurisdictional tolling.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dineen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206688040\">\n     2015 WL 6688040\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4 (\"Moreover, even if the courts in\n    <em>\n     Engle v.
