The claims arise out of an incident that occurred after\n   leaving a Bruins game at TD Boston Garden, located at 100 Legends Way in Boston, MA. Pursuant to this Court's order on the Defendants Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 28) and subject to the Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 54) the following counts remain: assault and battery of Mr. Deluca by Officer Merner (count I); assault and battery of Mrs. Deluca by Officer Moore (count II); violations of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (MCRA) against the Deluca's by Officers Chu, Merner, and Moore (count III). The Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment as to all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Facts\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 7, 2013, Mr. and Mrs. Deluca attended a Bruins playoff game in Boston. Prior to the game, they went to the Greatest Bar for food and drinks with two of their friends. Mr. Deluca had approximately five beers and Mrs. Deluca had two. Around 10:30 PM, after a Bruins win the Deluca's and their friends exited the arena with a large crowd of people onto Causeway Street. No one in the Deluca's direct vicinity was acting disorderly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Deluca was carrying a professionally made sign that he wanted to show on the television screen at the Ace Tickets Window. The group walked down the street towards the intersection of Causeway Street and Friend Street, in the rain. There were no physical barriers restricting access to the area located by the Ace Tickets Window. As Mr. Deluca approached the Ace Tickets Window, Officer Chu, who was with a group of police officers, yelled at him to \"get the fuck out of here.\" Officer Deluca asked what he had done wrong and Officer Chu repeated his order \"to get the fuck out of here.\" Mr. Deluca identified himself as an off duty police officer and Officer Chu requested to see identification. While Mr. Deluca was looking for his identification, Officer Merner approached calling Mr. Deluca an asshole and ordering him to \"get the fuck out of here.\" Officer Merner pointed his finger in Mr. Deluca's face and poked him several times. Mr. Deluca informed Officer Merner that he didn't know what he had done wrong. Officer Merner shoved Mr. Deluca with both hands causing Mr. Deluca to move backwards. Even though Officer Merner was informed that Mr. Deluca was an off-duty officer he continued to yell at and walk aggressively towards Mr. Deluca, forcing Mr. Deluca to take multiple steps backwards. At some point, Officer Merner began to walk away but then re-approached Mr. Deluca, ripped the sign out of his hands, and threw it as he continued to curse at him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mrs. Deluca observed this interaction and approached the group of officers. She was shoved from the side by Officer Moore, which caused her to stumble backwards. Mrs. Deluca cursed at Officer Moore and asked why he had pushed her. She too was told that she needed \"to get the fuck out of here.\" Mrs. Deluca informed Officer Moore that she was a nurse and again asked why she had been pushed. Officer Moore ordered her \"to get the fuck out of here before you get arrested.\" The Deluca's left the area out of fear of being arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Legal Standard\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgement as a matter of law.\" Fed.

While Officer Merner's use of force occurred within his discretionary functions, I find that the facts may permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that he was not acting in good faith. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, Mr. Deluca did nothing to warrant such aggressive behavior by Officer Merner. While Mr. Deluca did not immediately comply with the officers orders to leave the area, Officer Chu requested identification purportedly permitting Mr. Deluca to remain in the location for a short period of time. The record shows that Mr. Deluca and Officer Chu notified Officer Merner of this information but that did not halt his aggressive conduct. Officer Merner approached Officer Deluca from the start in an aggressive manner yelling expletives, pointing his finger in Mr. Deluca's face, poking his chest, shoving him, and ripping the sign out of his hand. Mr. Deluca was the only individual in the area of the Ace Tickets Window and although the street was crowded, no one around him was acting disorderly. I find that these facts taken together could allow a reasonably jury to conclude that Officer Merner acted with hostility towards Mr. Deluca as a result of bad faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    B.

Officer Moore argues that because there is no evidence that he intended to cause a harmful or offensive touching and because Mrs. Deluca did not see him prior to the touching she could not have been in\n   fear, and he is entitled to summary judgment. However, Mrs. Deluca testified that Officer Moore shoved her with two hands which may reasonably be inferred to be an intentional and offensive contact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because I find that there is a genuine issue of fact as to Officer Moore's intent and the surrounding circumstances in which Mrs. Deluca was touched, summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (Count III)\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    A.

Plaintiffs argue that the Defendant's violated this right when they ordered the Plaintiffs to leave the area, threatened to arrest them for refusal to leave, and used physical force.

In\n   <em>\n    Weston W.\n   </em>\n   , the restriction imposed on the plaintiff's right to travel was a curfew requiring that minors be at home between the hours of 11 PM and 5 AM. In the present case, the infringement imposed on Plaintiffs was an order to leave a public area. An order requesting a person to leave a public area imposes a much less significant restriction on a person's right to travel than a curfew prohibiting a person's ability to move from a particular location for six hours.\n   <em>\n    Weston W.\n   </em>\n   is therefore readily distinguishable from this case and not sufficient to put officers on notice that the alleged conduct violated the Plaintiffs right to travel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Plaintiffs also point to\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Therefore, at the very most, this decision shows that the right to travel\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   include a person's right to stand in a public area for a brief moment of time.

The Deluca's were walking on Causeway Street after the Bruins had won a playoff game with thousands of other fans. Additionally, there are a large number of bars, which are particularly busy during sporting events, located around the area of Causeway Street. Many people drink during sporting events and people's emotions run high especially during playoffs. Even assuming that the Defendants were not specifically ordered to keep the area by the Ace Tickets Window clear, police officers\n   have a duty to maintain public safety, which includes controlling the crowd.

Mass. 1994). This case is distinguishable from the present matter because the court's decision came after a jury had determined that the defendant had only acted negligently. Here, there are facts in the present case that may permit a reasonable juror to infer that the Defendants acted with bad faith and not negligence therefore, the issue should be submitted to the jury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The Defendant's argument that Mrs. Deluca was not placed in apprehension of an offensive touching because she did not see Officer Moore approach does not change the outcome of this motion. Because the Court finds that there is evidence to support an assault and battery based on an attempted battery, apprehension is not required.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Guzman v.
