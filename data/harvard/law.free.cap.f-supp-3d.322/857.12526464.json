Instead, Alvarado-Velasquez remained in custody pursuant to a detainer issued by the Immigration and Custom Enforcement (\"ICE\") agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This turn of events prompted Alvarado-Velasquez to file a Motion to Dismiss With Prejudice (Doc. No. 19), in which he relied on cases like\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ventura\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205129012\">\n    2017 WL 5129012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y.

Sept. 20, 2013) that discussed the interplay between the BRA and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (\"INA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and held that there is no ICE detainer exception to the BRA. As the court in\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   The Government cannot and should not have it both ways. The United States Attorney's Office and ICE/DHS [Department of Homeland Security] are part of one Executive Branch. As such, the Executive Branch should decide where its priorities lie: either with a prosecution in federal district court or with removal of the deportable alien. Courts \"addressing the possibility of deportation during a criminal prosecution have explained that the Executive Branch has two choices when an alien unlawfully present in the United States after prior removal is facing criminal prosecution: The DHS may proceed administratively with deportation, or defer removal for the alien to face criminal prosecution.\" ... What the Government cannot do is \"proceed on a dual criminal prosecution and deportation track[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205129012\">\n    2017 WL 5129012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (internal citations omitted). (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 3, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response to the requested dismissal with prejudice, the Government primarily relied upon\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hernandez-Hernandez\n   </em>\n   , Slip op. 18-cr-00030 (EAW)(JJM) (W.D.N.Y. April 23, 2018), an unpublished Report and Recommendation. There, the Magistrate Judge \"perceive[d] no 'clear and manifest' intention by Congress supportive of defendant's position that the Bail Reform Act supersedes ICE's independent statutory authority under the INA to detain [a defendant]\", and recommended a finding that ICE detention in\n   such circumstances did not violate the BRA, at least where there is no evidence that it took \"the defendant into administrative custody for purposes of delivering him for criminal trial or to avoid the pretrial release provisions of the\" BRA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 27, 2018, the Court held a hearing on Alvarado-Velasquez's Motion to Dismiss, and afforded the parties an opportunity to file supplemental briefs. On August 3, 2018, in conjunction with the filing of its supplemental brief, the Government filed a Motion to Dismiss Without Prejudice (Doc. No. 28), asserting that Alvarado-Velasquez's removal was in process. Shortly thereafter, \"in an abundance of caution,\" Alvarado-Velasquez filed a response, again requesting that any dismissal be with prejudice. (Doc. No. 29 at 1). Less than a week later, and before the Court could rule on the pending Motions to Dismiss, the Government filed a Notice indicating \"that the defendant was flown from the United States to Guatemala on Thursday, August 9, 2018\" and he \"has, therefore, been removed from the United States.\" (Doc. No. 30 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   With Alvarado-Velasquez no longer in the country and outside this Court's jurisdiction, the only remaining question is whether dismissal of the Indictment should be with or without prejudice. This is purely an academic exercise if Defendant remains outside the United States. Nevertheless, because (1) the Government has filed its Motion under Rule 48(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ; and (2) Defendant has been returned to Guatemala thereby undercutting the suggestion that ICE detained him for purposes of the criminal trial, the Court will dismiss this case without prejudice. Furthermore, by objecting to the Government's Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice, Defendant has likely preserved the issue should he later return to the United States and be re-indicted on the same charges,\n   <em>\n    U.S v.
