Here, plaintiff alleges that Mott's LLP (\"Mott's\"), a subsidiary of Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (collectively, \"defendants\"), employed deceptive labeling and marketing practices in selling its applesauce products. Plaintiff requests an order \"directing Defendants to disgorge the profits obtained from each sale of the [applesauce] Products in the District of Columbia\" and establishing a community fund \"for the benefit of the general public\" into which Mott's is to pay \"all monies which it has been required to disgorge.\" Compl. at 23.

Courts in this district recognize disgorgement as an \"integrated claim\" in which plaintiffs have a \"common and undivided interest.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v.

The Court finds that they have based on the evidence submitted to the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   a. The Unredacted Version of the Stephenson Declaration shall be Sealed\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants submitted a declaration by Kelly Stephenson (the \"Stephenson Declaration\"), the Director of Brand Marketing at Mott's. In fact, defendants docketed two versions of this declaration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 16-2, 17-2. The version attached as an exhibit to defendants' response to the present motion to remand has a portion of paragraph 6 redacted, as it contains highly confidential business information. However, defendants attached an unredacted version of the same declaration to an Unopposed Motion to File the Confidential Declaration of Kelly Stephenson Under Seal [ECF No. 17]. The Court finds the unredacted version as properly sealed and, thus, defendants' motion will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   b. The Stephenson Declaration Demonstrates that the Amount in Controversy Requirement is Met\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Based on the Stephenson Declaration, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the profits from the applesauce products sold in the District of Columbia exceed $75,000. Mr. Stephenson declares that \"the aggregate sales of the Applesauce Products in Washington, DC between May 2014 and May 2017 are estimated to have exceeded $5,300,000.\" Confidential Decl. of Kelly Stephenson \u00b6 4, ECF 16-2. Furthermore, Mr. Stephenson attests that, based on his personal knowledge, the profits on these sales well exceeded $75,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. The Court has no reason to doubt Mr. Stephenson's sworn declaration and plaintiff provides no contradictory evidence. The Court, therefore, finds that the amount in controversy requirement is met and the case is properly removable to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, plaintiff's Motion to Remand [ECF No. 15] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   The Unopposed Motion to File the Confidential Declaration of Kelly Stephenson Under Seal [ECF No. 17] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   An order consistent with this holding accompanies this opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
