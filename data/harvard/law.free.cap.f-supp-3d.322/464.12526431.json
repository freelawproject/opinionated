Of these, all but the CIA have proceeded in this litigation by identifying responsive records and determining whether particular records are properly withheld pursuant to one or more FOIA exemptions. To the extent these three agencies have declined to produce records, summary judgment briefing is underway as to whether the claims of withholding are justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The CIA, however, pursuant to its customary practice, has issued a \"\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response,\" in which it refused to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records on the ground that to do so would itself reveal information (the existence of a CIA intelligence interest in the Raid and/or CIA operational involvement in it) which FOIA protects from disclosure. The ACLU and CIA have now cross-moved for summary judgment on the propriety of the CIA's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response. The ACLU argues that the White House's statements,\n   per Spicer, about the Raid (and earlier statements by CIA officials regarding its interest in Yemen generally) constitute an official acknowledgment of its interest in the Yemen Raid that precludes the CIA from relying on the instant\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response. The ACLU also argues that a substantive response to its FOIA requests would not reveal the CIA's operational involvement in the Raid. The CIA argues that the\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response was proper. For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees with the ACLU that the White House's statements sufficiently acknowledged a CIA interest in the Raid as to preclude the CIA's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response as formulated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Air Raid in Yemen\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 29, 2017, the US conducted an \"intelligence-gathering raid\" in al Ghayil, Yemen. One service member and an unspecified number of civilians died. According to news reports cited by the ACLU, in anticipation of the Raid, President Trump declared the area around al Ghayil, Yemen, a temporary \"area of hostilities.\" This designation exempted the Raid from existing policy guidance that limited, in the interest of minimizing civilian casualties, the circumstances under which such a raid can lawfully be conducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the days that followed, White House Press Secretary Spicer three times fielded questions at press briefings about the Raid. Because their content is central to this dispute, and particularly to whether there was an official acknowledgement of the CIA's interest in the Raid, and if so what the scope was of that acknowledgement, the Court quotes them in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 31, 2017, the following exchange occurred during Spicer's daily press briefing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Q (Reporter):\n   </strong>\n   Thanks, Sean. Just following up again about the strike over the weekend in Yemen. Can you confirm that the eight-year-old-the reports that the eight-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in that strike? And if you can address sort of the killing of the American citizen in this anti-terrorism operation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    MR. SPICER:\n   </strong>\n   I'm not going to go any further than what the Department of Defense has released. Obviously, we recovered a tremendous amount of information, and we killed an estimated 14 members of al Qaeda in-AQAP individuals. And then we suffered the loss of life of a service member, and four people were injured. That's as far as I'm willing to go at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dkt. 37 (\"Daikun Decl.\"), Ex. 6 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 2, 2017, during a daily press briefing, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Q (Reporter):\n   </strong>\n   On Yemen, it was initially described, the raid over the weekend, as a successful raid by the administration. There are now some questions and comments raised about the possibility of additional civilian casualties. So I've got a couple of questions for you on this one. Would you still stand by your characterization of the raid as \"successful\"? Was the President given multiple options about this raid, or just one? And were there consultations with the prior\n   administration's national security officials, military officials about the raid moving forward?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    MR. SPICER:\n   </strong>\n   Thank you. Actually, I'd like to just walk through that. I appreciate you bringing this up. There is-let's go through the tick-tock on that raid. On November 7th, CENTCOM submitted the plan to DOD. Clearly, that was under the last administration. Legal teams were involved immediately when it was submitted to DOD. On December 19th, the plan was approved by the Department of Defense and recommended that it be moved ahead. It was sent then to the National Security Council staff here in the White House. Again, this all happened under the previous administration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 6th, there was an interagency deputies meeting. The deputies recommended at that time that they go ahead. It was so easily approved it was sent straight up. The conclusion to hold was, at that time, to hold for what they called a \"moonless night,\" which, by calendar, wouldn't occur until then-President-elect Trump was President Trump.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 24th, shortly after taking office, Secretary of Defense-then Mattis [sic] read the memo, resent it back up to the White House conveying his support. On the 25th of January, the President was briefed by General Flynn on Secretary Mattis's recommendation and the status of the operation, or potential operation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The President asked to see Secretary Mattis and Joint Chiefs [sic] of Staff Dunford. He then, on that evening, had a dinner meeting, which included the President, the Vice President, Secretary Mattis, Chairman Dunford, Chief of Staff Priebus, Jared Kushner, Chief Strategist Bannon, General Kellogg, General Flynn, and CIA Director Pompeo where the operation was laid out in great extent. The indication at that time was to go ahead on Friday the 26\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   In the morning, the deputies committee met again. It was not a necessary step because they had previously recommended and also reaffirmed their support for that. On January 26th, the President signed the memo authorizing the action. So it was a very-not only was it a very, very though-out [sic] process by this administration, it had started back on November 7th in terms of-clearly well before that, but it was a move forward by CENTCOM on November 7th. This was a very, very well thought-out and executed effort.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Q:\n   </strong>\n   Where was the President the night of the raid? How did he learn about Chief Owens's death? And do you still stand by your characterization that it was successful?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    MR. SPICER:\n   </strong>\n   The President was here in the residence. He was kept in touch with his national security staff. Secretary Mattis and others had kept him updated on both the raid and the death of Chief Owens, as well as the four other individuals that were injured. So he was kept apprised of the situation throughout the evening.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   And again, I think-I would go back to what I said yesterday: It's hard to ever call something a complete success when you have the loss of life, or people injured. But I think when you look at the totality of what was gained to prevent the future loss of life here in America and against our people and our institutions, and probably throughout the world in terms of what some of these individuals could have done, I think it is a successful operation by all standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   And again, I want to reiterate, it is tough to ever use the word \"success\" when you know that somebody has lost their life. But when you go back and\n   look at an individual that dedicated their life to serving this country, and went over and over and over again knowing that this not only the risk that he took but wanted to do it because he knew the threat that these kind of individuals pose to our country and to our people, that's-while not a success that you lost to [sic] him, you know that he died in sacrifice for someone else here in this nation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Daikun Decl., Ex. 5 at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, on February 7, 2017, during a daily press briefing, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Q (Reporter):\n   </strong>\n   I have a question for you, Sean, though, on Yemen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    MR.

And do you still stand by your characterization that it was a successful raid?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    MR. SPICER:\n   </strong>\n   Absolutely. That-he was not-that was-the raid that was conducted in Yemen was an intelligence-gathering raid. That's what it was. It was highly successful. It achieved the purpose it was going to get-save the loss of life that we suffered and the injuries that occurred. The goal-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Q:\n   </strong>\n   So you're pushing back on reporting that he was a target?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    MR.

Petraeus addressed \"[p]olitical unrest in Yemen [that] has helped AQAP co-opt local tribes and extend its influence.\" He explained that \"counterterrorism cooperation with Yemen has, in fact, improved,\" and that \"we clearly have to intensify our collaboration and deny AQAP the safe haven that it seeks to establish.\" Dkt. 48 (\"Second Diakun Decl.\"), Ex. 4 at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On February 26, 2014, speaking at the President's Associates Dinner at the University of Oklahoma, then-CIA Director John O. Brennan identified the activities of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (\"AQAP\") in Yemen as a one of the \"challenges that cause us the greatest concern.\" Second Diakun Decl., Ex. 3 at 3. The ACLU alleges that AQAP was the target of the Raid at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On March 13, 2015, speaking before the Council on Foreign Relations, Brennan explained that CIA analysts \"monitor[ ] developments\" in a number of \"hotspots,\" including Yemen.

In support, the CIA filed a declaration by Antoinette Shiner, an Information Review Officer at the CIA's Litigation Information Review Office. Dkt. 44 (\"Shiner Decl.\"). There, Shiner explained why the CIA viewed a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response as justified consistent with FOIA Exemptions One and Three.

The ACLU contends that the White House's statements by Spicer at the press briefings reviewed above represent an \"official acknowledgment\" of the CIA's intelligence interest in the Raid. Therefore, the ACLU argues, the CIA may not proceed by means of a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response to the FOIA request, but must instead (like DoD, Justice, and State) review its responsive records to determine, and report on the merits, whether disclosure of these is protected by one or more FOIA exemptions. The CIA-while not disputing that the White House's statements are attributable to the CIA-disputes that these statements constitute an official acknowledgment of such a nature as to preclude a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court's analysis begins by reviewing the two most apposite decisions, each applying the official acknowledgement doctrine in the context of drone strikes: the D.C.

It reasoned that, given the \"acknowledgments that the United States ha[d] participated in drone strikes, it [was] neither logical nor plausible for the CIA to maintain that it would reveal anything not already in the public domain to say that the Agency at least ha[d] an intelligence interest in such strikes.

It noted that: (1) the FOIA requests at issue were not \"limited to drones operated by the CIA,\" and (2) the CIA had offered \"no reason to believe that disclosing whether it has any documents at all about drone strikes [would] reveal whether the Agency itself-as opposed to some other U.S. entity such as the Defense Department-operates drones.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In particular, Spicer explicitly acknowledged that the U.S. participated in the Yemen Raid; that the Raid was an \"intelligence-gathering raid\"; and that the Director of the Central\n   <em>\n    Intelligence\n   </em>\n   Agency (explicitly referred to by his official title) was in the room when the Raid was \"laid out in great extent\" and at a time when \"the indication ... was to go ahead.\" Under any reasonable reading, these statements revealed the CIA's intelligence interest in the Raid, a point further underscored by the CIA's prior acknowledgement of its intelligence interest in Yemen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    710 F.3d at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" 'There comes a point where ...

First, as in\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   , none of the ACLU's five requests here have asked the CIA to turn over records related to the CIA's operational role in the Raid. Indeed, none ask the CIA to yield documents related to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   agency's operational role. The requests instead are for documents regarding the legal and policy basis for the Raid, the processes involved in the Raid's approval, and after-action assessments of the Raid's outcome. Second, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that a response by the CIA revealing the existence of records responsive to such requests otherwise might have tended to reveal that the CIA had a hand in the operation of the Raid, on the facts here, no such inference would arise. That is because Spicer's statement acknowledged that other agencies-most relevant, the Department of Defense, a unit of government with obvious military and intelligence operational capabilities-were involved in the Raid. It therefore is not plausible or logical to claim that disclosing the possession by the CIA of responsive documents regarding the Raid would be reasonably expected to reveal that the CIA in particular carried out, or had the operational capability to carry out, this mission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   To the extent that the CIA argues that Spicer's statements do not themselves reveal the agency's possession of one or more records relating to the Raid, that argument does not carry the day, because the attendant circumstances compel the inference that the agency possesses some such records. As in\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   , where the D.C. Circuit held it \"implausible that the CIA d[id] not possess a single document on the\n   subject of drone strikes,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    710 F.3d at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Spicer's statements admitting the CIA's intelligence interest in the Raid-and the CIA's multiple earlier acknowledgments of its broader intelligence interest in Yemen-make the inference unavoidable that the CIA has, at a minimum, some records related to the Raid. It is not logical or plausible to claim otherwise. According to Spicer, the Raid was \"highly successful\" in achieving its \"intelligence-gathering\" mission and resulted in the loss of an American life. The Court is unprepared to accept that the CIA Director attended the meeting with the President in which that Raid was discussed and appears to have been approved, but that neither he nor his staff ever generated or received any documentation whatsoever (even in the form of a calendar entry or preparatory paperwork) related to that meeting or the Raid before, during, or after these occurred. Taking the White House press secretary's statements regarding the Raid at face value, the only rational inference is that the CIA must possess at least some records related to the Raid as to which the CIA Director was personally briefed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The CIA next argues that an agency can lose its ability to provide a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response only \"when the existence or nonexistence of the particular\n   <em>\n    records\n   </em>\n   covered by the\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response has been officially and publicly disclosed.\" CIA Reply at 8 (emphasis in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wilner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5686855\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/60/#p69\">\n    592 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   70 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   CIA Br. at 21-22.

Thus, for example, in\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held-without a more particularized inquiry into whether the existence of records responsive to specific FOIA requests had been revealed-that, in light of the CIA's public statements, its justifications for its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response \"evaporate[d].\"\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5898726\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/100/\">\n    756 F.3d at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That principle applies here: The heart of the CIA's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response is that a response on the merits would reveal the CIA's intelligence interest in the Raid. The White House's statements, however, have effectively acknowledged such an interest, vitiating the\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Finally, the CIA argues that the ACLU's FOIA request should be denied because the classified information sought by the ACLU is more specific in nature than the information Spicer disclosed. It asks the Court to uphold its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response on the basis of the test articulated in\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. CIA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3487083\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/171/#p186\">\n    586 F.3d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186 (2d Cir. 2009), with respect to the\n   tailoring required between a FOIA request for classified information and the prior official disclosures of that information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   test asks whether the information requested by the plaintiff \"matches\" the information previously disclosed, and is generally used to determine whether an agency has waived its ability to invoke a particular FOIA exemption. The Second Circuit has recently called into question how strictly the\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   test is to be applied in practice,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5898726\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/100/\">\n    756 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   120 n.19, and the ACLU argues that the test has been supplanted entirely by the \"logical and plausible\" standard discussed in\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court, however, need not address that question here. In the context of \"official acknowledgments,\" as in the context of determining the applicability of a FOIA exemption more generally, \"the government retains the burden of persuasion that [the] information [sought] is not subject to disclosure under FOIA.\"\n   <em>\n    Inner City Press/Cmty. on the Move v.

Neither\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   , in similarly rejecting as implausible the justifications for\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   responses by the CIA, separately considered\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the CIA does not cite any case applying\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   to preclude a merits response to a FOIA request where the agency's justifications for the\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response at issue have been held implausible. As discussed below, the Court will give CIA the opportunity to submit a new and more tailored\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response to the ACLU's FOIA request. In the event of such a response, the Court may then have occasion to consider\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   's application. The Court therefore rejects the CIA's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The ACLU's competing motion presents a more complex question. The ACLU asks for entry of summary judgment in its favor, so as to now require the CIA-like DoD, Justice, and State-to either produce responsive records or produce a\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index identifying those records that are properly withheld pursuant to a FOIA exemption. This familiar procedure was followed by the panels in both\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    710 F.3d at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5898726\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/100/\">\n    756 F.3d at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court's judgment, however, is that the wiser course in this case is to give the CIA an opportunity first to assess whether a more targeted\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   submission may viably be made. The Court has rejected\n   the CIA's capacious\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   theory, that a substantive response could reveal the CIA's intelligence interest in the Raid, because that interest has been acknowledged. But as the CIA notes in the course of making its argument based on\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , a number of the ACLU's document requests seek much more specific (and comprehensive) data and records than revealed by Press Secretary Spicer's broad pronouncements. A substantive FOIA response to some of these requests possibly might tend to reveal information covered by FOIA Exemptions One and Three. For example, the ACLU's third request seeks records that pertain to \"[t]he process by which the decision was made to designate three parts of Yemen as 'areas of active hostilities.' \" However, on the record at hand, the CIA has not officially acknowledged that it or any other agency ever designated any part of Yemen as an \"area of active hostilities\"; a merits response to that request might reveal more than what Spicer's statements acknowledged. FOIA requests one, four and five similarly appear amenable, potentially, to valid\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   tailored to those specific requests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will therefore give the CIA a second chance to supply a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response with respect to requests one, three, four, and five. The Court therefore denies the ACLU's motion for summary judgment as to those FOIA requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   FOIA request two, however, is different. It asks for records that pertain to: \"[t]he process by which the government approved the al Ghayil Raid, including which individuals possessed decision-making authority and the evidentiary standard by which the factual evidence was evaluated to support the determination.\" As to that request, Spicer's statements put CIA Director Pompeo in the proverbial \"room where it happened.\" Spicer revealed that Pompeo participated in the \"process by which the government approved the al Ghayil Raid\"-Pompeo, Spicer stated, was present when the Raid was \"laid out in great extent\" and at the time when \"the indication ... was to go ahead.\" The CIA is at liberty of course to claim, on the merits, that records responsive to this request are sheltered by one or more FOIA exemptions.
