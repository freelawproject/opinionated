Michael Goodson (collectively, \"Crestek\"), challenge the Internal Revenue Service's response to their Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, requests for 22 categories of documents related to their income tax liabilities from 2006 to 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.

It also disputes many withholdings and redactions that the IRS made under FOIA's exemptions for documents that would not otherwise be available to private parties in litigation and for law enforcement information that could reasonably be expected to compromise a confidential source or to risk circumvention of the law by disclosing investigatory techniques and procedures.

Neither of\n   these challenges to the Inman Declaration's credibility has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Crestek also challenges the Spatz Declaration's credibility for two reasons.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , it complains that Spatz relied on others to identify responsive records and that this was unreasonable since he identified responsive records that others did not find.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. But the Spatz Declaration-and Crestek's observation that Mr. Spatz identified responsive records that others overlooked-shows that he did not simply rely on others. Spatz Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Crestek challenges the Supplemental Spatz Declaration's credibility because it references Ms. Inman's voicemail without explaining how he would have personal knowledge of it.

Crestek argued that the IRS had not shown all the documents to be predecisional since the IRS did not state when each document was written or when the relevant decisions took place. Opp. to Mot. Summary J. 8-9. Crestek also argued that the IRS had not shown all the documents to be deliberative since the IRS had not identified the author and recipient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Crestek did not specify which of its arguments applied to which of the IRS's withholdings and redactions under the deliberative process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The IRS responded to Crestek's challenge with a supplemental declaration that established the applicability of the deliberative process privilege to 15 of the 168 groups of records at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Spatz Decl. I. The supplemental declaration clarified why 46 groups of records were predecisional.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. But the IRS identified the author and recipient of only 15 of the records that it showed to be predecisional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Spatz Decl. 19 (Items 1-3), 20 (Items 3-4), 27 (Item 3), 28 (Items 6-7), 36 (Items 3-4), 38 (Item 3), 39 (Items 2-3 and 5), 41 (Item 1). Because the IRS did not show that the remaining 153 groups of records were both predecisional and deliberative, I ordered the IRS to produce these records or submit another supplemental declaration explaining the basis for its withholdings. ECF # 38 (May 14, 2018 Order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The IRS responded to my order by producing 1,247 pages of responsive records without deliberative process redactions and submitting a supplemental declaration to justify its withholding of the 186 pages that remained at issue. Supp. Spatz Decl. II \u00b6\u00b6 8-10. Crestek's response to the supplemental declaration raises three final concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Crestek expresses concern about the declaration's statement that \"the IRS Appeals Office uses alternative dispute resolution techniques to promote agreement, and the ordinary prohibitions against ex parte communications between IRS Appeals Officers and other IRS employees do not apply to Fast Track.\" Pls.' Opp. to Supp. Spatz Decl. II 1 (quoting Supp. Spatz Decl. II \u00b6 12). Crestek speculates that any ex parte communications that took place \"would not properly be a part of the IRS deliberative process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IRS has clarified that it redacted six emails reflecting the content of ex parte communications under the deliberative process privilege. Supp. Spatz Decl. III \u00b6 9. These communications were about whether the issues in Crestek's case were suitable for Fast Track settlement and about how the IRS might withdraw the Fast Track application if it wished.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. They were predecisional and deliberative because they helped the IRS decide whether to pursue a Fast Track settlement or withdraw the Fast Track application. Crestek did not renew its opposition to the withholding of these communications after the IRS described their contents, and in any event I find that the IRS has adequately proven their privileged status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mapother\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724300,10518583\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/3/1533/\">\n    3 F.3d at 1537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that Exemption 5 applies to documents that are both predecisional and deliberative).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Crestek challenges the IRS's redactions to six pages of emails. It notes that the redactions protect discussions\n   about the effect of a request for assistance that Crestek made to the Taxpayer Advocate Office, and it asserts that these discussions have no connection to the IRS's deliberations about Crestek's tax liability. Pls.' Opp. to Supp. Spatz Decl. II 2. But the IRS explains that the discussions do have a connection to the IRS's deliberative process. Because the Taxpayer Advocate Office has significant power over IRS employees and can require them to take an action permitted by law, to refrain from taking any action, or to stop any action under way, Crestek's request for assistance caused \"serious uncertainty\" about the next steps for Crestek's case. Supp. Spatz Decl. III \u00b6 10. So the IRS exam team discussed \"what the IRS could do in the Crestek audit while it was uncertain whether the Taxpayer Advocate Office would intervene\" in the team's denial of Crestek's Application for Fast Track Settlement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. These are deliberations that preceded a decision about what next steps the team should take, and they enjoy the protection of the deliberative process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Crestek challenges the adequacy of Paragraph 27 of the IRS's second supplemental declaration because the IRS \"does not provide the identifying names of the individuals claimed to be the IRS Counsel who engaged in communications.\" Pls.' Opp. to Supp. Spatz Decl. II 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the IRS has not claimed that any of the redactions and withholdings in question protect communications in which an IRS counsel participated. Spatz Decl. II \u00b6 27. The IRS describes the records as entries in Appeals Officer Koprowski's Case Activity Record that reflect her conversations with Tax Computation Specialist Jen Xenakis and two drafts of a statutory notice of deficiency with handwritten annotations believed to have been made by Ms. Koprowski.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Crestek is right that the IRS has not provided the names of any IRS counsel related to these records. But that does not undermine the IRS's claim of privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After several rounds of briefing, four declarations, and extensive production, the parties have narrowed their disputes about the deliberative process privilege down to three issues. None of the Crestek's arguments about these issues has merit. So I will grant the IRS's motion for summary judgment on its redactions and withholdings under the deliberative process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Although it might be possible to produce the entries made on a form while redacting the form itself, such a production would necessarily reveal information about the structure of the form and the types of information that the form treats as relevant to a law enforcement decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Crestek's Sur-Reply also argues, without citation to authority, that the public interest in its FOIA request \"outweighs the deliberative process privilege and enforcement privileges\" asserted by the IRS.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4-6. This appears to be an invitation to set FOIA's exemptions aside in evaluating Crestek's FOIA claims. If Crestek intends to argue that the public interest is a factor under FOIA Exemptions 5, 7(D), and 7(E), it has forfeited this argument by failing to brief it adequately.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Schneider v.
