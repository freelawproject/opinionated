(ECF No. 33). For the reasons discussed below, the Court denies Defendant's motion to dismiss the Information and Defendant's request for an alternative remedial measure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 24, 2017, Defendant drove a vehicle to the United States Border Patrol Checkpoint on Highway 86 near Westmorland, California. At the checkpoint, Defendant remained in his car while an agent conducted a primary canine inspection with a drug detection dog. The dog alerted to Defendant's vehicle, which was then sent to the secondary inspection area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the secondary inspection area, a border patrol agent asked Defendant for consent to search his vehicle. Defendant responded \"yes.\" During the second canine inspection, after Defendant had exited his vehicle, the dog again alerted to Defendant's vehicle. Upon further inspection, which involved removing the bed of the pickup truck, agents eventually found packages of methamphetamine floating in the vehicle's gas tank. Upon speaking with a DEA special agent, Defendant admitted that he was paid to cross the vehicle into the United States and understood that he was transporting narcotics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant was arrested on October 24, 2017, with his initial appearance on October 25, 2017. (ECF No.1). On December 5, 2017, the Government filed the Information against Defendant, charging him with one count of possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). (ECF No. 12). On January 23, 2018, Defendant sent the Government a discovery request letter. (ECF No. 38). On February 2, 2018, the Court ordered the Government, pending final judgment, to preserve evidence, including any video footage of the vehicle's approach and detention at the checkpoint. (ECF No. 24). On February 9, 2018, Defendant moved for discovery relating to the Highway 86 checkpoint video. (ECF No. 25). The Government responded that the checkpoint video was no longer available and had likely been overwritten in December, approximately 45 days after Defendant's arrest. (ECF No. 27). According to Border Patrol Agent Marc Lieberman, Customs and Border Protection policy provide for a minimum thirty-day retention period for video from the Highway 86 Checkpoint. (ECF No. 30). The amount of time that video is retained depends on the\n   system's storage capacity because video recordings are set up to record until the memory is full, at which point the video begins to record over the oldest recorded video data.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Typically, this re-recoding occurs every 4-6 weeks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Video cannot be preserved unless manually downloaded before the desired footage is recorded over.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant now moves to dismiss the Information, asserting a violation of due process for the destruction of the video recording at the checkpoint. Alternatively, Defendant asks the Court to take alternative remedial measures by drawing an adverse inference that the video would not have supported the Government's view of any contested events at the checkpoint.

Further, when the defense contacted one of the government agents, reiterating defendants' claims of the legitimate purpose of the laboratory and demanding the return of the seized equipment, \"[e]ven though he knew the equipment would be destroyed, [the agent] responded that it was being held as evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11647284\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/928/#p931\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11647284\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/928/#p931\">\n    at 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, the Court does not have evidence before it that indicates that the potential exculpatory value of the checkpoint video was apparent to government agents and that the agents allowed the video to be overwritten in bad faith.

No facts indicate that, prior to the video being overwritten, anyone called into question the circumstances surrounding the checkpoint inspection and Defendant's arrest, such that government agents should have known to inspect and preserve the checkpoint video. Further, even in the absence of probable cause, a vehicle may still be searched pursuant to consent.\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073624\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/1086/#p1095\">\n    726 F.3d at 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, even assuming that government agents should have known about the legal significance of video footage of a canine inspection potentially undermining the basis for probable cause in a suppression hearing, because Defendant purportedly gave his consent for the vehicle search during secondary inspection, providing an alternative to probable cause as the basis for the search, it would not be apparent to government agents that the checkpoint video would have potentially exculpatory value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Zaragoza-Moreira\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   , the Court does not have evidence before it that would allow it to infer an intent by government agents to suppress evidence with potentially exculpatory value. Here, there are no allegations of conduct by government agents that approach\n   <em>\n    Zaragoza-Moreira\n   </em>\n   's deliberate omission of references to defendant's claims of duress in reports and the probable cause statement or\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   's false statement assuring defense counsel that the equipment was being held as evidence when the agent knew the equipment was about to be shipped to a toxic waste dump. Instead, the checkpoint video appears to have been preserved for a minimum of thirty days, in accordance with Customs and Border Protection's video retention policy for the Highway 86 Checkpoint, and then overwritten based on the system's storage capacity. Absent additional allegations of misconduct by government agents, the Court does not find bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Next, in evaluating prejudice to the accused, courts consider \"the centrality of the evidence to the case and its importance in establishing the elements of the crime or the motive or intent of the defendant; the probative value and reliability of the secondary or substitute evidence; the nature and probable weight of factual inferences or other demonstrations and kinds of proof allegedly lost to the accused; [and] the probable effect on the jury from absence of the evidence, including dangers of unfounded speculation and bias that might result to the defendant if adequate presentation of the case requires explanation about the missing evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1173-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, the checkpoint video was lost while in the Government's custody. The video was likely overwritten around the same time as the Information was filed. The Court record at this point does not contain evidence as to the reliability of the dog. If there are serious questions as to the dog's reliability, it may have been negligent to not preserve the video. But the Court can not make that determination on the present record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Turning to prejudice against Defendant, as the Court already laid out in its Due Process discussion, the video had potential exculpatory value and was of such a nature that Defendant would not be able to obtain comparable evidence. If Defendant intends to challenge the basis for probable cause of the search that led to the discovery of the packages of methamphetamine, absent the video, he has no substitute evidence to challenge the Government's testimony of the circumstances surrounding the search of his vehicle and his arrest. The prejudice to Defendant is significant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Therefore, the Court denies without prejudice the Defendant's proposed remedial measure, that is, drawing an adverse inference that the video would not have supported the Government's view of any contested events at the checkpoint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

These videos are particularly significant in the context of checkpoint searches, where defendants are often inside their vehicles and unaware of what is happening outside. Even when defendants have an opportunity to observe searches outside of their vehicle, they may not fully appreciate conduct that undermines the basis for a probable cause to search. Allowing the destruction of these videos, with no knowledge of their content, often deprives defendants of the best means to challenge the Government's version of the circumstances surrounding a dog search and alert, extinguishing any meaningful opportunity for defendants to mount a complete defense. Therefore, the Court puts the Government on notice that such checkpoint videos capturing the circumstances surrounding a dog search must be preserved. Failure to do so hereafter may support a future finding of bad faith. Defendant may renew his request for a remedial measure as the record is developed at a suppression hearing and at trial.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The Court will address the question of whether any exculpatory value of the checkpoint video was apparent before it was destroyed in conjunction with its bad faith discussion, as the two issues dovetail and \"turn on whether any exculpatory value of evidence ... was apparent to the government agents.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
