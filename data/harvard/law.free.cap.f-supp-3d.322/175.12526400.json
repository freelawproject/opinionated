COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Andrea Richardson, a transgender woman, claims that she was sexually assaulted by her male cellmate while incarcerated in the District of Columbia jail-specifically, its Central Detention Facility in Southeast D.C. She brought this lawsuit against the District and several jail officials alleging that they failed to protect her from the assault. The defendants have moved for summary judgment on some of her claims, including her claim that the jail officials violated the Eighth Amendment by acting with deliberate indifference toward the risk of her assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Richardson's Eighth Amendment claim names, as defendants, Warden William Smith in his individual and official capacities and several unknown jail officials designated as \"John Does I-X.\" Richardson concedes that because she did not identify the John Doe defendants during discovery, her Eighth Amendment claim against them should be dismissed without prejudice. As for Warden Smith: The undisputed facts concerning his role in the alleged assault show that he did not violate Richardson's clearly established constitutional rights. He is therefore entitled to qualified immunity in his individual capacity. And Richardson has offered no evidence that a District policy or practice of ignoring inmates' concerns about the risk of assault caused the purported Eighth Amendment violation here, as would be required to support her official-capacity claim against Smith. The Court will therefore grant summary judgment on Richardson's Eighth Amendment claim. And because that is her sole federal claim, the Court will remand the rest of the case to the District of Columbia Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Thus, no reasonable jury could find that he had subjective knowledge of Glover's particular risk of sexual assault and kept Richardson in his cell notwithstanding that knowledge, as would be required to support a determination of deliberate indifference under her first theory of liability. As to Richardson's allegation that Smith maintained a hostile environment that contributed to her risk of being assaulted, she has offered no evidence that Smith ever observed or otherwise had knowledge of said environment, and it is well established that a plaintiff may not hold a supervisor liable under \u00a7 1983 based solely on his status as a supervisor-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , under a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   theory of liability.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

It is undisputed that Smith played a limited role in the chain of events that led to Richardson's purported assault.

But she still must persuade the Court that, in 2014, Smith was on clear notice that the foregoing conduct and associated state of mind amounted to a constitutional violation. She cites no authority, nor is the Court is aware of any, that provided such notice. The right to be free from deliberate indifference to the risk of assault does not necessarily imply that Smith needed to categorically prevent transgender female inmates from being celled with male inmates who exhibited no particularized red flags when it came to sexual violence. And an officer in Smith's position could reasonably-not necessarily correctly, but reasonably-believe that the D.C. jail's system for housing transgender inmates properly balanced inmate safety against avoiding mandatory isolation of transgender inmates, especially because it is undisputed that the double-celling policy was enacted to mitigate the risk of suicide.

The Court disagrees. \"If a complaint alleging municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 may be read in a way that can support a claim for relief, thereby giving the defendant fair notice of the claim, that is sufficient\" to survive dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9320668,3720063\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/1302/\">\n    326 F.3d at 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There was fair notice here. For one, Richardson's complaint generally identified Warden Smith as a defendant in his individual and official capacities. Compl. at 1;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Her \u00a7 1983 claim in particular designates Warden Smith as a defendant and contains no language limiting him to his individual capacity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. And while the heart of Richardson's allegations may be that jail officials personally acted with deliberate indifference, the complaint can fairly be read as alleging that their indifference was driven by a widespread custom of the Department of Corrections. Specifically, Richardson alleges that Smith and the unknown guards failed to remove Glover from Richardson's cell after she \"repeatedly complained about his sexually aggressive comments and sexual assaults upon her.\" Compl. \u00b6 51.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   That allegation at least suggests that the District had adopted a custom of inaction in the face of inmates' expressed concerns about sexual assault. And when combined with her designation of Warden Smith as a defendant in his official capacity and the complaint's background factual allegations, the Court finds that the District was on notice that Richardson was raising a municipal-liability claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   But that does not mean that her municipal-liability claim survives summary judgment. For it to do so, the record would need to support a finding that (1) at least one official behaved with deliberate indifference toward the risk that Richardson would be sexually assaulted, and (2) the indifference was caused by the District of Columbia's policy, practice, or custom of failing to act on inmate's reported fears of assault. While the record read in the light most favorable to Richardson amply supports the first of these requirements,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   it does not support the second.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   All of the evidence regarding officials' failure to heed Richardson's complaints about Glover go to her particular case-the allegation being that, despite her pleas to several employees, she was not removed from Glover's cell. The Court can find no evidence suggesting that jail guards ignored complaints so routinely that it amounted to an official policy or custom or, relatedly, that a policymaking official had \"actual or constructive knowledge\" that the guards would \"probably violate constitutional rights\" and yet did nothing about it.\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

If there is any such proof in the record, Richardson has not pointed to it.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court will therefore grant the defendants' motion for partial summary judgment as to Count Four of the complaint, which alleges an Eighth Amendment violation. It will also dismiss Count Five given Richardson's consent to its dismissal. And, Count Four being her only federal claim, the Court will remand Richardson's remaining claims-Counts One, Two, and Three-to the District of Columbia Superior Court. A separate order accompanies this memorandum opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Richardson was sentenced to time served for misdemeanor second-degree theft around this time. But she was held at the jail after her sentencing because she was being investigated for a possible parole violation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    In the Court's view, the complaint's allegations\n    <em>\n     may have\n    </em>\n    supported another theory of municipal liability. Again, Richardson alleges that Smith failed \"to initiate a policy whereby transgender females would be housed in their own cells, an[d]/or housed with other transgenders or gay males and/or did not have a reasonable alternative to segregation that did not involve protective custody or solitary confinement in violation of PREA and in violation of Plaintiff's constitutional rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 52. As the Court explained, Smith himself is protected from this allegation by qualified immunity-no clearly established law required him to institute such policies. But that does not necessarily mean that the District's policies regarding transgender housing at the time of Richardson's alleged assault complied with the Eighth Amendment. Nevertheless, in defending against the contention that she did not state an official-capacity Eighth Amendment claim, Richardson focuses solely on the allegation that the District engaged in a policy or practice of turning a blind eye toward complaints about the risk of sexual assault.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 7, 26-27. The Court therefore considers her to have forfeited other routes of establishing municipal liability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Contrary to the District's argument, the Court's conclusion that Warden Smith is entitled to qualified immunity does not automatically defeat the first part of her official-capacity claim. In establishing that a municipality is liable for causing a constitutional violation, a plaintiff may rely on a predicate constitutional violation that has been dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity. And here, the record undoubtedly supports the existence of an Eighth Amendment claim against at least one official. Richardson testified that Glover made sexually aggressive comments toward her, that she told several guards and her case manager that she feared he would assault her, that her pleas were ignored, and that she was ultimately assaulted. That is deliberate indifference to a T.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
