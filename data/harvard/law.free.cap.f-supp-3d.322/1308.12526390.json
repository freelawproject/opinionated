Because Commerce did not address in its Final Issues and Decision Memorandum a particular argument the Coalition made in the brief it filed during the review, the court remands the surrogate value determination to Commerce for reconsideration of this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the Final Results, Commerce used import value data obtained from the Global Trade Atlas (\"GTA\") pertaining to plywood imports in Thailand (Thai Harmonized Tariff Schedule (\"Thai HTS\") subheading 4412.32.00-000) to value Senmao's plywood input.\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 41. Commerce calculated an average unit value (\"AUV\") for Thai imports from all countries other than those Commerce inferred to have benefited from export subsidies (India, Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand) and nonmarket economy countries (e.g., China and Vietnam).\n   <em>\n    See Prelim. I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 20. The six remaining source countries in the Thai import data were Finland, Germany, Malaysia, Russia, Taiwan, and the United States (with Germany representing a negligible quantity). The resulting AUV was the surrogate value Commerce applied to the plywood input, which was $96.53 per cubic meter.\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Coalition does not contest the Department's decision to use import data from Thailand, rather than data from another possible surrogate country, in determining the plywood surrogate value. Nor does the Coalition contest the decision to exclude the data from certain countries based on subsidization or status as a nonmarket economy country. The Coalition confines its claim to how Commerce used the GTA Thai import data, arguing that Commerce erred by not excluding from the AUV calculation the data on imports into Thailand from Taiwan and the United States, the data for each of which the Coalition characterizes as having an aberrationally low AUV. Coalition's Br. 8. The AUVs for the imports from Taiwan and the United States were $13 per cubic meter\n   and $23 per cubic meter, respectively.\n   <em>\n    See Coalition for American Hardwood Parity's Case Br.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 6 (Feb. 10, 2015) (P.R. Doc. 392) (\"\n   <em>\n    Coalition's Case Br.\n   </em>\n   \"). The Coalition submits that an AUV of $370 per cubic meter would have resulted were the imports from Taiwan and the United States excluded from the surrogate value calculation. Coalition's Br. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Coalition argues that the Thai AUV for plywood imports from Taiwan on a per-kilogram basis is less than the Thai AUVs for imports of wood chips or particles and for other sawdust, wood waste, and scrap.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Coalition's Br. 9;\n   <em>\n    see also Coalition's Case Br.\n   </em>\n   14. The Coalition argues, essentially, that wood chips or particles and other sawdust, wood waste, and scrap should be valued less than plywood, such that the Thai AUV for plywood imports from Taiwan must be aberrationally low. The Coalition asserts that the Thai AUV \"for non-coniferous wood scrap in the form of chips or particles\" is $0.0243 per kilogram and that the Thai AUV \"for other sawdust, wood waste, and scrap\" is $0.0805 per kg, while the Thai AUV for plywood from Taiwan, on a per-kilogram basis, is $0.0204 per kg. Coalition's Br. 9. The Coalition calculated this latter figure by converting the AUV for Taiwan of $13 per cubic meter to kilograms by applying a density factor of 638.96 kg/cubic meter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See Coalition's Case Br.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 1, Ex. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Because the Coalition made its argument regarding chips, sawdust, waste, and scrap in its case brief filed before Commerce,\n   <em>\n    see Coalition's Case Br.\n   </em>\n   at 14, and because the data supporting this argument potentially would detract from the Department's finding that the Thai AUV of plywood imports from Taiwan was not aberrationally low, Commerce was obligated to address this argument in its final determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SKF USA Inc. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052677\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1365/#p1374\">\n    630 F.3d 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (\"Commerce also has an 'obligation' to address important factors raised by comments from petitioners and respondents.\" (citations omitted) ). Commerce did not do so.\n   <em>\n    See Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 41-43. The court, therefore, directs Commerce to reconsider its surrogate value for plywood in light of this argument. In doing so, the court expresses no view on whether the data the Coalition cites necessarily require Commerce to find that the Thai AUVs of plywood imports from Taiwan or the United States are aberrationally low. At this time, the court will not rule on the other arguments the Coalition presented in contesting the plywood surrogate value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Because Thailand (like the United States and, essentially, all of its trading partners) is a member of the Harmonized System Convention, the Thai HTS is structured according to the nomenclature of the HS to the six-digit level. Classification of all goods under the Harmonized System is governed by the \"General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System,\" (also identified as the \"General Interpretive Rules\" or \"GIRs\"), which, like the HS nomenclature, are effectuated in the tariff laws of all member countries of the Harmonized System Convention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, 5th ed.

For the reasons discussed below, the court concludes that it was not. The record does not contain evidence to support a determination that the overlaying glue is properly classified under Thai HTS heading 3506.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The terms of HS heading 35.06 (and, therefore, the terms of Thai HTS heading 3506 as well) are as follows: \"Prepared glues and other prepared adhesives, not elsewhere specified or included; products suitable for use as glues or adhesives, put up for retail sale as glues or adhesives, not exceeding a net weight of 1 kg.\" EN 35.06. The terms of HS heading 39.09 (and Thai HTS heading 3909) are: \"Amino-resins, phenolic resins and polyurethanes, in primary forms.\" EN 39.09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   There is evidence on the record, in a questionnaire response submitted by Senmao, indicating that the overlaying glue, as would be expected for an adhesive used in manufacturing, was not put up for retail sale in containers of 1 kg. or less.\n   <em>\n    See Multilayered Wood Flooring from the People's Republic of China: Supplemental Section A, C &amp; D Response\n   </em>\n   8 (Sept. 29, 2014) (P.R.

The questionnaire response also states that the overlaying glue, as purchased by Senmao, is a finished glue rather than a\n   powder resin that is processed into finished glue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Accordingly, by application of GIR 1, the glue could be classified under Thai HTS 3506 only if it is \"not elsewhere specified or included,\" i.e., not included in another heading of the nomenclature.

In its surrogate value comments, Senmao identified Thai HTS subheading 3909.10 as the correct six-digit subheading for its overlaying glue (specifically identifying as the correct classification the country-specific subheading of HTS 3909.10.90-000).\n   <em>\n    See Multilayered Wood Flooring from the People's Republic of China: Surrogate Value Comments\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 1 (Aug. 11, 2014) (P.R. Doc. 266-67) (\"\n   <em>\n    Senmao's SV Comments\n   </em>\n   \"). HS Subheading 3909.10 is one of three six-digit subheadings within HS heading 39.09 that pertain to the amino-resins classifiable under the heading (the others being HS subheading 3909.20 (\"Melamine resins\") and HS subheading 3909.30 (\"Other amino-resins\") ). The Explanatory Note for heading 39.09 provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   These resins are used for the manufacture of transparent, translucent or brightly coloured articles of plastics and are much used for moulding table and fancy ware and electrical goods. In solutions and dispersions (emulsions and suspensions), (whether or not modified with oils, fatty acids, alcohols, or other synthetic polymers)\n   <em>\n    they are employed as glues\n   </em>\n   and as textile dressings, etc. (See the General Explanatory Note to this Chapter [39], exclusion (b), for the classification of glues.).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   EN 39.09 (emphasis added). \"Exclusion (b)\" in the General Explanatory Note to Chapter 39 provides the critical distinction between the resin-based glues of HS heading 35.06 and those of heading 39.09. It instructs that the following glues are excluded from Chapter 39:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Preparations specially formulated for use as adhesives, consisting of polymers or blends thereof of headings 39.01 to 39.13 which, apart from any permitted additions to the products of this Chapter (fillers, plasticisers, solvents, pigments, etc.) contain other added substances not falling in this Chapter (e.g., waxes, rosin esters, unmodified natural shellac) ... (\n   <strong>\n    heading 35.06\n   </strong>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   EN Chapter 39, exclusion (b). There is evidence of record that the overlaying glue does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   contain added substances other than those considered permitted additions by the language of exclusion (b), which identifies as including fillers, plasticizers, solvents, and pigments, but this evidence is limited to Senmao's surrogate value comments, which identified Thai HTS subheading 3909.10 as the correct six-digit\n   subheading for its overlaying glue.\n   <em>\n    See Senmao's SV Comments\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 1. On the other hand, the record contains no evidence that the overlaying glue\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   contain any substance that would result in its classification outside of the scope of HS heading 39.09 and, therefore, within the scope of HS heading 35.06, which as to bulk liquids and pastes is limited to prepared glues \"not elsewhere specified or included.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EN 35.06. Despite this complete lack of record evidence, Commerce determined Thai HTS heading 3506 to be the correct tariff classification for Senmao's overlaying glue. It did so without even making a finding of fact that the overlaying glue contained a specific substance removing it from the scope of Thai HTS heading 3909. Nor did Commerce conduct a proper analysis of the tariff classification issue presented to it. Instead, Commerce based its determination that the Thai GTA import data for a subheading of heading 3506 (specifically, Thai HTS subheading 3506.91.90-000\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) was the best available information on a series of findings-all of which are irrelevant to the issue of which heading is the correct one-and erroneous conclusions that violate established principles of tariff classification under the HS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Commerce began its analysis by reciting its familiar criteria for selecting surrogate values.\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 47 (\"[T]he Department's preference is to use, where possible, a range of publicly available, non-export, tax-exclusive, and product-specific prices for the POR ....\"). It then compared the two competing tariff classifications based on these four criteria, stating that \"[r]egarding HTS subheading 3909.10.90-000 and 3506.91.90-000, we find that both represent a broad market average, are publicly available, are exclusive of taxes and duties and are contemporaneous with the POR. However, based on the record before us, we do not find the HTS classifications to be equally specific to the overlaying glue input reported by Senmao.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This was error. Because the GTA data are generated according to the international HS nomenclature and the GIRs, which form the basis of Thailand's tariff classification scheme, a surrogate value determined according to a set of Thai import data can be valid and reliable only if the data set is selected according to the established HS tariff classification principles. Commerce itself seems to acknowledge this much, citing and relying in part on a legal note within the international \"harmonized commodity description and coding system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In deciding which set of GTA data was the best available information, Commerce first needed to determine which of the competing Thai HTS headings, 3506 or 3909, was correct for the overlaying glue. Commerce overlooked this issue, addressing instead the question of which of two subheadings, each of which was under a different heading, was more specific. \"Relative specificity\" is the criterion applied by GIR 3(a), not GIR 1, and it is a fundamental principle of tariff classification under the HS (if not the most fundamental principle) that resort to GIR 3 may not be had unless the correct heading cannot be determined according to GIRs 1 and 2. GIR 3 applies only \"[w]hen by application of Rule 2(b) or for any other reason, goods are\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   , classifiable under two or more headings.\" GIR 3. Here, it is error to choose between the two headings based on relative specificity because the terms of both cannot, even\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   , describe the overlaying glue. By the terms of HS heading 35.06, the two\n   headings are mutually exclusive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HS heading 35.06 (\"Prepared glues and other prepared adhesives,\n   <em>\n    not elsewhere specified or included\n   </em>\n   ...\" (emphasis added) ). In short, Commerce erred in choosing Thai HTS 3506 over Thai HTS 3909 without regarding the principle of GIR 1, and it also erred in deciding upon a subheading (which it based on the impermissible criterion of relative specificity) before deciding upon a heading, in violation of the GIRs in general and GIRs 1 and 6 in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Commerce further erred in rejecting Thai HTS heading 3909 based in part on HS Note 6 to Chapter 39 as it relates to the term \"in primary forms\" as used in Thai HTS heading 3909 and certain subheadings thereunder.\n   <em>\n    See Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 47-48. As Commerce noted, \"Legal Note 6 of Chapter 39 of the harmonized commodity description and coding system provides that 'primary forms' includes liquids, pastes, and powders.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47. The record evidence (i.e., Senmao's response to the supplemental questionnaire) shows that the overlaying glue is not a powder, but it does not show that it is not a liquid or paste, and, as a practical matter, it is hard to imagine that it could function as overlaying glue if it were anything but a liquid or paste.\n   <em>\n    See Senmao's Supp. QR\n   </em>\n   at 9. Finding as a fact that \"[t]o the extent that Senmao's purchased 'finished' glue undergoes any further processing, it is minimal at best,\" Commerce concludes that this finding \"weighs against finding that the overlaying glue reported by Senmao was in a 'primary form.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 48. This conclusion is misguided. The finding that Senmao's overlaying glue did not undergo significant processing after it was purchased in no way supports a conclusion that this glue is excluded from the scope of Thai HTS heading 3909. As Note 6 to Chapter 39 of the HS and the ENs make clear, a finished glue can be in a \"primary form\" as a liquid or paste, and some finished glues are liquids or pastes that are correctly classified under HS heading 39.09. Similarly misguided is the Department's conclusion that \"Senmao expressly stated that it did not use powder resin in producing subject merchandise, which is a subset of the products covered under HTS 3909.10.90-000\" and \"[a]s such, HTS 3909.10.90-000 includes a product that Senmao expressly disclaims using (powder resin), detracting from its specificity to Senmao's input.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The record evidence that Senmao did not use a powder resin does not support a finding or conclusion that Senmao's asserted classification was incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In summary, there was no record evidence to support a valid finding that the overlaying glue is excluded from the scope of Thai HTS heading 3909. As discussed above, Thai HTS heading 3506 could be correct only if the overlaying glue\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   excluded from heading 3909. There was some evidence that Thai HTS heading 3909 is the correct heading, albeit limited to Senmao's assertion to that effect. The finding that the Thai GTA data for a subheading of Thai HTS heading 3506 were better \"available information\" than the data for a subheading of Thai HTS heading 3909 is, therefore, entirely unsupported by record evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Senmao argues that Commerce acted contrary to law when, at the urging of the petitioner, it rejected Senmao's case brief on the ground that the portions of\n   the brief referencing the HS Explanatory Notes constituted an untimely submission of new factual information. Senmao's Br. 37;\n   <em>\n    see Rejection of Submission of Case Brief Filed in the 2012-2013 Administrative Review of the Antidumping Duty Order on Multilayered Wood Flooring from the People's Republic of China\n   </em>\n   (Feb. 12, 2015) (P.R. Doc. 396) (\"\n   <em>\n    Dep't's Letter\n   </em>\n   \"). Senmao refiled its brief after deleting the references Commerce rejected. Before the court, Senmao again relies upon the ENs in support of its claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Senmao's Br. 36-37. Defendant argues that the Department's decision to reject Senmao's initial case brief was proper and, further, that because the ENs constitute information that is not on the record, the court may not consider them in addressing Senmao's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. to Mots. for J. upon the Admin. R. 24 (July 14, 2016), ECF No. 90 (\"Def.'s Br.\"). According to defendant, because this is not a \"customs classification case,\" the court's review of the Department's determination is \"limited to the record developed before Commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Commerce was wrong to reject the case brief with the EN references, and defendant is wrong in arguing that the court should not consider the ENs in adjudicating the claim.

The ENs are not evidence. Rather than factual information that might be considered \"evidence,\" they are an international legal reference essential to the proper interpretation of the HS nomenclature and GIRs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Degussa Corp. v.

Nor are the ENs information described by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.102\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(21)(iii) (\"Publicly available information submitted to value factors under \u00a7 351.408(c) ...\"). The information to which \u00a7 351.408(c)(iii) refers is properly interpreted, consistent with the statutory provision it is effectuating, as \"information regarding the values of ... factors [of production] in a market economy country or countries,\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1), and \"prices or costs of factors of production,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.102\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1677b(c)(4). The ENs cannot serve as \"information\" to \"value\" anything, are not information on \"prices\" or \"costs,\" and, moreover, emanate from an international body, the World Customs Organization (the \"WCO\"), not from any particular country or countries. Here, the pertinent information Senmao submitted, and Commerce considered, for valuation of the overlaying glue factor of production was the Thai GTA information. As a legal reference on the interpretation of the GIRs and the HS nomenclature, including the scope of headings and six-digit subheadings, the WCO's Explanatory Notes are in this context essentially no different than any other legal reference a party may cite in a case brief before Commerce or argue before a court, such as a statute, judicial precedent, or restatement of the law. For these reasons, the court concludes that Commerce misapplied its regulation in rejecting Senmao's case brief and that defendant is misguided in arguing that the court may not consider the ENs as a legal reference in adjudicating this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Senmao argues that the record citations to the ENs that Commerce refused to consider \"would have resolved the issue.\" Senmao's Br. 35. If by this Senmao is arguing that the ENs, when applied to the record information about the overlaying glue, resolve the question of the proper tariff heading, the court disagrees. As the court discussed previously, the fact needed to determine whether Thai HTS heading 3506 or Thai HTS heading 3909 is the correct heading is the composition of the\n   glue that includes, in particular, the identity of the added ingredients. By submitting Thai HTS subheading 3909.10.90-000 as the correct tariff classification, Senmao has disclosed publicly that the finished glue is based on a urea resin or thiourea resin. Senmao included in its questionnaire response a more specific chemical identity for the main component of the finished glue (for which it claimed confidential treatment), but it did not disclose the identity of any other component of the finished glue (nor did Commerce request that it do so).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In conclusion, the Department's determination that GTA data for a subheading under Thai heading 3506 is the best available record information with which to value the overlaying glue input is not supported by substantial evidence. The court, therefore, must remand this determination for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Nothing on the record refutes Senmao's assertion in its surrogate value submission that its overlaying glue is properly classified under Thai HTS heading 3909. On the record as it now stands, Commerce on remand must accept that assertion because the opposite assertion-that heading 3506, which applies only to bulk finished adhesives that are \"not elsewhere specified or included,\" is the correct heading-is entirely unsupported by record evidence. In the alternative, Commerce has the discretion to reopen the record in an effort to reach a new determination, supported by valid factual findings, of which of the two tariff headings is correct. If using GTA import data to value this input, it must determine the correct tariff heading before it may proceed to select the proper subheading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GIRs 1, 6 (the correct subheading is to be determined according to terms of the subheadings and related subheading legal notes and according to GIRs 1-5 applied\n   <em>\n    mutatis mutandis\n   </em>\n   at the subheading level, only after the correct heading has been determined).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    E.

Fine Furniture raises an additional objection to the use of the 2013 Eiwlee financial statements based on the auditor's finding of an insufficiency in the information the company provided on Eiwlee's employee retirement benefit obligations. For the reasons discussed below, the court concludes that these arguments do not suffice to cause the court to order Commerce to reconsider the decisions it made in the Final Results that relate to the use of Eiwlee's 2012 and 2013 financial statements to calculate the financial ratios.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    1. Commerce Was Not Compelled by the Record Evidence to Choose Neotech's Financial Statement over Eiwlee's Financial Statements Due to the Type of Merchandise Produced\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For their argument that the Eiwlee statements are not the best available information, plaintiffs point to the financial statement of a Thai producer of plywood, Neotech Plywood Company Limited (\"Neotech\"), arguing that this is preferable to the statements of Eiwlee, which produced, in addition to MLWF, products including wooden household products and wooden furniture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   They argue that the production process of these other products is less comparable to the production process of subject merchandise than is the production process for plywood.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Senmao's Br. 15-23; Lumber Liquidators' Br. 2-8; Fine Furniture's Br. 27-29, 32-34; Jisen Wood's Br. 3-4; Armstrong's Br. 4. Senmao argues that the other products Eiwlee produces, e.g., wooden furniture, involve a more complex production process than does MLWF and that this production process differs from Senmao's MLWF production process to a greater degree than the difference between the MLWF production process and that of plywood. Senmao's Br. 13, 15-16. Senmao adds that \"[a]ll three websites of Eiwlee indicate that Eiwlee is a member of 'The Thai Furniture Industries Association' and the 'Thai Housewares Trade Association,' \" while \"[n]o mention is made of any membership in any association of flooring producers.\" Senmao's Br. 18.

Fine Furniture further argues that \"Commerce relied on sheer speculation that Eiwlee's failure to follow Thai accounting rules had no impact on 2012 data carried forward and restated in the tainted 2013 financial statement\" and that \"Commerce places greater reliance on Eiwlee's accountants in 2013 than the company's own auditor who conferred only a 'qualified opinion' with respect to the whole 2013 report, including the 2012 data contained therein.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2062%2C597\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The language by which the auditor expressed her reasons for issuing a conditional opinion on the 2013 Eiwlee financial statements refutes the premise of Fine Furniture's arguments.

As a result, I was not satisfied with the audit evidence regarding the estimate employee retirement benefit for the year ended 31 December 2013 because I did not receive documents and relevant information for the audit of such estimate from the Company. I, therefore, was unable to reach conclusion on the adjustment value for the estimate employee retirement benefit.

As to any adjustment to correct the deficiency in required reporting of estimated employee retirement benefit obligations, the auditor stated that \"[a]ny adjustment, if any, may affect the presentation of the Company's performance for the year ended 31 December 2013.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2062%2C597\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Fine Furniture's argument that the auditor \"conferred only a 'qualified opinion' with respect to the whole 2013 report, including the 2012 data contained therein,\" Fine Furniture's Br. 30, is not persuasive because it is not the most reasonable interpretation of the auditor's explanation. Commerce was not unreasonable in interpreting the auditor's statement of the reasons for issuing a conditional opinion to refer only to the company's financial performance for 2013. The auditor's statement under the heading \"Conditional Opinion\" provides further support for the Department's conclusion that the auditor did not consider the restated 2012 data to have been affected by the failure of the company to follow the cited reporting standard:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   In my opinion, except the effect from the abovementioned issued [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] for which I expressed conditional opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2013, and the results of operations for the year then ended of Eiwlee Industrial Co., Ltd. are in accordance with the reporting standard for Non-Publicly Accountable Entities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    Eiwlee's 2013 Financial Statement\n   </em>\n   .

On remand, Commerce must reconsider its surrogate cost and make a new determination that is based on factual findings, each of which is supported by substantial evidence on the record, and that is based on sound reasoning. In redetermining a surrogate cost, Commerce is not bound to confine itself to the evidence relating to Thailand and may consider all record evidence relevant to the determination of a surrogate cost for foreign inland freight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Defendant raises various arguments as to why the court is required to sustain the Department's surrogate cost for foreign inland freight, all of which are unpersuasive. Defendant argues that the Department's methodology is consistent with past practice and retains the internal consistency of the Department's calculations. Def.'s Br. 29-31. As to the distance Commerce used, defendant argues that the plaintiffs \"do not cite evidence that other distances are more appropriate or that the distances upon which Commerce relied are factually inaccurate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2058%2C326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2058%2C326\">\n    at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These arguments\n   fail to address Senmao's objection that everything in the calculation not obtained from\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   is absent from the record and is, therefore, unsupported speculation. Regardless of the Department's past practice, the court is unable to sustain a determination that is based on factual findings for which there is no evidence present on this administrative record. Defendant maintains that plaintiffs have offered no evidence to support the argument that handling cost does not vary with the distance traveled by the cargo, but this argument also misses the point. There is no record evidence to support the illogical premise that handling cost\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   vary with distance traveled. The $210 cost estimate is for \"Inland transportation and handling,\" for either an import or an export shipment, and there is no record evidence as to how much was for handling and how much was for transport alone. Senmao has identified a flaw that detracts from the reasonableness of the Department's methodology. There might be instances in which a lack of record data makes a methodological flaw unavoidable, but even in such a situation, the Department's method must be reasonable and adequately explained based on the record evidence that exists and the choices that the evidence makes available. Here, the surrogate cost Commerce calculated is based in part on assumptions that record evidence does not support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defendant argues, further, that neither Senmao nor any other party preserved the argument that Commerce, in the alternative, should have used the data pertaining to Indonesia by exhausting administrative remedies before the agency. Def.'s Br. 33. The court does not reach defendant's exhaustion of remedies argument because the court is not ruling that Commerce, upon remand, is required to use any particular method of determining a surrogate cost. Instead, the whole record is open to the Department's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    G. Fine Furniture's Claim that Commerce Unlawfully Denied Fine Furniture's Request to Be a Voluntary Respondent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Commerce did not assign Fine Furniture an individual weighted-average dumping margin. Fine Furniture submitted a request to be a voluntary respondent, which had it been granted would have resulted in Fine Furniture's being assigned an individual weighted-average dumping margin in the review. Commerce denied the request and included Fine Furniture among the separate-rate respondents assigned the 13.74% rate. Fine Furniture claims the Department's denial of its request to be a voluntary respondent was contrary to law. For the reasons discussed below, the court finds merit in this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Paragraph (1) of subsection 777A(c) of the Tariff Act requires that Commerce \"shall determine the individual weighted average dumping margin for each known exporter and producer of the subject merchandise.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(1). An exception to this general requirement is contained within the same subsection, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   If it is not practicable to make individual weighted average dumping margin determinations under paragraph (1) because of the large number of exporters or producers involved in the investigation or review, the administering authority may determine the weighted average dumping margins for a reasonable number of exporters or producers by limiting its examination to-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   (A)a sample of exporters, producers, or types of products that is statistically valid based on the information available to the administering authority at the time of selection, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   (B) exporters and producers accounting for the largest volume of the subject merchandise from the exporting\n   country that can be reasonably examined.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.402\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2). When Commerce invokes this exception, it typically limits the investigation or review to an examination of \"exporters and producers accounting for the largest volume of the subject merchandise from the exporting country\" and determines the individual weighted-average dumping margins for only those exporters and producers.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2058%2C326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is the procedure Commerce followed in the second review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   A respondent not selected for individual examination potentially still may receive an individually-determined margin according to section 782(a) of the Tariff Act, which provides that Commerce, upon limiting the number of respondents according to section 777A(c), \"shall establish an ... individual weighted average dumping margin for any exporter or producer not initially selected for individual examination\" if two conditions are met. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(a) (prior to 2015 amendments). The first condition applying to this \"voluntary respondent\" procedure is that an exporter or producer seeking individual examination submit \"the information requested from exporters or producers selected for examination\" by the same deadlines that apply to the selected respondents. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(a)(1) (prior to 2015 amendments). Fine Furniture satisfied this condition and thereby submitted a qualifying voluntary respondent request. The second condition, which Congress addressed in section 782(a)(2), is at issue in this case. Section 782(a)(2) provided Commerce discretion to deny a qualifying voluntary respondent request in certain circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   On June 29, 2015, while Commerce was conducting the instant review, Congress amended section 782(a)(2), among other provisions in the antidumping duty and countervailing duty statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-27, \u00a7 506,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Stat.%20362\">\n    129 Stat. 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 386-87 (2015) (\"TPEA\"). Prior to the amendment to section 782(a)(2), which was made by section 506 of the TPEA, Commerce was required to accept a qualifying voluntary respondent request if \"the number of exporters or producers who have submitted such information is not so large that individual examination of such exporters or producers would be unduly burdensome and inhibit the timely completion of the investigation.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(a)(2) (prior to 2015 amendments). As amended by the TPEA, the provision (renumbered as section 782(a)(1)(B) ) allowed Commerce to deny a qualifying request if \"the number of exporters or producers subject to the investigation or review is not so large that any additional individual examination of such exporters or producers would be unduly burdensome to the administering authority and inhibit the timely completion of the investigation or review.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(a)(1)(B) (post 2015 amendments). The TPEA also added a provision (the new section 782(a)(2) ) giving a broad definition to the term \"unduly burdensome\" and allowing Commerce to consider any factors relating to the timely completion of an investigation and review that it considers appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The TPEA amendment expanded considerably the discretion Commerce could exercise in denying a qualifying voluntary respondent request. Because the TPEA did not specify an effective date for the change in section 782(a)(2), nothing in the TPEA expressly precluded Commerce from applying its new discretion in the instant review, which was concluded upon the publication of the Final Results on July 15, 2015 and therefore after the June 29, 2015 date of the amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gozlon-Peretz v.

Read in pertinent part, the statute reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   [T]he administering authority shall establish ... an individual weighted average dumping margin for any exporter or producer ... who submits to the administering authority the information\n   requested from exporters or producers selected for examination, if ...\n   <em>\n    the number of exporters or producers who have submitted such information\n   </em>\n   is not so large that individual examination\n   <em>\n    of such exporters or producers\n   </em>\n   would be unduly burdensome and inhibit the timely completion of the investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(a) (prior to 2015 amendments) (emphasis added). Under the provision, the general rule is that Commerce will examine individually all such requesters. The exception, which as an exception to a general rule should be read narrowly, allows Commerce to review fewer than all requesters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   According to plain meaning, the reference to \"the number of exporters or producers who have submitted such information\" and the later reference to \"such exporters or producers\" must be read to refer to the same group of exporters or producers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(a)(2) (prior to 2015 amendments). Nevertheless, the provision is not without ambiguity. The interpretive question that arises is whether both are references to the exporters or producers who have submitted the information as necessary in order to be considered as voluntary respondents, or whether both are references to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   exporters and producers who have submitted the information \"requested from exporters or producers selected for examination,\" i.e., the mandatory respondents plus the respondents requesting treatment as voluntary respondents. In this instance, the court is not called upon to answer the question as to which interpretation should be preferred because Commerce has settled the question by adopting the former interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Specifically, for the Final Results Commerce interpreted the phrase \"number of exporters or producers who have submitted such information\" to include only the exporters or producers who voluntarily have submitted \"the information requested from exporters or producers selected for examination,\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(a) (prior to 2015 amendments), i.e., the requesters for voluntary respondent status, not the total number of exporters or producers who have submitted the information (which also would include the mandatory respondents).\n   <em>\n    See Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (interpreting those words to mean \"the number of such companies that have\n   <em>\n    voluntarily\n   </em>\n   provided such information\" (emphasis added) ). Where a statute is susceptible to more than one interpretation, a court will defer to the agency's interpretation if it is a reasonable one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    467 U.S. 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). The court considers the Department's interpretation reasonable because it is consistent with the plain meaning and the context of the provision as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Department's interpretation raises another issue of statutory construction that the court must consider. This issue is the intended meaning of the term \"so large\" as used in the clause \"not so large that individual examination of such exporters or producers would be unduly burdensome and inhibit the timely completion of the investigation.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(a)(2) (prior to 2015 amendments). The words \"so large\" necessarily signal an intended comparison with another number that is relatively smaller. The difficulty posed by this case is that the \"number of exporters or producers\" was one. This is the smallest possible number that can exist in any situation in which the voluntary respondent procedure could be invoked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Commerce impliedly interpreted the statute such that the number in question-one-is \"so large\" as to allow it to reject Fine Furniture's voluntary respondent request, even though it was the only\n   such request pending before it in the second review. When examining this interpretation according to the two-step process required by\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   , the court must conclude that this interpretation is unreasonable on its face. According to plain meaning, as well as logic, a number cannot be \"so large\" in comparison with another number, and, at the same time, be as small as it possibly can be. The general rule established by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(a) (prior to 2015 amendments) is that Commerce must examine individually\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   exporters and producers that requested voluntary respondent treatment; the exception allows Commerce to examine\n   <em>\n    fewer\n   </em>\n   than all of them if the number of requestors is \"so large that individual examination of such exporters or producers would be unduly burdensome and inhibit the timely completion of the investigation.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(a) (prior to 2015 amendments) (\"the administering authority shall establish ... an individual weighted average dumping margin for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   exporter or producer ... who submits to the administering authority the information requested\" (emphasis added) ). Under the Department's interpretation, Commerce may avoid reviewing\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   requestor of voluntary respondent status even if the number of requestors is as small as possible. The court, therefore, rejects this interpretation under \"step one\" of the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   analysis as contrary to plain meaning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   that \"[f]irst, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.

Although Commerce, consistent with Article 6.10.2 of the Agreement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   will not discourage voluntary\n   responses and will endeavor to investigate all firms that voluntarily provide timely responses in the form required, in certain cases (including cases involving the same product from multiple countries) where the number of exporters or producers is particularly high, Commerce may decline to analyze voluntary responses because it would be unduly burdensome and would preclude the completion of timely investigations or reviews. Section 782(a) generally codifies existing practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, H.R. Rep. No. 103-316, Vol. 1 at 873 (1994),\n   <em>\n    reprinted in\n   </em>\n   1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4040, 4201. The first sentence establishes the general principle that Commerce must examine individually all companies that voluntarily submit the requisite responses and in fact states the principle in the absolute. The second sentence provides an exception to the general principle, referring to \"certain cases\" in which \"the number of exporters or producers is particularly high,\" and in so doing might be referring to those requesting voluntary respondent status, consistent with the reference earlier in the sentence. Although it is possible to read the reference to \"the number of exporters or producers\" as also including the number of the mandatory respondents, this is not the only plausible reading. In any event, the SAA does not lend support to the Department's construction, which is at odds with plain meaning and logic. Consistent with the plain meaning of the statute, the SAA clarifies that the procedure described in the second sentence is intended as an exception to the general rule set forth in the first sentence, which is that Commerce will examine individually\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   respondents who voluntarily and timely submit responses in the correct form. Only when the number of exporters or producers is \"particularly high\" may Commerce deviate from the general rule by examining fewer than all such requesters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In determining that examining Fine Furniture would be \"unduly burdensome,\" Commerce noted that neither of the mandatory respondents had previously been subject to an individual review, that the Department \"needed to submit multiple questionnaires in order to become familiar with both companies' corporate structures, sales and FOPs,\" and that its \"analysis of Dajen was especially complicated due to its possible affiliations with several other companies located in different countries.\"\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 15.

Further, the court holds impermissible the Department's implicit interpretation of those words such that the number one can be \"so large\" for purposes of the statutory standard. Therefore, the court cannot sustain the Department's decision to reject Fine Furniture's voluntary respondent request on the reasoning Commerce put forth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Defendant argues that Fine Furniture failed to exhaust its administrative remedies for certain of the arguments it makes before the court, having raised in its case brief before Commerce \"that Commerce may only decline to review voluntary respondents where they represent a large number.\" Def.'s Br. 37. The court disagrees with the implication that Fine Furniture raised only that argument.\n   <em>\n    See Administrative Review of the Antidumping Duty Order on Multilayered Wood Flooring from the People's Republic of China: Case Brief for Consideration Prior to the Final Results\n   </em>\n   11-16 (Feb. 9, 2015) (P.R. Doc. 386). Moreover, the argument defendant identifies as being included in Fine Furniture's case brief is a meritorious one, for the reasons the court discussed above. Defendant argues that, in any event, Commerce in this instance reasonably exercised its discretion to refuse to allow Fine Furniture to serve as a voluntary respondent. The court is unable to agree with this argument because Commerce denied the voluntary respondent request based on faulty reasoning. As the court has explained, that reasoning was grounded in an impermissible interpretation of section 782(a)(2) as it existed prior to amendment by the TPEA. Commerce, therefore, must reconsider its decision to deny Fine Furniture's voluntary respondent request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    H.

Yingyi-Nature and Jisen Wood are correct. The record does not contain substantial evidence, or any evidence, to support a finding of fact that the PRC imposed a tax, duty, or charge in the amount of 8% \"on Senmao's exports.\" Commerce based its ultimate factual finding that China did impose such an 8% tax, duty, or charge on Senmao's exported merchandise on various subordinate findings, but among them is a critical finding the record evidence does not support.

According to the record evidence provided by Senmao, the input VAT served as a deduction from potential output VAT liability but did not serve as a basis for a \"refund\" or \"rebate\" of input VAT such that 8% of this input VAT was not recovered by reason of exportation of the merchandise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The more important point, however, is that Commerce lacked evidentiary support for its finding that under the PRC's VAT system a producer of exported merchandise such as Senmao did not incur irrecoverable input VAT on domestic sales. To the contrary, the record evidence consisting of Senmao's questionnaire responses and its exhibits demonstrates that Senmao incurred irrecoverable input VAT on both its domestic and its export sales.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to that evidence, the difference between its domestic sales and its export sales, with respect to treatment under the Chinese VAT system, was that the export sales received a preferential reduction of 9% from the generally-applicable 17% rate for\n   <em>\n    output\n   </em>\n   VAT, resulting in a preferential VAT rate of 8% on the sales for export.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Department's erroneous finding that irrecoverable input VAT \"amounts to a tax, duty or other charge imposed on exports that is not imposed on domestic sales,\"\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13, was a critical error, for it was an essential part of the reasoning by which Commerce found that irrecoverable input VAT amounts to a \"tax, duty, or other charge imposed by the exporting country on the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States\" within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B). Commerce stated that the intent of its practice of deducting 8% as \"a fixed percentage of EP\" was \"arriving at a tax neutral dumping comparison.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.402\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Methodological Change for Implementation of Section 772(c)(2)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as Amended, In Certain Non-Market Economy Antidumping Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C481\">\n    77 Fed.

But an input VAT incurred upon the purchase of materials for use in production of goods both for export sale and domestic sale cannot correctly be found in fact to be a tax, duty, or charge that is not imposed on domestic sales. The Department's reasoning that the irrecoverable input VAT must be deducted from EP starting prices in order to attain tax neutrality\n   is based on that erroneous finding. There is no record evidence from which Commerce could find that Senmao's export sales incurred a \"tax, duty, or other charge\" that its domestic sales avoided. Under the Chinese VAT system as shown by the evidence placed on the record by Senmao, export sales were not treated less favorably than were domestic sales (and in fact were treated more favorably).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In summary, it cannot be shown on the record of this case that, as Commerce presumed, irrecoverable input VAT is incurred under the Chinese VAT scheme exclusively with respect to export sales. Instead, the evidence placed on the record by Senmao is that the PRC VAT system imposes input VAT on the materials used in all production of a good, whether or not the finished good subsequently produced is exported. Therefore, the evidence of record does not support the Department's ultimate finding that the tax in question \"amounts to\" an export tax, duty, or charge imposed by the exporting government on the exportation of the subject merchandise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Simply stated, input VAT incurred on materials used in domestic production that is not rebated or refunded upon the sale of the good (whether domestically or to an export market) made from those materials cannot, as a factual matter, \"amount to\" something it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   In conclusion, the Department's decision to make the deductions from Senmao's EP starting prices for \"irrecoverable\" input VAT was erroneous because it was based on a critical finding of fact, i.e., that irrecoverable input VAT did not occur on domestic sales, that was unsupported by record evidence and illogical. On remand, Commerce must reach a new determination on the VAT issue that does not have these deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <em>\n    I. Old Master's Claim Challenging the Assignment of the 13.74% Rate to the Separate-Rate Respondents\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In the Final Results, Old Master was assigned the separate-rate margin of 13.74%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   at 41,478. Because Commerce calculated a zero margin for Dalian, this rate was based entirely upon the examination of Senmao, the only individually examined respondent that did not receive a zero or\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   rate.\n   <em>\n    See Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 52. Old Master challenges the rate that it was assigned, arguing that Commerce abused its discretion and acted contrary to law by calculating an assessment rate for separate-rate respondents that \"roughly quadruple[d] the deposit rate\" and that was \"untethered to commercial reality.\" Old Master's Br. 2. Old Master contends that it was unreasonable in this case for Commerce to calculate the separate rate by using a method for calculating the \"all-others\" rate that is used in investigations because the rate here was based on a single mandatory respondent, \"a clearly non-representative sample,\" which resulted in a rate that does not reflect \"commercial reality.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C481\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C481\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the reasons discussed below, the court rejects this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Paragraph (1) of subsection 777A(c) of the Tariff Act requires that Commerce \"shall determine the individual weighted average dumping margin for each known exporter and producer of the subject merchandise.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). An exception to this general requirement is contained within the same subsection, which reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   If it is not practicable to make individual weighted average dumping margin determinations under paragraph (1) because of the large number of exporters or producers involved in the investigation or review, the administering authority may determine the weighted average dumping margins for a reasonable number of exporters or producers by limiting its examination to-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   (A)a sample of exporters, producers, or types of products that is statistically valid based on the information available to the administering authority at the time of selection, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   (B) exporters and producers accounting for the largest volume of the subject merchandise from the exporting country that can be reasonably examined.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.402\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2). When Commerce has invoked this exception, it necessarily must establish margins for the unselected respondents that remain subject to the review by a means other than an individual examination. In administrative reviews involving products from a nonmarket economy country, the statute is silent as to how Commerce must establish a rate for these unselected respondents. To \"fill the statutory gap, Commerce generally follows the method for determining the all-others rate in market economy investigations.\" Def.'s Br. 47. That method, which applies to investigations, rather than reviews, is outlined in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(A), which sets forth a general rule under which Commerce is to base the all-others rate on \"the weighted average of the estimated weighted average dumping margins established for exporters and producers individually investigated, excluding any zero and de minimis margins, and any margins determined entirely under section 1677e of this title\" (i.e., determined entirely according to facts otherwise available). 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(A). The Department followed its practice here and assigned to the separate-rate respondents that were not individually examined a rate of 13.74%, which was the only rate calculated for an individually examined respondent that was not zero or\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Old Master argues that Commerce should not have applied its normal procedure because, after excluding Dalian Dajen's zero margin, the separate rate was based upon only one individually examined respondent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Old Master's Br. 3. According to Old Master, using the rate of only one individually examined respondent is not representative of those respondents that were not individually examined and is not \"logically connected\" to the \"commercial reality\" of the separate-rate respondents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These arguments are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Old Master appears to base its \"commercial reality\" argument on the fact that the 13.74% rate \"roughly quadruple[d] the deposit rate.\" Old Master's Br. 2. The cash deposit rate, though, is only an \"estimated\" rate, consistent with the retrospective statutory scheme for assessment of antidumping duties, under which Commerce, at a later time, determines the amount of antidumping duty that actually is to be assessed and collected upon the liquidation of entries of subject merchandise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.212\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"[T]he United States uses a 'retrospective' assessment system under which final liability for antidumping and countervailing duties is determined after merchandise is imported.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Old Master posits that the 13.74% rate is \"non-representative\" because it is based on an examination of a single mandatory respondent. Old Master's Br. 4. At no point during the administrative review did Old Master contest the selection of the mandatory respondents or argue that Senmao was not a suitable candidate. Because Senmao was one of the \"exporters and producers accounting for the largest volume of the subject merchandise from the exporting country,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2)(B), its pricing practices are presumptively representative of the other exporters and producers of subject merchandise. Old Master has not put forth a convincing reason why Senmao should not be presumed to be representative of the other exporters and producers of subject merchandise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Finally, Old Master does not point to any provision of the statute that Commerce violated in assigning to it an all-others rate based upon the rate of the only individually examined respondent that did not receive a zero or\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   margin. While Old Master is correct that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(A) explicitly applies to investigations, the Court of Appeals has reasoned that \"the statutory framework [of \u00a7 1673d ] contemplates that Commerce will employ the same methods for calculating a separate rate in periodic administrative reviews as it does in initial investigations.\"\n   <em>\n    Albemarle Corp. &amp; Subsidiaries v.

Although these are grounds that in some instances have caused courts to excuse the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, neither suffices in the situation presented by this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Regarding futility, plaintiff argues that \"[r]aising the rejected argument in the administrative case brief would have been a futile exercise, as Commerce had already made its determination by conducting the administrative review.\" Penghong's Reply Br. 3. This argument is not technically accurate, as the review could not be considered to have been \"conducted\" prior to\n   issuance of the Final Results. Before then, Commerce as a procedural matter retained the power to rescind the review of Shenyang Haobainian Wooden Co., Ltd. The earlier decision to accept the petitioners' second request and proceed with the review was by definition not a final administrative decision, as signified by the case brief procedure of \u00a7 351.309(c)(2). Instead, the initial decision was one Commerce procedurally was free to alter between the issuance of the Preliminary Results and the Final Results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   As to the pure legal question justification, plaintiff argues that its \"claim, that Commerce violated its regulations by allowing a change to an administrative review request after the deadline, is purely legal in nature and no additional information is necessary for the Court to decide the issue.\" Penghong's Reply Br. 3. It might be true that \"no additional information is necessary\" for the court to decide the question presented on the merits, but if it is true it is only because the administrative record contains the factual details bearing on the issue. That is not the same as saying that only a pure legal question is presented. Deciding the issue on the merits would require resort to the record for consideration of the specific factual circumstances according to which Commerce reached a decision not to reject the second review request, as reflected in the preliminary results of the second review. Shenyang Haobainian Wooden Co., Ltd., having declined to pursue the issue in its case brief, allowed that decision to become a final decision as embodied in the Final Results. Accordingly, it may not challenge the merits of that decision before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.
