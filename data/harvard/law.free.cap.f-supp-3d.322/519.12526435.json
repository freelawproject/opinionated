Both parties have moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, Hofsommer's motion is granted and the Commissioner's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hofsommer applied for Disability Insurance benefits and Supplemental Security Income on March 10, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certified Administrative Record, filed Nov. 1, 2017 (Docket # 11) (\"R.\"), 26. The Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") denied Hofsommer's applications and Hofsommer sought review by an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"). R. 178-85. A hearing was held on December 15, 2015, at which Hofsommer and his attorney appeared. R. 108-170. In a written decision dated February 3, 2016, the ALJ found that Hofsommer was not disabled. R. 23-40. The Appeals Council denied review, making the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Commissioner. R. 1-6. Hofsommer filed this action on June 22, 2017, seeking review of that final decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, filed June 22, 2017 (Docket # 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Hearing Before the ALJ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hofsommer was represented by attorney Gary Gogerty at the hearing before the ALJ. R. 110. Before calling any witness to testify, the ALJ reviewed the record, at which time Hofsommer's attorney stated that the only outstanding medical\n   records were records pertaining to \"[c]ontinuous treatment.\" R. 111. The ALJ then called Hofsommer to testify. R. 111.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hofsommer was 54 years old at the time of the hearing, and had previously had two shoulder surgeries on his right arm. R. 112, 126. After his first surgery, Hofsommer re-injured his shoulder while helping his wheelchair-bound aunt into a car. R. 134-35. Physical therapy made his shoulder worse. R. 127-28. Hofsommer demonstrated how high he could lift his right arm for the ALJ, and the ALJ described it as being \"a little bit above [his] waist.\" R. 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hofsommer could not dial on a phone with his right hand because doing so caused him shooting pain up to his neck. R. 129. He described the pain as a sharp pain that runs from the tip of his shoulder to his fingers and neck, and said it was usually a nine to ten on a ten point scale. R. 143-44. He had received medical opinions from several doctors, who had said that he needed a total shoulder replacement and would have to wait until he was 62 to get one. R. 126-27. The doctors had told him that he was \"too young and too active\" to have another surgery earlier than that, but when the ALJ asked what the doctors meant by \"too active,\" he said \"I don't know. I asked them the same thing and they never answer me.\" R. 139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To treat his shoulder, Hofsommer took muscle relaxers and Ambien to help him sleep. R. 127. Hofsommer testified that although he had previously been prescribed narcotic pain medication, the doctor who had prescribed that medication to Hofsommer had stopped doing so after finding that Hofsommer's urine tested positive for marijuana. R. 129-32. He no longer used marijuana, and drank a couple of beers \"[m]aybe once a week.\" R. 132-33. Although the ALJ stated a medical report indicated that in November 2015, Hofsommer had been admitted to an emergency room and had been found to have a blood alcohol content of .243, Hofsommer denied any recollection of being tested and found to have that blood alcohol content. R. 133-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Regarding his work history and vocational experience, Hofsommer testified that other than occasionally watching an elderly friend of his for $50 \"every week or two weeks\" during the summer of 2015, he had not worked in any capacity since January of 2011. R. 111-13, 115. In 2006 and 2007, he worked for Breckenridge Enterprises in Florida, where he did \"stone block work.\" R. 123-24. In 2000, he worked for \"Hansen Pipe Products and Pre-Cast,\" where he smoothed concrete after it was poured. R. 124-25. He also worked as a construction worker in 1998 for a company called \"PT Florida Incorporated,\" where he helped build high rise buildings. R. 148-49. Hofsommer had completed ninth grade, though he was enrolled in some special education classes when he attended school, and at the time of the hearing, he was illiterate. R. 117, 122-23. Hofsommer went to \"Job Corps\" for two years when he was 15 or 16. R. 117.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Concerning daily activities, Hofsommer stayed at home with his mother, with whom he lived. R. 118. Hofsommer's mother had previously had \"a couple [of] heart attacks,\" and Hofsommer had moved back to New York from Florida in 2011 to take care of her. R. 119, 123. To help his mother, Hofsommer would \"take out the trash ... vacuum floors\" and would also assist her with cooking, cleaning, setting the table, and doing laundry. R. 119. Hofsommer was capable of using a riding lawnmower to mow his mother's lawn, though his brother often helped with work outside of the home. R. 120. Hofsommer could not lift anything with his right arm, though he would occasionally put one log at a time into his mother's fireplace using his left\n   hand, with each log weighing \"[m]aybe five pounds or something like that.\" R. 121. Hofsommer also stayed with his aunt every other week around 2011 or 2012 to help her with activities such as \"putting her clothes in the wash and making sure her garbage and stuff was all taken out,\" and also \"clean[ing] up her room.\" R. 135-36. Hofsommer had no driver's license because he lost it approximately eleven years prior to the hearing as a result of a \"DUI.\" R. 116-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The ALJ called Josiah Pearson, a vocational expert witness (\"VE\"). R. 145. Using the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\"DOT\"), the VE classified Hofsommer's prior work with PT Florida and Breckenridge as \"construction worker II,\" which was an unskilled job requiring a very heavy level of exertion, and the job at Hammond as a \"laborer at a concrete plant,\" an unskilled job with a heavy exertion level. R. 150-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The ALJ asked VE Pearson to assume a hypothetical person of Hofsommer's age, education, and work history, with the residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to engage in a full range of light exertional work as defined in the DOT, but without the ability to reach overhead with his dominant right upper extremity, and with the ability to occasionally reach in all other directions with that extremity. R. 151. The VE testified that such a person could perform jobs that existed in substantial numbers in the national economy, including as an usher, school bus monitor, cashier II, or counter clerk. R. 152-53. The ALJ additionally asked whether any jobs would exist in the national economy that the hypothetical person could perform if he could not reach in any direction with the dominant right upper extremity but could occasionally handle and finger with that extremity. R. 153-54. The VE testified that such a person could perform the jobs already listed even with this additional restriction. R. 154.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Medical Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Both Hofsommer and the Commissioner have provided summaries of the medical evidence contained in the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 4-14; Comm'r Mem. at 1-10. The Court had directed the parties to specify any objections they had to the opposing party's summary of the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, filed Nov. 3, 2017 (Docket # 12), \u00b6 5. Neither party specified any objections, and the summaries are substantially consistent with each other. Accordingly, the Court adopts Hofsommer's and the Commissioner's summaries of the medical evidence as accurate and complete for purposes of the issues raised in this suit. We discuss the medical evidence pertinent to the adjudication of this case in section III below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The ALJ's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The ALJ denied Hofsommer's application for benefits on February 3, 2016. R. 39-40. The ALJ found that Hofsommer met the insured status requirements of the Act through June 30, 2011, and that he had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since January 1, 2011, the alleged onset date. R. 28. The ALJ found that Hofsommer had severe impairments of \"right shoulder rotator cuff tear ; osteoarthritis of the right shoulder; cervical spine degenerative disc disease and spondylosis ; tremor; and hypertension.\" R. 28. He found, however, that Hofsommer had no impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled \"the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.\" R. 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As for Hofsommer's RFC, the ALJ determined that he could \"perform light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b) except no reaching with the\n   dominant right upper extremity, and he can occasionally handle and finger with the right upper extremity.\" R. 30. In making this finding, the ALJ considered Hofsommer's \"longstanding treatment record at Crystal Run Healthcare beginning prior to the alleged onset date to the present.\" R. 30. The ALJ also evaluated a Disability Questionnaire dated June 23, 2014, that had been submitted by Dr. Rocco Bassora, plaintiff's orthopedic surgeon; three opinion letters from Dr. Bassora dated February 3, 2014, November 20, 2014, and January 26, 2015; and a Disability Questionnaire dated April 7, 2014, from Dr. Towhid Shiblee, Hofsommer's internist, R. 30, 32, 35-36. The ALJ gave \"[s]ome weight\" to Dr. Bassora's \"overall opinion,\" which included a statement in the June 23, 2014 Disability Questionnaire indicating that Hofsommer could\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   never lift or carry, ... is unable to work with his right shoulder and arm.... [Has] marked limitation in using arms for reaching (including overhead); moderate limitation in grasping, turning, twisting objects with bilateral upper extremities; and minimal limitation using fingers and hands for fine manipulations with bilateral upper extremities.... [C]ould not tolerate low stress work due to severe right shoulder pain, ... was limited to no pushing, pulling, and bending.... [And] has psychological limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   R. 35-36 (citations omitted). In so doing, the ALJ noted that Dr. Bassora was an orthopedic surgeon. R. 36. The ALJ gave \"great weight\" to the portion of the opinion stating that Hofsommer had \"no limits to sitting standing and walking,\" but noted that \"[t]he opinions regarding time off task, pain, fatigue, capable of stress, and missing time from work are poorly supported by [Dr. Bassora's] own medical records.\" R. 36. The ALJ also noted that he gave \"some weight\" to Dr Bassora's statement that Hofsommer had \"moderate limits grasping, minimal fingering and marked in using arms for reaching,\" but that Dr. Bassora had \"explained the reaching earlier as limited to reaching overhead.\" R. 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The ALJ gave \"little weight\" to Dr. Shiblee's opinion that Hofsommer\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   experienced pain and fatigue at a level of 10, indicating severe.... [W]as unable to work ... [H]ad marked limitation in [his right upper extremity in] grasping, turning, twisting objects; using fingers and hands for fine manipulations; and using arms for reaching, including overhead.... [W]as incapable of tolerating low work stress due to severe right shoulder pain, ... needed to avoid temperature extremes, and ... pushing and pulling.... [And] had not worked for two years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   R. 35-36 (citations omitted). The ALJ noted that Dr. Shiblee was not an orthopedic expert, his findings \"were contrary to his physical exams,\" and \"his opinions are poorly supported by substantial evidence including his own exams, which failed to support his own assessments.\" R. 36 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As to Hofsommer's credibility, the ALJ found that his \"medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms,\" but that his \"statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms [were] not wholly credible.\" R. 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In conclusion, the ALJ found that a person of Hofsommer's RFC could not perform Hofsommer's past work as a \"Laborer\" or \"Construction worker II.\" R. 37. However, relying on the VE's testimony and Hofsommer's RFC as described above, the ALJ found that \"there are jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant can perform,\" including \"[u]sher ... [s]chool bus monitor ... [c]ashier II ... [and] [c]ounter\n   [c]lerk.\" R. 38-39. Accordingly, the ALJ found Hofsommer not disabled from January 1, 2011, through the date of the decision.

The claimant testified to moving up to the area so that he could take care of his mother. He reported helping her with a range of activities of daily living from laundry, taking out the trash, setting\n   the table, to vacuuming. In addition, the claimant testified to helping take care of his ailing aunt while she was sick in 2011 and 2012 and staying with her every other week and helping her with a range of activities. Finally, the claimant reported that he was hired to take care of his 82 year old friend a few hours a day a couple of times a week and was paid $50 a week, but when asked to describe when, where and how often he was doing this work he was extremely vague and failed to provide any concrete information, which impacts on the claimant's veracity. These activities all provide support for the residual functional capacity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   R. 36-37. Hofsommer argues that the ALJ inaccurately described Hofsommer's daily activities when assessing his credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We reject this argument because the ALJ's description accords with Hofsommer's testimony at the hearing before the ALJ. During this hearing, Hofsommer testified that he \"moved back up here from Florida to take care of\" his mother, that he helped his mother take out laundry and \"put it in the basket and kick it over with my foot to the dryer for her,\" that he \"take[s] out the trash and ... tr[ies] to vacuum floors or something,\" and that he \"tr[ies] to set the table and stuff for her and clean it off.\" R. 119. Likewise, Hofsommer also testified that in 2011 and 2012, he stayed with his aunt \"[j]ust like every other week or something\" and helped her by \"putting her clothes in the wash and making sure her garbage and stuff was all taken out,\" and also cleaned her room. R. 135-36. Finally, Hofsommer initially testified that he watched over his 82-year-old friend \"like two, three hours a day\" and in exchange was given \"like $50 like every week or every two weeks or whenever.\" R. 112-14. After further questioning by the ALJ however, Hofsommer recharacterized this arrangement by stating that he \"just stopped there every once in awhile just to see how [his friend] was doing,\" that he would watch his friend \"if [his friend's wife] had to go somewhere,\" that he did not know how many times a week he went to his friend's house, and that his friend's wife paid him $50 \"just because she knew I couldn't work or nothing.\" R. 115-16. Thus, the ALJ properly described this arrangement (with the minor exception that Hofsommer did not testify to watching over his friend \"a couple of times a week\"), and Hofsommer's vague responses upon further questioning about this arrangement. Hofsommer's assertion that the ALJ misstated his testimony as described above is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Hofsommer also argues that \"the ALJ does not specify which of [Mr. Hofsommer's] alleged limitations are contradicted by [his] daily activities.\" Pl.

Dec. 3, 2008) ). However, elsewhere in the ALJ's opinion, the ALJ specifically notes that \"the claimant's testimony that he could not use his arm in any capacity is not well supported by ... his activities of daily living.\" R. 37.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Hofsommer asserts that the ALJ improperly characterized his work history prior to the alleged onset of his disability as \"sporadic,\" and speculatively noted that this \"raises a question as to whether the claimant's continuing unemployment is actually due to medical impairments.\" Pl. Mem. at 23 (quoting R. 37). Hofsommer counters the assertion that his work history was \"sporadic\" by noting that he \"worked every year from 1980 through 2009 with the exception of two (2) years, 1985 and 2003.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205111317\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hofsommer does not support this argument with a citation to the record corroborating his work history. Moreover, Hofsommer's earnings for many of these years was very low, suggesting that he in fact engaged in only sporadic work. He earned under $15,000 for every year starting with the beginning of his work history in 1980 through 2005, and in many years earned far lower amounts, including in years during the five year period before his alleged disability onset date of 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 236 ($2,868 in 1994, $1,291.50 in 1996, $6,145.75 in 1997, $1,952.00 in 1999, $7,786.02 in 2001, zero earnings in 2003, $572 in 2004, $2,030.83 in 2005, $5,561.13 in 2008, and $1,054 in 2009). Moreover, Hofsommer's sporadic work history was properly considered by the ALJ in discounting Hofsommer's credibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schaal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11586750\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/134/496/#p501\">\n    134 F.3d at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"ALJs are specifically instructed that credibility determinations should take account of 'prior work record.' ...

Mem. at 23-24 (citing R. 37). In particular, Hofsommer asserts that the medical records the ALJ cites for this proposition do not so say.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. This is incorrect. For example, in support of this conclusion, the ALJ cited to an August 15, 2012 post-operative report signed by Dr. Bassora, which noted that after Hofsommer's surgery on June 12, 2012, Hofsommer was \"in physical therapy working on aggressive [range of motion],\" that Hofsommer had a \"[frontal flexion] 150 active and 160 passive with pain,\" and that Hofsommer \"continues to improve his [range of motion].\" R. 774-75. Another post-operative report dated February 13, 2013, from Dr. Bassora, provided that although Hofsommer \"continue[d] to experience pain in his shoulder with difficulty with overhead activities,\" he still maintained \"[frontal flexion] 100 active and 160 passive with pain.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 814-15. Furthermore, a September 26, 2013 consultation performed by Dr. Howard Yeon, MD, noted in the section labeled \"Physical Exam\" that Hofsommer had \"[f]lexion/extension and side bending [range of motion] within normal limits.\" R. 864. Finally, another consultation performed by Dr. Yeon on November 6, 2013, noted in the section marked \"Physical Exam\" that Hofsommer had \"[f]orward flexion 120 active, 140 passive.\" R. 878. The Commissioner notes that these reports show that Hofsommer could move his arm above shoulder level insofar as his forward flexion range of motion exceeded 90 degrees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Comm'r Mem. at 24, and Hofsommer does not dispute this assertion in his reply brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Based on the above, we reject Hofsommer's arguments that the ALJ's credibility\n   determination was unsupported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Hofsommer's RFC and the VE's Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Hofsommer argues that the ALJ failed to properly assess his RFC, and as a result the hypotheticals posed to the VE were not supported by substantial evidence, and the VE's responses to those hypotheticals must thus be rejected.

After discussing the relevant medical evidence, the ALJ found that Hofsommer retained the RFC to \"perform light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b) except no reaching with the dominant right upper extremity, and he can occasionally handle and finger with the right upper extremity.\" R. 30. Under the cited regulations, light work is defined as \"involv[ing] lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds.... [And] requires a good deal of walking or standing, or when it involves sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 416.967(b). Implicit in the ALJ's conclusion, therefore, was the finding that Hofsommer could lift up to 20 pounds occasionally, could frequently lift or carry objects weighing up to 10 pounds, and could do some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls. Notwithstanding this implicit finding, the ALJ does not directly explain what evidence supports this implicit finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As for the evidence the ALJ reviewed, the ALJ pointed to Dr. Bassora's opinion, which reported that Hofsommer had \"no\n   limits to sitting standing and walking,\" and \"moderate limits grasping, minimal fingering and marked in using arms for reaching.\" R. 36, 592-93. However, Dr. Bassora's opinion also reported that Hofsommer could not push, pull, lift, or carry at all. R. 592, 596. Although the ALJ recognized that Dr. Bassora made this finding, R. 35, the ALJ failed to indicate what weight this statement carried. If he accepted it, he failed to reconcile this opinion with Hofsommer's alleged capacity for light work requiring these abilities. R. 35-36. Instead, the ALJ simply stated that Dr. Bassora's responses to the Disability Questionnaire \"provide[ ] support for the\" RFC and gave \"[s]ome weight ... to Dr. Bassora's overall opinion.\" R. 36. Assuming that the portion of Dr. Bassora's opinion stating that Hofsommer could not push, pull, lift, or carry was also given \"some weight,\" then the ALJ should have explained why such restrictions did not further impede Hofsommer's ability to perform light work. On the other hand, if the ALJ provided little or no weight to these restrictions, then the ALJ should have explained his reason for doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   We recognize that the ALJ also noted that his RFC determination was supported by the activities of daily living in which Hofsommer still engaged, including helping his mother with \"a range of activities of daily living from laundry, taking out the trash, setting the table, to vacuuming.... [T]ak[ing] care of his ailing aunt while she was sick in 2011 and 2012 and staying with her every other week and helping her with a range of activities.... [And] tak[ing] care of his 82 year old friend a few hours a day a couple of times a week.\" R. 36. However, the ALJ never directly states that these activities demonstrated that Hofsommer could \"frequent[ly] lift[ ] or carry[ ] ... objects weighing up to 10 pounds,\" could sometimes lift up to 20 pounds, or could push and pull as required to perform light work.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 416.967(b). Indeed, Hofsommer testified that when helping his mother with laundry, he would kick the full basket of laundry to her instead of lifting it, R. 119, 137, and that although he would occasionally lift logs and place them in a fireplace for his mother, he would do so by putting one log in at a time, each log weighing \"[m]aybe five pounds,\" R. 121.

The Second Circuit noted that the claimant's \"ability to sit for prolonged periods of time was the key to the ultimate determination of his disability,\" and had been the subject of varying opinions by the claimant's consulting and treating physicians, and that the ALJ failed to make an adequate determination on whether the claimant retained the ability to sit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57433\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/728/582/#p585\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57433\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/728/582/#p585\">\n    at 586-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Similarly here, the ALJ conclusorily determined that Hofsommer was capable of light work, and noted that Hofsommer's treating physician found no limitations in Hofsommer's ability to sit, stand, or walk. R. 30, 36. The ALJ, however, failed to discuss how the evidence established that Hofsommer could push, pull, carry, or lift as required to perform light\n   work per the regulations' definition, despite the fact that a treating source's opinion on which the ALJ relied noted that Hofsommer could not perform these functions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 36. These functions were more important in this case than Hofsommer's ability to sit, stand, or walk, given that Hofsommer's alleged disability arose from a shoulder injury. Thus, the ALJ's conclusory finding that Hofsommer could perform light work as defined in the SSA regulations was not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We reiterate that an express \"function-by-function\" assessment of a claimant's RFC is not required, so long as the ALJ \"explain[s] how the evidence supports his or her conclusions about the claimant's limitations and ... discuss[es] the claimant's ability to perform sustained work activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Casino-Ortiz v.
