Wright, United States District Judge\n   Defendants move to compel arbitration and to stay the proceedings in this matter pending arbitration. (Dkts. 27, 30.) Because Plaintiff is contractually obligated to arbitrate this dispute, the Court grants Defendants' motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Samuel Zean commenced this lawsuit to dispute a debt. He alleges, among other things, that the debt-collection efforts of Defendants Comcast Broadband Security, LLC, and Southwest Credit Systems, L.P., violated certain consumer protection laws. The parties dispute both the commencement date and the terms of their contractual relationship. Zean argues that he accepted Comcast's offer for residential Internet service via telephone on February 26, 2016. According to Zean, this telephonic interaction formed \"a valid contract for services\" that addressed only \"the price, service speed, and duration of [the] agreement\" and did not include \"any other terms or conditions.\" Zean's complaint alleges, however, that he entered a 12-month \"Internet Service Contract\" with Comcast on March 7, 2016. And it is undisputed that Zean paid Comcast for residential Internet service and installation in March 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to Comcast, its relationship with Zean commenced in March 2016 and that relationship is governed by the Comcast Agreement for Residential Services (Subscriber Agreement). The Subscriber Agreement provides Comcast's terms and conditions, including those governing billing, fees for installation and equipment rental, and cancellation of service. As part of Comcast's \"routine and regular business practice,\" Comcast technicians provide the Subscriber Agreement to customers during installation and \"direct customers to read and accept the Subscriber Agreement.\" The Subscriber Agreement provides that a customer accepts its terms by using Comcast's Internet services after activation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Subscriber Agreement also provides, on its first page, that it \"\n   <strong>\n    CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION 13 THAT AFFECTS [A CUSTOMER'S] RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ALL SERVICE(S).\n   </strong>\n   \" (Emphasis in original.) The arbitration provision in Section 13 states that \"[a]ny Dispute involving you and Comcast shall be resolved through individual arbitration.\" The Subscriber Agreement defines a \"dispute\" as \"any claim or controversy related to Comcast.\" A customer may opt out of the arbitration provision by informing Comcast in writing within 30 days of the customer's Internet activation. Zean sent Comcast such an opt-out letter, dated December 22, 2016, nine months after the installation and activation of Zean's Internet service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Zean alleges that Comcast erroneously charged him for an August 2016 technical-support visit arising from Comcast's attempts to resolve Internet-connectivity issues. Comcast subsequently transferred the purported debt to Southwest for collection. Despite his protests, Zean alleges, both Comcast and Southwest used an automated telephone dialing system to call Zean in their efforts to collect the debt. Southwest also reported the debt to Trans Union, LLC,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the debt appeared on Zean's credit report. Zean seeks declaratory\n   relief stating that he does not owe the purported debt; alleges violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; the Fair Credit Reporting Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201681\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; and seeks damages in tort for invasion of privacy and defamation.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Zean stipulated to the dismissal of Trans Union, LLC, on February 21, 2018.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n     9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    , requires the enforcement of written agreements to arbitrate disputes and reflects a \"liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,\"\n    <em>\n     Moses H.

Comcast's Motion to Compel Arbitration\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    The crux of the question before the Court is whether the parties' contractual relationship includes a valid arbitration agreement and, if so, whether the present dispute falls within the scope of that agreement. Comcast argues that Section 13 of the Subscriber Agreement expressly requires Zean to arbitrate his claims against Comcast. Zean counters that his contract with Comcast includes only those terms that Zean agreed to during the February 26 telephone conversation with a Comcast representative, which do not include an arbitration provision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    <strong>\n     A.

Ct. App. 1992).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Zean and Comcast do not dispute that a valid contract was formed. Instead, the parties dispute the date of commencement and the terms of their contractual relationship. Zean argues that his contractual relationship with Comcast commenced during a February 26 telephone conversation between Zean and a Comcast representative. According to Zean, that conversation did not include any discussion of an arbitration provision and, for that reason, Zean's contract with Comcast does not include such a provision. But Zean's complaint\n    does not allege that his contract with Comcast commenced on February 26. Instead, Zean's complaint alleges that he entered into a one-year contract with Comcast on March 7, 2016-the same date that Comcast installed and activated Zean's Internet service.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    As to the terms of the contract, Comcast submits the declarations of Nicole Patel, who serves as Comcast's Director of Regulatory Compliance.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Patel declares that Zean received the Subscriber Agreement via e-mail in March 2016, and that it is Comcast's routine and regular business practice for Comcast technicians to provide the Subscriber Agreement to customers during the installation of Internet services. Patel also declares that Zean affirmatively acknowledged the terms of the Subscriber Agreement, and that the Subscriber Agreement is available online. These averments support the determination that Zean both received and accepted the terms of the Subscriber Agreement.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Schwartz v. Comcast Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3664360\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/256/515/#p518\">\n     256 F. App'x. 515\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 518 (3d Cir. 2007) (determining customer received subscriber agreement based, in part, on evidence detailing Comcast's routine methods of providing the subscriber agreement to its customers). Zean's affirmative conduct also indicates that he accepted the Subscriber Agreement. Zean paid installation and modem-rental fees shortly after Comcast installed his Internet service. Zean also wrote to Comcast nine months after the installation of his Internet service, seeking to opt out of the Subscriber Agreement's arbitration provision. These actions conform with the terms of the Subscriber Agreement and are inconsistent with Zean's argument that his contract with Comcast included only terms addressing the price, duration, and speed of his Internet service.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The Subscriber Agreement also contains numerous terms that are essential to a contract for Internet service, including terms governing the use of the Internet service, the ownership and leasing of equipment, cancellation, and dispute resolution. For this reason, the limited nature of Zean's purported contractual terms is objectively unreasonable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3664360\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/256/515/#p518\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3664360\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/256/515/#p518\">\n     at 519-20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (rejecting plaintiff's asserted terms of Internet contract as objectively unreasonable because no \"reasonable adult\" would accept plaintiff's position). Moreover, the Subscriber Agreement contains a merger clause stating that the Subscriber Agreement \"replace[s] any and all prior ... verbal agreements.\" This merger clause refutes Zean's contention that contract formation occurred orally during a telephone conversation on February 26.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.
