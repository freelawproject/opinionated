DANIELS, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Joel and Mary Rich bring this action against Defendants Fox News Network, LLC, Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman (together with Fox News, the \"Fox Defendants\"), and Fox News contributor Ed Butowsky asserting claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\") and for aiding and abetting and conspiring to intentionally inflict emotional distress on Plaintiffs. (Compl, ECF No. 7, \u00b6\u00b6 135-71.) Plaintiffs principally allege that Defendants conspired to cause Plaintiffs severe emotional distress by publishing a news article reporting that their son, Seth Rich, a former Democratic National Committee (\"DNC\") employee, was murdered for leaking sensitive, private emails from DNC servers to WikiLeaks. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs also assert a claim against all Defendants for tortious interference with Plaintiffs' contract with Fox News contributor and private investigator Rod Wheeler, as well as a claim against Fox News for its negligent supervision and/or retention of Zimmerman and Wheeler.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 172-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 35, 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants' motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim are GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs are the parents of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee (\"DNC\") employee who was murdered on July 10, 2016. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 13, 16.) Although the murder is still being investigated by the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (\"MPDC\") and remains unresolved, the MPDC's investigation supports the conclusion that Seth Rich's murder was the result of a botched robbery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) According to Plaintiffs, however, Defendants have publicized a different and patently fictitious story about the circumstances of their son's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 22, 2016, more than 44,000 private emails from the DNC were published on a website maintained by the organization known as WikiLeaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) According to Plaintiffs, a conspiracy theory developed among some political groups that Seth Rich was murdered because he provided the DNC emails to WikiLeaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 22.) On August 22, 2016, Plaintiffs issued a response to the conspiracy theory, which stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [S]ome are attempting to politicize this horrible tragedy, and in their attempts to do so, are actually causing more harm than good and impeding ... the ability of law enforcement to properly do their job. For the sake of finding Seth's killer, and for the sake of giving the family the space they need at this terrible time, they are asking for the public to refrain from pushing unproven and harmful theories about Seth's murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about December 17, 2016, Butowsky made contact with Plaintiffs through, a Facebook post indicating that he was \"looking to connect with anyone Jewish in Omaha[,] Nebraska.\" (Compl. \u00b6 25.) Butowsky spoke with Plaintiffs by phone and informed them that he had heard WikiLeaks received the DNC emails from Seth Rich. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) Plaintiffs, however, denied that their son had done so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) On January 3, 2017, Butowsky sent Joel Rich a follow-up email with the subject line, \"Please call ed [sic] Butowsky. We met through Jeremy from your temple.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   That same day, Zimmerman emailed Brad Bauman, who was handling press inquiries on Plaintiffs' behalf, asking for information about Seth Rich's murder. (Id. \u00b6 28.) When Bauman responded, Zimmerman wrote back that she \"would want to get the information directly from [Joel Rich] or law enforcement to ensure its accuracy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, on January 5, 2017, Zimmerman emailed Joel Rich requesting information about Seth for stories she was writing, claiming that she wanted to \"bring further attention to his case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) Joel Rich responded by sending Zimmerman information about Seth as well as photographs of him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 20, 2017, Butowsky called Joel Rich and encouraged him to look at Seth's bank account to see if there were any payments posted from WikiLeaks. Plaintiffs, however, again assured Butowsky\n   that rumors about Seth Rich and WikiLeaks were \"baseless.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 23, 2017, Butowsky sent a text message to Rod Wheeler stating that he was \"looking for some assistance on something that happened in Washington\" and asking him to call. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Wheeler, a former MPDC homicide detective turned private investigator, was then under contract with Fox News to appear as an on-air contributor, as well as to provide \"off-air assistance, as requested by Fox.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) When Wheeler called, Butowsky stated that he was working with Zimmerman at Fox News on an article about Seth Rich and wanted Wheeler to conduct an investigation into his murder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 28, 2017, Wheeler met with Butowsky and Zimmerman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Plaintiffs allege that Butowsky, Zimmerman, and Fox News \"sought to have Wheeler plausibly corroborate the sham story ... that Seth gave the DNC emails to WikiLeaks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) That same day, Butowsky sent an email to Plaintiffs offering to hire Wheeler on their behalf to investigate their son's murder, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) Wheeler also spoke with Plaintiffs directly about the prospective investigation, though he did not mention that he had met with Zimmerman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 3, 2017, Butowsky sent Joel Rich a draft of an engagement agreement between Plaintiffs and Wheeler, which stated that Wheeler would provide \"media representation\" for the Rich family and that he would \"[i]nterview, investigate, and represent\" Seth's family members \"in any and all media contacts and with regards to the official police investigation surrounding the death of Seth Rich.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Plaintiffs, however, told Butowsky and Wheeler that they would not allow Wheeler to serve as their media representative unless Plaintiffs would have complete control over the comments Wheeler made publicly on their behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.) Butowsky told Plaintiffs that he would accept Plaintiffs' condition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 5, 2017, Butowsky followed up and urged Plaintiffs to allow him to hire and pay for Wheeler's services on their behalf, appealing to their \"need to get closure, as a family.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) Butowsky assured Plaintiffs that his motivation in offering to pay Wheeler on Plaintiffs' behalf was purely altruistic, and that he was concerned about the rumors circulating about Seth, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Butowsky further assured Plaintiffs that he would not be involved any longer and that Wheeler would take his directions from, and provide all information directly to, Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Butowsky told Plaintiffs that they would \"never see me ever talk about this anywhere.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In a phone call with Joel Rich on March 13, 2017, Butowsky reiterated that he would respect Wheeler's obligation not to speak about his investigation to anyone but Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 14, 2017, Plaintiffs executed a contract with Wheeler's private investigation firm, Capitol Investigations, LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) The contract stated, among other things, that \"[t]he representation shall not include media representation, unless otherwise permitted by [Plaintiffs] in writing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) The contract also stated, \"Capitol Investigations shall not release any information regarding the investigation, including but not limited to findings, working theories or path [sic] forward to any third party without prior authorization by [Plaintiffs] unless that third party is an investigating agency, i.e. Metropolitan Police Department and the FBI.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 9, 2017, Wheeler sent a text message to Zimmerman stating, \"I'm ready to say Seths [sic] Death [sic] was not\n   a botched robbery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) On April 18, 2017, Butowsky sent Wheeler a text message stating that he would be \"meeting [White House Press Secretary] Sean Spicer and want you with me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) Wheeler and Butowsky met with Spicer two days later and provided Spicer with written materials relating to Wheeler's investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Neither Wheeler nor Butowsky asked Plaintiffs for permission prior to meeting with Spicer, nor had they informed Plaintiffs of the meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 24, 2017, and with Plaintiffs' approval, Wheeler obtained an interview with MPDC Detective Delia-Camera, the lead homicide detective investigating Seth Rich's murder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.) The night before the interview, Butowsky sent an email to Wheeler stating, \"Delia camera [sic] is either helping us or we will go after him as part of the coverup [sic].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) Zimmerman then sent Wheeler several emails, some of which were copied to Butowsky, with information about Detective Delia-Camera and the MPDC's investigation into Seth Rich's murder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 10, 2017, Butowsky and Zimmerman advised Wheeler that an FBI source had confirmed that emails were exchanged between Seth and WikiLeaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) Butowsky and Zimmerman also told Wheeler that they would be meeting with the source and would provide Wheeler with details from the meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Plaintiffs allege that, in fact, Zimmerman and Butowsky did not have such a source. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) The next day, Zimmerman sent Wheeler a copy of an article she had drafted for publication by Fox News (the \"Zimmerman/Fox Article\"), reporting on Seth Rich's alleged disclosure of DNC emails to WikiLeaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 72.) Zimmerman worked on and exchanged multiple drafts of the Zimmerman/Fox Article with Butowsky. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 15, 2017, Zimmerman told Wheeler that the \"bosses at Fox\" wanted the Zimmerman/Fox Article published the next day, while Butowsky left Wheeler a voicemail telling him to \"close this deal, whatever you got to do.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) That same day, Zimmerman also contacted Plaintiffs to request their comment on a FBI report showing that Seth Rich had disclosed the DNC emails to WikiLeaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.) Also on May 15, 2017, Wheeler spoke with Joel Rich about the Zimmerman/Fox Article, which Rich maintained was false. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nevertheless, on May 16, 2017, Fox News published the Zimmerman/Fox Article. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) The article contained a quote from an unnamed federal investigator stating, \"I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The article also noted that the federal investigator's \"revelation\" was \"consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich's family to probe the case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) In addition, the article quoted Wheeler as stating, \"[m]y investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.) Plaintiffs allege that the quotes attributed to the federal investigator and Wheeler were false. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87, 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Later that day, Fox News published a second article that stated, among other things, \"Rod Wheeler, a retired Washington [D.C.] homicide detective and Fox News contributor investigating the case on behalf of the Rich Family, made the WikiLeaks claim, which was corroborated by a federal investigator who spoke to Fox News.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.) The second article also stated that \"a spokesman for Rich's family on Tuesday said Wheeler was not authorized to speak for the family....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Over the next several days following the publication of both articles, Seth Rich's murder and the Zimmerman/Fox Article were covered on various Fox News programs and in other media sources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) In addition, on May 22, 2017, Wheeler issued a public media release indicating that he was \"of the personal opinion that the information/article reported by Fox News Channel was essentially correct and worthy of further investigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) However, the next day, Fox News issued a retraction of the Zimmerman/Fox Article, explaining that the article \"was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting!]\" and that \"[u]pon appropriate review, [it] was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106-07.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Even after the Zimmerman/Fox Article was retracted, various Fox News programs continued to discuss Seth Rich's murder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108.) Plaintiffs allege that this coverage was designed to \"exploit the sham story\" that was the subject of the Zimmerman/Fox Article in order to boost Fox News's ratings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109.) Plaintiffs further allege that Butowsky continued to publicly discuss the Zimmerman/Fox Article, including on Twitter. One Tweet, for example, suggested that Plaintiffs had confirmed that Aaron Rich, Seth's brother, received money from WikiLeaks in his personal bank account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113.) In addition, on August 16, 2017, Butowsky told National Public Radio that \"every word\" of the Zimmerman/Fox Article was true. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After the retraction of the Zimmerman/Fox Article, Butowsky remained in contact with Plaintiffs. On May 25, 2017, for instance, Butowsky sent Joel Rich a text message stating, in part, \"I kept thinking at some point you would explain the things written about me were not true but you never did .... The idea that I conspired to do something which I have no idea what that could've been is complete hogwash made up by ... Bauman.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111.) The text message stated further, \"You should call Malia Zimmerman. She found the person and the gun that was used to shoot your son.... When you find out who did it you are going to be very very emotional.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege that Butowsky continued calling, texting, and leaving voicemails for Joel Rich. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that the Zimmerman/Fox Article, together with the Defendants' overall conduct, has caused them \"intense distress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.) Plaintiffs allege that they both now exhibit symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive behavior and that Mary Rich experiences symptoms consistent with social anxiety disorder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130-31.) Plaintiffs further allege that they experience feelings of anxiety, and have developed a \"hypersensitivity to potentially being harassed, threatened, and harmed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 132(A)-(B).) As a result, they claim they have installed three video cameras outside their home to detect unwanted visitors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132(B).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In addition, Plaintiffs allege that Mary Rich was laid off shortly before her son's death, but that she had received a job offer on the same night that the Zimmerman/Fox Article was published. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133.) Plaintiffs allege that as a result of the publication of the Zimmerman/Fox Article and subsequent media coverage, she became distraught and was unable to accept the job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs further allege that although Mary Rich had a \"preexisting neurological condition, which was being managed with regular treatment,\" her condition has become aggravated such that she has been unable to return to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

THE COMPLAINT FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs assert several state law claims against Fox News, Zimmerman, and Butowsky for IIED, as well as conspiring to commit and aiding and abetting IIED, and tortious interference with contract. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 136-44, 146-56, 158-71, 173-77.)

Litig.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3976160\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/826/478/#p520\">\n     826 F.Supp.2d 478\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 520 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). Although Plaintiffs assert that the \"[c]omplaint alleges a wide range of economic damages,\" Plaintiffs characterize these damages as the \"result of Wheeler's breach of contract\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    cooperation with Defendants to publish the [Zimmerman/]Fox Article.\" (Opp'n at 32 (emphasis added).) Thus, Plaintiffs have not specifically identified damages that are attributable to Defendants' interference with Wheeler's contract, rather than the reputational and emotional injury caused by the publication of the Zimmerman/Fox Article.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
