We adhere to the view explicated by this court in the case of <em>Kistler v. N.J. Mfts. Ins. Co., </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>324, 331 (App.Div.1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">\" \u2019 * * To our mind, <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(6) was never intended to apply to a direct monetary claim by an insured against his carrier but only to those situations in which an insured was constrained to bring suit to enforce the provisions of a liability or indemnity policy whereby the carrier was obliged to defend and indemnify. The rule refers to a policy of liability or indemnity and does not by its terms apply to direct loss by the insured, such as might be occasioned by fire, theft or collision, so as to permit a counsel fee award to an insured who brings suit against his insured to enforce casualty-type direct coverage.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Accordingly, that portion of the order for judgment of the Law Division, dated November 5, 1979, granting judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant \u201cfor counsel fees of plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u201d and for disbursements in the amounts of $10,600 and $1,292.03, respectively, is reversed and set aside; and the cause is remanded to the Law Division with directions to amend said order for judgment by denying plaintiff\u2019s application for judgment against defendant for counsel fees and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b550-9\">FRANCIS, J.A.D., dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>I would affirm the judgment of the Law Division substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Petrella in his oral opinion of October 19, 1979. <em>Maros v. Transamerica Insurance Company, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>572, 579 (1978) is authority for the allowance of counsel fees in appropriate first party actions against insurance companies. Moreover, in <em>Maros </em>the Court cited with approval <em>Corcoran v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 244-245 (App.Div.1975). In that case the action was not only a first party action, it was a casualty type insurance policy and, in my view, is indistinguishable in principle from the present action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
