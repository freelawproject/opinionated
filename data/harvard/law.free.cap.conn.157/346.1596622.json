The defendants are the owners of a building in which the plaintiff was employed. A large asphalted parking area, also owned by the defendants, adjoins the building on two sides. A sidewalk runs along the front of the building, parallel to it, and extends to State Street. Another sidewalk runs through the parking area, extending from the building out to James Street. The plaintiff alleged that, as she was leaving her place of employment about 5 p.m. on January 2, 1964, she walked over the parking area to get to James Street and, owing to the negligence of the defendants, fell on an accumulation of ice in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Among the defendants\u2019 many assignments of error, there are several which are related to rulings by the trial court in connection with a question as to the precise location of the plaintiff\u2019s fall. In her original complaint dated December 23, 1964, the plaintiff alleged that she was walking over a parking area \u201clocated west of, next to, adjacent and in front of\u201d the building and that in the parking area \u201cand particularly at about ten feet in from the sidewalk\u201d there was an accumulation of ice and snow. In compliance with an order of the court granting a motion of the defendants that the plaintiff be required to make her complaint more specific by stating the location of the alleged fall, the plaintiff, on October 1, 1965, filed an amendment to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>complaint which alleged the place of the fall to be \u201c[i]n the said parking area, and particularly at about ten feet in from the sidewalk and at a point from near the right end of the large \u2018Lee Beaehwear\u2019 sign as one faces the building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The case was reached for trial in September, 1966. The record discloses that during a discussion in chambers counsel for the plaintiff requested permission to amend the complaint to designate the location of her fall as being at a point opposite the left end, instead of the right end, of the Beaehwear sign as one faces the building. The record discloses nothing further about this chambers discussion. Later, in open court, after the jury were selected, the plaintiff moved for permission to file a substituted complaint changing the allegation as to the place where she fell. The defendants strenuously objected, pointing out that in 1965 the precise location of the fall had been described as a result of their motion for a more specific statement, that in January, 1966, following this amendment, they had taken a deposition from the plaintiff and that the parties had had two pretrial sessions, all without any suggestion from the plaintiff that her pleading would be further amended. In support of their opposition they aptly cited the case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Toscano, </em>144 Conn. 582, 136 A.2d 341. It appears that the newly alleged location of the fall was between fifty and one hundred feet away from the location originally claimed. The plaintiff claimed that the location specified in her more specific statement was \u201ca typographical error at most.\u201d Despite the defendants\u2019 objections, the court permitted the substituted complaint to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Subsequently, in the course of the cross-examina,tion of the plaintiff, the defendants\u2019 attorney made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>reference to a sketch which he claimed was drawn by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney in the plaintiff\u2019s presence at the time her deposition was taken and which pinpointed the location of the fall with relation to the building and the street lines. The defense counsel claimed that the sketch showed the location of the plaintiff\u2019s fall as being at the point originally alleged and not at the location as to which the plaintiff testified at the trial. The sketch was admitted as an exhibit for identification, and the point marked thereon is as the defense counsel has claimed. When the sketch was shown to the plaintiff, she denied any knowledge of it. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney denied that he drew the sketch.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At this point the defendants moved for a mistrial. Their counsel again represented to the court that, when the plaintiff\u2019s deposition was being taken in January, 1966 (when the alleged location of the fall was as originally claimed), there was some confusion as to the precise spot in question and, in the presence of the plaintiff, her attorney drew the layout of the parking lot and marked the specific location where the alleged fall occurred \u2014 which was the location alleged in the original complaint as amended on October 1, 1965, and not as the plaintiff was testifying as a witness. He claimed that he had no reason to believe that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney would deny that he had done so or that the plaintiff would deny knowledge of the sketch. Under the circumstances, he requested that the court declare a mistrial so that other counsel could appear for the defendants and he could be a witness to testify that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had drawn the sketch and marked on it the spot where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the plaintiff claimed to have fallen so that it could be marked as a full exhibit. The court denied the motion and ordered defense counsel \u201cnot to make any reference to this document hereafter.\u201d It also refused to permit defense counsel to read to the jury the paragraphs of the original complaint and amendment which were inconsistent with the testimony of the plaintiff, even though those pleadings had been admitted as full exhibits in the case. This ruling was clearly erroneous and contrary to well-established practice. See <em>Billings\u2019 Appeal, </em>49 Conn. 456, 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The court then permitted the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to read to the jury seven pages from the plaintiff\u2019s deposition, reciting details of her fall as related on her redirect examination \u201cto indicate whether her testimony is consistent or not.\u201d The court allowed the reading \u201cto show that the alleged inconsistency is not so according to the deposition.\u201d The portions of the deposition which were read to the jury did not specify in which of the two areas of the parking lot the plaintiff fell and did not precisely locate any particular place of the plaintiff\u2019s fall. The court, nevertheless, denied the defendant\u2019s motion that it be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Rulings on motions to amend pleadings and to order mistrials lie in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Teitelman </em>v. <em>Bloomstein, </em>155 Conn. 653, 662, 236 A.2d 900; <em>Antonofsky </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>144 Conn. 594, 598, 136 A.2d 338; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Toscano, </em>supra, 587. The discretion, however, is a legal discretion and is subject to review. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Lawlor, </em>139 Conn. 68, 71, 90 A.2d 164. The general principle is that a mistrial should be granted when, as a result of some occurrence at the trial, it is apparent that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial and the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>proceedings are vitiated. Considering all of the circumstances of the case, the court\u2019s erroneous rulings, and particularly the obvious prejudice to the defendants arising from the plaintiff\u2019s belated substituted complaint and the unanticipated and now-altered denial by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that he did in fact draw the sketch pinpointing the site of the plaintiff\u2019s fall, we are constrained to hold that a new trial should he ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Since a new trial is necessary, there is no need to discuss the remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-5\"> During the argument of the appeal in this court, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel changed his flat denial to a claim that he did not remember drawing the sketch.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
