The motion was overruled, and, without having again pleaded, the party was convicted after a trial on the merits.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b46-10\"><em>Held, </em>that the conviction was valid. If the defendant failed to plead over, it was the duty of the Court to enter a plea of not guilty for him, and the failure to enter it did not affect his rights, and was only a defect of form, which, under the <em>statute </em>\u2014 Comp. <em>L. </em>6013 \u2014 will not authorize a reversal of the judgment.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AN\">\n<em>Heard July 9th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AuG\">\n<em>Decided July 11th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-12\">Error to Ontonagon Circuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-13\">Plaintiff in error pleaded not guilty to an information for burglary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-14\">Eor the purpose of making a motion to quash, leave was granted to withdraw his plea of not guilty.

Law Repos. </em>510.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-9\">A plea or answer to the information was requisite at common law, and as to proceedings upon arraignment and plea generally, see 1 <em>Chit. Or. L. </em>414; <em>Whart. Am. Or. L. </em>530; <em>Rose. Or. JSv. </em>224; 1 <em>Arch. Or.

L. </em>\u00a7 6038 \u2014 directing that the court shall order a plea of not guilty to be entered when defendant refuses to plead, not only assumes there must be a plea, but requires it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-12\">So held on a similar statute. \u2014 1 <em>Ala. </em>655.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-13\"><em>Wm.

The court thereupon adjourned until the next day, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the defendant was allowed to withdraw his plea; and the motion to quash was taken up, and, after argument, denied, and the cause was ordered to proceed. A motion was then made by the defendant for a continuance, and an affidavit in support of the motion was read and filed. The defendant\u2019s counsel and the prosecuting attorney were heard upon this motion, and, after argument, the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">A jury was then called and sworn in the cause, to which no objection appears to have been made; and the court thereupon adjourned till the next day, when, as the record states, \u201cthe jury, after having heard the proofs and allegations of the parties, the argument of counsel, and the charge of the court, retired from the bar thereof, under charge of Duncan Ross, an officer of the court, duly sworn foi\" that purpose, to consider of their verdict to be given; and, after being absent for a time, returned into court, and say, upon their oath, that they find the said Charles Hensche guilty in manner and form as the people have in their information in this cause, charged.\u201d The court thereupon adjourned till the next day, when a motion was made by defendant to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, on five distinct grounds, but making no objection on the ground that defendant had not pleaded to the information, or that no plea was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The record does not show what action was had upon this motion; and, on the same day, a motion was made by defendant in arrest of judgment, for several reasons going to the propriety of the information and the prosecuting attorney\u2019s right to file it, <em>mid also </em>\u201cbecause the trial was had, and the verdict of the jury thereon was rendered, upon no plea of the prisoner, or issue in the case; but without any plea and without any issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The record does not inform us of the action taken upon this motion, except by the inference of its denial to be drawn from the entry of the judgment, or sentence by the Court, on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>From tlie facts appearing upon the record, the substance of which is above stated, we think it evident that the defendant, the prosecuting attorney and the Court, treated the withdrawal of the plea as merely temporary, for the purpose only of allowing his motion for quashing the information to be heard. And when that motion was disposed of, the Court and the parties considered and treated the plea as again restored and standing in foil force.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The trial appears to have been had, in all respects, in the same manner, as if the plea had been again entered, or as if no motion to quash had been made, and the plea had stood as when originally interposed. And we think it entirely clear, from the record, that the defendant has had the same full benefit of the plea as if it had been again, formally entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">To make the proceedings regular <em>in </em>form, however, the defendant should again have put in his plea of not guilty, or, neglecting to do so, as he did not \u201cconfess the information to be true,\u201d the Court should, under the statute \u2014 <em>Comp. L. </em>\u00a76038 \u2014 have ordered the plea of not guilty to be entered for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The object of this statute was to give to a defendant the benefits of a plea of not guilty, though he should refuse or fail to plead; an object which has been folly accomplished in the present' case, though the plea was not again formally entered\". And the Court might, when the objection was first raised, or at any subsequent time, order the plea to be entered <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Under the facts of this case it was a matter purely formal, and cured by \u00a7 6043 <em>Comp. L. </em>which provides that \u201cNo indictment shall be quashed or deemed invalid, nor shall the trial, judgment <em>or oilier proceedings </em>thereon be affected,\u201d by reason of any defect or imperfection in matters of form which shall not tend to the prejudice of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>There is no error in the record, and the judgment of the Circuit Court must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b50-5\">Cooley and Campbell JJ. concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b50-6\">Martin Oh.
