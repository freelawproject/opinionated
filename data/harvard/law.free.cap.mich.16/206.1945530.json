Tbat wben Gillett made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>payment, the plaintiffs had a right to rest another six years, and then proceed against the defendant for the balance of the account, and such payment would save it from being-barred by the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\">Judgment was'rendered for plaintiff below.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-6\"><em>A. L. Millard, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-7\">The claim was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-8\">The payments made by Gillett upon the notes given by him for the amount which he agreed to pay upon the compromise with the plaintiffs, would not operate to save the remainder of the debt, which was, by agreement of all parties, assigned to Sigler, from the bar of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-9\">The intention and effect of the compromise arrangement between the several parties, was to divide the debt and sever the liability of Sigler <em>&amp; </em>Gillett, each being thereafter liable for a separate portion of the debt. Gillett gave his several notes, some of them with an endorser, for the amount agreed upon for his share, and on paying them he no longer had any liability for the remainder, for which Sigler was alone liable. The payments made by Gillett, after this arrangement, were not upon joint account, but for the purpose of discharging his several obligations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-10\">And even if he had made the payments directly on the copartnership indebtedness, being done after the dissolution of the partnership, it would not take the case out of the statute as against the other partner.\u2014 <em>Story on Part. </em>\u00a7\u00a7323, 324, <em>'et sup.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-11\">A payment or acknowledgment of. a debt, in order to take a case out of the statute, must be an unequivocal and unqualified acknowledgment of the indebtedness, as then existing.\u2014 1 <em>Peters, </em>351.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-12\">It cannot be claimed that the act of Gillett in paying his own notes was such an acknowledgment of the debt now sued for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>It would not be such an acknowledgment even as to Q-illett. It was not a recognition, even by him, of the balance of the original indebtedness, not included in the notes. He was bound to pay these notes, whether the original indebtedness still subsisted or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-5\">And if it would not amount to such acknowledgment as to G-illett, much less would it as to Sigler. \u00ab</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-6\">The written agreement of Sigler did not constitute Gillett the agent of the former. It did not, and was not intended to confer any authority or power on Gillett to do any thing for him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-7\">As a joint debtor he had authority to pay the debt, and this agreement gave him no additional power in that regard. The stipulation that what he paid or secured should enure to the benefit of both, was intended to secure a benefit to Sigler; not to authorize Gillett to charge him by any act or admission of his.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-8\">There is a manifest difference between an authority for one to discharge, and to charge another. \u2014 1 <em>Peters, </em>351, (388) <em>etsup.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-9\">And if this stipulation meant no more than that whatever sum was paid by Gillett should operate to cancel the indebtedness as against Sigler, as well as Gillett, to the extent merely of the amount actually paid (though we do not think that was what it meant), then it was of no effect whatever, as such would be the effect of such payment without any such stipulation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-10\">Such a payment as this by Gillett (payment of part, with the express understanding that he was not to j&gt;ay any more), is not an implied promise to pay the residue, but the reverse, and will not take a case out of the <em>statute. </em>\u2014 kMich. 508.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-11\"><em>\u00c1. Pond, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b209-12\">Campbell J.</author>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">Suit was brought by Platt against Sigler to charge him individually, under a sealed instrument, whereby he agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>to hold himself personally liable, upon so much of certain partnership demands against himself, and one Augustus B. Gillett, as should not be secured or paid by Gillett, whom he authorized to compound with the creditors for his own release. This suit was to recover of Sigler the balance not paid by Gillett, and the declaration was a special one, founded on the agreement. Sigler pleaded the general issue, and relied also on the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The principal questions arise under the statute of limitations. It is claimed by Sigler that payments made by Gillett, after the special agreement became operative, can not be regarded as payments which could operate to renew or keep alive any liability against any one but himself, and that more than six years having elapsed without any other recognition of liability, this action is barred. It is claimed on the other side that this agreement is not subject to the six years\u2019 bar, and also that such payments are evidence against Sigler.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">This is an -action of assumpsit upon an express agreement, and it is included within subdivision I of section 5361 of the <em>Compiled Laws, </em>requiring all actions of assumpsit to be brought within six years. The only question is, therefore, whether any payment or acknowledgment has saved the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The purpose of the agreement sued upon was to sever the liabilities of the former partners, Gillett being allowed to settle separately with the creditors for his own benefit, and not for the benefit or on the account of Sigler. The creditors who dealt with him, in reliance on the agreement, did so expressly for his advantage. By accepting the proposal they made Sigler their sole debtor for his portion of the debt, whatever that might be. He never agreed to be liable alone for the whole, and the dealings with Gillett extinguished it as a joint claim. There is no authority given or implied which could justify any reliance on Gillett\u2019s action under this contract as had in behalf of Sigler. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>suit is not on the original claim, but on the latter\u2019s private undertaking of October 19th, 1858, and any promise or recognition thereafter could only he valid when made by Sigler, or by his individual authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">All evidence of G-illett\u2019s subsequent acts was, therefore, immaterial, and incompetent to charge Sigler. There being no proof of any other acts of recognition, the claim appears to have become outlaAved. The court below erred in holding G-illett\u2019s payments binding against Sigler so as to avoid the statutory bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">As this will dispose of the case, we do not deem it necessary to consider the remaining errors assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-8\">The other justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
