In her sole issue, Baty complains that the trial court erred by determining that her amended expert report was deficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM.

Olga Futrell, a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), administered retrobulbar anesthesia during the procedure, which is generally described as anesthesia behind the eyeball. During the administration of the anesthesia, Futrell allegedly inserted a needle into Baty's left optic nerve, which eventually resulted in permanent blindness in her left eye.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Baty sued Futrell for negligence and Complete Anesthesia Care, P.C., Futrell's employer, alleging that it was vicariously liable for Futrell's negligent acts. Baty\n   served and attached an expert report authored by Dr. Steven Chalfin with her original petition. Futrell and CAC filed timely objections to Chalfin's report, and motions to dismiss Baty's claims, contending that Chalfin's report was inadequate and failed to satisfy the statutory requirements for a healthcare liability expert report. Because the parties agreed that Chalfin's first report was deficient, one thirty-day extension of time was granted to allow Baty to cure the deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Baty thereafter submitted Chalfin's amended expert report to Futrell and CAC. Futrell and CAC filed timely objections alleging that the amended expert report was deficient as to all essential elements of a health care liability claim (standard of care, breach of the standard of care, and causation); Futrell and CAC also filed amended motions to dismiss and requested a hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court sustained Futrell and CAC's objections to the amended expert report as being deficient, and granted their amended motions to dismiss. Pursuant to the trial court's orders, all claims asserted by Baty were dismissed with prejudice. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Health Care Liability Claim Expert Reports\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A plaintiff asserting a health care liability claim must serve each defendant with an expert report that includes \"a fair summary of the expert's opinions ... regarding applicable standards of care, the manner in which the care rendered by the physician or health care provider failed to meet the standards, and the causal relationship between that failure and the injury, harm, or damage claimed.\" TEX.

TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 74.351(r)(6). Identifying the standard of care is critical because whether a defendant breached his or her duty to a patient cannot be ascertained without specific information as to what the defendant should have done differently.\n   <em>\n    Palacios,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11094124,11094165\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/46/873/\">\n    46 S.W.3d at 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The amended expert report authored by Chalfin, and relied on by Baty, states the standard of care to be as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   In evaluating and providing medical care for a patient such as Mrs. Baty, the standard of care for an ordinarily prudent practitioner such as a MD or CRNA requires:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1. Adequate preoperative assessment of the patient;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   2. Adequate communication with the patient and/or the patient's family;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   3.

In the case of retrobulbar anesthetic blocks, administering the block in the proper manner to preclude injuring the delicate structures of the orbit, including the globe and optic nerve.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Additionally, in Chalfin's summary of the medical care that was provided to Baty, he states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Of note, the initial block attempt produced inadequate akinesia and anesthesia, so a second retrobulbar block attempt was performed (Refs. 6, 11). This is significant because complications such as globe penetration and optic nerve injury are more common when blocks require augmentation (additional needle sticks). This is due to the fact that the initial injection volume can distort the anatomy of the orbital structures, and lead to injury by the needle on the subsequent attempt. For this reason, many Opthalmic surgeons augment an inadequate block by using a\n   blunt cannula inserted via a conjunctival incision, rather than a needle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Baty argues the language above provides an adequate description of the applicable standard of care because all that was required to satisfy the standard of care element was for the amended report to state that (1) it was erroneous for Futrell to place the needle into Baty's optic nerve, and (2) Futrell should not have done so. Baty contends that no additional explanation of what constitutes the applicable standard of care is necessary. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"While a 'fair summary' is something less than a full statement of the applicable standard of care ... even a fair summary must set out what care was expected, but not given.\"\n   <em>\n    Palacios,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11094124,11094165\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/46/873/\">\n    46 S.W.3d at 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the standard of care is defined by what an ordinarily prudent healthcare provider would have done under the same or similar circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11094124,11094165\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/46/873/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, despite Baty's efforts to cure the report's deficiencies, Chalfin's amended expert report is conclusory, inadequate, and does not satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Palacios\n   </em>\n   objective \"good faith\" standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because the statements outlined in the amended expert report are conclusory, numerous matters are unexplained. For example, what constitutes: (1) an adequate preoperative assessment of the patient; (2) adequate communication with the patient concerning the procedure to be performed; (3) an adequate level of training, skill, and competence to perform this procedure? At a minimum, the amended expert report should specify and articulate what procedures and testing are necessary to perform the retrobulbar block, and the level of skill and competence that is required for a CRNA, such as Futrell, to successfully do so. Further, what is the \"proper manner\" to administer the retrobulbar block ? What should be done by a CRNA under the circumstances to avoid injury to a patient? The amended expert report is silent on these queries, and one is left to infer what Futrell should have done differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Clearly, the amended report does not specify what actions, procedures, or treatment was either required or\n   <em>\n    should have been\n   </em>\n   performed or provided by Futrell while administering the retrobulbar block to Baty. In fact, the amended report does not (1) identify or articulate the applicable standard of care for a CRNA when performing a retrobulbar block procedure, (2) describe what actions or courses of action are encompassed within the requisite standard of care for performing said procedure, or (3) even explain, as it should, how an ordinarily prudent CRNA\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   perform this procedure under the same or similar circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amended report does not properly analyze Futrell's specific conduct in treating Baty in accordance with the applicable standard of care, or how Futrell's compliance with the requisite standard of care would have avoided injury to her. Moreover, there is no explanation recited in the amended report as to what actions or procedures a reasonably prudent healthcare professional, such as Futrell, should take to avoid inserting a needle into a patient's optic nerve in the event a first injection for a retrobulbar block was insufficient. As such, the failure to explain or articulate in Chalfin's amended report what specific actions and precautions were required and\n   <em>\n    should have\n   </em>\n   been\n   taken by Futrell to properly treat Baty in this instance is fatal to her recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It is conclusory to state that Futrell should not have placed the needle into the optic nerve of Baty's left eye, as Chalfin has opined. Common sense dictates that a healthcare provider should not insert a needle into a patient's optic nerve. Nevertheless, common sense and the standards of care which must be adhered to by healthcare professionals are not synonymous. Further, the additional statements made by Chalfin in his summary of Baty's medical care (which only attempts to articulate the standard of care for a surgeon, rather than for a CRNA) are insufficient and cannot provide a basis for determining what the proper standard of care\n   <em>\n    should be\n   </em>\n   for an ordinarily prudent healthcare professional that is treating a patient under the same or similar circumstances. In light of these inadequate statements, one must again infer as to what the healthcare professional should do. Because it is improper to speculate or make inferences in this context, we cannot say that Chalfin's description in his amended report of a procedure that is used by \"many\" surgeons is sufficient to establish that this alternative procedure is part of the recognized standard of care for a CRNA such as Futrell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The trial court's determination to sustain the objections to the amended expert report and to grant the motions to dismiss was not outside of the zone of reasonable disagreement. Because the amended expert report is silent as to Futrell's duties and what an ordinarily prudent CRNA\n   <em>\n    should have\n   </em>\n   done in this instance, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that Baty's claims were meritless. Although Baty's circumstances are most unfortunate, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Baty's claims with prejudice. Therefore, Baty's sole issue is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To survive a dismissal of asserted healthcare liability claims, a plaintiffs expert report must adequately address each of the three required statutory elements. The failure to satisfy even one of the statutory elements will bar recovery. Here, Baty's amended expert report is inadequate, conclusory, and fails to satisfy the standard of care requirement as to Futrell. Because of these deficiencies, the amended expert report cannot resurrect the vicarious liability claims that Baty has asserted against CAC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gardner v.

Futrell, a nurse anesthetist, administered retrobulbar anesthesia for the procedure; he allegedly extended the needle into Baty's left optic nerve and caused permanent nerve damage and loss of sight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Dr. Chalfin's seven-page, single-spaced amended report is divided into six sections. He first discusses his experience, training, and education, stating that he is a board-certified ophthalmologist and has performed over 3,500 retrobulbar blocks. There is no dispute as to his qualifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In the second and third sections of the amended report, Dr. Chalfin provides a list of the medical records and documents that he reviewed in developing his opinions and a summary of the medical care provided to Baty from March 23, 2011, the date of the cataract surgery, to June 18, 2012. Dr. Chalfin begins with a summary of the cataract surgery performed by Dr. Kemp:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Dr. Kemp performed phacoemulsificationcataract extraction, left eye, with implantation of an intraocular lens on 23 March, 2011. The surgery was performed under retrobulbar anesthesia administered by Olga Futrell, CRNA. Of note, the initial block attempt produced inadequate akinesia and anesthesia, so a second retrobulbar block attempt was performed (Refs. 6, 11). This is significant because complications such as globe penetration and optic nerve injury are more common when blocks require augmentation (additional needle sticks). This is due to the fact that the initial injection volume can distort the anatomy of the orbital structures, and lead to injury by the needle on the subsequent attempt. For this reason, many Ophthalmic surgeons augment an inadequate block by using a blunt cannula inserted via a conjunctival incision, rather than a needle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Dr. Chalfin's continued summary details that at least two other subsequent treating physicians have opined that Baty's vision loss was probably caused by the retrobulbar block.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The last three sections of Dr. Chalfin's amended report discuss the standard of care, breach of the standard of care, and causation, respectively, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF CARE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   In evaluating and providing medical care for a patient such as Mrs. Baty, the standard of care for an ordinarily prudent practitioner such as a MD or CRNA requires:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   1.

In that section of his report, Dr. Chalfin begins with a summary of the anesthesia aspect of the cataract surgery performed by Dr. Kemp:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   The surgery was performed under retrobulbar anesthesia administered by Olga Futrell, CRNA. Of note, the initial block attempt produced inadequate akinesia and anesthesia, so a second retrobulbar block attempt was performed. This is significant because complications such as globe penetration and optic nerve injury are more common when blocks require augmentation (additional needle sticks). This is due to the fact that the initial injection volume can distort the anatomy of the orbital structures, and lead to injury by the needle on the subsequent attempt. For this reason, many Ophthalmic surgeons augment an inadequate block by using a blunt cannula inserted via a conjunctival incision, rather than a needle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Dr. Chalfin then details that at least two other subsequent treating physicians have opined that Baty's vision loss was probably caused by the retrobulbar block :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   The patient was examined by Dr. O'Malley on 3 June, 2011. On that visit the visual acuity was measured at 20/150-2. The patient was noted to have an afferent papillary defect in the left eye. An OCT showed central thinning of the nerve fiber layer when compared to the study performed in March, 2011. Dr. O'Malley stated that his impression was \"L CRAO (central retinal artery occlusion ) with residual central scotoma. Told will be permanent scotoma-\n   <em>\n    most likely a complication of RB (retrobulbar) or peribulbar injection\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   The patient was examined by Dr. Robert Tenery on 18 June, 2012. Dr. Tenery found optic atrophy of the left eye and noted that the patient \"lost central VA OS during LE + IOL probably from retrobulbar block.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   In short, Dr. Chalfin's report states that the standard of care required Futrell to administer the retrobulbar block in a manner that did not injure Baty's optic nerve, that Futrell breached the standard of care by \"[i]rreparably damaging Mrs. Baty's left optic nerve during the administration of the retrobulbar block by sticking it with the retrobulbar needle,\" and that this breach caused Baty's loss of vision in her left eye. And according to Dr. Chalfin, at least two other physicians are of the opinion that Futrell's \"needle stick\" injured Baty's optic nerve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Futrell and CAC argue that Dr. Chalfin's causation opinion is conclusory. I disagree; his opinion, including his permissible reliance on Baty's medical records, plainly provides \"enough information linking the defendant's breach of the standard of care to the plaintiff's injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Salais,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323538\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/323/527/#p536\">\n    323 S.W.3d at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Dr. Chalfin's report represents an objective good-faith effort to comply with the definition of an expert report because it adequately addresses at least one pleaded liability theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Certified EMS,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7095189\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/392/625/#p632\">\n    392 S.W.3d at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
