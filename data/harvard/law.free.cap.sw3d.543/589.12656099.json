Draper III, Judge\n   Jack Alpert (hereinafter, \"Alpert\") filed a declaratory judgment action against the state of Missouri, the attorney general, and the prosecuting attorney for Johnson County, Missouri (hereinafter and collectively, \"the state\"), seeking a declaration the state could not enforce section 571.070, RSMo Supp. 2013,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against him without violating article I, section 23 of the Missouri Constitution and the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. This Court holds Alpert's pre-enforcement constitutional challenges are ripe for determination, and section 571.070 withstands constitutional scrutiny. The circuit court's judgment is affirmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 1970, Alpert pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance in Pettis County, Missouri, and was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In 1975, Alpert pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance in federal district court and received a two-year sentence. Alpert successfully completed both sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 1983, Alpert filed an application pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) with the United States attorney general to restore his right to possess a firearm, which was prohibited due to his felony convictions. Alpert's application was granted. In 1986, Alpert applied for a federal firearms license, class 01 (hereinafter, \"FFL01 license\"), a three-year, renewable license, permitting one to deal firearms. After the license was issued, Alpert began buying and selling firearms. Alpert's license was renewed regularly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2007, Alpert founded Missouri Bullet Company (hereinafter, \"MBC\"), a cast bullet manufacturer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2008, the General Assembly amended section 571.070, making it unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a felony under Missouri law \"or of a crime under the laws of any state or of the United States which, if committed within this state, would be a felony,\" to possess a firearm. When Alpert attempted to renew his FFL01 license, he was told he could not because of the 2008 amendment to section 571.070. Consequently, Alpert was required to surrender his FFL01 license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Alpert filed a declaratory judgment action raising facial and as-applied challenges to section 571.070. Alpert sought a declaration that section 571.070 could not be enforced against him without violating the Missouri and United States constitutions. Alpert set forth facts demonstrating his law-abiding behavior since completing his sentences and having his federal gun rights restored. Alpert's petition further alleged he wished to possess two family heirloom pistols and a rifle he was awarded in 1993. Alpert maintained his claims were ripe because the facts necessary to adjudicate the claims were developed fully, section 571.070 affected him in a manner giving rise to an immediate, concrete dispute, and he lacked an adequate remedy at law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties filed competing motions for summary judgment. Alpert alleged section 571.070 was unconstitutional as applied to him because it was underinclusive, overinclusive, and its prohibition barring felons from possessing firearms was not longstanding. The state countered Alpert's claims were not ripe because he was not being prosecuted or threatened with prosecution for violating section 571.070. The state also argued Alpert, as a convicted felon, categorically was excluded from Second Amendment protections, and, therefore, his facial and as-applied challenges must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The circuit court sustained the state's motion. The circuit court rejected the state's ripeness argument, finding it would be improper to bar Alpert's pre-enforcement action because it would require him to violate the law before proceeding. The circuit court held section 571.070 did not violate the Missouri or United States constitution primarily because felons categorically are removed from the group of people who can claim the protections of those constitutional provisions. Alpert appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Ripeness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This Court first must determine whether Alpert's constitutional claims are ripe. The state argues Alpert's challenges are not ripe because he failed to present sufficient facts to establish a fully developed claim, and section 571.070 does not affect Alpert such that there is an immediate, concrete dispute. The state further maintains Alpert has not been charged with violating section 571.070, he has not been threatened with prosecution, there is no evidence he currently possesses any firearms, and he has other remedies at law. Alpert counters the state sought summary judgment and did not present any disputed facts requiring further development. Alpert also contends he demonstrated an immediate, concrete dispute existed because he was able to possess firearms lawfully from the time his rights were restored in 1986 until 2008 when section 571.070 was amended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The stated purpose of the declaratory judgment act is to allow parties 'to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations.' \"\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Kan. v.

Assuming\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    this Court adopted the two-step framework in\n    <em>\n     Binderup\n    </em>\n    , Alpert's claim would fail. Unlike the\n    <em>\n     Binderup\n    </em>\n    challengers, Alpert falls into the category of\n    <em>\n     serious\n    </em>\n    offenders traditionally prohibited from possessing firearms under\n    <em>\n     Marzzarella\n    </em>\n    's first step. Although Alpert characterizes his offenses as \"minor drug crimes at a time when most offenders like him would receive probation,\" he downplays the fact he received both state and federal\n    <em>\n     felony\n    </em>\n    drug convictions, requiring him to serve prison time. This contrasts with the\n    <em>\n     Binderup\n    </em>\n    challengers, both of whom were state misdemeanants, not sentenced to jail time, and whose crimes were considered non-serious in several jurisdictions.\n    <em>\n     Binderup\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     836 F.3d at 352-53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Binderup\n    </em>\n    noted it was not presented with an instance in which the disqualifying offense was considered a felony by the authority that created the crime, but stated, \"it is possible to read\n    <em>\n     Heller\n    </em>\n    to leave open the possibility, however remote, of a successful as-applied challenge by someone convicted of such an offense.

First, Alpert claims his challenge is based on a more rigorous form of strict scrutiny than applied in prior challenges. However, as this Court stated in\n    <em>\n     Clay\n    </em>\n    , \"section 571.070.1's restriction on the possession of weapons by felons survives even the most stringent formulation of the strict scrutiny standard in that it is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.\"\n    <em>\n     Clay\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819956\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/481/531/#p532\">\n     481 S.W.3d at 535\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Alpert has not cited any case in which a Second Amendment claim was subject to a \"stringent formulation of the strict scrutiny standard\" and the challenger prevailed. Second, Alpert contends he substantiated his claim with ample, uncontradicted evidence regarding personal details of his life to demonstrate he posed no risk to public safety. This Court has not adopted such a test as articulated in\n    <em>\n     Binderup\n    </em>\n    , and even if this Court chose to do so,\n    as discussed previously, Alpert cannot prevail.

However, Alpert disregards the common denominator that ties his case to the others: he committed two serious felonies requiring him to serve prison time.

Accordingly, I would dismiss this action.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-94\">\n     Rule 84.04(d)(1) provides: \"The point shall be in substantially the following form: 'The trial court erred in [\n     <em>\n      identify the challenged ruling or action\n     </em>\n     ], because [\n     <em>\n      state the legal reasons for the claim of reversible error\n     </em>\n     ], in that [\n     <em>\n      explain why the legal reasons, in the context of the case, support the claim of reversible error\n     </em>\n     ].' \"\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-95\">\n     If the rules need to be amended or modified, this Court has the constitutional authority to do so.\n     <em>\n      State ex rel.
