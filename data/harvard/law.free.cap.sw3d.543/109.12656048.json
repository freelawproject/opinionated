Defendant raises one point on appeal, arguing the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements made to a co-defendant while they were both in separate interrogation rooms at a police station and after Defendant was properly advised of and waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find the claim of error to be without merit. An extended opinion would have no precedential value. We have, however, provided a memorandum opinion only for the use of the parties setting forth the reasons for our decision. We affirm the judgment pursuant to Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
