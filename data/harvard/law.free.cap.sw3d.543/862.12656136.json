V.M. contends the evidence is neither legally nor factually sufficient for the trial court to have found, by clear and convincing evidence, that terminating his parental rights is in M.J.M.G.'s best interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 161.001(b)(2). Because we conclude V.M. failed to challenge an independent ground in support of the trial court's ruling, we affirm the trial court's order terminating V.M.'s parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   M.J.M.G. was born on October 14, 2016. Both M.J.M.G. and his mother tested positive for amphetamines and marijuana at the time of his birth. M.J.M.G. was placed in the neonatal intensive care unit due to respiratory problems and withdrawal symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 24, 2016, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services filed its Original Petition for Protection of a Child, for Conservatorship, and for Termination in Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After several status hearings, on May 18, 2017, the matter was called for trial. Following a hearing, the trial court terminated V.M.'s parental rights to M.J.M.G. based on the following grounds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) after being served with citation, V.M. failed to file an admission of paternity or counterclaim for paternity under Chapter 160 of the Texas Family Code,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 161.002(b)(1) ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) V.M. constructively abandoned M.J.M.G. and used controlled substances supporting termination under Texas Family Code Sections 161.001(b)(1) (N), and (P),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 161.001(b)(1) (N), (P), and termination of V.M.'s parental rights was in M.J.M.G.'s best interest,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 161.001(b)(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    FAILURE TO LEGITIMATE PATERNITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its brief, the State argues V.M. failed to challenge the trial court's finding under Texas Family Code section 161.002(b)(1) that V.M. failed to timely file an admission of paternity or a counterclaim for paternity under Chapter 160 of the Texas Family Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.
