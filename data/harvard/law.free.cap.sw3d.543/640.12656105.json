App. W.D. 2015). Because Rinehart's claim does not survive the first step, our recitation is limited to the record before the trial court at the time the alleged \"plain error\" occurred. We recite such other information as necessary for context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 12, 2015, at around 1:00 a.m., Rinehart struck and killed a nineteen-year-old man (\"Victim\") near Neosho, Missouri. Rinehart did not report the accident at the time, and was not present when authorities arrived shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The next morning, Rinehart told two people that he \"hit a deer last night[,]\" and showed them the damage to his vehicle-one\n   being Gaye Powell (\"Powell\")-a childhood friend who lived in Noel, Missouri. Rinehart told Powell he hit a deer \"towards your way[,]\" was not going to submit it to his insurance company, and would probably fix it himself. Powell came to believe Rinehart had hit Victim, and she reported the information to the police about a week and a half after talking to Rinehart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 17, 2015, Rinehart, through his attorney, contacted the Newton County prosecutor's office for the purpose of offering his voluntary surrender, and the surrender of his vehicle, on the condition that bail not be required if he were charged. The prosecutor indicated he could not agree to the bail condition at that time, and that he would first need to speak with the Neosho Police Department and Victim's family. On September 24, 2015, Rinehart's attorney contacted the Neosho Police Department and arranged for an interview and the surrender of Rinehart's vehicle the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The police took custody of Rinehart's vehicle and processed it for evidence: photographing damage to the front grill, hood, and windshield. Rinehart was charged by information with one count of the class D felony of leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A jury trial commenced on November 22, 2016. At trial, the contested issue was whether Rinehart\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   he had hit a person. The State's theory of the case was that when Rinehart hit Victim, Victim's head smashed into the windshield in front of Rinehart, and Victim \"rode\" the hood for approximately four seconds before Victim came off the vehicle. Rinehart, the State theorized, would have seen he hit a person during this interval, but nevertheless failed to remain at the scene or alert the authorities. Rinehart's theory of the case was that he\n   <em>\n    thought\n   </em>\n   he hit a deer, not a person. When Rinehart hit Victim, according to Rinehart's version of events, Victim was only on the windshield for a second or so before going out of Rinehart's line of vision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Both parties put on witnesses and evidence, including one expert witness for each party for purposes of accident reconstruction testimony. Rinehart did not testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before closing argument, the jury was instructed that they must not consider as evidence \"any statement or remark or argument by any of the attorneys addressed to another attorney or to the Court.\" The final instruction read to the jury before closing arguments was Instruction No. 9, which stated, in part: \"The attorneys will now have the opportunity of arguing the case to you. Their arguments are intended to help you in understanding the evidence and applying the law, but they are not evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In closing argument, the prosecutor made several references to Rinehart's possible intoxication, without timely objection by defense counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 \"If you're going to do that much damage to the vehicle, to have the person strike right in front of you as you're driving, and then not know that you hit a person. You know, if you are awake and sober, you're going to know that, I would submit to you.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 \"Ladies and gentlemen, the evidence that [Rinehart] knew that he hit a human being is the physical evidence to his car and his common sense.... Was [Rinehart] asleep? Was he drunk? We don't know. There's only two people there at the point of the impact. Would he have a reason to lie? Would he have a reason to wait five days to turn himself in? We\n   know he was sober when he talked to the police. Was he not sober at the time? There's a reason that leaving the scene of an accident is a crime, so-and the instructions will tell you to use your common sense-that you have to use your common sense. Even if it was a roof vault, you know, you've got all of this-the hood explodes in front of you, the head hits the windshield right in front of you, the body is flipped over onto the roof and rides it for 250 feet, and then slides off back, but he doesn't stop or maybe he did stop. Again, we don't know, but he didn't call it in.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 \"Even if [the Victim] was walking in the middle of the road between the fast and the slow lanes[,] ... you're still going to have your headlights illuminate something in the road ahead of you if you're paying attention or if you're sober. We can't know for sure what was going on in [Rinehart]'s mind at the time he hit [the Victim.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the prosecutor finished, defense counsel asked to approach the bench and the following colloquy took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [RINEHART'S ATTORNEY]: How do I voice an objection to the prosecutor's reference to the possibility of lack of sobriety on the part of the defendant? There's not any evidence in the record that there was any drinking done by him and certainly it's not a reasonable-what's the word? It's not a reasonable inference. You know, he did it once. I thought, you know, okay. He did it twice and I started to get up. After the third time I think that he has misled this jury. There's no reasonable inference that could be drawn from what the evidence is that he was drinking at all. I think the jury should be advised of that fact and to disregard it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: Do you have a response?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: [O]bviously we don't know. I never suggested that I had special knowledge. I was just saying why would a person not admit it and you're out at one o'clock on a Saturday morning. That comports with common sense. It's a reasonable inference under the facts as to why [Rinehart] would not have reported striking that individual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [RINEHART'S ATTORNEY]: I disagree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE COURT: You can-he didn't bring it up in his first close. He brought it up in the second. I will give you 30 seconds to state to the jury there's no evidence of alcohol.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rinehart's counsel then addressed the jury and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [RINEHART'S ATTORNEY]: I said I wasn't going to get a chance to come back up here with you. [The prosecutor] has suggested to you at least by the inference-I think his statement was if [Rinehart] was awake and sober in one reference and he made another reference to sobriety later on-wanting you to believe that there is a responsibility, if not a probability, that [Rinehart] was drinking or intoxicated when this accident occurred. I want to remind you that there's not one shred of evidence ... to make you believe that [Rinehart] had been drinking at all; no evidence whatsoever. Just because a man is out driving his vehicle at one o'clock in the morning doesn't mean he is drunk, so the judge has given me this time to tell you that.... It is not a reasonable inference to believe just because a man with long white hair and a beard driving his Ford Escort at one o'clock in the morning is intoxicated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After thirty minutes of deliberation, the jury found Rinehart guilty of leaving the\n   scene of a motor vehicle accident, and recommended a sentence of three years in the Department of Corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On December 16, 2016, Rinehart filed a motion for new trial asserting, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The Trial Court erred in failing to grant a mistrial,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , based on [Rinehart]'s objection to the [prosecutor]'s closing argument to the effect that [Rinehart] 'could have been impaired' on three or possibly four different occasions, which was an improper inference from the evidence adduced at trial, particularly when [Rinehart] chose not to exercise his right to testify at the trial. Not only were the statements improper inferences from the testimony, but was greatly prejudicial and most likely caused the jurors to deliberate with inflamed passions against [Rinehart].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At the sentencing hearing on January 3, 2017, Rinehart's motion for new trial was heard. After hearing argument, the trial court overruled the motion. The trial judge then stated that the court \"will follow the recommendation of the jury and order [Rinehart] confined under the supervision of the Department of Corrections for 3 years.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In his sole point on appeal, Rinehart argues that the trial court plainly erred in failing to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   declare a mistrial in response to the prosecutor's references to Rinehart's possible intoxication in closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review: Plain Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Rinehart, ceding that his claim is unpreserved, requests plain error review. Rule 30.20 provides, in relevant part, that: \"plain errors affecting substantial rights may be considered in the discretion of the court when the court finds that manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice has resulted therefrom.\" Whether to engage in plain error review is a decision within the reviewing court's discretion, and it is the appellant's burden to demonstrate plain error.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.
