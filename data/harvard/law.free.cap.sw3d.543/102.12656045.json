Pfeiffer, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Mr. Charles Barlow (\"Barlow\") appeals from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Daviess County (\"trial court\"), following a jury trial, convicting him of the class B felony of driving while intoxicated. In his sole point on appeal, Barlow argues that the trial court plainly erred in overruling\n   his motion to suppress and in admitting evidence obtained as a result of his traffic stop because the arresting officer did not have reasonable suspicion to stop Barlow's vehicle, violating Barlow's right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the evening of December 12, 2015, Deputy Tyler Miller (\"Deputy Miller\") of the Daviess County Sheriff's Department was working the night shift. Deputy Miller was standing outside the Corner Caf\u00e9 in Gallatin, Missouri, talking with a group of friends, when Barlow approached the group to speak with his ex-wife. Deputy Miller noticed that Barlow had bloodshot and glassy eyes and smelled of intoxicants. He also overheard Barlow speaking and noticed Barlow's speech was slurred. Shortly thereafter, Deputy Miller observed Barlow get into the driver's seat of a vehicle, but he was unable to stop him before he drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his patrol car, Deputy Miller attempted to locate Barlow but he was unable to immediately find him. As his vehicle was almost out of gas, Deputy Miller stopped at the gas station to refuel. After leaving the gas station, approximately five to ten minutes after Deputy Miller had observed Barlow in front of the caf\u00e9, Deputy Miller saw Barlow drive past him. Deputy Miller immediately stopped Barlow's vehicle and again observed the same signs of intoxication he had observed in front of the caf\u00e9. Barlow admitted to Deputy Miller that he had been drinking but refused to take a portable breath test. Deputy Miller conducted field sobriety tests which indicated signs of intoxication. Barlow was placed under arrest and agreed to take a breath test at the police station. The breath test showed Barlow's blood alcohol content was .286 percent, over the legal limit in Missouri of .08 percent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 577.012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State charged Barlow with driving while intoxicated as a chronic offender. Prior to trial, Barlow filed a motion to suppress the evidence gathered as a result of his traffic stop. Barlow argued that the stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion, thereby violating his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and article I, section 15 of the Missouri Constitution. After a suppression hearing at which Deputy Miller testified, the trial court denied the motion to suppress. Barlow failed to renew his objection to the admission of the previously challenged evidence at trial. The jury found Barlow guilty, and the court sentenced him to six years of imprisonment in the Missouri Department of Corrections. Barlow failed to file a motion for a new trial but now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his sole point on appeal, Barlow argues the trial court plainly erred in overruling his motion to suppress and in admitting all of the evidence found as a result of his traffic stop because, under the totality of the circumstances, Deputy Miller did not have reasonable suspicion to stop Barlow's vehicle because the fact that Deputy Miller observed that Barlow had bloodshot and glassy eyes, slurred speech, and a strong odor of an intoxicating beverage was not enough to justify the traffic stop when Deputy Miller did not observe Barlow make any traffic violations before stopping him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As conceded by Barlow on appeal, his claim of error has not been preserved for appellate review as he failed to renew his objection to the challenged evidence at trial and he did not include the claim in a motion for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Five to ten minutes before Deputy Miller stopped Barlow's vehicle, Deputy Miller observed that Barlow had bloodshot and glassy eyes, slurred speech, and smelled a strong odor of intoxicants coming from Barlow. Barlow argues that \"none of these observations directly indicate any impairment on the part of [Barlow].\" Barlow maintains that because Deputy Miller did not observe any\n   <em>\n    traffic violations\n   </em>\n   committed by him that Deputy Miller did not have reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify the stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Barlow's position on appeal is unsupported by the law and common sense. The crime of driving while intoxicated does not require as an element of the offense the commission of a traffic violation. The offense is committed by the act of driving while in an intoxicated condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 577.010.1 (\"A person commits the crime of 'driving while intoxicated' if he operates a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated or drugged condition\"). Barlow has cited no authority to support his apparent assertion on appeal that Deputy Miller could not have developed a reasonable suspicion that Barlow was intoxicated unless he first observed Barlow committing a traffic violation. No such rule exists. It is true that in most cases law enforcement officers\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   encounter intoxicated drivers on the road and often the officer decides to stop the intoxicated persons' vehicle because she observes a traffic violation. It is then upon encountering the driver up close and making observations of the driver that the\n   officer usually develops a reasonable suspicion of intoxication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However, in this case, Deputy Miller was\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   able to observe Barlow and develop a reasonable suspicion of intoxication almost immediately\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Barlow entered his vehicle and began driving. \"Intoxication may be proven by any witness who had a reasonable opportunity to observe the defendant's physical condition, and intoxication is usually evidenced by unsteadiness on the feet, slurred speech, lack of body coordination and impaired motor reflexes.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Scholl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088499\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/114/304/#p307\">\n    114 S.W.3d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307 (Mo. App. E.D. 2003). Deputy Miller personally observed that Barlow had bloodshot and glassy eyes, slurred speech, and smelled of intoxicants. The observations were made five or ten minutes before the traffic stop. We find that the observations of Barlow made by Deputy Miller support the trial court's finding that Deputy Miller had reasonable suspicion to justify the stop of Barlow's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Barlow analogizes this case to\n   <em>\n    State v.
