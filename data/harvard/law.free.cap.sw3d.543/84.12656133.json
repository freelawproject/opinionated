Taborn appeals the denial of his Rule 29.15 motion and argues that it was error to deny his claim that appellate counsel was ineffective when she failed to raise a claim of error on direct appeal involving the admission of uncharged misconduct evidence at trial. Because appellate counsel's strategic decision not to raise this issue on direct appeal was reasonable, we affirm. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
