On appeal, Wilmering alleges that the trial court erred in overruling his Motion for Judgment of Acquittal because the State failed to present sufficient evidence that Wilmering actually or constructively possessed the forged documents. We affirm. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
