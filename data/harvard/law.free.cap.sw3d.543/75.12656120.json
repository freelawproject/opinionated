After we affirmed Petty's conviction on direct appeal, he filed a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29.15, and his appointed counsel filed an amended motion. The circuit court denied Petty's motion following an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petty appeals. He argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a mistrial when the jury indicated that it was unable to reach a verdict after two-and-a-half hours of deliberation, and that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that the circuit court erroneously denied a mistrial after one of the jurors was observed crying in reaction to a recording of the child-victim's 911 call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We affirm. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have provided the parties an unpublished memorandum setting forth the reasons for this order. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
