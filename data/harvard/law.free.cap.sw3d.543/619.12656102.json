He contends the court clearly erred, because deficient appellate counsel prejudiced his appeal by failing to address two errors, after trial counsel preserved the alleged errors for appeal: 1) a prosecutor's misstatement of law during closing argument, and 2) the unlawful conditions of Baskerville's pre-trial detention. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
