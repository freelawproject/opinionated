The MSA did not actually terminate Father's or Mother's parental rights, nor did either of them voluntarily\n   relinquish their parental rights under the agreement, by a section 161.103 affidavit or otherwise. Father and Mother then sought to revoke their consent to the MSA after the Department moved the trial court to enter judgment. Over the parents' objections, the trial court rendered judgment on the mediated settlement agreement under section 153.0071 of the family code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20153.0071\">\n    Tex.

Father and Mother appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In three issues, Father and Mother assert that (1) the trial court erred by relying on section 153.0071(e), (2) the trial court erred by adopting the MSA's moratorium on any motions to modify for 48 months, and (3) the trial court erred by adopting the MSA's \"emergency\" prerequisite before any motion to modify could be filed in the interim.

The children involved were their two-year-old son, Andrew, and their three-month-old daughter, Betty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to the supporting affidavits, three-month-old Betty had suffered non-accidental trauma. The perpetrator was unknown, and the record contains multiple references (one as late as April 10, 2017) both to an ongoing criminal investigation and to the fact that \"a perpetrator has not been identified.\" Betty had numerous fractures in various stages of healing, including rib fractures, a clavicular fracture, a femur fracture, and distal femur corner fractures. Andrew had no injuries consistent with abuse or neglect. Betty attended a daycare, and it was the daycare that first expressed concerns on January 25, 2016. Father and Mother took Betty to a hospital that same evening. The Department's petition came two days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The petition sought to terminate Father's and Mother's parental rights to their two children under family code Chapter 161 (\"Termination of the Parent-Child Relationship\") of Subtitle B (\"Suits Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship\") of Title 5 (\"The Parent-Child Relationship and the Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20161.001\">\n    Tex.

Mr. Jones is Father's paternal great uncle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The following week, Jane Doe, a person who had regular contact with the children before their removal, filed a petition in intervention. She asserted that appointing either parent as sole managing conservator or both parents as joint managing conservators would significantly impair the children's physical health or emotional development. She sought to be appointed the children's possessory conservator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As the Department requested, in early July 2016 the trial court removed the Smiths and appointed the Joneses as the children's temporary possessory conservators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 31, 2016, the trial court ordered Father to pay $1,200 per month in child support and ordered Mother to pay $800 per month in child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On October 5, 2016, the Department, the Joneses, Father, Mother, and Jane Doe filed a \"Binding [Mediated] Settlement Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20161.001\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 153.0071(e).

The unique (and limited) grounds for setting aside a\n   mediated settlement agreement are set out in section 153.0071(e-1) of the family code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20161.001\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 153.0071(e-1).

When the trial court specifically asked if that meant the Department was not going to be putting on any testimony, the Department responded, \"That's correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   That same day, the trial court signed its \"Final Order in Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship.\" Citing section 153.371, the trial court appointed the Joneses as the children's permanent managing conservators and consequently removed the Department as managing conservator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20161.001\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 153.371.

Finally, the court ordered that Father and Mother pay child support as set out in Attachment C, which simply continued Father's $1,200 monthly payments and Mother's $800 monthly payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 153.0071(e) applies in this case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In their first issue, Father and Mother assert that section 153.0071(e) of the family code does not apply to suits to terminate the parent-child relationship brought under family code Chapter 161, citing\n   <em>\n    In re Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189295\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/498/624/\">\n    498 S.W.3d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

Although the Department's suit did not result in a Chapter 161 termination, Father and Mother argue that because termination was still a possibility at the time they negotiated and agreed to the MSA, section 153.0071 does not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Section 153.0071 provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (c) On the written agreement of the parties or on the court's own motion, the court may refer a suit affecting the parent-child relationship to mediation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (d) A mediated settlement agreement is binding on the parties if the agreement:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (1) provides, in a prominently displayed statement that is in boldfaced type or capital letters or underlined, that the agreement is not subject to revocation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (2) is signed by each party to the agreement; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (3) is signed by the party's attorney, if any, who is present at the time the agreement is signed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (e) If a mediated settlement agreement meets the requirements of Subsection (d), a party is entitled to judgment on the mediated settlement agreement notwithstanding Rule 11, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, or another rule of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (e-1) Notwithstanding Subsections (d) and (e), a court may decline to enter a judgment on a mediated settlement agreement if the court finds:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (1) that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (A) a party to the agreement was a victim of family violence, and that circumstance impaired the party's ability to make decisions; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (B) the agreement would permit a person who is subject to registration under Chapter 62, Code of Criminal Procedure, on the basis of an offense committed by the person when the person was 17 years of age or older or who otherwise has a history or pattern of past or present physical or sexual abuse directed against any person to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (i) reside in the same household as the child; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (ii) otherwise have unsupervised access to the child; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (2) that the agreement is not in the child's best interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20153.0071\">\n    Tex.

It was the fact of those terminations that unquestionably put\n   <em>\n    K.D.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   within Chapter 161, unlike here, where Father's and Mother's parental rights were not terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Although their rights were not in fact terminated, Father and Mother argue that section 153.0071 nevertheless does not apply because the Department pleaded for termination and because termination was still on the table when the mediation occurred.

In contrast, nothing in the settlement agreement here implicated section 161.001, because no parental rights were terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   At oral argument, Father and Mother argued that just as a criminal defendant may back out of plea bargain and go to trial, so too should they have the right to back out of their mediated settlement agreement and go to trial.

Because of the issue of first impression involved in this appeal, oral argument was set and held on November 15, 2017.

I interpret the so-far-as-reasonably-possible language included in judicial administration rule 6.2(a) as creating an exception to application of the 180-day deadline in situations, such as this one, where application of that deadline leaves a justice with days to draft a dissenting opinion on an important question of first impression.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Department initiated the present lawsuit on January 27, 2016, by filing an \"Original Petition for Protection of a Child, for Conservatorship, and for Termination in Suit Affecting the Parent Child Relationship.\" The Department pleaded that it had taken possession of three-month-old Betty\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   without a court order in accordance with section 262.104 of the family code ; requested that the trial court issue emergency orders concerning two-year-old Andrew; requested that the trial court immediately, without notice or an adversary hearing, appoint the Department as temporary sole managing conservator of Betty and Andrew; and sought termination of the parental rights of Mother and Father to Betty and Andrew if family reunification could not be achieved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20153.0071\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 262.104 (West Supp. 2017) (setting forth procedures for Department to take possession of a child in an emergency without a court order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The affidavit of removal supporting the Department's petition explained that Mother, who is employed by a public school, had received a call from Betty and Andrew's day care stating that Betty was not acting right; Betty had attended that day care since she was six weeks old. Mother went to the day care, fed Betty a\n   bottle, and soothed her. Mother returned to work but later that day received another call from the day care saying that Betty was not acting right. Mother picked up Betty from the day care and took her to a hospital emergency room based on the concerns expressed by the day care. At the emergency room, doctors determined that Betty had suffered fractures to almost all of her ribs; that the fractures were in various stages of healing; that Betty had fingerprint-shaped bruises on her back, buttocks, and right temple; that her clavicle was fractured and a knot was visible there; and that her femur had been previously fractured. Doctors ruled Betty's injuries as child abuse and called the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Father, who was a licensed vocational nurse employed by John Peter Smith Hospital, and Mother both denied causing Betty's injuries and denied that Betty had the bruises or fracture to her clavicle when she was dropped off at day care. Mother and Father have no criminal convictions, have no prior CPS referrals, and have been married for thirteen years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Doctors subsequently examined Andrew and determined that he had not sustained any prior injuries. Throughout the case, the Department consistently pleaded that the perpetrator of Betty's injuries was unknown and that a criminal investigation remained open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Department created a service plan for Mother and Father, and Mother and Father began working their plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Department, Mother, Father, the Joneses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and an intervenor named Jane Doe mediated their claims and signed a \"Binding Medi[ ]ated Settlement Agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the MSA, the parties did not agree to termination of Mother's and Father's parental rights but did agree to appoint the Joneses as the children's managing conservators; to appoint Mother, Father, and Jane Doe as possessory conservators; to permit Mother and Father to have four hours of visitation with the children every second and fourth Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to noon; and to have Mother and Father's visits supervised by the Smiths. The MSA also called for Mother and Father to pay child support to the Joneses. The MSA gave Jane Doe-on whom the record does not reflect that the Department conducted any type of home study or fitness investigation-possession of the children from 6:00 p.m. Friday to 6:00 p.m. Sunday every six weeks, for one week in the summer, and from December 27 at noon until December 29 at noon. The MSA stated that there would be \"no modification until after 48 months\" and separately stated that no modification is to be filed \"unless emergency.\" The handwritten MSA was purportedly executed pursuant to section 153.0071 of the family code. After signing the MSA, Mother and Father filed a written \"Objection to Binding Mediated Settlement Agreement\" in which they revoked their consent to the MSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Department moved to remain managing conservator of Betty and Andrew and to extend the 180-day disposition deadline for its termination suit because the Joneses needed additional time \"to qualify for permanency care assistance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court granted the extension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   About five months later, the Department filed a motion for judgment on the MSA. Mother and Father filed a response to the Department's motion for judgment, alleging that the MSA was not enforceable because Mother and Father had withdrawn their consent to the MSA, because MSAs are not enforceable in termination suits, because the 48-month-no-modification provision in the MSA is contrary to Mother and Father's statutory rights and renders the MSA illegal and contrary to public policy, and because Mother and Father had signed the MSA under duress-the Department's pending threat of termination of their parental rights. Affidavits by Mother and Father were attached to their response; the affidavits stated that Mother and Father did not believe the MSA was in the best interest of Andrew or Betty; that at the mediation, Mother and Father were threatened with termination of their parental rights if they did not sign the MSA; and that Mother and Father \"would never have entered into the MSA but for the threat of termination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The trial court conducted a hearing on the Department's motion for judgment on the MSA. At the hearing, Mother and Father again argued that the MSA was not enforceable, specifically asserting the same grounds they had raised first in their written objection to the MSA and again in their response to the Department's motion for judgment on the MSA. The Department put on no evidence at the hearing, moving for judgment based solely on the MSA's enforceability under family code section 153.0071. The trial court signed a judgment enforcing all but a few provisions of the MSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Mother and Father then perfected this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
