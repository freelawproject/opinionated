He asserts that his conviction is barred under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   because the offense for which he was indicted is more specifically described in another statute with a lesser range of punishment, section 548.6035 of the Transportation Code, involving \"Fraudulent Emissions Inspections of Motor Vehicle[s].\" We conclude that the trial court did not have sufficient information to determine based on the face of the indictment whether sections 37.10 and 548.6035 were\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The doctrine of\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   is a settled rule of statutory construction concerning statutes that deal with the same general subject, have the same general purpose, or relate to the same person or thing or class of persons or things, even when such statutes contain no reference to one another and even though they were passed at different times or during different sessions of the legislature.\n   <em>\n    Azeez v.

Likewise, the Court of Criminal Appeals has held that when the charging instrument was unobjectionable on its face, it was only after the State's evidence disclosed the statutory provisions purportedly at issue that the basis for an\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   challenge became manifest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Azeez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8383192\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/248/182/#p191\">\n    248 S.W.3d at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The indictment reads: \"[Appellant] ... did ... unlawfully, knowingly make a false entry in a governmental record, namely, TEXAS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM RECORD, attached hereto as Exhibit A, and the actions of [appellant] were done with the intent to defraud and harm another.\" Exhibit A, a database spreadsheet, is attached to the indictment and is entitled, \"Texas Information Management System.\" The print on Exhibit A is too small to read without enlarging it, but the exhibit includes data indicating that appellant was the inspector for a vehicle inspection and that the vehicle passed the inspection. Although the indictment reveals that appellant was charged with making a false entry in a governmental record involving vehicle inspections, the indictment is not limited on its face to a governmental record involving vehicle\n   <em>\n    emissions\n   </em>\n   inspections; however, section 548.6035 applies only to vehicle\n   <em>\n    emissions\n   </em>\n   inspections. Tex. Transp. Code \u00a7 548.6035.

The State's indictment does not show on its face that appellant was being charged with falsifying a vehicle emissions inspection report. Appellant pleaded guilty before the State presented evidence regarding what type of vehicle inspection was at issue in this case. We conclude that the trial court did not have sufficient information to determine that sections 37.10 and 548.6035 are\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   under these circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318907\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/346/713/#p716\">\n    346 S.W.3d at 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
