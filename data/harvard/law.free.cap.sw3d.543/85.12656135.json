Mr. Peters also contends that he \"did not avail himself of the independent, federally mandated registration requirements of SORNA via interstate travel,\" and, again, the trial court did not consider this matter because it failed to conduct a hearing on the merits. Mr. Peters's argument appears to implicate\n      <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202250\">\n       18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (a), which imposes federal punishment on sex offenders who are required to register, travel in interstate commerce, and knowingly fail to register. This argument is not fully briefed by either party, so we do not consider it further, although it can be addressed if Mr. Peters raises the matter on remand.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-18\">\n      In addition, we are inclined to reject the sheriff's attempt to apply the time limits of successive removal petitions under state law given that Mr. Peters did not base his petition on section 589.400 and the sheriff argued in his motion to dismiss that Mr. Peters \"does not meet the eligibility requirements to be removed from the registry\" in that he is not among those individuals expressly permitted to bring such petitions. If Mr. Peters is ineligible to file a removal petition under section 589.400, then it would appear that the statute, with its time limitations, does not apply to him. We further question the time-bar's applicability where a prior proceeding ends in dismissal rather than denial. Without deciding the merits of Mr. Peters's petition, we conclude that he must be given the opportunity to respond and be heard as to the merits of what was, in effect, the sheriff's summary-judgment motion. This point is granted.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-19\">\n      <strong>\n       Conclusion\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-20\">\n      Because the trial court erred in failing to give Mr. Peters an opportunity to respond or be heard before dismissing his declaratory-judgment petition with prejudice, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
