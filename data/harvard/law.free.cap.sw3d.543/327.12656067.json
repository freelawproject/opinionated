Lucchesi's negligence was the proximate cause of an automobile collision he had with Appellant Harold A. Rumzek. In spite of Appellee's negligence, the jury awarded Appellant zero damages for his past physical pain and mental anguish, his past physical impairment, and his past medical care expenses. Appellant contends that the jury's failure to award him any damages was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. Further, he argues the trial court erred by entering the final judgment without including an award of damages, and by failing to modify its final judgment to include an award of damages. We affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The undisputed facts reveal that Appellant was driving his 2009 Cadillac STS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   southbound in the far-right lane of Precinct Line Road in Hurst, Texas at approximately noon on August 22, 2011. At the same time, Appellee was also traveling southbound in the middle lane of the same road next to Appellant. Both parties recall hearing a siren from an emergency vehicle just as they passed through the intersection of Cannon Drive and Precinct Line Road. Appellee recalled seeing a firetruck traveling westbound on Cannon Drive, and, anticipating that it was turning onto Precinct Line Road, he attempted to turn his car to the right side of the road to avoid it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unfortunately, Appellee admittedly failed to see Appellant's car as he was changing lanes, and struck the driver's side of Appellant's car, where Appellant was sitting in the driver's seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellee's car suffered minor damage, in the form of a dent the approximate size of a baseball on the passenger side of his vehicle. Appellant's car suffered dents on the driver's door and the front fender, as well as scrape marks on the side of the car, but his car's air bags did not deploy. The parties called the police, but there is nothing in the record to indicate that either party was cited in the accident. Appellant was able to drive his vehicle home after the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the time of the accident, Appellant told Appellee and the police that he was not certain whether he was injured. However, Appellant testified that he was in pain that night, and that he even suspected he might have a broken collar bone as early as the same night of the accident. Nevertheless, as he believed the pain would go away, Appellant admittedly did not seek treatment for any injuries until three weeks after the accident. Instead, Appellant went on a previously-planned 12- to 14-day vacation, in which he drove from his home in Colleyville, Texas, to Michigan and Ohio and back to Colleyville, taking four days to drive each way. When he returned from his trip, Appellant went to the Baylor Clinic on September 14, 2011, where his treating physician took an x-ray to rule out a broken collar bone. His doctor diagnosed him with a cervical spine strain, a left shoulder AC sprain, and \"[d]egenerative disk disease from C4-C7\" and prescribed a course of physical therapy for him related to the pain in his left shoulder and neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant saw at least two different physical therapists at the clinic from September 30, 2011 to May 8, 2012, and was required to go back to his doctor for a renewal of the physical therapy prescription every six weeks. In all, Appellant had 55 physical therapy treatments for his left neck and shoulder pain, and seven office visits before he was discharged on May 8, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellee admitted at the time of the accident, and at trial, that he was at fault in the accident, and prior to trial, his insurance carrier paid for the repairs to Appellant's vehicle. The only issue remaining at trial was whether Appellant was entitled to any damages for the personal injuries he allegedly suffered in the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, Appellant testified that he suffered from \"piercing\" and \"very persistent\" neck and shoulder pain following the accident, as well as muscle spasms, which he claimed interfered with his ability to perform his daily tasks and volunteer work. He also became depressed and suffered mental anguish. Appellant's second physical therapist testified to the course of\n   treatment that she provided to him, as well as his medical records and physical therapy notes. Evidence of Appellant's medical expenses through medical records affidavits from the clinic, together with various billing records, indicated that his total expenses were $15,234.64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following trial, the jury found that Appellee's negligence was the proximate cause of the collision. The jury was then asked the amount of damages to which Appellant was entitled for his alleged past physical pain and mental anguish, future physical pain and mental anguish, past physical impairment, future physical impairment, and past medical care expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury entered zero in response to each question, and the trial court entered a final judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict. Appellant thereafter filed a motion to modify or correct the jury's verdict, which was denied. Appellant appeals from the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In three separate issues (Issues Three, Four, and Five in his brief), Appellant contends that the jury's zero damages verdict was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence, such as to be \"manifestly unjust,\" and that the evidence he presented at trial required the jury to award him damages for his claims for past medical expenses, his past physical pain and mental anguish, and his past physical impairment. In three additional but related arguments (Issues One, Six, and Seven), Appellant argues that the trial court erred by entering its final judgment without including an award of damages and that the trial court erred by failing to correct or modify the final judgment to make an award of damages; Appellant further argues that because of the jury's allegedly improper verdict and the trial court's failure to correct the verdict, the matter should be remanded to the trial court for a new trial on the issue of damages. Because we conclude that the jury had the discretion to enter a zero damages verdict on all of Appellant's claims, we find it appropriate to consider these six issues together. We consider separately Appellant's argument (Issue Two in his brief) that the medical record affidavits he submitted at trial setting forth the amount of his medical expenses required the jury, as a matter of law, to enter a damages award in the amount of those expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    THE JURY'S VERDICT WAS NOT AGAINST THE GREAT WEIGHT AND PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Generally, a jury has great discretion in considering evidence on the issue of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re State Farm Mut.

Further, x-rays of Appellant's left shoulder were deemed to be \"normal\" except for the existence of \"degenerative changes in the AC joint.\" And finally, an x-ray of Appellant's cervical spine showed only a \"decrease in the disk space from C4-C7 with mild spurring.\" Ultimately, his doctor diagnosed him with a cervical spine strain, a left AC (shoulder) sprain, and \"[d]egenerative disk disease from C4-C7.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the two physical therapists who treated Appellant both assessed him as having a \"sprain of neck, cervicalgia and joint pain [in his left] shoulder.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellant contends that he presented evidence of an \"objective\" injury, referring to the findings made by his second physical therapist, Jennifer Moreland, who conducted what she termed an \"Objective Examination\" of Appellant in which she physically examined the joints of his neck and back by palpitating his spine to see how the soft tissue and the joint felt, in order to test whether the joint was moving or not. Appellant finds it significant that Moreland found that he had no mobility in the clavicle or collar bone on the left side, and minimal mobility in the scapula.

Further, although Appellant started physical therapy on September 30, 2011, and was treated five times in the interim, his first physical therapist did not mention any reports of muscle spasms until his therapy session on October 19, 2011, almost two months after the accident. In addition, although Appellant reported having spams to his physical therapists from October of 2011 until May of 2012, there is nothing in the record to indicate whether his therapists actually detected the spams, or whether they were simply self-reported by Appellant. And finally, we note that although one of Appellant's treating physicians stated in his notes that he observed a \"mild spasm in the left trapezius\" when examining Appellant, this observation was made in January 23, 2012, approximately five months after the accident, and appears to be the only time a treating physician observed a spasm of any kind.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, we conclude as the court did in\n   <em>\n    McGuffin\n   </em>\n   , that the spasms reported by Appellant cannot be considered evidence of an \"objective\" injury stemming from his accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   And finally, we note that all of the cases on which Appellant relies are cases in which courts have reversed a jury's verdict awarding zero damages as being against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence, based on a finding that the plaintiff presented uncontradicted and verifiable objective evidence of an injury.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Heritage Operating, L.P. v.

Significantly, as set forth above, Appellant's physician diagnosed him with \"[d]egenerative disk disease\" in the C4 to C7 areas, and in addition, his x-rays confirmed the existence of degenerative changes in those same areas. Moreover, Appellant himself testified that he had a pre-existing \"serious\" lower back injury that he incurred in 1987, while serving in the Air Force in 1987, after which he was given a 60 percent disability rating on his retirement 24 years before the accident. Although Appellant testified at trial that his back was asymptomatic at the time of the accident, and had no impact on his symptoms following the accident, during his deposition, Appellant testified that he was still suffering symptoms from his back injury at the time of the accident; further, Appellant stated in his intake form at his first office visit that he had suffered \"chronic back pain\" for the past 24 years, and also advised his first physical therapist that he had been suffering from \"chronic low back pain\" for 20-plus years.

At trial, Appellant's only medical witness was Moreland, the second physical therapist, who treated him beginning in January of 2012, almost five months after the accident. Moreland, however, never testified on the issue of whether Appellant's symptoms were caused by the accident, and instead only testified to the treatment that\n   she provided to Appellant for his symptoms. Instead, the only evidence that Appellant's symptoms were caused by the accident came from Appellant himself, who testified that he did not suffer from any pain or limitations in his left shoulder and neck prior to the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We further note that even Appellant's own testimony was riddled with conflicts. For example, Appellant admitted at trial that he expressed to both Appellee and the police at the time of his accident that he was not certain whether he was injured, and that he thereafter delayed receiving treatment for three weeks, testifying that he felt \"functional\" during that time, and was able to drive from his home in Texas to Michigan and Ohio, and back shortly after the accident. Further, on one of the initial intake forms he filled out on September 29, 2011, almost four weeks after the accident, Appellant indicated that he had no difficulty \"managing his transportation needs\" and that had \"No Difficulty\" performing most of his everyday chores. Despite this, Appellant testified at trial that his injuries affected his ability to drive for several months after the accident, and that he had ongoing problems performing his daily activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Appellant also testified at trial that his injuries interfered with other aspects of his everyday life, including the volunteer work that he did, yet Appellant reported to his physical therapists that he had engaged in various volunteer activities while undergoing treatment, including volunteering at the Shriner's Circus two weekends in a row in October of 2011, serving a 17-hour shift as an \"election judge\" in November of 2011, and participating in a Shriner's \"competition flag ceremony\" in March of 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, although Appellant testified that he had \"piercing\" and \"very persistent\" neck pain and spams after the accident, he testified that he did not take any pain medication for his injuries, explaining that he has a high tolerance for pain, and was able to control his symptoms with a technique known as \"autogenics,\" which he had learned when he previously injured his back.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   When, as here, a plaintiff presents no uncontroverted objective evidence of an injury caused by the defendant's negligence, and the jury is instead presented with conflicting evidence on the cause of a plaintiff's injuries, the jury is entitled to find that the defendant is not liable for the plaintiff's injuries and to enter a zero damages award.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re State Farm Mut.

Having reached this conclusion, we also conclude that the trial court had the discretion to enter its final judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict, and to refuse to modify its final judgment to include an award of damages. We therefore overrule Appellant's Issue One and Issues Three through Seven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    APPELLANT'S MEDICAL RECORD AFFIDAVITS DID NOT ESTABLISH CAUSATION OR ENTITLEMENT TO DAMAGES FOR HIS MEDICAL EXPENSES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Appellant also argues that he was entitled to an award of damages for his medical expenses, as a matter of law, because he timely filed uncontroverted \"medical record affidavits\" prior to trial, together with billing records, indicating that he had medical expenses in the total amount of $15,234.64. In making this argument, Appellant relies primarily on section 18.001 of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code, which provides, in relevant part, that: \"Unless a controverting affidavit is served as provided by this section, an affidavit that the amount a person charged for a service was reasonable at the time and place that the service was provided and that the service was necessary is sufficient evidence to support a finding of fact by judge or jury that the amount charged was reasonable or that the service was necessary.\" TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp; REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 18.001(b) (West 2015). The Code further provides that a party intending to controvert a claim reflected by the affidavit must serve a copy of a \"counteraffidavit\" on the opposing party no later than 30 days after the day the party receives a copy of the affidavit, and at least 14 days before trial. TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp; REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 18.001(e)(1) (West 2015). Appellant points out that Appellee did not timely challenge or controvert the affidavits, and that his medical record affidavits were therefore admitted at trial as exhibits for the jury's consideration. Appellant believes that because his medical record affidavits\n   were uncontroverted, section 18.001 required the jury to award him the amount of his medical expenses set forth in the affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Appellant's argument, however, is based on a misunderstanding of the function of section 18.001. Section 18.001 is an evidentiary statute that accomplishes three things: \"(1) it allows for the admissibility, by affidavit, of evidence of the reasonableness and necessity of charges that would otherwise be inadmissible hearsay; (2) it permits the use of otherwise inadmissible hearsay to support findings of fact by the trier of fact; and (3) it provides for exclusion of evidence to the contrary, upon proper objection, in the absence of a properly-filed controverting affidavit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hong v.

App.-El Paso 1998, no pet.) ). In effect, the statute simply allows a plaintiff to avoid the necessity of presenting expert witness testimony as to the reasonableness of the amount of his medical expenses; however, it does not establish that a plaintiff is entitled to an award of those expenses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11838649\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/965/646/#p654\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting that although an uncontroverted section 18.001(b) affidavit provides \"legally sufficient\" evidence to sustain an award of medical expenses without the need to present expert witness testimony, it is \"not conclusive\" on the issue of whether the plaintiff is entitled to such an award).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To the contrary, Texas courts have uniformly recognized that presenting an uncontroverted medical records affidavit in compliance with section 18.001(b) does not substitute for evidence establishing a causal nexus between the defendant's negligence and the plaintiff's medical expenses; therefore, even if a plaintiff files such an affidavit, he still has the burden of establishing that his medical expenses were made necessary by the negligent acts or omission of the defendant in accordance with the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Murdock\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christus Health v.
