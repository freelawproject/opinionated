Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 286(c) of the controlled dangerous substances laws provides that a defendant who \u201cpreviously has been convicted\u201d of a similar offense is subject to a sentence of not less than ten years imprisonment. We are asked here to determine whether the enhanced penalty mandated by \u00a7 286(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is triggered when a defendant is convicted of a prior offense after the commission of, but before sentencing on, the principal offense upon which the enhanced penalty is sought. We hold that the mandatory sentence prescribed by \u00a7 286(c) may be imposed only where the conviction for a prior offense precedes the <em>commission </em>of the principal offense and, therefore, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">A trooper with the Maryland State Police purchased cocaine from Petitioner Leonard Timothy Gargliano at the Royal Exchange Pub in Salisbury in December 1989 and again in January 1990. Gargliano was not arrested after either of these transactions. When the trooper purchased cocaine from Gargliano a third time on December 21, 1990, however, Gargliano was arrested and was at that time charged with not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the latest sale but also with the two earlier sales. Gargliano was first brought to trial on charges arising out of the December 1989 and January 1990 sales and was convicted of two counts of distribution of cocaine on April 4, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">On June 21, 1991, prior to trial on the December 1990 offense, the State served Gargliano with a notice of intent to seek enhanced punishment on the December 1990 offense based upon the two convictions for the earlier sales. On September 27, 1991, upon a not guilty agreed statement of facts, Gargliano was convicted of one count of distribution of cocaine<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County as a result of the December 1990 sale. At sentencing, Gargliano argued that the enhanced penalty mandated by \u00a7 286(c) should not apply to a defendant who had neither been charged with nor convicted of a prior offense at the time the principal offense was committed. As is obvious from the above chronology of events, Gargliano committed the December 1990 offense before he was convicted \u2014 indeed, before he was even arrested\u2014 for either of the two prior sales. The trial judge rejected Gargliano\u2019s argument and ruled that \u00a7 286(c) is applicable whenever a prior conviction exists at the time of sentencing on the principal offense. Consequently, Gargliano was sentenced to the mandatory penalty of ten years, without parole, to be served concurrent with the sentences he was already serving on his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Gargliano appealed the imposition of the mandatory penalty and the applicability of \u00a7 286(c). The Court of Special Appeals held that \u00a7 286(c) unambiguously provides for an enhanced penalty if a prior conviction exists at the time of sentencing on the principal offense, even if the prior conviction is obtained after the commission of the principal offense. <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 593, 602, 622 A.2d 767, 774 (1993). The mandatory penalty of \u00a7 286(c) was therefore held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>to have been properly imposed upon Gargliano. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 622 A.2d at 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We granted Gargliano\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to consider whether, under \u00a7 286(c), the prior conviction which serves as the enhancing act must have been entered before the principal offense was committed. Reduced to its essentials, the question before us can be stated as follows: where the statute provides for an enhanced penalty if the defendant \u201cpreviously has been convicted\u201d of a similar offense, has a defendant \u201cpreviously been convicted\u201d where the conviction for the prior offense is entered after the defendant has committed the crime for which he is presently being sentenced?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Article 27, \u00a7 286, the statute here at issue, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">(c)(1) A person who is convicted under subsection (b)(1)[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] or subsection (b)(2)[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] of this section, or of conspiracy to violate subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than ten years <em>if the person previously has been convicted:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">(i) Under subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">(ii) Of conspiracy to violate subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">(iii) Of an offense under the laws of another state, the District of Columbia, or the United States that would be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>violation of subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) if committed in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">(emphasis added). Maryland, like every other state and the federal government,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has enacted various statutes which mandate enhanced penalties for certain repeat criminal offenders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although Article 27 contains numerous enhanced penalty statutes,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> only a few identify the sequence in which the enhancing act and the principal offense must occur.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 286(c) does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>not identify whether the prior conviction must be previous to the principal offense or merely previous to the sentencing for the enhanced penalty to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The lodestar of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>See, e.g., Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 73, 591 A.2d 481, 485 (1991); <em>Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471, 474 (1988); <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>302 Md. 143, 147, 486 A.2d 179, 181 (1985). We consider the goals or purpose to be served by the statute and the evils or mischief the General Assembly sought to remedy, and construe the statute in accordance with its general purposes and policies- \u2014 \u201cto remedy some evil, to advance some interest, to attain some end.\u201d <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">When called upon to construe a particular statute, we begin our analysis with the statutory language itself, as the words of the statute, given their ordinary and popularly understood meaning, are the primary source of legislative intent. <em>See, e.g., Dickerson v. State, </em>324 Md. 163, 170-71, 596 A.2d 648, 651 (1991); <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 92, 581 A.2d 9, 12 (1990); <em>Jones v. State, </em>304 Md. 216, 220, 498 A.2d 622, 624 (1985). If the language of the statute is plain and .clear and expresses a meaning consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, no further analysis is ordinarily required. <em>See, e.g., Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. at 515, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>525 A.2d at 633; <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>302 Md. at 147, 486 A.2d at 181. If the statute is clouded by ambiguity or obscurity, however,' we must consider \u201cnot only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment,\u201d in our attempt to discern the construction that will best further the legislative objectives or goals. <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986); <em>see also State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. at 93, 581 A.2d at 12; <em>Wynn v. State, </em>313 Md. 533, 539, 546 A.2d 465, 468 (1988). In doing so, the words of the statute must be \u201cread in light of the full context in which they appear, and in light of external manifestations of intent or general purpose available through other evidence.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. 182, 185, 567 A.2d 126, 127 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">To interpret the language of a statute in full context, we consider the statute\u2019s \u201cgeneral history and [the] prevailing mood of the legislative body with respect to the type of criminal conduct involved.\u201d <em>Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 327, 558 A.2d 715, 721 (1989); <em>see also Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. at 185, 567 A.2d at 127. Interpretation of the language of this statute in full context further requires that \u00a7 286(c) be read in conjunction with the other subsections of \u00a7 286 so that we may give effect to the whole statute and harmonize all of its provisions. <em>See Williams v. State, </em>329 Md. 1, 15-16, 616 A.2d 1275, 1282 (1992) (Court must discern \u201clegislative intent from the entire statutory scheme, as opposed to scrutinizing parts of a statute in isolation.\u201d); <em>see also Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. at 405, 535 A.2d at 474; <em>Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319-22, 498 A.2d 1195, 1197-98 (1985). Additionally, \u00a7 286(c) must be construed in light of the construction we have previously given to similarly worded enhanced penalty statutes, as \u201cstatutes that deal with the same subject matter, share a common purpose, and form part of the same system are <em>in pari materia </em>and must be construed harmoniously in order to give full effect to each enactment.\u201d <em>State v. Loscomb, </em>291 Md. 424, 432, 435 A.2d 764, 768 (1981). As we stated in <em>State v. Bricker, </em>\u201c[i]t is presumed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>General Assembly acted with full knowledge of prior legislation and intended statutes that affect the same subject matter to blend into a consistent and harmonious body of law.\u201d 321 Md. at 93, 581 A.2d at 12 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Finally, as a highly penal statute, \u00a7 286(c) must be \u201cstrictly construed so that only punishment contemplated by the language of the statute is meted out.\u201d <em>Dickerson v. State, </em>324 Md. at 172, 596 A.2d at 652 (citations omitted); <em>see also Rewis v. United States, </em>401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 1059, 28 L.Ed.2d 493, 497 (1971) (\u201c[R]ule of lenity\u201d requires court to construe any \u201cambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes ... in favor of lenity.\u201d); <em>Jones v. State, </em>324 Md. 32, 38, 595 A.2d 463, 466 (1991) (\u00a7 286(d) is highly penal and must be strictly construed); 3 C. Sands, <em>Sutherland on Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 59.03 at 102-03 (5th ed. 1992) (\u201c[WJhere there is doubt concerning the severity of the penalty prescribed by a statute, a milder penalty over a harsher one will be favored.\u201d). As we explained in <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 582 A.2d 525 (1990), in the context of sentencing,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">The policy behind the rule [of lenity] is \u201cthat the Court will not interpret a ... criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what [the legislature] intended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 222, 582 A.2d at 529 (quoting <em>Ladner v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 169, 178, 79 S.Ct. 209, 214, 3 L.Ed.2d 199, 205 (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">With these well settled rules of statutory construction in mind, we turn to our task of ascertaining the precise application of \u00a7 286(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Section 286(c) provides that a defendant who is convicted of violating either subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) or conspiracy to violate either of those subsections must be sentenced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ten years without parole<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cif the person previously has been convicted\u201d under those sections of the law. The statute is clear that a \u201cprevious conviction\u201d subjects a defendant to the enhanced penalty. Section 286(c) is unclear, however, as to when the conviction for the earlier offense must have been entered for it to be considered a \u201cprevious\u201d conviction such that the enhanced penalty applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Gargliano contends that the word \u201cpreviously\u201d in \u00a7 286(c) means \u201cprior to the commission of the principal offense\u201d while the State argues that \u201cpreviously\u201d means \u201cprior to sentencing on the principal offense.\u201d In support of his contention that \u00a7 286(c) should be interpreted such that a defendant \u201cpreviously has been convicted\u201d only if the defendant was convicted of the prior offense before the principal offense was committed, Gargliano asserts that enhanced penalties are typically applied only to defendants who have been convicted of an offense, have had the opportunity to reform their behavior, and thereafter commit additional criminal offenses. The interpretation of \u00a7 286(c) proffered by the State, and which the intermediate appellate court below adopted, is that a defendant \u201cpreviously has been convicted\u201d when a conviction exists at the time of sentencing on the principal offense. If the statute is interpreted in this manner, the sequence in which the enhancing act and the principal offense occur is irrelevant. The dispute over the proper interpretation of \u201cpreviously has been convicted\u201d ultimately resolves itself into a dispute over whether the statute was intended to apply only to defendants who fail to reform their behavior after a prior conviction or whether it was intended to apply to all defendants who amass multiple convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">As we stated above, \u00a7 286(c) does not define what is meant by the phrase \u201cpreviously has been convicted.\u201d We find that both interpretations of the phrase that have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>proffered are reasonable and, consequently, that \u00a7 286(c) is ambiguous. As such, we must look beyond the words of the statute and to other evidence of legislative intent to determine which interpretation of the two best furthers the legislative object or goals. <em>See, e.g., Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. at 75, 517 A.2d at 732; <em>Harbor Island Marina v. Calvert Co., </em>286 Md. 303, 311, 407 A.2d 738, 743 (1979); <em>Comptroller v. Mandel Re-election Com., </em>280 Md. 575, 579, 374 A.2d 1130, 1132 (1977). We now proceed to examine the legislative history of \u00a7 286(c) to determine what \u201cevils or mischief\u2019 prompted the enactment of this provision. <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421, 348 A.2d 275, 278 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Mandatory penalties for two time offenders under \u00a7 286 were first enacted in 1982 and appeared as subsections (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3). 1982 Laws of Maryland, Ch. 470. As enacted, each subsection provided that \u201c[a]ny person who has previously been convicted under this paragraph shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than ten years.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Legislature, aware that a disproportionately small number of drug offenders may be responsible for the commission of a large number of crimes, <em>see Testimony Summary, </em>SB 447, 1982 Legislative Session, enacted those subsections in order to \u201cimpos[e] mandatory sentences for persons previously convicted of certain offenses relating to the manufacture or distribution of controlled dangerous substances.\u201d 1982 Laws of Maryland, Ch. 470. As with the present version of the statute, the phrase \u201chas previously been convicted\u201d was not defined in \u00a7 286 as it existed in 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Section 286 was amended in 1988 to provide for even greater penalties for third and fourth convictions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At that time, subsections (d) and (e) were added to \u00a7 286 and subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) were recodified as subsection (c) without substantial change.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As recodified, subsections (c), (d) and (e) form a comprehensive scheme of graduated mandatory penalties for repeat offenders. <em>See </em>1988 Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, <em>Bill Analysis, </em>HB 606 (outlining graduated penalties of \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 286(c), (d) <em>&amp; </em>(e)). Subsection (c), mandating a sentence of at least ten years for a defendant who previously has been convicted of a similar offense, is commonly referred to as a \u201ctwo-time loser\u201d penalty. Subsection (d) of \u00a7 286 mandates a penalty of not less than 25 years for a \u201cthree-time loser,\u201d an individual who \u201cpreviously has served at least one term of confinement of at least 180 days in a correctional institution as a result of a conviction of a previous violation ... and has been convicted twice, where the convictions do not arise from a single incident.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If an individual \u201cpreviously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>has served 3 separate terms of confinement as a result of 3 separate convictions,\u201d the \u201cfour-time loser\u201d provision of \u00a7 286(e) applies and an enhanced sentence of not less than 40 years is mandated.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We have reviewed the entire legislative history of \u00a7 286 and have not discovered any discussion of the meaning of the phrase, \u201cpreviously has been convicted,\u201d in either the House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Judiciary Committee or the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee or on the floor of either body of the legislature during the enactment of any of the relevant amendments to \u00a7 286. The clear import of the language used throughout \u00a7 286 is that the Legislature sought to impose more stringent penalties on' certain offenders who repeatedly persist in a pattern of criminal conduct. From the sparse legislative history available, however, we cannot conclusively determine whether the General Assembly sought to subject all individuals who commit multiple offenses to the enhanced penalty or whether it sought to impose the statutory penalty only upon the narrower class of persons who have not responded to the restraining influence of conviction and punishment and thereafter continue to commit criminal acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">This is not the first time that we have had to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting an enhanced penalty statute. See, <em>e.g., Taylor v. State, </em>333 Md. 229, 235-36, 634 A.2d 1322, 1325 (1993) (\u00a7 643B(c) ambiguous as to whether defendant is entitled to parole or suspension of sentence imposed); <em>Jones v. State, </em>324 Md. at 38, 595 A.2d at 466 (\u00a7 286(d) ambiguous as to length of time individual must have actually been confined); <em>Malcolm v. State, </em>314 Md. 221, 234-35, 550 A.2d 670, 676 (1988) (language of then \u00a7 286(b)(2) ambiguous with respect to whether defendant who has met predicate requirements for application of statute could be granted parole if sentenced to greater than 10 years); <em>Montone v. State, </em>308 Md. 599, 615-16, 521 A.2d 720, 728 (1987) (\u00a7 643B(b) ambiguous as to whether prior convictions must be separated by intervening periods of incarceration); <em>see also Taylor v. State, </em>333 Md. at 236, 634 A.2d at 1325 (language of \u00a7 643B(b) termed \u201cpatently inartful,\u201d <em>citing Calhoun v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 478, 489-90, 418 A.2d 1241, 1249 (1980), <em>aff'd, </em>290 Md. 1, 425 A.2d 1361 (1981) and <em>Davis v.

When called upon to construe similar enhanced penalty statutes, we have repeatedly stated that the general purpose of such statutes is to deter the future commission of criminal offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>by persons who have previously been convicted and subject to the threat of punishment. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. State, </em>324 Md. at 38, 595 A.2d at 466; <em>Montone v. State, </em>308 Md. at 606, 521 A.2d at 723;. <em>see also Hawkins v. State, </em>302 Md. at 148, 486 A.2d at 182; <em>Garrett v.

State </em>we held that the plain language of \u00a7 286(d) evinced a legislative intent \u201cthat those who received the enhanced punishment had been accorded a fair chance at rehabilitation in the prison system and had not responded.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>324 Md. at 38, 595 A.2d at 466. In construing \u00a7 643B(b),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which is substantially similar to \u00a7 286(e) in mandating an additional penalty for an individual who \u201cpreviously has served three separate terms of confinement in a correctional institution,\u201d we found that the plain import of that statutory language was a legislative intent to \u201cidentify individuals incapable of rehabilitation and lock them up forever.\u201d <em>Montone v. State, </em>308 Md. at 613, 521 A.2d at 727. In <em>Montone, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">The picture that emerges is a statute specifically designed to identify and target a unique class of people so that they may be permanently exiled from our free society. These are the violent criminals who have been exposed to the correctional system three distinct times, who have refused to conform their conduct to societal standards, and who, instead, have demonstrated violent criminal behavior after each encounter with the correctional system, thus evidencing the futility of any hope for their rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">308 Md. at 606, 521 A.2d at 723. There, we also cited with approval the following statement from the Supreme Court of Nebraska:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Recidivist statutes are enacted in an effort to deter and punish incorrigible offenders____ They are intended to apply to persistent violators who have not responded to the restraining influence of conviction and punishment. It is the <em>commission </em>of the second felony <em>after conviction </em>for the first, and the <em>commission </em>of the <em>third </em>felony <em>after conviction </em>of the second that is deemed to make the defendant an incorrigible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\"><em>Montone v. State, </em>308 Md. at 609, 521 A.2d at 725 (citations omitted) <em>(quoting State v. Ellis, </em>214 Neb. 172, 333 N.W.2d 391, 394 (1983) (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">As noted by the United States Supreme Court, enhanced penalty statutes \u201cimpose a higher punishment for the same offence upon one who proves, by a second or third conviction, that the former punishment has been ineffacious in doing the work of reform for which it was designed.\u201d <em>Moore v. Missouri, </em>159 U.S. 673, 677, 16 S.Ct. 179, 181, 40 L.Ed. 301, 303 (1895) (citation omitted). In construing Maryland enhanced penalty statutes similar to \u00a7 286(c), we have found that such statutes were enacted with the purpose of identifying defendants who have not reformed their behavior after prior convictions and incarcerating such defendants for a longer period than would otherwise be applicable in order to protect the community and deter others from similar behavior. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. State, </em>324 Md. at 38, 595 A.2d at 466; <em>Montone v. State, </em>308 Md. at 606, 521 A.2d at 723; <em>see also Garrett v. State, </em>59 Md.App. at 118, 474 A.2d at 941, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 483, 479 A.2d 372 (1984). The means for achieving such deterrence is the provision of fair warning to previous offenders that if they continue to commit criminal acts after having had the opportunity to reform after one or more prior contacts with the criminal justice system, they will be imprisoned for a considerably longer period of time than they were subject to as first offenders. '</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Absent a clear statement of legislative intent to the contrary, we adhere to our previous determinations of legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>intent with regard to similar statutes \u2014 that the Legislature intended to \u201cprotect the public ... and to deter repeat offenders from perpetrating other criminal acts ... under the threat of an extended period of confinement\u201d \u2014 and find that the Legislature had the same intent in enacting \u00a7 286(c). <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>302 Md. at 148, 486 A.2d at 182. An enhanced penalty statute will best deter future criminal conduct when the defendant is made aware that the subsequent commission of criminal acts will be more harshly punished. Where, as here, the defendant has not been convicted of an earlier offense, and thereby warned about the enhanced consequences of future criminal conduct, prior to the commission of the principal offense, the imposition of an enhanced penalty is not warranted. We therefore hold that \u00a7 286(c) is applicable only if the defendant has been convicted of an earlier offense prior to the commission of the principal offense.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The rule in most jurisdictions with enhanced penalty statutes is that the prior conviction must precede the <em>commission </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>of the principal offense, and, thus, our interpretation of \u00a7 286(c) is in accord with the clear majority rule.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although the wording of these enhanced penalty statutes varies from state to state, most states that have considered the issue before us have held that an enhanced penalty is warranted <em>only </em>if the defendant was convicted of an earlier offense prior to the <em>commission </em>of the principal offense.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Generally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>courts following the majority rule share in our view that statutes which impose more severe penalties upon repeat offenders are intended to warn criminals of the consequences of persistent criminal conduct and to punish those who fail to take advantage of the opportunity to reform. As explained by the Kansas Supreme Court in <em>State v. Woodman, </em>127 Kan. 166, 272 P. 132 (1928):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">[I]t is a salutary provision of law that criminals who the law\u2019s discipline has hitherto failed to reform by prior convictions and punishment should form a class of defendants to be more severely punished than first offenders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">127 Kan. 166, 272 P. at 134. Similarly, as stated in <em>Morgan v. Commonwealth, </em>170 Ky. 400, 186 S.W. 132 (1916),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">It was not intended that the heavier penalty prescribed for the commission of a second offense should descend upon any one, except the incorrigible one, who, after being reproved, \u201cstill hardeneth his neck.\u201d If the heavier penalty prescribed for the second violation ... is visited upon the one who has not had the benefit of the reproof of a first conviction, then the purpose of the statute is lost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">170 Ky. 400, 186 S.W. at 133 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Although we recognize that courts in other jurisdictions have construed similar statutes in the manner advocated by the State and held that an enhanced penalty may be imposed when the prior conviction occurs after the commission of the principal offense,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we find that our construction of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ute \u2014 that the previous conviction relied upon for enhancement purposes must precede the commission of the principal offense \u2014 is in accord with the clear majority rule as well as the better reasoned cases and is most consistent with our prior interpretations of Maryland enhanced penalty statutes similar to \u00a7 286(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Finally, we note that while there is no evidence that the State delayed charging Gargliano with the December 1989 and January 1990 offenses so as to ensure that the mandatory penalty of \u00a7 286(c) would apply upon conviction of the December 1990 offense, we would be hesitant to construe the statute such that the State could, by the simple expedient of delaying the arrest or charging of an offense, manipulate the application of the statutory enhanced penalty. By requiring the prior conviction to precede commission of the principal offense, we assure uniformity and certainty in the application of \u00a7 286(c) and \u201celiminate[ ] any temptation on the part of the state to play games with the scheduling of an arraignment, or a sentencing in order to obtain an enhancement.\u201d <em>State v. Gehrke, </em>474 N.W.2d 722, 726 (S.D.1991); <em>see also Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S.-,-, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 2003, 124 L.Ed.2d 44, 56 (1993) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting potential for prosecutorial manipulation of enhanced penalty statute); <em>People v. Rojas, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at 802, 253 Cal.Rptr. at 791 (construction of enhanced penalty statute avoids possibility of prosecutorial manipulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Although we hold today that a conviction obtained after the commission of the principal offense does not trigger the imposition of a statutory enhanced penalty, we emphasize that evidence of other offenses and convictions obtained prior to sentencing remain within the wide scope of matters that the trial judge may consider in fashioning an appropriate sentence for a particular defendant. <em>See Logan v. State, </em>289 Md. 460, 480-81, 425 A.2d 632, 643 (1981); <em>Bartholomey v. State, 267 </em>Md. 175, 193-194, 297 A.2d 696, 706 (1972). As we explained in <em>Bartholomey v. State,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">[T]o aid the sentencing judge in fairly and intelligently exercising the discretion vested in him, the procedural policy of the State encourages him to consider information concerning the convicted person\u2019s reputation, past offenses, health, habits, mental and moral propensities, social background and any other matters that a judge ought to have before him in determining the sentence that should be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">267 Md. at 193, 297 A.2d at 706; <em>see also Johnson v. State, </em>274 Md. 536, 542, 336 A.2d 113, 116 (1975). A defendant\u2019s prior offenses and prior convictions are, of course, among those factors which the trial judge may take into consideration when imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In the area of statutory enhanced penalties, however, when we are uncertain whether the Legislature intended to authorize the imposition of an enhanced penalty in a particular situation, the presumption must be that the Legislature did not intend to do so. Accordingly, we hold that the enhanced penalty mandated by \u00a7 286(c) may be imposed only where the principal offense is committed after the defendant has been convicted of an earlier offense. Gargliano\u2019s sentence for the principal offense, distribution of cocaine, could not be enhanced under \u00a7 286(c) by his prior convictions for distribution of cocaine because those convictions were entered after the commission of the principal offense. Because the trial judge in the case <em>sub judice </em>relied upon convictions obtained after the commission of the principal offense in imposing the man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>datory penalty of \u00a7 286(c), we vacate that sentence and remand the matter for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED.

As explained by the Supreme Court of Louisiana in construing a similar enhanced penalty statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5S\">Traditional American principles of criminal responsibility of an individual for his conduct do not permit the state to convert a formal charge against him for a less serious offense into a charge for a more serious offense on the legal basis of a change of status or other incident which occurs <em>after </em>the initial offense charged.
