In Bundy\u2019s appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, the intermediate appellate court first opined that the State was entitled to only four peremptory challenges in the consolidated trial of Bundy and a codefendant. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 8 \u2014 301(d) (providing that, in cases other than those involving death, life imprisonment, or a statutorily prescribed sentence of 20 years or more, \u201ceach party is permitted 4 peremptory challenges\u201d). <em>See also </em>Maryland Rule 4-313(a)(l). That court, however, held that Bundy\u2019s \u201cobjection was not timely made\u201d and that the peremptory challenge issue was \u201cnot properly preserved for appellate review.\u201d <em>Bundy v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 512, 535, 622 A.2d 175, 187 (1993). Bundy disputes this conclusion, contending that his objection was timely and that, since the State exceeded the permitted number of peremptory challenges, his conviction must be reversed. For the reasons discussed below, we hold that Bundy suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ciently preserved for appellate review the issue of how many peremptory challenges the State should have been afforded.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Bundy was charged with theft of goods valued at $800.00 or more. He elected to be tried by a Baltimore City jury and his trial was consolidated with that of a codefendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury selection process began, and with it, the exercise of peremptory challenges by Bundy, his codefendant, and the State. After the State had exercised four peremptory challenges, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney asserted, \u201cI believe I\u2019m entitled to eight [challenges],\u201d to which the judge responded, \u201cYeah. Thank you. You\u2019re correct.\u201d Subsequently, the State exercised a fifth peremptory challenge and the stricken juror was directed to return to the jury assembly room. At this point, counsel for Bundy\u2019s codefendant declared, \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019m sorry. I thought the State had exhausted her strikes.\u201d The judge immediately reiterated, \u201cYou each get four. The State gets eight.\u201d After this ruling, the State exercised a sixth challenge, which was followed by the selection of the alternate juror. Thereupon, Bundy\u2019s counsel asked to approach the bench and the following bench conference took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaz\">\u201c[BUNDY\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I\u2019m somewhat confused. This just doesn\u2019t seem right. I thought each side got four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>strikes. I\u2019m just looking at the rule book. I don\u2019t understand how the State gets eight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">THE COURT: Well, it\u2019s two cases here. You get four for your case and the State gets four for her case. [Codefendant\u2019s counsel] gets four for her case and she gets four.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">[CODEFENDANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: But, they\u2019re being charged as codefendants, Your Honor. It\u2019s one trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">[BUNDY\u2019S ATTORNEY]: You see what I\u2019m saying. The State \u2014 even though they\u2019re calling two separate charging documents we are talking about one trial. I mean, the reason that I said that \u2014 we are sitting there, she keeps on striking and it just doesn\u2019t seem quite right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">[BUNDY\u2019S ATTORNEY]: So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">THE COURT: What are you asking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">[BUNDY\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">THE COURT: She is entitled to eight. You each get four.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa4k\">[BUNDY\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Okay. I\u2019m just going to I guess lodge an objection to the panel then at this point in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL6\">[CODEFENDANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I will join in the objection and ask for a mistrial at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">[BUNDY\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I will join in that too.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">The judge decided to recess for the day, instructed the jurors that trial would resume the following morning, and dismissed them. After the jurors had left, the discussion about the State\u2019s peremptory challenges continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">\u201c[BUNDY\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, if I may, I know you have already ruled on the issue of the peremptory challenges, but I would like to be able to pull some law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-15\">* * * * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-16\">I think the State is only allowed four strikes in this case. I would like over night just to do a little bit of research on the law and bring [it] to the Court tomorrow and perhaps before the jury comes back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>THE COURT: Well, of course, you can do that, but be here a little early tomorrow. Yes, you get the law and you also, Ms. Pollack [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: ... I mean, is the Court asking me to do research over night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">THE COURT: Well, Ms. Pollack, you\u2019re an experienced State\u2019s Attorney. You advised the Court and I think correctly that you\u2019re entitled to that number of strikes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWt\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I advised the Court on the basis of what I was told by a more experienced State\u2019s Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m asking you to please get me the law on it <em>because if you are, in fact, wrong I\u2019m going to have to dismiss this jury panel tomorrow </em>\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYG\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au-\">THE <em>COURT: </em>\u2014 and <em>start over. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">The following day, the judge resumed the peremptory challenge discussion by noting, \u201c[n]ow, the question really is how many [peremptory challenges] were they entitled to. Now, you ... were going to give me some law this morning.\u201d After a lengthy discussion on this topic, the judge reiterated his belief that the State seemed to be entitled to eight peremptory challenges and thus concluded, \u201cI\u2019m going to deny your request that this panel be dismissed and a new jury be selected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AuW\">The trial proceeded and Bundy was convicted of theft of goods valued at $300.00 or more. Bundy appealed his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals, alleging that the trial court erred in granting the State eight peremptory challenges. In a detailed opinion by Judge Moylan, the intermediate appellate court traced the legislative history behind \u00a7 8-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which entitles \u201ceach party\u201d to four peremptory challenges in a case such as Bundy\u2019s. In accordance with Bundy\u2019s contention that the State remains a single party, even when it prosecutes multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>defendants in the same trial, Judge Moylan concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">\u201cNothing ... in the 1986 amendment to \u00a7 8-301 affected in any way the pre-existing and ongoing status of the State as a single and indivisible party. Indeed, the legislative history of the amending Act reinforces our conclusion that the Legislature certainly did not intend to increase costs and to increase the number of jurors called for service by increasing the peremptory challenges available to the State from a single set of four to multiples of four.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\"><em>Bundy, </em>95 Md.App. at 531, 622 A.2d at 185. Despite this conclusion, the Court of Special Appeals held that Bundy\u2019s objection was untimely and that the peremptory challenge issue was not properly preserved for appellate review. The court stated that neither defendant objected until after \u201cthe prospective jurors who had been earlier challenged had left the courtroom and returned to the jury assembly room\u201d and after the alternate juror was accepted. <em>Bundy, </em>95 Md.App. at 534, 622 A.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In its answer to Bundy\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, the State concedes that it \u201cdoes not here challenge\u201d the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the State was entitled to only four peremptory challenges in the instant case. The State, however, does challenge Bundy\u2019s assertion that his objection adequately preserved the issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The State and Bundy disagree over whether Maryland Rules 8-131(a) and 4-323(c), concerning the preservation of issues for appellate review, were complied with in the instant case. Rule 8-131(a) provides that, \u201c[o]rdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any ... issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.... \u201d At trial, a significant amount of time was devoted to the issue of how many peremptory challenges the State was entitled to exercise. Before affirming his earlier ruling that the \u201cState gets eight\u201d peremptory challenges, the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>permitted Bundy\u2019s attorney to research the issue, asked the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney also to do some overnight research, and entertained a lengthy discussion regarding the results of the parties\u2019 research. Thus, Rule 8-131(a) was clearly satisfied as it \u201cplainly appears by the record [that the peremptory challenge issue was] raised in or decided by the trial court____\u201d Md.Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The State, however, also contends that Bundy failed to comply with Maryland Rule 4-323(e). Rule 4-323(c) provides that, \u201c[f]or purposes of review by the trial court or on appeal of any other ruling or order, it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Graham v. State, </em>325 Md. 398, 411, 601 A.2d 131, 137 (1992) (stating that, unless a party \u201chad no opportunity to do so, he is required to have made known to the court his objection to the ruling at the time the ruling was made\u201d). This rule is premised on the notion that \u201c[t]he ends of justice are served by the avoidance of delay and expense incident to appeals and new trials upon grounds of objection which might have been obviated and corrected in the trial court if the question had been ruled upon.\u201d <em>Davis v. State, </em>189 Md. 269, 273, 55 A.2d 702, 704 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Applying Rule 4-323(c) to the instant case, the Court of Special Appeals held that Bundy\u2019s objection was not timely and, therefore, the peremptory challenge issue was not preserved. The court explained its holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u201cAt the time the appellant finally objected [after the selection of the alternate juror], there was nothing the trial judge could do about the matter. Jurors earlier challenged could hardly be recalled and seated. There would be a question of which jurors then seated should be unseated. There would be a question of whether one of the unseated jurors should, in turn, unseat the alternate. There was, of course, always the possibility that the dismissed jurors had been sent home for the day, thus ending their jury service. There was also the possibility that the dismissed jurors had been sent to another courtroom and, possibly, even impaneled to hear another case. When the judge was finally called upon to rule upon the appellant\u2019s objection, there was no remedy available. \u2018The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><em>Bundy, </em>95 Md.App. at 535, 622 A.2d at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The State maintains that \u201c[t]he law and the record\u201d in this case support the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion. Citing <em>King v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>284 Md. 368, 372-73, 396 A.2d 267, 270 (1979), the State acknowledges that this Court has declared that \u201ca party is obligated to state his dissatisfaction with the jury selection procedure before the jury is sworn.\u201d The State, however, maintains that \u201can even more timely objection\u201d is required when dealing with the erroneous exercise of additional peremptory challenges. The State\u2019s reasoning is that \u201cwhere, as here, a selection procedure results not only in the elimination of jurors from the panel, but their removal from the courtroom, the objecting party\u2019s immediate complaint is not merely desirable but necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">We are in general agreement with the intermediate appellate court\u2019s and the State\u2019s comments. Ordinarily an objection should be lodged at the time an excess peremptory challenge is exercised because the trial judge may wish to remedy any error by recalling and seating the juror who was improperly stricken. <em>See Covington v. State, </em>282 Md. 540, 543, 386 A.2d 336, 337 (1978) (\u201c[I]t is incumbent upon a litigant to make known to the court an objection to the action of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>court at the earliest practicable opportunity.\u201d). <em>See also Lohss and Sprenkle v. State, </em>272 Md. 113, 119, 321 A.2d 534, 538 (1974) (stating generally that, \u201cwhen a party has the option of objecting, his failure to do so <em>while it is still within the power of the trial court to correct the error </em>is regarded as a waiver estopping him from obtaining a review of the point or question on appeal\u201d (emphasis added)). Even Bundy acknowledges this general principle, noting that \u201c[t]he proper time for objection to the State\u2019s utilization of more than four strikes was when the State actually exercised its fifth strike. That is the point at which the State\u2019s improper utilization of additional peremptories became obvious; and that is the point at which the trial court could have avoided prejudicing Petitioner.\u201d Thus, in order to provide the trial judge with an opportunity to seat an improperly stricken juror, an objection should be noted as soon as the extra peremptory challenge is exercised.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Although generally counsel should immediately object when the opposing party exceeds its allotted number of peremptory challenges, we have recognized that delayed objections to the exercise of peremptory challenges are permissible in limited circumstances. In <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 89, 106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>S.Ct. 1712, 1719, 90 L.Ed.2d 69, 83 (1986), the United States Supreme Court established that \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race.... \u201d When applying <em>Batson </em>in <em>Stanley v. State, </em>313 Md. 50, 542 A.2d 1267 (1988), this Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">\u201c[a] <em>Batson </em>objection is timely if the defendant makes it no later than when the last juror has been seated and before the jury has been sworn. <em>By waiting, rather than objecting to the first and every subsequent strike of a black juror, a clearer picture of what the State is doing may be seen; a pattern may form. </em>And if the objection is delayed, the trial court will have before it the total facts and circumstances of jury selection and thus will be in a better position to make the necessary <em>Batson </em>rulings, and to apply an appropriate remedy if one is called for.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">313 Md. at 69, 542 A.2d at 1276. <em>See also Parker v. State, </em>72 Md.App. 610, 617-18, 531 A.2d 1313, 1317 (1987) (stating that an objection premised upon the use of peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner \u201cappropriately may not be raised, or, at the least, is not cognizable, until the factual predicate for it exists\u201d). Because it is often necessary to obtain a \u201cclearer picture\u201d of how the State is exercising its strikes when a <em>Batson </em>violation is alleged, we concluded in <em>Stanley </em>that \u201can objection made just before the jury is sworn will ordinarily be sufficient to preserve a <em>Batson </em>issue for appellate review....\u201d <em>Stanley, </em>313 Md. at 69, 542 A.2d at 1276.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>We noted in <em>Stanley, </em>however, that even in cases where a party alleges racially discriminatory jury selection, \u201cprudence may suggest some action at an earlier time.\u201d 313 Md. at 69-70, 542 A.2d at 1276. We observed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">\u201cIf, for example, there is a question as to the race of a potential juror who has been the subject of a peremptory strike, it may be advisable to object at that point, in order to obtain a factual finding as to race while the juror is still available. <em>And if one appropriate remedy for a Batson violation is to seat the unconstitutionally stricken jurors ..., it is important to bring the Batson problem to the court\u2019s attention promptly. Otherwise, the jurors in question might be excused, and no longer available, if the court ultimately finds that peremptory challenges have been exercised in an unconstitutionally discriminatory manner. </em>Thus considerations of making an appropriate record ... and of keeping open options as to a proper remedy are among the considerations that may prompt careful counsel, under some circumstances, to object at a relatively early point in the jury selection process. Similar considerations may guide counsel in deciding the manner in which peremptories are exercised (e.g., challenge jury or struck jury).\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\"><em>Stanley, </em>313 Md. at 70 n. 10, 542 A.2d at 1276 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Although the quoted language from <em>Stanley </em>is not directly applicable to the instant case, it illustrates the need to object immediately to the improper exercise of peremptory challenges in most <em>non-Batson </em>scenarios. Absent a claim of racial discrimination (or gender discrimination),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> there is no need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>wait and see whether a pattern of discriminatory selection develops. Thus, a defendant should object as soon as the State exceeds the proper number of peremptory challenges afforded to it. \u201cOtherwise, the jurors in question might be excused, and no longer available, if the court ultimately finds that peremptory challenges have been exercised in an [improper] manner.\u201d <em>Stanley, </em>313 Md. at 70 n. 10, 542 A.2d at 1276 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Moreover, if we provided counsel with an unqualified right to object to the opposition\u2019s exercise of more than the allotted number of peremptory challenges at any time before the jury is sworn, counsel might time his or her objection so as to gain a tactical advantage or to delay the trial. Rather than objecting when the judge could remedy any error by simply calling a stricken juror back, counsel could wait and see whether the panel as a whole is desirable, and if not, ask that it be stricken. Such a practice, however, would be unacceptable. <em>Cf. Marsh v. Hand, </em>35 Md. 123, 127 (1872) (explaining that the purpose of requiring a timely objection to inadmissible evidence is \u201cto prevent a party from knowingly withholding his objection, until he discovers the effect of the testimony, and then if it turns out to be unfavorable to interpose his objection\u201d). Generally the jury selection process should not be repeated merely because an excess peremptory was exercised. Thus, absent a timely objection under Rule 4-323(c), Bundy would not have adequately preserved the peremptory challenge issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">With this background in mind, we must now examine the record before us to determine whether Bundy has satisfied the requirements of Rule 4-323(c). Prior to the State\u2019s exercise of a fifth peremptory challenge, the judge expressly accepted as correct the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s assertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>that, \u201cI believe I\u2019m entitled to eight [challenges].\u201d When the State exercised a fifth peremptory, defense counsel for Bundy\u2019s codefendant proclaimed, \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019m sorry. I thought the State had exhausted her strikes.\u201d In accordance with his earlier pronouncement, the judge summarily ruled, \u201cYou each get four [peremptory challenges]. The State gets eight.\u201d The State insists that Bundy \u201cmischaracterizes\u201d counsel for the eodefendant\u2019s statement as an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Although \u201cthe articulation of the objection was not a paragon of clarity,\u201d <em>Sherman v. State, </em>288 Md. 636, 640, 421 A.2d 80, 82 (1980), and although we would recommend that counsel express objections in more definite terms, Rule 4-323(c) was satisfied under the circumstances of this case. This Court made clear in <em>Lattisaw v. State, </em>329 Md. 339, 619 A.2d 548 (1993), that it is not necessary for counsel to exclaim the exact words, \u201cI object,\u201d when the trial court makes an adverse ruling. Where the record demonstrates that counsel \u201csufficiently indicated his [or her] disagreement with the [trial] court\u2019s view,\u201d we have refused to \u201cread Rule 4-323(c) so narrowly.\u201d <em>Lattisaw, </em>329 Md. at 344, 619 A.2d at 550. <em>See also Phillips v. Venker, </em>316 Md. 212, 216, 557 A.2d 1338, 1340 (1989) (\u201cAlthough it would have been preferable for the attorney to employ the time-honored expression of T object,\u2019 thus removing any question about preservation, we believe that given the unusual circumstances of this case, his statements were sufficient to convey his objection.\u201d); <em>Scott v. State, </em>289 Md. 647, 654, 426 A.2d 923, 927 (1981) (\u201cWhile appellant\u2019s counsel did not use the magic words T object\u2019, he did make known to the court that to which he objected.\u201d); 5 Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 103.8, at 26 n. 2 (1987) (\u201cOf course, the words T object\u2019 are not necessary; it is enough that counsel indicate that he or she protests a particular thing.\u201d). In the instant case, the record sufficiently indicates that counsel\u2019s statement put the trial judge on notice of her complaint that the State just exceeded its allotted number of peremptory challenges. The judge, however, declined to remedy the State\u2019s exercise of its fifth challenge and immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>reiterated his earlier ruling that the State gets eight challenges and each defendant gets four.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Perhaps anticipating our ruling that Bundy\u2019s codefendant complied with Rule 4-323(e), the State notes that, \u201ceven had co-counsel\u2019s query to the court at this juncture constituted an objection, Bundy still is not entitled to relief. It is settled that a co-defendant\u2019s objection is not sufficient to preserve the issue for the non-objecting party.\u201d For this proposition, the State cites <em>Osburn v. State, </em>301 Md. 250, 253, 482 A.2d 905, 906 (1984) and <em>Ezenwa v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 489, 514-15, 572 A.2d 1101, 1113 (1990). Thus, the State contends that Bundy\u2019s attempt \u201cto climb onto the back of what he asserts was his co-defendant\u2019s more timely objection\u201d must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\"><em>Osburn, </em>however, is distinguishable from the facts <em>sub judice. </em>On appeal in <em>Osburn, </em>the defendant contended that a portion of the State\u2019s closing argument was objectionable. At trial, however, only a codefendant objected to the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s argument. The record in <em>Osburn </em>indicates that, in response to the codefendant\u2019s objection, the judge stated, \u201coverrule it,\u201d and informed the State to continue with its closing argument. After this ruling, the codefendant objected again and a bench conference took place. At the bench conference, Osburn had nothing to say about the allegedly improper argument. This Court concluded that \u201c[t]he record reveals that Osburn did not object to the state\u2019s argument although [the codefendant] did.... No relief was sought by Osburn and thus, ... the issue has not been preserved for review.\u201d <em>Osburn, </em>301 Md. at 253, 482 A.2d at 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Expanding on <em>Osburn </em>in <em>Ezenwa, </em>the Court of Special Appeals held that, where only a codefendant objected to testimony, two other codefendants could not raise the issue before the intermediate appellate court because they did not individually object. 82 Md.App. at 514-15, 572 A.2d at 1113. In that case, counsel for the codefendant stated, \u201c[objection,\u201d to which the judge responded, \u201c[ojverruled,\u201d and instructed the witness to continue testifying. <em>Ezenwa, </em>82 Md.App. at 514, 572 A.2d at 1113. The two other defendants did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>object, and the intermediate appellate court refused to address the issue on their behalf. <em>Ezenwa, </em>82 Md.App. at 515, 572 A.2d at 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Although we express no opinion on the soundness of the <em>Ezenwa </em>holding, we note that Judge Joseph Murphy, commenting on <em>Ezenwa </em>in his handbook on Maryland evidence law, wrote the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">\u201cThis rule should be relaxed, but do not expect that it will be. Unless the identity and/or status of the objecting party is a factor in the trial judge\u2019s decision to overrule the objection, any counsel\u2019s objection really should be allowed to preserve the issue, at least for all similarly situated parties. On appeal, of course, everyone should be stuck with whatever reasons have been stated in support of any such objection. <em>Right now, however, unless the trial judge is kind enough to state for the record which parties will receive the benefit of another party\u2019s request for relief, </em>you will always have to protect the record yourself.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook </em>\u00a7 102(C), at 13 (2d ed. 1993). Judge Murphy\u2019s comments highlight one reason why the instant case is distinguishable <em>from Osbum </em>and <em>Ezenwa. </em>In neither <em>Osbum </em>nor <em>Ezenwa </em>did the trial judge suggest that the non-objecting defendant would receive the benefit of the other party\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">In this case, however, the trial judge was \u201ckind enough\u201d to acknowledge that the codefendant\u2019s objection also benefited Bundy. When the codefendant exclaimed, \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019m sorry. I thought the State had exhausted her strikes,\u201d the judge explicitly addressed both of the parties in overruling the objection. He immediately stated, <em>\u201cYou each </em>get four. The State gets eight.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, the manner in which the trial judge summarily overruled the objection in this case adequately reflects that he assumed the objection was made on behalf of both defendants. As such, Bundy sufficiently preserved the peremptory challenge issue for appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In sum, Bundy\u2019s codefendant \u201csufficiently indicated his disagreement with the court\u2019s view\u201d concerning the proper number of peremptory challenges allotted to the State. <em>Lattisaw, </em>329 Md. at 344, 619 A.2d at 550. \u201cIn so doing, he made known his \u2018objection to the action of the court,\u2019 which is all that Rule 4-323(c) requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Md.Rule 4-323(c)). Furthermore, immediately after the codefendant\u2019s objection, the trial court ruled on the objection. The manner of that ruling obviated Bundy\u2019s need to join in the objection because the judge acknowledged that the objection inured to Bundy\u2019s benefit by expressly directing his ruling (\u201cYou each get four. The State gets eight.\u201d) to both defendants. Thus, the peremptory challenge issue was sufficiently preserved by Bundy.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Because the Court of Special Appeals decided this case on non-preservation grounds, it failed to determine the relief to which Bundy is entitled. We note that the State prudently declined to contest the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 ruling that the State was entitled only to four peremptory challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>under Md.Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. Art., \u00a7 8-301(d), and we accept Judge Moylan\u2019s well-considered conclusion. Therefore, whether the State\u2019s erroneous exercise of a fifth and sixth peremptory challenge was harmless, or whether that error necessitates a new trial, must now be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The State suggests that, even if Bundy preserved the peremptory challenge issue and even if the State exercised too many challenges, we should remand the case to the Court of Special Appeals for a determination of whether that error was harmless. For the purpose of judicial economy, however, we shall address this issue now. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(b). In its brief before the intermediate appellate court, the State\u2019s harmless error argument was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">\u201c[E]ven if [the Court of Special Appeals] were to agree with Bundy\u2019s interpretation of the peremptory challenge statute and rule, he nevertheless should not be entitled to reversal of his conviction. As discussed, the goal of the peremptory challenge is to achieve impartiality on the jury. Bundy has never suggested that he was tried by anything less than an impartial jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Thus, the State contends that Bundy \u201cis not entitled to reversal, since he suffered no prejudice as the result of the [State exercising the additional peremptory challenges].\u201d This argument might have some merit. <em>Cf. St. Luke Church v. Smith, </em>318 Md. 337, 343-44, 568 A.2d 35, 38 (1990) (suggesting that in some instances the granting of excess peremptory challenges may not constitute a \u201csignificant deviation from prescribed procedure\u201d which necessitates a new trial). In the instant case, however, the trial judge reopened the inquiry into the peremptory challenge issue and opined that, under the totality of the circumstances, dismissal of the panel should be the remedy if the State had in fact exercised two excess peremptory challenges. Perhaps this was based upon his realization that, if the State had in fact been improperly permitted additional peremptory challenges, this may have had a prejudicial effect on these defendants. Moreover, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>the State was permitted to exercise its excess challenges, the defendant had exhausted his strikes. Based on these facts, the judge told all the parties that if the State was wrong, he was going to \u201chave to dismiss this jury panel.\u201d We shall adopt his proposed remedy under these unusual circumstances. Therefore, Bundy is entitled to a new jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The State\u2019s case sought to prove that two brothers, Melvin and Marvin Bundy, entered a jewelry store on Harford Road. According to the State\u2019s witnesses, Melvin Bundy (defendant) asked to look at a watch. While the defendant examined the watch, his brother, in a possible attempt to distract the employee, repeatedly asked to see another watch. The employee, however, declined his requests. After the defendant looked at the watch and discussed it with his brother, they bolted for the door. The employee, however, flipped a switch located under the counter, which locked the door. The <em>employee then </em>called <em>to </em>the president of the store, who came up from the basement. Sensing a volatile situation, he pulled a loaded \u201c38 Special\u201d from behind the counter and, without pointing it at the brothers, made them aware of its presence before placing it back under the counter. The brothers returned the watch, alleged that the employee was \"distraught,\u201d and that she mistakenly claimed they tried to steal it. Despite their pleas that the police not be called, the employee telephoned the police who arrived shortly thereafter and arrested the brothers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\">. In its entirety, Maryland Rule 4-323(c) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">\u201cObjections to Other Rulings or Orders. \u2014 For purposes of review by the trial court or on appeal of any other ruling or order, it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court. The grounds for the objection need not be stated unless these rules expressly provide otherwise or the court so directs. If a party has no opportunity to object to a ruling or order at the time it is made, the absence of an objection at that time does not constitute a waiver of the objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\">. Although the State maintains that Bundy was required to object no later than the point at which the State exercised its fifth strike, it contends that an even earlier objection should be required. The State argues that \u201c[t]he time to have objected was at the time of the court\u2019s granting the additional strikes....\u201d It was not necessary, however, for Bundy to object to the court\u2019s granting of the additional strikes. As the Court of Special Appeals aptly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">\u201cPreliminarily, we have to note that the appellant\u2019s complaint ... about the State's having been <em>awarded </em>peremptory challenges is beside the point. The <em>awarding </em>of excess challenges would be immaterial if, in fact, they were never utilized. In this case, the State used six of the eight peremptory challenges it was awarded. The significant error, therefore, if error it be, is not that the State was <em>awarded four additional </em>peremptory challenges to which it was not entitled but that it <em>actually utilized two additional </em>peremptories to which it was not entitled.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-8\"><em>Bundy v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 512, 514, 622 A.2d 175, 176 (1993) (citing <em>St. Luke Church v. Smith, </em>318 Md. 337, 344, 568 A.2d 35, 38 (1990)). Thus, the defendant correctly asserts that \"[t]he proper time for objection to the State\u2019s utilization of more than four strikes was <em>when the State actually exercised its fifth strike. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">. In the various scenarios to which <em>Batson </em>has been extended, it is often equally necessary for a party to delay his or her objection until a \"clearer picture\u201d of how opposing counsel is exercising peremptory challenges has formed. <em>See Georgia v. McCollum, </em>505 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 2348, 120 L.Ed.2d 33 (1992) (extending <em>Batson </em>to prohibit criminal defendant from exercising peremptory challenges to purposefully discriminate based on race); <em>Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., </em>500 U.S. 614, 111 S.Ct. 2077, 114 L.Ed.2d 660 (1991) (holding that civil litigant\u2019s exercise of racially discriminatory peremptory challenges offends Equal Protection Clause); <em>Powers v.

T.B., </em>606 So.2d 156 (Ala.Civ.App.1992), <em>cert. </em>granted, -U.S.-, 113 S.Ct. 2330, 124 L.Ed.2d 242 (1993) (consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ering whether <em>Batson </em>should be extended to forbid peremptory jury strikes based on gender where nine out of ten men in the venire were stricken in a paternity suit).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\">. Our conclusion that the judge intended the codefendant\u2019s objection to benefit Bundy as well is also evident from the judge's decision to reexamine whether the State had exceeded its allotted number of challenges. <em>At the request of Bundy\u2019s counsel, </em>the judge gave her permission to \u201cpull some law\u201d on the issue and told her to arrive \u201ca little early\u201d the next day to address the issue. Apparently this was an implicit acknowledgment that the judge was on notice of both parties\u2019 objection to his earlier ruling that the State was entitled to eight peremptory challenges. Absent the codefendant\u2019s objection at the time the State exercised its fifth challenge, and absent the judge\u2019s belief that the objection benefited Bundy as well, it is unlikely that the trial court would have reconsidered the issue at the request of Bundy\u2019s counsel. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 4-323(c) (stating that, \u201c[f]or purposes of review by the trial court ..., it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court\u201d). <em>See also </em>Maryland Rule of Procedure 522 b (1984) (predecessor of Rule 4-323(c)) (stating that, \u201c[f]or purposes of reconsideration by the trial court,\u201d an objection should be made at the time the objectionable ruling is made).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
