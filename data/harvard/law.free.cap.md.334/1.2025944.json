On the morning of trial Tiller filed an Amended Bill of Complaint. It alleged that Tiller was a New York corporation, registered and doing business in the State of New York. Ronald Nadler was a resident of the State of Maryland and the chief executive officer of Glenmar, as well as its principal, if not only, stockholder. To the best of Tiller\u2019s information and belief Glenmar leased certain space in the Westridge Square Shopping Center, located in Frederick, Maryland, and in Cranberry Mall, located in Westminster, Maryland. Tiller and Nadler entered into two contracts, one calling for Tiller to do \u201cthe work\u201d for. Nadler at Westridge for $637,000, and the other for Tiller to do \u201cthe work\u201d for Nadler at Cranberry for $688,800. Ronald Nadler requested that Tiller send all bills to Glenmar, the lessee at both shopping malls. Ronald Nadler agreed to be personally liable to Tiller for the payment of both contracts. At the time of the suit, due to change orders and credits, there was a net balance due for the Cranberry project in the amount of $229,799.46, and on the Westridge project the sum of $264,273.85, which Nadler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>refused to pay, although it had approved all work, including change orders and their cost, and even though the work had been performed in a timely, good and workmanlike manner. The Amended Bill of Complaint contained two counts alleging breach of contract. Count I sought damages in the amount due under the Cranberry contract, and Count II sought damages in the amount due under the Westridge contract. Tiller demanded judgment against Ronald Nadler and Glen-mar plus interest, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Also on the morning of trial, Nadler handed to the court and to opposing counsel a Motion to Dismiss based on \u00a7 7-301. In his Motion Nadler asserted that Tiller was a New York Corporation \u201cwhich has never qualified to transact business in the State of Maryland.\u201d Appended to the Motion was a certification by the custodian of records of the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation that there is no record of a foreign or domestic corporation by the name of Tiller Construction Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Also appended to the Motion were excerpts from depositions of Mr. Tiller and his daughter. She was President and Treasurer of Tiller Construction Corporation. Both Mr. Tiller and his daughter said that they did not remember any documents being executed registering or qualifying the company to do business in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Tiller\u2019s counsel conceded that the corporation had not qualified to do business in this State.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His point, however, was that Tiller was not obliged to qualify because its activities did not mount up to doing business in Maryland in the contemplation of the statute. Tiller\u2019s counsel claimed that Tiller \u201cjust had occasional business\u201d in Maryland. Nadler\u2019s counsel countered by asserting that there were two separate contracts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>build movie theaters, each \u201cin excess of one-half million dollars.\u201d The contracts involved</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqI\">the employment of a substantial number of subcontractors, most of whom were Maryland subcontractors, involved maintaining a supervisor on each job, as well as they opened Maryland bank accounts....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">He claimed that \u201call of this is really uncontested.\u201d After discussion about the timeliness of the motion and other preliminary matters, the court reserved ruling and called for the trial to begin on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The first witness was Bruce Tiller, Vice President and stockholder of Tiller Construction Corporation, who was called to testify on behalf of his company. Mr. Tiller told the court that he first met Nadler in 1986 at Frederick, Maryland when a Mr. Manus, for whom he had done a considerable amount of work in other states, asked him to give a projected cost on the construction of two cinemaplexes. Nadler called Mr. Tiller in the spring of 1987 and asked if he would build the theaters for him on the same basis as given Manus. Mr. Tiller checked \u25a0with Manus, was informed that Manus was not going through with the project and had no objection to Tiller building the cinemaplexes for Nadler. Mr. Tiller told Nadler that he would build the theaters on the same basis as proposed to Manus. At Nadler\u2019s request, Mr. Tiller came to Maryland to confer with an architect. The plans for the Westridge project were completed and a contract was executed by Nadler and Tiller on that project at a base bid of $687,000. A contract was also executed on the Cranberry Mall project calling for a cost of $688,800. The contracts were standard A.I.A. contracts. The Westridge project was about 98% complete late in December 1987. The Cranberry project was about 98% complete when Tiller received a letter from Nadler\u2019s attorney dated 26 January 1988. It expressed dissatisfaction with Tiller and how the projects were being handled. In the letter, Nadler\u2019s attorney also complained about Mr. Tiller\u2019s \u201cpersonal conduct\u201d in handling the work and contended that the \u201cconstruction and management of the projects has been most deficient.\u201d The attorney advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>I have met with Ron Nadler over the past several days and it is his decision that Glenmar must terminate you from the two jobs in Frederick and Cranberry [as of 22 January 1988].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">It was elicited from Mr. Tiller that on the Westridge and Cranberry projects Tiller and its superintendents \u201cinteracted not only with Mr. Nadler ... but also interacted at times with the architect.\u201d The meetings were held on the job sites in Maryland. All but one of the dozen or so subcontractors on each job were from Maryland. Tiller opened a bank account in the Sovran Bank of Maryland and the Maryland subcontractors were paid by checks drawn on that account. Each project had a telephone for the duration of the jobs, listed with information in the name of Tiller Construction Corporation. Tiller billed the subcontractors for the work they did. The superintendent on the Cranberry project was an employee of Tiller and the superintendent on the Westridge job was an independent contractor hired by Tiller.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Later in the day, the court asked Nadler\u2019s counsel how much more time he expected to spend cross-examining Mr. Tiller: \u201cDo you figure another two hours with this witness?\u201d The response was, \u201cA lot more, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">THE COURT: Is that two days or two hours? I really need a range.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">NADLER\u2019S COUNSEL: I would say at least another four hours, Your Honor, because we have got all these change orders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The court announced that it \u201cwould like to finish the plaintiffs case tomorrow\u201d and then consider whether Tiller had been doing business in such a way as to fall under the requirements of Title 7 of the Corporations and Associations Article. Depending on the result, he told the parties, the case might end without further ado. Then the court suggested an alternative route. It told Tiller\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">It may well be that the way to approach this is ... to let you develop any further evidence that you want to develop on the issue of presence or non-presence in the State for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>purposes of qualification, let [Nadler\u2019s attorney] do the same, and limit our inquiry to those issues, and then go \u2022 directly to a motion to dismiss to see where we are before we spend four hours on the change orders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">After both sides agreed to the suggestion, the court announced a 10-minute break after which \u201cI would like you [Nadler\u2019s lawyer] to confine your cross-examination ... to ... any further questions that you have got on the issue of qualification.\u201d Turning to the lawyer for Tiller, the court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">You may redirect on that issue, and we will reserve. I have some questions that I want to ask on the issue of qualification. If I feel that our record is complete by the end of today, we will argue first thing tomorrow morning on the issue of qualification. Then, depending on the ruling, we will either go forward with all the supplemental matters or the case will be over.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">After the recess, attention returned to Bruce Tiller, who was still on the witness stand. Now, however, the trial had transmogrified into a hearing on Nadler\u2019s motion to dismiss. In addition to his former testimony \u2014 ostensibly on the merits, but, particularly on cross-examination, reaching deeply into the question of \u201cdoing business\u201d in Maryland \u2014 Mr. Tiller testified that the supervisors on the construction jobs lived in a motel and their rooms were paid by Tiller as a business expense. Painters and clean-up men were brought in from New York and stayed in Maryland until the jobs were completed. Tiller did the \u201coversight. [It] saw how things got done.\u201d Liability insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance were obtained, covering each project in the name of Glenmar as the insured. There was a sign at each project advertising Tiller as the contractor. A local construction permit was obtained. Subcontractors supplied all their own equipment from Maryland. Four or five months were spent on the projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">As for Tiller\u2019s other business activities during the time it was engaged in construction work for Nadler, Mr. Tiller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>testified that the company was building a small hostel for the State of New York at a cost of $400,000 or $500,000 and a $300,000 project for AMC Theaters in Michigan. He added that Tiller might have been involved in a hospital project at that time, but he was not sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">C</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">When court reconvened the next day, the judge announced: We are here this morning to consider the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss based on failure of the plaintiff corporation to qualify under the laws of Maryland. I am prepared to hear argument on that now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Nadler reiterated his contention that Tiller was required to qualify as a foreign corporation to do business in Maryland. Tiller had \u201cpervasive activity in the State of Maryland,\u201d he argued. He said that he was relying on <em>Snavely, Inc. v. Wheeler, </em>74 Md.App. 428, 538 A.2d 324 (1988) to support his Motion to Dismiss. Tiller countered that it was not engaged in so much business in Maryland as to bring it within the requirements of the foreign corporations statute. <em>Suavely, </em>it added, involved far more pervasive intrastate business than was represented by the Westridge and Cranberry construction projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">In <em>Snavely, Inc. v. Wheeler, </em>the Court of Special Appeals was called upon to determine under what circumstances an unqualified foreign corporation was doing business in Maryland in the contemplation of \u00a7 7-203 (qualification of a foreign corporation to do intrastate business), in the light of \u00a7 7-103 (activities not considered intrastate business), so that \u00a7 7-301 (failure to qualify \u2014 maintenance of suit) would preclude access to the Maryland courts. Robert M. Bell, then a judge of the Court of Special Appeals and now a judge of this Court, writing for a panel of the intermediate appellate court, made a thorough analysis of the principles that have been applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>determine when a foreign corporation is doing intrastate business in Maryland. Judge Bell concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">The appellate decisions of this State make clear that \u201ca foreign corporation is doing business within a state when it transacts some substantial part of its ordinary business therein.\u201d <em>S.A.S.

We summed up in <em>S.A.S.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak7\">A determination whether a particular act or set of acts constitutes \u201cdoing business\u201d depends upon the facts of each individual case, and rests not on a single factor, but rather on the nature and extent of the business and activities which occur in the forum state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">286 Md. at 339, 407 A.2d 1139. <em>Snavely, </em>74 Md.App. at 435, 538 A.2d 324, recognized, as we noted in <em>S.A.S., </em>286 Md. at 339, 407 A.2d 1139, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">[t]he party asserting that an unregistered or unqualified foreign corporation is \u201cdoing business within the state\u201d carries the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-11\"><em>Snavely </em>accurately reflects what its ancestors in this Court and in the Court of Special Appeals have expressed and applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The trial judge pronounced an opinion from the bench. He referred to \u00a7 7-203 (\u201cQualification to do intrastate business\u201d) and \u00a7 7-301 (\u201cFailure to register or qualify \u2014 Maintenance of suit\u201d). He said of \u00a7 7-301:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">This is, to be sure, a real provision. ... [Fjoreign corporations who have failed to comply, regardless of the validity of their claim on the merits, have been denied access to our courts, period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">It is not a matter of the court having special solicitude for people who are owed money. It is a question of whether our courts are, by legislative provision, open to parties to use our courts in the event they don\u2019t comply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">The judge recognized that the burden of proving that an unqualified foreign corporation is doing business in this State is upon the party presenting that defense, citing to <em>S.A.S. </em>He observed that Maryland\u2019s foreign corporation law</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amx\">is not unique to the State of Maryland. It is done all over the United States. Frankly, [Maryland\u2019s provisions] I think [are] based on the Model Business Corporation Act, ... so there is nothing really unique about Maryland\u2019s statutes, either.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">The judge noted, \u201cIt is stipulated that, in fact, ... Tiller Construction Corporation was never qualified to do business in the State of Maryland.\u201d And so, he concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">the question becomes, were they, in fact, doing business intrastate within the meaning of the Corporations and Associations Article?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">He looked to <em>Snavely, </em>74 Md.App. 428, 538 A.2d 324, quoting its conclusion at 434, 538 A.2d 324, which in turn quoted <em>S.A.S., </em>286 Md. at 339, 407 A.2d 1139, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">\u201c[t]he appellate decisions of this State make clear that \u2018a foreign corporation is doing business within a state when it transacts some substantial part of its ordinary business therein.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>He compared the statutes to those with respect to home improvement companies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\">It is, I would note, fairly common in this State for builders who are within the State, who fail to get home improvement licenses, to be denied the right to recover on their contracts because our statutes say very clearly if you are not licensed, you can\u2019t use our Courts. Not that you are not morally entitled to be paid, but simply, our Courts are closed to you. So, I must view this with this in mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The trial judge looked at the facts in the light of the factors designated in <em>Suavely, </em>which may be considered in determining whether Tiller was doing business in Maryland, as he found those facts to be from the evidence before him. As to taxes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">To the extent that there were contracts made with local suppliers, that sales taxes were paid in this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">[A]ll inventory was, in fact, local. According to Mr. Tiller, it was all bought locally and paid for locally, and the tax paid locally as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">As to an office and telephones:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">While there was no office maintained here, there was a motel room leased for a considerable period of time. There was presence of the corporation for up to five months. There was, while no, as I said, formal office, there was a sign on the job site and telephones listed in information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">As to management functions and bank accounts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">There was no substantial advertising in the State, although there was, in fact, a bank account that was maintained in the State. There were, in fact, fairly pervasive management functions in terms of these two projects. That, in fact, was what the general contractor was engaged to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">As to the amount of Tiller\u2019s business which was conducted in Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The fact of the matter is that for the five-month period or so that Tiller Construction was on the job in Maryland, the value of the projects in question was far better than 50 percent of its income during that period of time based on the testimony given yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">Mr. Tiller indicated that these two projects alone were in excess of $1 million. He mentioned a project in Detroit and another in New York State. Whatever it was, it was a substantial part, whatever the exact percentage, of the revenues of the corporation in that time frame.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The judge rejected Tiller\u2019s notion that \u201cthere must be a continuing course of conduct, and that coming in and even doing all these things is not sufficient to cause the corporation to be found to be doing business for purposes of having to qualify.\u201d The judge declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">What we have here, essentially, is a builder coming in from a foreign jurisdiction to basically construct two projects of some substance over a five-month period, all aspects of the project. They contract for services, as defense counsel points out, to buy supplies here, to manage, to basically set up shop here, whether or not you have got a desk and chair or office, but basically to do all the operations in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">At this point the judge was on solid ground. He had approached the question whether Tiller was doing business in Maryland by assessing its activities pursuant to the factors noted in our appellate opinions and concluded that Tiller had indeed transacted some substantial part of its ordinary business in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Then, however, the trial judge looked to 36 Am.Jur.2d Foreign Corporations \u00a7 351, which he said concerned \u201cconstruction work relative to doing business.\u201d He quoted 36 Am.Jur.2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">\u201cAlthough there is some support for a contrary view, according to a number of cases a foreign corporation which engages in doing construction work, although it engages in performing but a single construction contract, engages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>business within the state, and therefore becomes subject to state laws regulating the doing of business therein by foreign corporations. The performance of such work is not deemed to fall within the rule that a single or isolated transaction will not amount to doing business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">He found 17A <em>Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations to he of the </em>same effect, providing at \u00a7 8469:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, engaging in construction work within a state is not deemed to fall within the single or isolated transaction rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The judge discovered what he deemed to be overwhelming authority on the issue in 90 A.L.R.3d 937 under the heading, \u201cConstruction Work by Foreign Corporation as Doing Business for Purposes of Statute Requiring Foreign Corporation to Qualify as Condition of Access to Local Courts.\u201d It provided, the judge explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">the really dispositive article on this [question], and it is absolutely, 100 percent on point----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">\u201cThat is our case,\u201d the judge declaimed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\">That is exactly the case we have, and there are, collected in this note, numerous cases from numerous jurisdictions where vastly the majority rule is, you have got to qualify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">He perused the cases listed \u201ctrying to determine what kind of work had been done in different cases and the duration of the projects.\u201d He mentioned, without specific citation, cases involving contracts for construction from Indiana, Montana, Pennsylvania and Texas. All of the durations of work were \u201cessentially the same or less than the time spent here, and the finding was that\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-12\">the foreign corporation had failed to register and was, therefore, denied access to the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">The <em>Fletcher </em>general rule, however, is contrary to the law of Maryland. Our closed-door statute and <em>Suavely </em>and its ancestors reject as a universal proposition that performing a single act of construction constitutes \u201cdoing business.\u201d <em>S.A.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>stated at 286 Md. at 339, 407 A.2d 1139, as we have seen, that \u201cdoing business\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">depends upon the facts of each individual case, and <em>rests not on a single factor, </em>but rather on the nature and extent of the business and activities which occur in the forum state,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac\">(emphasis added). <em>Yangming </em>noted that this Court \u201chas not given \u00a7 7-301 an entirely literal construction.\u201d 311 Md. at 502, 536 A.2d 633. \u201cSpecifically,\u201d <em>Yangming </em>asserted, we have</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">not construed \u00a7 7-301 as listing three, disjunctive factors, any one of which, if present, could bar an unregistered or unqualified corporation from suing in Maryland courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-6\"><em>Id. Yangming </em>emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">Instead, we have held that \u00a7 7-301 embodies a test for determining whether a foreign corporation is \u201cdoing business\u201d in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\"><em>Id. Yangming </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">Under this test, \u00a7 7-301 bars an unqualified or unregistered foreign corporation from suing in Maryland courts only if the corporation is doing such a substantial amount of localized business in this State that the corporation could be deemed \u201cpresent\u201d here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\"><em>Id. </em>Of course, the type of activity in which the corporation engages may be considered with other factors in determining whether the corporation is \u201cpresent\u201d here and doing intrastate business. But the type of activity, including construction of a building, may not, standing alone, suffice to establish that the corporation is doing intrastate business in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">Tiller appealed. Before decision by the Court of Special Appeals, we ordered the issuance of a writ of certiorari on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">This appeal boils down to whether the evidence showed that Tiller was present in Maryland and \u201cdoing intrastate business\u201d here. The trial judge reached the correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>conclusion, but in part for the wrong reason. Our task, however, is to review the propriety of the judgment, not of the opinion rendered in arriving at the judgment. <em>See Andrews v. Andrews, </em>242 Md. 143, 153-154, 218 A.2d 194 (1966); <em>Velasco v. P.E. Church in Maryland, </em>200 Md. 634, 640, 92 A.2d 373 (1952); <em>Alleghany Corp. v. Aldebaran Corp., </em>173 Md. 472, 478-479, 196 A. 418 (1938); <em>Methodist Church v. Browne, </em>39 Md. 160, 163 (1873). The trial judge\u2019s grant of the Motion to Dismiss was not erroneous. We shall not disturb it.
