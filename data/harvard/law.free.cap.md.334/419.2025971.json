When Maryland State Police Trooper McQueeney arrived at the scene of the accident one-half hour later, he observed that Rettig had \u201cbloodshot, glassy eyes and a strong odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath.\u201d Trooper McQueeney accompanied Rettig to the hospital, where he issued a field sobriety test and then arrested him. At that point, Rettig volunteered that he was \u201ctoasted\u201d but maintained that he had the right to operate his all-terrain vehicle while intoxicated on his own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">On April 24,1992, Rettig was convicted in the District Court of Maryland of driving while intoxicated in violation of \u00a7 21-902(a) of the Transportation Article. He appealed to the Circuit Court for Worcester County, pleading not guilty and waiving his right to a jury trial. At the trial de novo in the circuit court, Rettig defended on the ground that, although he had been intoxicated at the time of the accident, he could not be convicted under \u00a7 21-902(a) since that provision reached only driving conducted on public property and on private property used by the public generally, but did not reach purely private property such as Rettig\u2019s backyard. The circuit court rejected Rettig\u2019s defense, finding that, although the driving occurred on Rettig\u2019s own property, Maryland\u2019s drunk driving provision \u201capplie[d] throughout the State, ... whether on private or public property.\u201d The circuit court convicted Rettig of driving while intoxicated, fined him- $200, and as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>sessed $126 in court costs. Rettig filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting a single question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">\u201cIs it a violation of [Transportation Article] 21-902 to drive a vehicle while intoxicated on private property which is not used by the public?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We granted the petition and shall answer the question in the affirmative. 328 Md. 741, 616 A.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Maryland\u2019s prohibition on driving while intoxicated, \u00a7 21-902(a) of the Transportation Article, is contained within Title 21, entitled \u201cVehicle Laws \u2014 Rules of the Road.\u201d Section 21-101.1 defines the general scope of Title 21 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">\u201c(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 The provisions of this title relating to the driving of vehicles refer only to the driving of vehicles on highways, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">(1) As provided in subsection (b) of this section; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">(2) Where a different or additional place specifically is provided for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">(b) <em>Applicability to private property. </em>\u2014 (1) A person may not drive a motor vehicle in violation of any provision of this title on any private property that is used by the public in general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-12\">(2) A person may not drive a motor vehicle in violation of any provision of this title on any property that is owned by or under the control of this State or any of its political subdivisions, county boards of education, or community colleges and that is open to vehicular traffic and used by the public in general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_D\">(3) Any person who violates any provision of this subsection is in violation of the law to the same extent and is subject to the same penalty as if the motor vehicle were driven on a highway.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">In addition, subtitle 9 of Title 21, which includes \u00a7 21-902, has a separate scope provision which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-16\">\u201c\u00a7 21-901 Scope of subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-17\">\u201cThe provisions of this subtitle apply throughout this State, whether on or off a highway.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The petitioner Rettig primarily argues that, by construing \u00a7 21-901 in light of \u00a7 21-101.1, the \u00a7 21-902(a) prohibition on intoxicated driving extends only to highways and to private or public property open to the public generally, but not to other private property. Rettig relies on the fact that the only areas specifically set forth in \u00a7 21-101.1 are highways and property used by the public in general. He states that the general language of \u00a7 21-901, <em>ie., </em>\u201cthroughout this State, whether on or off a highway,\u201d should be read to mean highways and property used by the public in general.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The petitioner\u2019s argument, however, ignores the broad expansion which the Legislature included in \u00a7 21-101.1(a)(2). Thus, while \u00a7 21-101.1 itself expressly covers highways and property used by the public in general, subpart (a)(2) of that section also states that \u201ca different or additional place\u201d may be provided for elsewhere in the Title. Consistent with \u00a7 21-101.1(a)(2), such an additional place was provided for in \u00a7 21-901. There, the Legislature declared that the provisions of subtitle 9 \u201capply throughout this State, whether on or off a highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">When interpreting a statute, we assume that the words used have their ordinary and natural meaning. <em>Atkinson v. State, </em>331 Md. 199, 215, 627 A.2d 1019, 1027 (1993); <em>Richmond v. State, </em>326 Md. 257, 262, 604 A.2d 483, 485-86 (1992); <em>Privette v. State, </em>320 Md. 738, 744-745, 580 A.2d 188, 191 (1990). The ordinary meaning of the word \u201cthroughout\u201d is \u201cin or to every part.\u201d <em>Websters\u2019 Third New International Dictionary </em>2385 (1981). We believe that, by the broad language of \u00a7 21-901, the General Assembly intended \u00a7 21-902 to apply to land anywhere within the State of Maryland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>whether on a public highway, on other public land open to vehicular traffic and used by the public in general, in a parking lot, on a private road or driveway, or indeed on any land surface including a backyard. <em>See Locklear v. State, </em>94 Md.App. 39, 46 n. 2, 614 A.2d 1338, 1341 n. 2 (1992) (\u201c\u00a7 21-901 means precisely what it says,\u201d and thus one driving while intoxicated on a \u201cdirt mound\u201d on private property is guilty under \u00a7 21-902).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We decline to read a \u201cused by the public\u201d limitation into \u00a7 21-901 when nothing in the broadly-worded language of \u00a7\u00a7 21-101.1(a)(2) or 21-901 suggests that the Legislature intended to make the application of \u00a7 21-902 depend upon the nature of the land involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The history of \u00a7\u00a7 21-101.1 and 21-901 further supports the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to limit the application of \u00a7 21-902 solely to highways and property used by the public in general. Prior to 1977, this State\u2019s vehicle laws were contained in Code (1957, 1970 Repl.Vol., 1975 Cum.Supp.), Art. 66]6. The \u201crules of the road\u201d were located in subtitle 11, which began with the consolidated scope provision that would eventually become \u00a7\u00a7 21-101.1 and 21-901. This scope provision, \u00a7 11-101, read as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">\u201c\u00a7 11-101. Provisions of subtitle refer to vehicles upon the highways; exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">The provisions of this subtitle relating to the operation of vehicles refer exclusively to the operation of vehicles upon highways except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">(1) Where a different place is specifically referred to in a given section; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>(2) <em>The provisions of Part IX of this subtitle and Subtitle 10 shall apply upon highways and elsewhere throughout the State.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">(3) Except in Garrett and Somerset counties, any person operating a motor vehicle on private property which is used by the public in general in violation of the provisions of this subtitle shall be deemed in violation of the law to the same extent as if the motor vehicle were being operated on a public highway and the violation carries the same penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">(4) Any person operating a motor vehicle on property owned, under control of the State or its political subdivisions, the county boards of education, or the community colleges, open to vehicular traffic and used by the public in general, in violation of the provisions of this subtitle shall be deemed in violation of the law to the same extent as if the motor vehicle were being operated on a public highway, and the violation carries the same penalty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Part IX, referred to in \u00a7 11-101 as applying \u201cupon highways and elsewhere throughout the State,\u201d included the prohibition on intoxicated driving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">\u201c\u00a7 11-902. Driving while intoxicated....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to drive or attempt to drive or to be in actual physical control of any vehicle within this State while he is in an intoxicated condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">The language of former \u00a7 11-101 reveals the clear legislative intent to prohibit the intoxicated driving of a vehicle regardless of the nature of the land on which it takes place. The phrase \u201celsewhere throughout the State\u201d could hardly mean anything less. <em>See </em>59 Op.Atty.Gen. 659, 665 (1974). Moreover, language identical to former \u00a7 11-101 in the vehicle codes of other jurisdictions has been held to encompass any land area. See <em>Dayhoff v. State, </em>42 Colo.App. 91, 93, 595 P.2d 1051, 1053 (1979), <em>aff'd, </em>199 Colo. 363, 609 P.2d 119 (1980) (private parking lot); <em>State v. Hollobaugh, </em>297 A.2d 395 (Del.Super.Ct.1972) (grocery store parking lot); <em>People v. Guynn, </em>33 Ill.App.3d 736, 338 N.E.2d 239 (1975) (private property not used by the public generally); <em>State v. Carroll, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>225 Minn. 384, 31 N.W.2d 44 (1948) (private roadway at a summer resort);. <em>State v. Budden, </em>226 Kan. 150, 595 P.2d 1138 (1979) (parking lot of a tavern); <em>State v. Novak, </em>338 N.W.2d 637 (N.D.1983) (private field); Annotation, <em>Applicability, to Operation of Motor Vehicle on Private Property, of Legislation Making Drunken Driving A Criminal Offense, </em>29 A.L.R.3d 938, 949-951 (1970, 1993 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In 1977, the Legislature recodified Maryland\u2019s vehicle laws by repealing Art. 66)6 in its entirety and enacting Code (1977), \u00a7\u00a7 11-101 through 27-105 of the Transportation Article in its place. <em>See </em>Ch. 14 of the Acts of 1977. Former \u00a7 11-101 was broken down into separate provisions as part of the 1977 recodification. The bulk of former \u00a7 11-101 became new \u00a7 21-101.1, which governs the scope of Title 21 generally. <em>See </em>Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 21-101.1, Ch. 14 of the Acts of 1977, at 991 (\u201cThis section presently appears as Art. 66]\u00e9, \u00a7 11-101\u201d). Former subsection 11-101(2) was deleted from \u00a7 21-101.1\u2019s general scope provision, was added with changes in wording but without substantive change as \u00a7 21-901 of the Transportation Article, and was placed directly within the new subtitle 9. <em>See </em>Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 21-101.1, Ch. 14 of the Acts of 1977, at 991 (\u201cPresent \u00a7 11-101(2), which relates to exceptions for ... Subtitle 9 of this title, [is] deleted as unnecessary in light of ... [\u00a7] 21-901 to the same effect\u201d); Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 21-901, Ch. 14 of the Acts of 1977, at 1045 (\u201cThis section, which is an exception to the general rule established in \u00a7 21-101.1 of this title, is new language derived without substantive change from Art. 66/6, \u00a7 11-101(2)\u201d). As the Revisor\u2019s Notes make clear, new \u00a7 21-901 was intended to carry the same force as former \u00a7 11-101(2). <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Seidel, </em>326 Md. 237, 252-253, 604 A.2d 473, 481 (1992) (Re-visor\u2019s Note, stating that the revision constituted \u201cnew language derived without substantive change,\u201d showed that the new sections did not alter the original legislative intent); <em>Rentals Unlimited v. Administrator, </em>286 Md. 104, 109-110, 405 A.2d 744, 748 (1979); <em>Collier v. Connolley, </em>285 Md. 123, 130-131, 400 A.2d 1107, 1110-1111 (1979). <em>See also Office &amp; Prof. Employees Int\u2019l v. MTA, </em>295 Md. 88, 100, 453 A.2d 1191, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>1197 (1982) (\u201cA change in the phraseology of a statute as part of a recodification will ordinarily not be deemed to modify the law unless the change is such that the intention of the Legislature to modify the law is unmistakable\u201d); <em>Bureau of Mines v. George\u2019s Creek, </em>272 Md. 143, 155, 321 A.2d 748, 754-755 (1974). Like its predecessor provision, \u00a7 21-901 continues to mean that intoxicated driving of a vehicle under \u00a7 21-902(a) is an offense regardless of the nature of the land on which it is committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">This interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 21-101.1 and 21-901 is certainly not unreasonable or illogical. We have recognized previously that Maryland\u2019s drunk driving provisions generally were enacted for the protection of the public. <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shrader, </em>324 Md. 454, 464, 597 A.2d 939, 943-944 (1991); <em>State v. Werkheiser, </em>299 Md. 529, 537, 474 A.2d 898, 902 (1984); <em>State v. Moon, </em>291 Md. 463, 477, 436 A.2d 420, 427 (1981). The menace posed by an impaired driver on purely private property is sometimes no different from that posed by one who ventures onto property open to the public generally. <em>See State v. Magner, </em>151 NJ.Super. 451, 454, 376 A.2d 1333, 1334 (1977) (\u201cOperation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor holds no less threat of extraordinary danger of injury to the driver and others or damage to property because that particular folly is performed in a private place\u201d). <em>See also People v. Guynn, supra, </em>33 Ill.App.3d at 739, 338 N.E.2d at 241; <em>State v. Novak, supra, </em>338 N.W.2d at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Furthermore, there is never a guarantee that a vehicle driven by someone in an impaired condition will remain off the roadways for long. <em>See State v. Carroll, supra, </em>225 Minn. at 386-387, 31 N.W.2d at 46 (\u201cno one can say when [an intoxicated person], while in a confused or befuddled state of mind as a result of his or her condition, will leave the private road and pursue a mad, zigzagging course down a public highway or street, with the resulting damage and horrors so frequently reported\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Both courts below correctly held that petitioner\u2019s driving a vehicle in his backyard while intoxicated constituted a violation of \u00a7 21-902(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WORCESTER COUNTY AFFIRMED.

At oral argument, the petitioner presented an even narrower interpretation of \u00a7 21-101.1 than he did in his brief, arguing that by (a)(1) and (2), the Legislature intended to establish two necessary conditions for the private property exception to apply. Under this reading, the private property in question would have to be both of the type described in subsection (b) and then be separately specified in each provision. The language of \u00a7 21-101.1 clearly cannot support this unwieldy interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\">. At other places in Title 21, the General Assembly has specified narrower categories of property than those generally described in \u00a7 21-101.1. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 21-903 (\u201cA person may not consume an alcoholic beverage while driving a motor vehicle on a highway\"); \u00a7 21-1201 (\"With the exceptions stated in [subtitle 12],\u201d the provisions of the subtitle relating to the operation of bicycles apply \"whenever a bicycle is operated on any highway or on any path set aside for the exclusive use of bicycles\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
