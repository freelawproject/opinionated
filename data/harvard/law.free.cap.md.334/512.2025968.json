The marriage was tumultuous from the very beginning; periods of cohabitation alternated with periods of separation. Even during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>periods of cohabitation, the couple would <em>go </em>for months at a time without sexual relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Sometime in the spring of 1989, Debbie had a three week affair with Gus Economides (Gus).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Debbie gave birth to a son, Brock Daniel Owen Sider (Brock), on January 7, 1990. Debbie maintains that she and Bruce had their doubts regarding the paternity of the child; Bruce, however, claims that both he and Debbie believed that he was the father of Brock. Gus was unaware of Debbie\u2019s pregnancy and of Brock\u2019s subsequent birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In September, 1991, Debbie left the marital home for the last time. On October 2, 1991, Bruce filed a Complaint for Final Divorce or Limited Divorce in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his complaint, Bruce cited Debbie\u2019s then-ongoing adulterous affair with George Brooks (George) as the grounds for divorce.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition to a prayer for divorce, Bruce also requested in his complaint, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) that he be awarded permanent custody of Brock, (2) that he be awarded liberal visitation rights with Sean, (3) that he be awarded child support, (4) that he be granted use and possession of the family home, and (5) that the court make a monetary award to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">On October 16, 1991, Bruce filed a Motion for Emergency Hearing. The grounds for the motion were that on October 12 Debbie \u201cabandoned and deserted the family home and took with her [Brock].\u201d Bruce further alleged in this motion that Debbie \u201cwould not reveal where she was going [ ], nor where she would be residing, nor where [Brock] would be.\u201d In a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>somewhat contradictory statement, he also asserted that he \u201chas reason to believe that [Debbie] and [Brock] are presently residing with George Brooks.\u201d Bruce, therefore, requested that the court expeditiously grant an emergency hearing to resolve the custody issues relating to Brock. On October 18, 1991, the court granted Bruce\u2019s motion and set the emergency hearing for November 1, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Sometime during this legal maneuvering, George approached Gus and informed him that Debbie suspected that Gus, and not Bruce, was Brock\u2019s father. Gus agreed to take a blood test; the results, dated October 25, 1991, indicated a 99.91% probability that Gus was in fact the father of Brock.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On October 31, 1991, Debbie and Gus jointly filed in the Circuit Court for Howard County a Petition to Establish Paternity. The court ordered Bruce to show cause, on or before November 30, 1991, why Gus should not be declared to be Brock\u2019s biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In the interim, on October 31, 1991, Debbie filed in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, a motion to stay the divorce and custody proceedings pending the outcome of the paternity case in Howard County. Instead, on November 21, 1991, the court (Cawood, J.), in conjunction with the Circuit Court for Howard County (Sybert, J.), stayed the paternity case in that jurisdiction pending the resolution of the divorce and custody case in Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">At the November 1, 1991 emergency custody hearing, the court, pursuant to a stipulation by the parties, resolved the temporary custody issues. The Pendente Lite Order provided for Debbie to have custody of Brock during the week and for Bruce to have custody on weekends, with the exception of Thanksgiving and. Christmas vacations when Brock would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>with Bruce.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">On January 20, 1992, Bruce filed a Petition for Contempt and Other Relief. Bruce alleged that Debbie, in violation of the Pendente Lite Order, denied his judicially scheduled visitation of Brock on several occasions. The resolution of this contempt petition is not disclosed in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">On February 12, 1992, Debbie filed, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, a motion to consolidate the Howard County paternity case and the Anne Arundel County divorce and custody case. The court granted this motion on May 22, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Earlier, on February 12, 1992, Debbie sought a court order requiring Bruce to submit to a blood test. She averred in her motion that Gus was Brock\u2019s biological father. Bruce answered this motion and denied that Gus was the biological father. The court denied Debbie\u2019s motion without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">On March 13, 1992, the court issued another order, which reiterated that Debbie have custody of Brock during the week and that Bruce have custody of Brock on the weekends. On June 8, 1992, Bruce again filed a Petition for Contempt and Other Relief alleging that Debbie was refusing to permit him to see Brock in violation of the court\u2019s March 13 Order. After a July 17, 1992 contempt hearing, the court (Lerner, J.) found Debbie in contempt and sentenced her to ninety days in the Anne Arundel County Detention Center, but suspended the sentence contingent on Debbie obeying all court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Debbie filed a second Motion for Blood Test on August 10, 1992. In his answer, Bruce maintained that, in denying Debbie\u2019s previous motion for blood test, \u201cJudge James C. Cawood has already ruled a blood test unnecessary as paternity is not in dispute.\u201d Debbie eventually withdrew this motion at the beginning of the trial after the court ruled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201cthere was no question from a biological point of view, based on [Gus\u2019s blood] test and I think it was conceded that was [the] reason not to [have Bruce] take [a blood] test, that [Gus] was, in fact, the biological father.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">After the consolidated trial in August, 1992, Judge Cawood, in an opinion dated September 11, 1992, with respect to the paternity case, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">\u201cThere is little dispute that, at a time when she was having sexual relations with her husband and with Gus Economides, Defendant Debbie Sider became pregnant. She was not sure who the father was. However, she treated the child as that of her husband, Bruce Sider. He had no idea that anyone else was the father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">\u201cWhen the always stormy relationship between the two began to disintegrate, she became involved with George Brooks, with who[m] she now lives and expects to marry. Together they decided to check out the paternity. Mr. Brooks went to Economides who, as surprised as any one that his three week affair with Mrs. Sider had possibly produced a child, agreed to a blood test which determined that he was in fact the natural father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">\u201cBy the time the results of the test were achieved, The Siders had already separated, and armed with this information, Mrs. Sider attacked. On the eve of an emergency hearing, she revealed the blood test to Mr. Sider by way of a Motion to Stay. He refused to abandon his rights to the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\"><em>\u201cMr. Sider claims he should be considered the natural parent of the child by estoppel.... We agree with him.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The court further reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-11\">\u201cIt does not take long to get attached to a child, particularly when the child is, or certainly appears to be, one\u2019s own. From the evidence in this case, Mr. Sider was deeply concerned with the upbringing of' Brock. We need no professional to tell us the trauma of being told, after 21 months of a child\u2019s life, that you are not really the parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\u201cMrs. Sider chose a course of action. She had her doubts about the paternity, but she did not disclose them because she knew the devastating effect it would have on the relationship between her and Mr. Sider. Having done this, she cannot wait for the appropriate moment to take advantage of this in a divorce proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">With respect to Gus, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">\u201cThe question remains whether Mr. Economides is es-topped. He obviously never knew about the paternity until the revelations by Mr. Brooks. Since that time he has seen the child and given [Debbie] money, but has not told the child he is the father. He seems to be doing the best he can with a difficult situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\"><em>\u201cNonetheless, we believe his rights are not paramount to Mr. Sider. </em>If he had resisted the blood test, we cannot believe a Court would have ordered it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">\u201cWe therefore hold that, <em>at law, Mr. Sider should be considered as the biological father of Brock.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">With regard to the divorce and custody case, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI8\">\u201cwe find [Debbie\u2019s] actions toward [Bruce] to be spiteful\u2014 not merely the aforementioned paternity problem, but her wilful refusal to grant him the child for weekends on end, and her turning his stepson, Sean, against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">\u201cWe find extreme the hostility both Mrs. Sider and Mr. Brooks have against Mr. Sider.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-12\">\u201cIn order to improve our understanding of the complex currents behind this case, we ordered the parties to see a psychologist appointed by the Court, Stanley Zweback. Dr. Zweback, seeing only Mr. Sider, found him to be psychologically a proper parent. Mrs. Sider refused to go because it was \u2018too expensive and difficult.\u2019 We find it hard to believe that someone who was to obligate herself for six days of counsel fees for trial found the psychologist too expensive. In any event, she asked the Court for no relief but just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>disobeyed the Order, as Judge Lerner subsequently found she flagrantly violated the custody order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201cWe have no doubt that Mrs. Sider loves her child, as does Mr. Sider. She has a great advantage in that she is home all day because of injuries which required her to become permanently disabled with the Police Department. It was for that reason that we suggested originally that she have the child during the week, even though we were displeased with her actions about the paternity. However, she has shown that situation will not work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Therefore, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">\u201cIn a strict consideration of the best interests of the child, we believe Mr. Sider is the better parent. Assuming we were wrong about the estoppel theory, the question is a much closer one. Is she unfit, or are there exceptional circumstances? (citation omitted). If \u2018unfit\u2019 means will she hurt the child, the answer is no. There is no credible evidence that either has intentionally hurt this child or failed to provide for him. However, we consider all of the factors we have indicated above to be exceptional circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">\u201cWe therefore will give primary custody to Mr. Sider.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">The court ordered that Bruce be \u201crecognized as the natural father of Brock\u201d and denied the Petition for Paternity filed by Debbie and Gus. It granted custody of Brock to Bruce while reserving reasonable visitation rights to Debbie and granted Bruce the use of the family home and automobile for 18 months. The court also denied Gus\u2019s prayer for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Debbie and Gus appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court first addressed the custody issues. It held that in a custody contest between a third party and a parent, custody in the parent is presumed to be in the best interests of a child and it is only after a showing that the parent is unfit, or upon a finding of exceptional circumstances, that a third party will be awarded custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The court reviewed our previous cases which examined custody disputes between parents and third parties and delineated approximately 12 factors which a court should assess in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist. It concluded, however, that only four factors were relevant in the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">(1) The nature and strength of the ties between the child and the third party \u201ccustodian\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">(2) The intensity and genuineness of the parent\u2019s desire to have the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">(3) The stability and certainty of the child\u2019s future in the custody of the parent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">(4) The character and reputation of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">After reviewing each of these factors under the facts and circumstances of this case, the court agreed with the circuit court and held that \u201cexceptional circumstances existed in this case to rebut the presumption that the minor child\u2019s best interest lay with being in the custody of his mother.\u201d It therefore affirmed the circuit court\u2019s award of custody to Bruce.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The Court of Special Appeals next addressed the paternity case and the following issue raised jointly by Debbie and Gus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">When all of the parties stipulate that the putative father is the biological father of the child and the stipulation is supported by a blood test, does the trial court have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>authority to deny the paternity petition and rule that the husband is the natural father of the minor child?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">It first stated that \u201c[t]he short answer to this issue is yes, providing the court determined that it is in the best interest of the child\u201d to deny the paternity petition. The court then concluded, however, that the circuit court failed to discuss what would be in Brock\u2019s best interest. Consequently, it held that, with respect to the paternity petition, the case must be remanded to determine the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">\u201cWhether Gus (a male individual who claims to be the father of a child born to a married couple) is entitled to petition the circuit court to determine whether said male individual is the biological father of the child when the child was conceived during the marriage of said married couple?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The intermediate appellate court thus reversed the circuit court\u2019s judgment with respect to the paternity action, and remanded the case to determine whether it was in the \u201cbest interest of Brock\u201d to grant the paternity petition. The court set forth the following criteria for determining Brock\u2019s best interests, but expressly stated other factors could also apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">\u201c(1) the stability of the child\u2019s current home environment (in light of the aforementioned resolution of the various custody issues discussed above); (2) whether there is an ongoing family unit; (3) the child\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional needs; (4) Brock\u2019s past relationship with Gus; and (5) Brock\u2019s ability to ascertain genetic information for the purpose of medical treatment and genealogical history.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">The Court of Special Appeals also noted that if, on remand, the circuit court concludes that it is in the best interests of Brock to grant the paternity petition, the court should then \u201cacknowledge the parties\u2019 stipulation that Gus is the natural father of Brock.\u201d Finally, the intermediate appellate court explained that if Gus is entitled to petition the court and is acknowledged to be Brock\u2019s biological father, the court must consider the issue of Gus\u2019s visitation rights. We granted certiorari to consider the significant issues raised in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\n<em>The Paternity Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Before us, Debbie and Gus assert that a circuit court has no authority to deny a paternity petition when: (1) the mother and biological father of an infant under the age of two jointly request a determination of paternity, (2) the paternity is supported by a blood test and the husband consents to the biological paternity, and (3) there is no marital integrity to protect because of the pending divorce action between the mother and husband. They also maintain that the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard, suggested by the Court of Special Appeals as the proper standard on remand, is inappropriate because fundamental interests, parental privacy and paternity, are involved. Moreover, they argue, even if the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard is utilized, the uncontroverted facts in this case preclude a court from ruling that Bruce is the \u201cnatural\u201d father.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Debbie and Gus next contend that a biological father should not be estopped from establishing his paternity when he filed a petition to do so only six days after learning that he may be the father. They maintain that the denial of the paternity petition violated Gus\u2019s rights under both the federal and state constitutions. Specifically, they assert that the disparate treatment of men in general, and of Gus in the instant case, in the context of paternity litigation violates Maryland\u2019s Equal Rights Amendment, Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Furthermore, it is argued that under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Gus has a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of his child. Finally, they aver that the right to conceive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>and to raise one\u2019s child is an essential right, which has been ignored in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\n<em>The Custody Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Debbie and Gus argue that the presumption that a minor child should be in the custody of the child\u2019s biological parents' was not overcome in this case. They observe that only after a showing that the parents are unfit, or where exceptional circumstances render parental custody detrimental to the child, may a court grant custody to a non-parent. They maintain that the court erroneously found exceptional circumstances in this case. In particular, they claim that no testimony was presented that showed Brock had bonded to Bruce and thus there was no evidence that Brock would suffer any detriment if custody was awarded to Debbie. They also argue that Gus, even though he is the acknowledged biological father, has been treated as a \u201cnon-person\u201d throughout this litigation, thus violating his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In addition, Debbie and Gus contend that both the trial court and intermediate appellate court based their respective custody determinations solely on the fact that Debbie was hostile to Bruce and contemptuous of the legal system. Consequently, they argue that the custody award was in actuality a punitive award against her for her actions, which is not a proper sanction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Finally, they maintain that by holding that Bruce \u201cshould be considered as the biological father of Brock,\u201d and thus recognized as Brock\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d father, the trial court in effect granted a judicial adoption, an act prohibited in this State. For these reasons, Debbie and Gus request that custody of Brock be awarded to Debbie.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Bruce maintains that public policy precludes Debbie from attempting to establish that he is not the biological parent in order to further her self-interest in obtaining exclusive custody of Brock. Therefore, he contends that Debbie is estopped from asserting that Bruce is not Brock\u2019s biological father because she treated him, and represented him to the world, as the child\u2019s father for almost two years. Bruce further argues that Gus should be estopped from asserting any claim to Brock\u2019s custody and paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Bruce suggests that under the doctrine of unclean hands, Gus and Debbie\u2019s adultery should preclude Debbie from custody of Brock and preclude Gus from establishing his paternity. Therefore, Bruce contends that equity should be applied to prevent Gus, even though he may be the biological parent, from reducing or eliminating the rights of Bruce.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">According to Bruce, the circuit court properly used the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard in resolving the custody issue. He maintains that the circuit and intermediate appellate courts both correctly and unambiguously concluded that exceptional circumstances existed in this case and thus the presumption that children should remain in the custody of their natural parents was overcome. He points to fourteen factors in the circuit court\u2019s opinion which formed the basis for a finding of exceptional circumstances, concluding therefrom that the grant of custody was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Moreover, Bruce argues that Debbie is unfit as a parent and thus the court\u2019s decision to award custody to him was justified. In addition, he observes that a court\u2019s custody determination may not be reversed by an appellate court if the fact finding was not clearly erroneous and the ultimate custody decision was not a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Although we said in <em>Monroe v. Monroe, </em>329 Md. 758, 767, 621 A.2d 898 (1993), that \u201cestablishing paternity is not a necessary factor to be considered when addressing the issue of custody,\u201d this case presents a unique situation. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>unlike the circuit and intermediate appellate courts below, we believe that the paternity issue <em>in the instant case </em>must be resolved before we can address the difficult custody issue. In the absence of a paternity determination, we could not in the circumstances of this case properly analyze the custody dispute now before us. First to be determined in this regard is Brock\u2019s paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In Maryland, a child born to a married woman is presumed to be the offspring of the woman\u2019s husband. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1991 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 5-1028(c)(l) of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See also Monroe, supra, </em>329 Md. at 764-65 n. 2, 621 A.2d 898. This presumption \u201cmay be rebutted by the testimony of a person other than the mother or her husband.\u201d \u00a7 5-1028(c)(2) of the Family Law Article. We have stated, however, \u201cwhere the party against whom the paternity decree is sought, or as to whom the determination of paternity would be adverse, admits paternity, no further judicial proceedings to establish that fact are required.\u201d <em>Monroe, supra, </em>329 Md. at 768, 621 A.2d 898. (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The underlying facts in this case conclusively establish that Gus is Brock\u2019s biological father; indeed, Bruce conceded as much in his answer to Debbie\u2019s second motion for blood test, and in his trial testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, it appears that no further proceedings with regard to paternity were necessary. The question remains whether the trial court had the authority to deny the paternity petition jointly filed by Debbie, Brock\u2019s biological mother, and Gus,- Brock\u2019s biological father, when there was no marital integrity to protect. In addition, we must consider whether, as occurred here, a court has the power to declare that a third party non-parent is the \u201cnatural\u201d father of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>We agree with Bruce that the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard should be used in deciding whether to grant a paternity petition. In <em>Turner v. Whisted, </em>327 Md. 106, 607 A.2d 935 (1992), we concluded that a trial court must consider the best interests of a child before granting a putative father\u2019s request for a blood test. <em>Id. </em>at 116-17, 607 A.2d 935. Similarly, in this case, the trial court, in deciding whether to grant the jointly filed paternity petition, should have considered what was in the best interests of Brock.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">While primarily considering the best interests of the child, the trial court should also have considered the interest that a biological parent, Gus in this case, has in his child. In <em>Turner, supra, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">\u201calthough an unwed father\u2019s biological link to his child does not, in and of itself, guarantee him a constitutional stake in his relationship with that child, such a link combined with a substantial parent-child relationship will do so. \u2018When an unwed father demonstrates a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by \u201ccom[ing] forward to participate in the rearing of his child,\u201d ... his interest in personal contact with his child acquires substantial protection under the Due Process Clause.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">327 Md. at 115-16, 607 A.2d 935 (quoting <em>Michael H. v. Gerald D., </em>491 U.S. 110, 142-43, 109 S.Ct. 2333, 2352, 105 L.Ed.2d 91 (1989) (Brennan, J., dissenting)).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On the other hand, \u201csociety has historically protected the integrity of the marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>family unit from claims of paternity by other men.\u201d <em>Turner, supra, </em>327 Md. at 114-15, 607 A.2d 935 (citing <em>Michael H., supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The trial court should have considered and balanced these competing interests in deciding whether to grant the paternity petition. In <em>Monroe, supra, </em>329 Md. at 772, 621 A.2d 898, we explained the balancing process, in the context of a custody dispute, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u201cWhere there is disputed paternity, <em>i.e., </em>two men are competing for custody, <em>Turner </em>made clear that the putative father\u2019s motive for pursuing the action \u2014 [his] \u2018commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood,\u2019 <em>Turner, </em>327 Md. at 117, 607 A.2d 935, and his interest in establishing a relationship with the child \u2014 must be balanced against the interest of the presumptive father, and his family, in maintaining an already formed familial relationship. <em>Id. </em>The best interest of the child, evidence as to which may come from the child\u2019s representative, informs the proper balance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">In the instant case, the trial court failed to consider Gus\u2019s interests. In fact, the court concluded that: \u201c[Gus\u2019s] rights are not paramount to Mr. Sider.\u201d We believe the court erred when it dismissed the paternity petition without sincerely considering Gus\u2019s interests in the matter.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Had the court properly considered all the competing interests, the only conclusion it could have reached would have been to grant the paternity petition. Looking at the various interests, we conclude that (1) Gus certainly has a significant interest in establishing a relationship with Brock; (2) it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>not appear that denying the petition would necessarily be in the best interests of Brock; and (3) perhaps most importantly, unlike many other custody cases including <em>Michael II., supra, </em>there is no family integrity to protect. Therefore, the court should have granted the paternity petition and declared that Gus is <em>the </em>father of Brock.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Plainly, the court\u2019s decision to characterize Bruce as Brock\u2019s \u201cnatural father\u201d was erroneous. In <em>Lipiano v. Lipiano, </em>89 Md.App. 571, 598 A.2d 854 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>325 Md. 620, 602 A.2d 710 (1992), the Court of Special Appeals addressed such an argument. There, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cNeither [the definition of natural father in \u00a7 5-310] nor the concept of \u2018Natural father\u2019 that it defines have anything to do with custody disputes, however. That section is part of the State adoption law. Section 5-311 generally provides that a child may not be adopted without the consent of his \u2018natural father\u2019 (and \u2018natural mother\u2019) unless their parental rights have previously been terminated. Section 5-310 defines the term \u2018Natural father\u2019 for that purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\"><em>Id. </em>[89 Md.App.] at 578 n. 2, 598 A.2d 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">A court\u2019s attempt to declare a third party to be the \u201cnatural parent\u201d of a child in a custody dispute is in effect a judicial adoption, which is not sanctioned in Maryland. <em>See Board of Education v. Browning, </em>333 Md. 281, 286, 635 A.2d 373 (1994) (\u201cIn Maryland, the general rule is that there can be no adoption except under and in accordance with a statute.\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Furthermore, the circuit court\u2019s decision had the effect of terminating Gus\u2019s parental relationship with Brock which generally can only be accomplished through a decree of adop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Consequently, a court cannot judicially declare that Bruce is Brock\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d father. As stated previously, the court should have granted the joint paternity petition and ruled that Gus was Brock\u2019s father. After establishing that Gus is Brock\u2019s father and that Bruce is a third party, a court can properly address the custody issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">This case involves a custody contest in which the biological mother and father advocate awarding custody to the mother, while a third party, Bruce, seeks custody for himself. Custody disputes between parents and third parties are governed by the principles set forth in <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 372 A.2d 582 (1977); we there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">\u201c Where parents claim the custody of a child, there is a <em>prima facie </em>presumption that the child\u2019s welfare will be best subserved in the care and custody of its parents rather than in the custody of others, and the burden is then cast upon the parties opposing them to show the contrary.\u2019<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">\u201cWe have indicated how the presumption may be rebutted. In <em>Ross v. Pick, </em>[199 Md. 341, 86 A.2d 463 (1952) ], we pointed out that the ordinary entitlement of parents to the custody of their minor children by the natural law, the common law, and the statute, is not an absolute one and declared that the right \u2018may be forfeited where it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>that any parent is unfit to have custody of a child, or where some exceptional circumstances render such custody detrimental to the best interests of the child.\u2019 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">\u201cTo recapitulate: the best interest of the child standard is always determinative in child custody disputes. When the dispute is between a biological parent and a third party, it is presumed that the child\u2019s best interest is subserved by custody in the parent. That presumption is overcome and such custody will be denied if (a) the parent is unfit to have custody, or (b) if there are such exceptional circumstances as make such custody detrimental to the best interest of the child. Therefore, in parent-third party disputes over custody, it is only upon a determination by the equity court that the parent is unfit or that there are exceptional circumstances which make custody in the parent detrimental to the best interest of the child, that the court need inquire into the best interest of the child in order to make a proper custodial disposition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><em>Id. </em>[280 Md.] at 178-79, 372 A.2d 582 (quoting in part <em>Ross v. Pick, supra, </em>199 Md. at 351, 86 A.2d 463).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In the instant case, the trial court\u2019s opinion reveals that it primarily treated Bruce as a parent because it concluded that Debbie was estopped from asserting that Bruce was not Brock\u2019s father. The court also found in the alternative that, even if Bruce was treated as a third party, exceptional circumstances existed which made custody in Debbie detrimental to the best interests of Brock. The court, however, failed to explicitly state what exceptional circumstances it was relying upon. Because he did not detail his findings with regard to exceptional circumstances, the trial judge must reevaluate his custody decision. The trial judge appears to have concluded that Debbie was not unfit, undoubtedly taking into account that a finding of adultery does not in any way create a presumption of unfitness to have custody of one\u2019s own child. <em>See Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 127, 372 A.2d 231, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 939, 98 S.Ct. 430, 54 L.Ed.2d 299 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>On remand, the circuit court should consider the following factors set forth in <em>Ross v. Hoffman, supra, </em>and any other relevant factors, in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">(1) the length of time the child has been away from the biological parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">(2) the age of the child when care was assumed by the third party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">(3) the possible emotional effect on the child of a change of custody;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">(4) the period of time which elapsed before the parent sought to reclaim the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">(5) the nature and strength of the ties between the child and the third party custodian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">(6) the intensity and genuineness of the parent\u2019s desire to have the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">(7) the stability and certainty as to the child\u2019s future in the custody of the parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">We listed other important factors in <em>Turner, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\">\u201cthe stability of the child\u2019s current home environment, whether there is an ongoing family unit, and the child\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional needs. An important consideration is the child\u2019s past relationship with the putative father, (citation omitted). Finally, other factors might even include the child\u2019s ability to ascertain genetic information for the purpose of medical treatment and genealogical history.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">327 Md. at 116-17, 607 A.2d 935. We also stated in <em>Monroe, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-14\">\u201cWhether the child has established a relationship with a third party sufficient to constitute exceptional circumstances, rebutting the presumption of custody in the biological parent, is not dependent on its development during the absence of the biological parent. A relationship resulting in bonding and psychological dependence upon a person without biological connection can develop during an ongoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>biological parent/child relationship. Particularly is this true when the relationship is developed in the context of a family unit and is fostered, facilitated and, for most of the child\u2019s life, encouraged by the biological parent. That the relationships, one with a known biological parent and the other with an acknowledged, though, in fact, non-biological, parent, progress at the same time, does not render either less viable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">329 Md. at 775-76, 621 A.2d 898. We would further note that it is ordinarily in the best interest of a child to be raised with his or her siblings. <em>See Hild v. Hild, </em>221 Md. 349, 359, 157 A.2d 442 (1960); <em>Melton v. Connolly, supra, </em>219 Md. at 190, 148 A.2d 387; <em>Hadick v. Hadick, </em>90 Md.App. 740, 748, 603 A.2d 915 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In addition, factors that are specifically relevant to this case include (1) the position of the biological father, Gus; (2) how Brock has fared in Bruce\u2019s custody during the past two years; and (3) Debbie\u2019s ability to care for Brock during the daytime, <em>see DeGrange v. Kline, </em>254 Md. 240, 243, 254 A.2d 353 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">We reiterate that the appropriate standard in a parent-third party contested custody case, after taking into account the presumption that a child is better off with his or her natural parents, is the best interests of the child. Moreover, we emphasize:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">\u201cthat in any child custody case, the paramount concern is the best interest of the child. As Judge Orth pointed out for the Court in <em>Ross v. Hoffman, [supra], </em>we have variously characterized this standard as being \u2018of transcendent importance\u2019 and the \u2018sole question.\u2019 The best interest of the child is therefore not considered as one of many factors, but as the objective to which virtually all other factors speak.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0Z\"><em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>306 Md. 290, 303, 508 A.2d 964 (1986). <em>See also Monroe, supra, </em>329 Md. at 769, 621 A.2d 898 (\u201cWhen a court is called upon to resolve the issue of which of the parties to a child custody action should be awarded custody of a child, the critical and overriding consideration is \u201cwhat is in the best interest of the child?\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Our decision today does not offend the rule that an appellate court should give due deference to a trial court\u2019s custody decision.

If it appears that the chancellor erred as to matters of law, further proceedings in the trial court will ordinarily be required unless the error is determined to be harmless. Finally, when the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the chancellor founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the chancellor\u2019s decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\"><em>Davis v.

With regard to the custody case, the Court of Special Appeals also discussed two other issues raised by Debbie.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">First, it addressed her contention that the circuit court erred when it denied her motion to appoint separate counsel for Brock.

The intermediate appellate court responded to this contention by stating that \u201call parties and courts openly acknowledged Gus\u2019s biological paternity, [and thus] paternity was not at issue in the present case <em>(i.e., </em>the divorce/custody case) and, therefore, the trial court did not err by denying Debbie's Motions for Blood Test (of Bruce).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b557-10\">.
