According to its title, the purpose of ch. 659 was \u201cto provide certain guidelines and procedures for the seizure and forfeiture of motor vehicles used in violation of [the subtitle captioned <em>Health-Controlled Dangerous Substances].\u201d </em>The 1972 amendment added a number of new subsections to \u00a7 297, one of which, formerly designated as (f), is now designated as subsection (i); it reads in its current form, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201c(i) In exercising the authority to seize motor vehicles pursuant to this section the following standards shall be utilized:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">(1) A motor vehicle used in violation of this section shall be seized and forfeiture recommended to the forfeiting authority when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">(i) Controlled dangerous substances in any quantity are sold or attempted to be sold in violation of this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">(ii) Although the violator has not sold or attempted to sell controlled dangerous substances in violation of this subtitle, an amount of such substances or paraphernalia is located which would reasonably indicate that sale is contemplated by the violator; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">(iii) The total circumstances of the case dictate that seizure and forfeiture is justified; these circumstances would include such factors as the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">1.

An extensive criminal record of the violator;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>3. A previous conviction of the violator for a controlled dangerous substances violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">4.

The manner in which the vehicle was being used.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Following these provisions of \u00a7 297(i) is subparagraph (2) which directs that a motor vehicle used in violation of the subheading shall not be seized (a) when the vehicle is being used by a member of the family other than the registered owner and controlled dangerous substances (\u201cCDS\u201d) or drug paraphernalia are located therein in a quantity insufficient to suggest that a sale is contemplated, and where no sale was made or attempted, and the registered owner neither knew nor should have known that such material was in the vehicle; (b) when an innocent registered owner lends the vehicle to another and the latter or someone invited into the vehicle by such person causes CDS or drug paraphernalia to be brought into the vehicle without the owner\u2019s knowledge; or (c) the vehicle falls within the provisions of \u00a7 297(b)(4)(i) or (ii), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Section 297(i)(3) was also added to the statute by the 1972 amendment; it provides that forfeiture shall be recommended \u201conly after the chief law enforcement officer of the police department ... that seized the motor vehicle has determined from the records of the Motor Vehicle Administration the names and addresses of all registered owners and secured parties.\u201d This subsection further provides that forfeiture can only be recommended after the chief law enforcement officer \u201chas personally reviewed the facts and circumstances of the seizure and has personally determined, <em>according to the above guidelines, </em>that forfeiture is warranted and so represents in writing to the appropriate forfeiting authority.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Subsection 297(j), as it now reads, provides that \u201c[i]f the forfeiting authority determines independent of the decision of the police department ... that seized the motor vehicle\u201d that it falls within the exemptions specified in \u00a7 297(i)(2), or that the standards to be utilized pursuant to subsection (i)(l) of \u00a7 297 were not met, the forfeiting authority shall surrender the vehicle upon request to the owner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">What is now \u00a7 297(k) was added to the statute by the 1972 amendment as subsections (q) and (r); it is thereby provided that \u201c[i]f, after a full hearing,\u201d the court determines that the property should not be forfeited, it shall order its release, but if it determines that forfeiture is proper, the court shall order that the property be forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In light of these provisions, and particularly subsections 297(b)(4) and 297(i), the question before us is whether a motor vehicle, used by an individual in an attempt to purchase illicit drugs, is subject to seizure and forfeiture in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">In November of 1992, members of the Frederick City Police Department and other area law enforcement agencies engaged in a street level undercover drug operation in Frederick, Maryland. The purpose of this operation was to arrest individuals who attempted to buy a controlled dangerous substance, crack cocaine, from undercover police officers. Because it is known as an area where considerable drug activity takes place, the police selected the Brookside Apartments in Frederick to conduct the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">On November 6, 1992, two undercover police officers were standing in the entrance way of building number 1105 of Brookside Apartments. At approximately 7:25 p.m., Mark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Allen Willard approached the officers and asked \u201cCan I get a forty?\u201d This language is commonly used by individuals engaged in the illegal drug trade to signify an offer to purchase $40.00 worth of crack cocaine. One of the police officers answered in the affirmative and walked with Willard under the stairwell of the building. The officer then displayed three individually packaged \u201crocks\u201d of what purported to be crack cocaine. Willard selected two of the \u201crocks,\u201d handed the undercover officer $40.00, and left the area. The price of $20.00 per \u201crock\u201d was consistent with the price of crack cocaine in Frederick in November of 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Unknown to Willard, the substance that he bought from the officer was not crack cocaine; rather, it was a substance specially manufactured by a local law enforcement chemist for the undercover drug operation. Although the size, shape, color, texture, and packaging of the substance was substantially identical to crack cocaine, the substance was in fact comprised solely of a non-controlled substance (\u201cnon-CDS\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">After the transaction, the police observed Willard enter a 1988 Toyota Pick-Up Truck. As he began to drive away, members of the arrest team stopped the vehicle and placed Willard under arrest. A search incident to the arrest uncovered the two \u201crocks\u201d of non-CDS which Willard had just purchased; no CDS or drug paraphernalia was found in the vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">After the arrest, the police seized Willard\u2019s vehicle. Consistent with the provisions of \u00a7 297(i), Frederick Chief of Police Raffensberger thereafter wrote to the State\u2019s Attorney, send<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>ing him a copy of the police forfeiture report and related documents concerning Willard\u2019s arrest and the seizure of his vehicle. Raffensberger\u2019s letter stated that \u201c[t]he facts and circumstances\u201d of the seizure had been reviewed by him and he determined that forfeiture is warranted under \u00a7 297(i)(l)(iii). Raffensberger therefore requested that proceedings be instituted to forfeit the vehicle. The State\u2019s Attorney, having made the requisite determination \u201cindependent of the decision of the police department,\u201d advised the Motor Vehicle Administration of his intention to initiate forfeiture proceedings and sought to ascertain, as required by the statute, whether the vehicle was subject to any liens or security interests. Subsequently, based upon the recovery of the two \u201crocks\u201d of non-CDS found in Willard\u2019s vehicle, .the State\u2019s Attorney for Frederick County filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Frederick County for the forfeiture of Willard\u2019s 1988 Toyota Pick-Up Truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">At the trial of the forfeiture proceeding, the facts were stipulated, as heretofore outlined. The State\u2019s Attorney relied solely upon \u00a7 297(b)(4) which proscribed the use of a motor vehicle, or the intent to use the motor vehicle, to transport or in any manner to facilitate the \u201cpossession\u201d of a controlled dangerous substance. He argued that the evidence disclosed that Willard intended to use his vehicle to purchase and transport CDS, thereby facilitating his possession of the substance, and that under the statute it made no difference that what Willard thought was cocaine was non-CDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Willard maintained that nothing in \u00a7 297 authorized forfeiture of his vehicle since the substance which he transported was non-CDS, even though he believed that it was cocaine. Specifically, he urged that had the legislature intended that \u00a7 297(b)(4) permitted forfeiture in these circumstances, it would have expressly included non-CDS substances within the ambit of the statute. Pointing to the requirements of \u00a7 297(i) and the recommendation for forfeiture, Willard contended that this subsection sets forth standards to be utilized in exercising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the authority to seize motor vehicles, and that these standards did not encompass possession of non-CDS. He argued that none of the factors to be considered under \u00a7 297(i) covered non-CDS and that because this subsection singularly addressed motor vehicle forfeitures, it was controlling. He said that his intention to transport could only be of the substance that he actually purchased and because it was not CDS his vehicle could not be seized and forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The trial court (Rollins, J.) held, without any reference to \u00a7 297(i), that nothing in \u00a7 297 specifically provided for forfeiture when non-CDS was possessed or transported in a vehicle. Accordingly, the court concluded that forfeiture was not appropriate in the circumstances, and it ordered that the vehicle be released to Willard. The State\u2019s Attorney appealed on behalf of the Frederick City Police Department. We granted certiorari prior to consideration of the appeal by the intermediate appellate court to decide the important issue presented in the case. 332 Md. 245, 630 A.2d 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">It was argued before us, as it was at the forfeiture trial below, that a motor vehicle which is intended for use in transporting or in any manner facilitating the transportation, sale, receipt, possession, or concealment of CDS is subject to forfeiture under \u00a7 297(b), even when that vehicle transports non-CDS purchased under the guise of being CDS. In so contending, reliance was placed upon several federal cases that have so construed the federal forfeiture statute (21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 881 (West 1989 &amp; Supp.1993)), which contains provisions virtually identical to \u00a7 297(b); these cases hold that a conveyance is forfeitable when it is <em>intended to be used </em>to facilitate the transportation, sale, receipt, possession, or concealment of CDS, even if CDS is not actually present in the conveyance. <em>See, e.g., United States v. One 1980 Bertram 58' Motor Yacht, </em>876 F.2d 884 (11th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. $64,000.00 in U.S. Currency, </em>722 F.2d 239 (5th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. One 1979 Porsche Coupe, </em>709 F.2d 1424 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Cir.1983); <em>United States v. One 1980 Cadillac Eldorado, </em>705 F.2d 862 (6th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Willard focused his appellate argument before us almost entirely on the provisions of \u00a7 297(i). He maintained that Police Chief Raffensberger did not comply with the provisions of this section and made no independent determination as to why the Willard vehicle should be recommended for forfeiture. He argued that the provisions of \u00a7 297(i) were controlling and that they were totally ignored by the State\u2019s Attorney. He urged that the recommendation for forfeiture was improperly predicated solely on the general provisions for seizure of property set forth in \u00a7 297(b). In this regard, Willard suggested that the more specific provisions of .\u00a7 297(i) governed the seizure and the forfeiture of his vehicle, rather than the more general provisions of \u00a7 297(b)(4); and that nothing in the provisions of \u00a7 297(i) authorized vehicle forfeitures where the only substance transported was non-CDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In <em>State v. One 1967 Ford Mustang, </em>266 Md. 275, 292 A.2d 64 (1972), decided prior to the effective date of what is now \u00a7 297(i), we recognized that under \u00a7 297(b) possession alone of CDS is sufficient to justify the seizure of a motor vehicle, and that \u201c[o]nce the basis of forfeiture under \u00a7 297 is established ..., the remedy is prescribed by law \u2014 loss of the seized vehicle.\u201d 266 Md. at 277, 292 A.2d 64. We said that \u201c[i]f the Legislature had desired to make this forfeiture discretionary, it could have so provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 292 A.2d 64. We further said that under \u00a7 297 \u201cthe duties and powers of the courts are narrowly limited\u201d and that \u201c[o]nce the seizing authority decides to seek forfeiture, the court\u2019s only responsibilities are to require proof that the vehicle seized was \u2018used, or intended for use, to transport, or in any manner to facilitate the transportation, sale, receipt, possession, or concealment of [controlled dangerous substances].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 292 A.2d 64. We explained that once it was determined that no statutory exceptions to forfeiture were applicable, and that due process requirements had been satisfied, \u201crequests for remission are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>best directed to the Governor,\u201d since under Art. II, \u00a7 20 of the Maryland Constitution, any discretion to remit forfeitures is vested in the Governor. <em>Id. </em>at 278 n. 2, 292 A.2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">While fully cognizant of the fact that forfeitures under \u00a7 297 could produce harsh results, we emphasized that the legislative purpose was to curtail drug traffic in Maryland and discourage such a blight from continuing in the future. <em>Id. </em>at 278-79, 292 A.2d 64. We concluded by stating that we could find no cases, state or federal, holding that \u201cin the absence of statutory permission, discretion is vested in the judiciary to deny forfeiture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 292 A.2d 64. We took note, however, of the addition of what is now subsection (i) to \u00a7 297, stating that it was enacted subsequent to the forfeiture involved in <em>One 1967 Ford Mustang </em>and therefore was not implicated in the case. We nevertheless characterized the amendment to \u00a7 297 as \u201cproviding] guidelines for the exercise of discretion <em>by the seizing authority </em>in deciding whether to recommend forfeiture to the State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, n. 3, 292 A.2d 64 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In <em>Pr. George\u2019s Co. v. One 1969 Opel, </em>267 Md. 491, 298 A.2d 168 (1973), we reiterated what we said in <em>One 1967 Ford Mustang, </em>namely that trial judges lack the discretion to order the return of vehicles seized for violation of the provisions of \u00a7 297(b). We recognized that by the enactment of ch. 659 of the Acts of 1972, which added subsection (i) to \u00a7 297, the legislature \u201cspelled out in some detail standards, guidelines and methods of procedure to be applied and followed by the authorities in respect of the forfeiture of motor vehicles under \u00a7 297.\u201d <em>One 1969 Opel, </em>267 Md. at 499-500, 298 A.2d 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">While we have never had occasion to specifically address the interaction of subsections (b) and (i) of \u00a7 297, the Court of Special Appeals has confronted this very issue. <em>See State v. One 1989 Harley-Davidson, </em>90 Md.App. 445, 601 A.2d 1119, <em>cert. granted, </em>327 Md. 129, 607 A.2d 947, <em>appeal dismissed per stipulation, </em>327 Md. 417, 609 A.2d 1193 (1992); <em>State v. One 1985 Ford, </em>72 Md.App. 144, 527 A.2d 1311 (1987); <em>State v. 1982 Plymouth, </em>67 Md.App. 310, 507 A.2d 633 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>In <em>State v. 1982 Plymouth, supra, </em>a motor vehicle was used for the possession and concealment of marijuana and forfeiture was sought. The issue before the court was whether \u00a7 297(i) constituted \u201ca modification, by way of limitation,\u201d on \u00a7 297(b)(4)\u2019s forfeiture conditions, or whether \u00a7 297(i) was \u201crather a set of \u2018guidelines\u2019 to the police to assist them in deciding when to seize a vehicle and to recommend forfeiture to the State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d 67 Md.App. at 312, 507 A.2d 633. The court concluded \u201cthe latter to be the case\u201d and posed the further question of \u201cwhat standard of review, if any, the judge at a forfeiture proceeding shall employ to determine whether the policeman properly followed the guidelines provided by [\u00a7 297(i) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>In ordering forfeiture, the court focused solely upon \u00a7 297(b)(4), holding that it was not necessary that other conditions set forth in subsection (i) be present. Section 297(b)(4), the court said, \u201ccovers the waterfront\u201d as the overall scheme of \u00a7 297 makes clear that the only conditions for forfeiture are those contained in \u00a7 297(b)(1) through (4). <em>Id. </em>at 314, 507 A.2d 633. As to this, the court held that the use of a vehicle for possession of drugs standing alone is sufficient for forfeiture. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Writing for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>1982 Plymouth, </em>Judge Moylan reviewed a number of our motor vehicle forfeiture cases decided between 1971 and 1973. While strictly applying the provisions of \u00a7 297(b), none of our cases involved the subsequently enacted provisions of \u00a7 297(i). In undertaking to ascertain the legislative purpose in enacting \u00a7 297(i), i.e., whether it was intended as \u201can additional set of preconditions for forfeiture,\u201d the intermediate appellate court noted that three standards were contained in the subsection, none of which dealt in the court\u2019s opinion \u201cin any way with the ultimate forfeiture itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 507 A.2d 633. These standards, the court said, referred only \u201cto the antecedent steps of (1) seizing the vehicle in the first instance and (2) recommending forfeiture to the State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As to these, the court said they were \u201cdirected to police officials\u201d and were, as we observed in <em>One 1967 Ford Mustang, supra, </em>266 Md. at 278, n. 3, 292 A.2d 64, only guidelines to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>exercised by \u201cthe seizing authority\u201d in deciding whether to recommend forfeiture to the State\u2019s Attorney. <em>1982 Plymouth, </em>67 Md.App. at 319, 507 A.2d 633. Accordingly, the intermediate appellate court explained that these \u201cclearly are not guidelines for the judge\u201d since the judge is not \u201cthe seizing authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the court observed that, under the statute, it is not the judge who will decide whether to recommend forfeiture to the State\u2019s Attorney, nor is the recommending function a judicial decision, either in the first instance or by way of <em>de novo </em>determination. <em>Id. </em>The \u201coverall scheme\u201d of the 1972 amendments to \u00a7 297, according to the court, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">\u201cAfter providing some guidelines for when a policeman should seize a vehicle and recommend its forfeiture and some guidelines for when a policeman should not seize a vehicle or recommend its forfeiture, the statute provides safeguards upon the exercise of that discretion by establishing two levels of review within the executive branch of government. After setting out both the affirmative and negative standards themselves ... [the 1972 amendment] goes on to provide an initial review by \u2018the chief law-enforcement officer\u2019 of the concerned police department:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">\u201c \u2018(3) Forfeiture of the motor vehicle used in violation of this subtitle shall be recommended to the State\u2019s Attorney only after the chief law-enforcement officer of the police department, bureau, or force that seized the motor vehicle has determined from the records of the Motor Vehicle Administration the names and addresses of all registered owners and secured parties as defined in the Code, has personally reviewed the facts and circumstances of the seizure and has personally determined, according to the above guidelines, that forfeiture is warranted and so represents in writing to the appropriate State\u2019s attorney.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">[Subsection (j) ] deal[s] with the power of the State\u2019s Attorney to review the decision made by the police department, to follow it, or to override it if the State\u2019s Attorney deems that course appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u201cThe statutory scheme does not contemplate any second guessing or <em>de novo </em>determination by the judge of 1) the policeman\u2019s decision to seize and to recommend forfeiture, 2) the chief law enforcement officer\u2019s decision to go forward with the forfeiture recommendation in writing, or 3) the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s decision to petition for forfeiture.

One 1985 Ford, supra, </em>a case also involving the forfeiture of a motor vehicle for possession of marijuana, the Court of Special Appeals said that in terms of the ultimate forfeiture hearing, \u201cthe merits of the forfeiture issue are to be controlled by the provisions of [\u00a7 297(b) ].\u201d 72 Md.App. at 146, 527 A.2d 1311. Specifically, it said that \u201conce the illicit use of the vehicle is shown, the vehicle is presumptively subject to forfeiture and the burden of proof is upon the owner to demonstrate entitlement to an exemption from that presumptive forfeiture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 527 A.2d 1311. The court acknowledged that to forfeit a motor vehicle for possession of CDS where no commercial aspect of the drug traffic is involved may seem harsh; it nevertheless reiterated the oft-stated view that the legislature intended it to be harsh. <em>Id. </em>at 150-51, 527 A.2d 1311. The court said that the legislative scheme makes clear that \u201cthe courts have little option but to apply the law with all its intended vigor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 527 A.2d 1311. As to the application of subsection (i), the court explained that it provides a set of guidelines, not for the judge to apply in determining whether forfeiture is to be ordered, but for the exercise of the seizing authority\u2019s discretion in deciding whether to recommend forfeiture to the State\u2019s Attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 152-53, 527 A.2d 1311. In this regard, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he guidelines for seizure, in any event, are only for the benefit of the executive branch and are not subject to judicial review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153, 527 A.2d 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The fundamental goal of the courts in interpreting statutory language is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent. <em>GEICO v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, 332 </em>Md. 124, 131, 630 A.2d 713 (1993); <em>State v. Crescent Cities Jaycees, </em>330 Md. 460, 468, 624 A.2d 955 (1993). In doing so, we read the words of the statute in light of the full context in which they appear, i.e., we endeavor to divine legislative intent from the entire statutory scheme, as opposed to scrutinizing parts of a statute in isolation. <em>Williams v. State, </em>329 Md. 1, 15-16, 616 A.2d 1275 (1992). Consequently, the various subsections of \u00a7 297 must be interpreted with reference to one another and harmonized to the extent reasonably possibly. <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank v. Schlossberg, </em>306 Md. 48, 56, 507 A.2d 172 (1986); <em>Comm\u2019n on Med. Discipline v. Bendler, </em>280 Md. 326, 330, 373 A.2d 1232 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">That \u00a7 297(b)(4) subjects motor vehicles to seizure and forfeiture for simple possession of CDS is clear from our cases. <em>See One 1969 Opel, supra; One 1967 Ford Mustang, supra. </em>Moreover, because the plain language of \u00a7 297(b)(4) encompasses an \u201cintent\u201d to use a motor vehicle to facilitate possession and transportation of CDS, we share the view of those federal courts that such an intention to possess CDS, believing it to be CDS, even though it is not, is within the coverage of \u00a7 297(b)(4). In this regard, we ascribe to the legislature, in its purpose to deter trafficking in and use of illicit drugs, full recognition that so-called police \u201cstings\u201d regularly make use of \u201clook-alike\u201d CDS substitutes to apprehend violators, as was done in this case. Manifestly, a real danger exists where illicit drugs are actually used by the police in its undercover enforcement activities of the CDS laws. We therefore conclude that the trial judge was wrong in holding that \u00a7 297(b)(4) had not been violated by Willard in the circumstances of this case. Indeed, it is crystal clear from the stipulated facts that Willard intended to purchase and possess cocaine and to utilize his motor vehicle to facilitate that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Turning to the provisions of \u00a7 297(i), we think it clear that the legislature did not intend by the enactment of this subsection to supplant any of the provisions of \u00a7 297(b), including subsection (4), as they applied to the seizure and forfeiture of motor vehicles. As we see it, \u00a7 297(i) was. intended, as its words indicate, to vest <em>\u201cin the seizing authority </em>\u201d a measure of discretion, guided by the factors specified in the subsection, in making the determination whether the motor vehicle, which became \u201csubject to forfeiture\u201d under \u00a7 297(b)(4), should be recommended for forfeiture. Thus, the precept upon which Willard relies, namely that a specific statutory provision, \u00a7 297(i), governs over a general one, \u00a7 297(b)(4), <em>see GEICO, supra, </em>332 Md. at 132-33, 630 A.2d 713, has no application in this case where the two provisions are intended to operate independently of one another, although part of one statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">As was indicated in <em>1982 Plymouth, </em>and as we recognized in <em>One 1967 Ford Mustang, </em>\u00a7 297(i) provides guidelines to the seizing authority in determining whether to \u201crecommend\u201d forfeiture to the State\u2019s Attorney. Contrary to Willard\u2019s contention, Chief of Police Raffensberger, in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 297(i)(3), did personally review \u201cthe facts arid circumstances\u201d of the seizure of Willard\u2019s vehicle and personally determined according to the guidelines contained in \u00a7 297(i), that forfeiture was warranted and he so advised the State\u2019s Attorney in writing. This recommendation culminated in the petition for forfeiture filed by the State\u2019s Attorney. Nothing more was required of the Chief of Police or the State\u2019s Attorney; the subsection does not require a written evaluation or written report weighing the factors contained in \u00a7 297(i) as a condition precedent to the institution of a forfeiture proceeding. In recommending forfeiture in this case, the Chief of Police was required by \u00a7 297(i)(l)(iii)(l through 6), and did take into account \u201cthe total circumstances of the case\u201d in determining whether \u201cseizure and forfeiture is justified\u201d; those circumstances were (1) whether there was possession of CDS, (2) whether the violator has an extensive criminal record, (3) whether the violator has been previously convicted of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>CDS violation, (4) whether the violator frequently associates with distributors of illegal CDS, (5) the circumstances of the arrest, and (6) the manner in which the vehicle was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">The record before us shows that in furtherance of his intended purpose to possess and transport CDS in his motor vehicle, Willard drove into an area known for high drug activity, knowing that he could purchase cocaine. While nothing before us shows that Willard had a criminal record, or that he ever sold drugs, or that the manner in which he used his vehicle for his illegal purpose was other than commonplace, the weighing of these and other factors specified in the subsection, is not for the judiciary but for the police and State\u2019s Attorney. Although the statute doesn\u2019t contemplate a <em>de novo </em>review by the trial judge, or the appellate court, of the judgmental process of the Chief of Police and State\u2019s Attorney under \u00a7 297(i), even if it did, it could not be judicially found as a matter of law that the decision of the executive branch officials to recommend forfeiture was without a lawful foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">In concluding that the seizure and forfeiture in this case was in accord with the governing provisions of \u00a7 297(b)(4), we are mindful that forfeitures are disfavored in law because they are considered harsh extractions, odious, and to be avoided when possible. <em>See United States Coin &amp; Currency v. Dir., </em>279 Md. 185, 187, 367 A.2d 1243 (1977); <em>Commercial Credit Corp. v. State, </em>258 Md. 192, 199, 265 A.2d 748 (1970). But \u00a7 297(b) was plainly intended by the legislature as strong \u201cmedicine\u201d in the war against drugs. Indeed it was intended to be harsh in order to be effective. It is, therefore, not a statute which, as Willard suggests, mandates a liberal construction to avoid the imposition of a forfeiture; rather, in view of its clear language and purpose, the statute must be construed presumptively in favor of forfeiture absent the applicability of statutory exceptions. Nothing in \u00a7 297(i) vests power in the court, after forfeiture proceedings have been lawfully commenced, to excuse forfeiture where that course of action is not legislatively sanctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE APPELLANT, THEREBY FORFEITING THE SUBJECT MOTOR VEHICLE TO THE STATE OF MARYLAND TO THE USE OF THE FREDERICK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT COSTS TO BE PAID BY MARK ALLEN WILLARD.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-15\">.

I part company with the Court, however, when it holds that the lower court has no function in determining whether executive branch officials abused their discretion, or acted outside the permissible bounds of the statute, in deciding to seek forfeiture. Specifically, I believe the legislature intended court review of the decision of the forfeiting authority, not to substitute the court\u2019s judgment for that of the forfeiting authority, but to determine whether the forfeiting authority abused his or her discretion by seeking forfeiture under circumstances that clearly do not fall within any of the standards or conditions established by the statute. I believe the discretion given the forfeiting authority is broad, and the court would have to approve forfeiture if the record demonstrated any state of facts that would fit within the standards established by the legislature for the forfeiture of a motor vehicle, but that the discretion given to the forfeiting authority is not limitless, and the court is not powerless to correct an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">I agree with the Court that the trial judge erred in denying the forfeiture on the ground that the material transported in the vehicle was not a controlled dangerous substance. Section 297(b)(4) of Art. 27 makes eligible for forfeiture, subject to limitations thereafter set forth, conveyances of all types \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>tended for use\u201d in the transportation of controlled dangerous substances, and this defendant intended to transport a controlled dangerous substance in this vehicle. This vehicle passed the threshold test for forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">The threshold test, however, is just that \u2014 an initial test applicable to all conveyances. If a conveyance does not qualify for forfeiture under subsection (b)(4), the inquiry ends and forfeiture is not permitted. If the conveyance is a motor vehicle, however, it must also qualify for forfeiture pursuant to subsection (i) of the \u00a7 297. It simply could not be clearer that the legislature, by adding subsection (i) to \u00a7 297 intended to impose a separate set of standards with which there would have to be compliance if the conveyance sought to be forfeited was a motor vehicle. The initial language of subsection (i), which introduces the standards that follow, clearly establishes that further limitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">(i) In exercising the authority to seize motor vehicles pursuant to this section the following standards shall be utilized ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The use of the words \u201cstandards\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d make it clear that the legislature was not simply setting forth criteria that it would prefer the forfeiting authority consider in determining whether to forfeit a vehicle. Rather, the legislature mandated two specific conditions that could be shown to justify forfeiture of a vehicle, and then established a third \u201cwild card\u201d or \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d condition, with guidelines, that would serve to justify such a forfeiture. The introductory language to the three possible conditions that will justify forfeiture of a motor vehicle is clearly limiting. The legislature provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">A motor vehicle used in violation of this section shall be seized and forfeiture recommended to forfeiting authority when....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">I do not believe there is any disagreement that in this context, \u201cwhen\u201d means \u201cwhen, and only when.\u201d The first two condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tions that follow are clear, and a court will ordinarily have little difficulty in determining whether they have been met:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">1. Controlled dangerous substances in any quantity are sold or attempted to be sold in violation of this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">2. Although the violator has not sold or attempted to sell controlled dangerous substances in violation of this subtitle, an amount of such substances or paraphernalia is located which would reasonably indicate that sale is contemplated by the violator[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">No one contends that the State can qualify this vehicle for forfeiture under either of these conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">The third condition is decidedly more general. The legislature said forfeiture of a motor vehicle could be accomplished when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">3. The total circumstances of the case dictate that seizure and forfeiture is justified; these circumstances would include such factors as the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">a. The possession of controlled dangerous substances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\">b. An extensive criminal record of the violator;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-13\">c. A previous conviction of the violator for a controlled dangerous substances violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-14\">d. Corroborated information is developed indicating that the violator is or was recently a seller, or frequently associates with individuals known to be distributors of illegal controlled dangerous substances or paraphernalia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-15\">e. Circumstances of the arrest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-16\">f. The manner in which the vehicle was being used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD7n\">Assuming that this third condition is not void for vagueness,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it is apparent that the legislature intended by this language to permit forfeiture of a vehicle when the threshold test of subsection (b)(4) was met and in addition one or more of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>circumstances declared in this third condition demonstrated the presence of an additional factor of seriousness justifying seizure. It is here that the discretion of the forfeiting authority comes into play. That discretion is, in light of the legislative language, necessarily broad. It is not, however, limitless. By establishing the conditions for forfeiture, and requiring that the forfeiting authority file a petition with the court in order to obtain a forfeiture, the legislature has expressed its intention that the court exercise the limited, but traditional oversight of determining whether the forfeiting authority abused it\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I cannot imagine the legislature acting to carefully circumscribe the power of forfeiture in the case of motor vehicles, as it obviously did in enacting subsection (i) by ch. 659 of the Acts of 1972, only to insert in that same statute language that permitted the forfeiting authority to forfeit a motor vehicle under any other circumstances that seemed appropriate to that authority, without any limit on that discretion or any judicial oversight to curb the possible abuse of that discretion. In subsection (j) of \u00a7 297, the legislature commanded that the forfeiting authority make an independent determination of whether the conditions of forfeiture have been met. Subsection (j) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">If the forfeiting authority determines independent of the decision of the police department, bureau, or force that seized the motor vehicle that ... the standards to be utilized pursuant to subsection (i)(l) of this section were not met, the forfeiting authority shall surrender the vehicle upon request to the owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">There is nothing tentative about that language. The legislature obviously did not want a motor vehicle forfeited that did not meet the standards of subsection (i)(l). The forfeiting authority was directed, by use of the mandatory word \u201cshall\u201d to surrender the vehicle if it did not meet the established conditions. Surely this decision is susceptible to judicial over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>sight under an \u201cabuse <em>of </em>discretion\u201d or \u201cclearly wrong\u201d test; otherwise the subsequent judicial proceeding mandated by the legislature lacks meaning. It is interesting to note that in <em>State v. One 1976 Dodge, </em>65 Md.App. 482, 501 A.2d 103 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>305 Md. 599, 505 A.2d 856 (1986), the State argued that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">[w]hen faced with a forfeiture petition under Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 297 (1982 Repl.Vol. and 1985 Cum.Supp.), a circuit court is empowered to determine only \u201cwhether the police commissioner abused his discretion or was clearly erroneous in recommending forfeiture....\u2019.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">I agree with the position taken by the State in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">In the instant case, the trial judge indicated to counsel early in the proceedings his belief that forfeiture was not possible when a controlled dangerous substance was not involved. The State asked permission to make a full record for purposes of appeal, and did so by dictating into the record an agreed statement of facts. There is .nothing in the agreed statement of facts that would come within a country mile of satisfying any of the three conditions for forfeiture of a motor vehicle established by the legislature. No controlled dangerous substances or paraphernalia were found in the vehicle; there was no evidence the defendant had any prior record, much less an \u201cextensive criminal record\u201d; there was no \u201ccorroborated information\u201d that the defendant was recently a seller, or frequently associated with individuals known to be distributors of controlled dangerous substances or paraphernalia; there was no evidence that there was anything unusual about the circumstances of the arrest; and, the manner of use of the vehicle was simply to transport a small quantity of a substance that the driver believed to be a controlled dangerous substance. On this record, there was an abuse of discretion or clear error in determining that the vehicle qualified for forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Concededly, the focus of the parties and the court below was on a different issue \u2014 the availability of forfeiture when the substance was not a controlled dangerous substance. That question having been resolved, it may be appropriate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>afford the State an opportunity, if it so desires, to offer any evidence it may have to show the presence of any of the aggravating factors set forth by the legislature in the third condition. I would vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Judge Chasanow and Judge Bell have authorized me to state that they join in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-17\">.
