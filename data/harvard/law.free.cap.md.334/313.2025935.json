The car\u2019s door was open and the engine was running. The manner of his death proved to be homicide and the cause of his death was a single gunshot wound to his head. Cash in the amount of $130 was on his person. Inside the car were numerous bags of cocaine, two pagers, $310 in cash and several pieces of paper bearing initials or names and phone numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">The police investigation of the crime led them to Anthony Brady Weston, Perry Wilson Lee and Ryan O\u2019Neil Wilson. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Five days after the murder, they were arrested. The Grand Jury for Prince George\u2019s County returned an indictment against them. All three were jointly charged with the premeditated murder of Johnson (1st count), the attempted robbery of Johnson with a deadly weapon (2nd count), conspiracy to rob Johnson with a deadly weapon (3rd count), and unlawfully using a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence (4th count). Wilson and Lee were jointly charged with the offense of accessory after the fact to the murder of Johnson (5th count).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County denied a motion for severance, and on 2 April 1991 Wilson and Lee were tried together by a jury. Each of them was found guilty on the conspiracy charge and on the accessory charge and not guilty on the remaining charges. Wilson attempted to appeal from the judgments entered against him, but his appeal was deemed defective by the Court of Special Appeals and dismissed. He resorted to post conviction procedures, was granted the right to note a belated appeal and exercised the right. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 680, 622 A.2d 810 (1993). We issued a writ of certiorari upon Wilson\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Detective Roger Irvin of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department arrested Lee at Lee\u2019s home in Lanham, Maryland. Irvin transported Lee to the Department\u2019s Criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Investigations Division and interviewed him. Lee made a statement, which was reduced to writing and signed by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Special Agent Douglas Reardon of the Virginia State Police took Wilson into custody at St. Paul\u2019s College in Lawrence-ville, Virginia, where Wilson was a student. After advising him that he was being arrested for capital murder, Reardon interviewed Wilson in the office of the Dean of Student Affairs. Wilson made a statement which was reduced to writing and signed by him. Later Wilson was further interviewed by Reardon in the Sheriffs office. The statement made by Wilson at that time was not transcribed but Reardon made \u201cjust about verbatim\u201d notes of what Wilson said. Wilson signed the notes and wrote \u201cvoluntary statement\u201d thereon. Detective Daniel Smart of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department also obtained a statement from Wilson shortly after the interview by Reardon in the Sheriffs office. The statement was reduced to -writing and signed by Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">There was a plenary hearing on pretrial motions filed by Wilson and Lee to suppress their respective statements. The trial court denied the motions on the ground that a preponderance of the evidence established that they were freely and voluntarily made. They were thus available for presentation to the jury for its consideration as substantive evidence in the event that the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that they were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">At trial, Lee\u2019s statement was admitted into evidence over Wilson\u2019s objection. As recited to the jury by Irvin, Lee said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-u\">On January 6th, 1990 me, Anthony [Weston], Ryan [Wilson] went out in my father\u2019s gold Honda. Ryan had his father\u2019s D.C. police gun. We were going to rob a dope dealer. Anthony had the gun. We went around Dodge Park Apartments. There was no one out so we decided to leave. When I saw a car enter the apartment myself and Ryan were walking on the sidewalk. Anthony was about 15 feet in the street. That\u2019s when the car came back and Anthony said, \u201cAre you looking?\u201d I could not hear what the person said in the car. Then Anthony said, \u201cGet on \u2014 get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the fuck out or on.\u201d The car stood for 30 seconds, then pulled in and parked. A male got out the car. He then reached back in the car and hit the horn and turned to Anthony and said putting his hands in the air \u201cI\u2019m the biggest dealer around here.\u201d Anthony then said, \u201cNo, fuck, you\u2019re not\u201d, and shot him. Anthony then ran. Me and Ryan walked away. I could not believe he had done that. I then got in my car, pick up Anthony, Ryan and talk about it and then dropped Ryan off and dropped Anthony off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">That narrative part of the statement was in Lee\u2019s handwriting. The statement continued in question and answer form, and was reduced to writing by Irvin.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">Question number one: \u201cWhat is Anthony\u2019s name?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGC\">Answer: \u201cAnthony Brady Weston.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">Question number two: \u201cWhat is Ryan\u2019s name?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">Answer: \u201cRyan O\u2019Neil Wilson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">Question number three: \u201cWhere does Anthony live?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arpc\">Answer: \u201cIt\u2019s on Walkerton in Lanham, Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW7\">Question number four: \u2018Where does Ryan live?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">Answer: \u201cIt\u2019s off of Hill Road somewhere.

There were a couple people out there. They said that they did not have anything. We were leaving. Me and Ryan were on the sidewalk. Anthony was ten to fifteen feet behind us and he was in the street. That\u2019s when a car came in. The car went down about three buildings and it looked like he was dropping somebody off. Meanwhile, we were calling Anthony and saying, \u2018Come on, Anthony, let\u2019s go.\u2019 The car came back and Anthony said, \u2018Are you looking for something?\u2019 He said that the \u2014 he said that to the guy in the car. 1 couldn\u2019t hear what the guy said. The car pulled in front of the building where he was shot at. The guy got out of the ear. He was rolling down his window. When he was doing this he reached back in the car and blew the horn three times. He was facing the building. Anthony was behind him. The guy turned around and threw his hands in the air and said, \u2018I\u2019m the biggest hustler around here.\u2019 And Anthony said, \u2018No, you\u2019re not. I am.\u2019 The whole time the gun was at his head. At first the guy hit the gun away and then Anthony shot the gun and then Anthony run down the street to the 25 Hour store. I walked to the car. Ryan left. He walked towards the store. I drove and picked up Ryan first and then Anthony. We talked driving home and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>asked Anthony why he did that. He didn\u2019t say why he did it. I dropped Ryan off, then Anthony at their homes.\u201d Question number fourteen: \u201cWhat happened to the gun?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADe\">Answer: \u201cAnthony gave it to Ryan. I don\u2019t know what Ryan did with the gun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">Question number fifteen: \u201cHow many times did Anthony shoot the black male on Dodge Park Road.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">Answer: \u201cOnce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">Question number sixteen: \u201cDid you tell anybody about this incident?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">Answer: \u201cMy girlfriend.

There was no other evidence adduced by the State except the two men\u2019s statements. Each of the defendants opted not to testify and no other evidence was offered in their behalf. Motions for judgments of acquittal were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The sole question Wilson asks us to determine boils down to whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Lee\u2019s statement. We consider Wilson\u2019s challenge only with respect to the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and on the common law hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">In its guise as substantive evidence against Wilson, Lee\u2019s statement was hearsay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its posture as substantive evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>dence it also invoked the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The basic rule as to hearsay bars its admission in evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">If one were to read [the language of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment] literally, it would require, on objection, the exclusion of any statement made by a declarant not present at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\"><em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 63, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980) (citation omitted). The Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">But, if thus applied, the Clause would abrogate virtually every hearsay exception, a result long rejected as unintended and too extreme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\"><em>Id. </em>In <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 813, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3145, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990), the Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">From the earliest days of our Confrontation Clause jurisprudence, we have consistently held that the Clause does not necessarily prohibit the admission of hearsay statements against a criminal defendant, even though the admission of such statements might be thought to violate the literal terms of the Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">The Supreme Court has recognized that hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause are \u201cgenerally designed to protect similar values\u201d but it has \u201cbeen careful not to equate the Confrontation Clause\u2019s prohibitions with the general rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814, 110 S.Ct. at 3146 (citations omitted). \u201cBoth,\u201d however, \u201cexpress a preference for a personal examination of a declarant as a means of testing the veracity and accuracy of a witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Chapman v. State, </em>331 Md. 448, 453, 628 A.2d 676 (1993). By the refusal of the Court to equate the protections of the Confrontation Clause with the common law rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>regarding the admission of hearsay in criminal trials, the Confrontation Clause may bar \u201cthe admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 814, 110 S.Ct. at 3146.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 65, 100 S.Ct. at 2538, the Court set forth \u201ca general approach\u201d for determining when incriminating statements admissible under exceptions to the hearsay rule also meet the requirements of the Confrontation Clause. The general approach has two aspects. The first is that a \u201crule of necessity\u201d must be satisfied. <em>Roberts </em>declared this rule was established by the Sixth Amendment \u201cin conformance with the Framers\u2019 preference for face-to-face accusation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The second comes into play only upon satisfaction of the rule of necessity. The hearsay statement is then admissible provided it bears \u201cadequate \u2018indicia of reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539. The <em>Roberts </em>approach was recognized and applied by the Court in <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986). It was iterated and applied in <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 814-815, 110 S.Ct. at 3145-3146. We quoted and applied it in <em>Chapman, </em>331 Md. at 455-456, 628 A.2d 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">One of the ways the rule of necessity called for in the first aspect of the <em>Roberts </em>approach may be satisfied is by proving that the hearsay declarant is unavailable. <em>See Chapman, </em>331 Md. at 470, 628 A.2d 676. A declarant is \u201cunavailable\u201d when the proponent demonstrates that he has been unable to procure the attendance of the absent witness by process or other reasonable means. <em>See </em>Fed.Rule Evid. 804(a)(5).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u201cIndicia of reliability\u201d translates into a \u201cshowing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539; <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. at 543, 106 S.Ct. at 2063. If the hearsay at issue possesses \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d it can be admitted into evidence despite the general rule barring a trier of fact from considering hearsay. <em>See Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. at 543, 106 S.Ct. at 2063. In <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>the Court considered the circumstances surrounding the hearsay statement, <em>id. </em>at 544-545, 106 S.Ct. at 2064, arid the \u201cinterlocking\u201d nature of the codefendant\u2019s and defendant\u2019s confessions to determine whether the codefendant\u2019s confession enjoyed the required \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d but did not rely on corroborative <em>physical </em>evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 545-546, 106 S.Ct. at 2064. In <em>Cruz v. New York, </em>481 U.S. 186, 107 S.Ct. 1714, 95 L.Ed.2d 162 (1987), the Court also turned to the interlocking nature of the codefendant\u2019s hearsay statement and the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>dant\u2019s statement to corroborate the reliability of the hearsay statement. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">Quite obviously, what the \u201cinterlocking\u201d nature of the codefendant\u2019s confession pertains to is not its <em>harmfulness </em>but rather its <em>reliability: </em>If it confirms essentially the same facts as the defendant\u2019s own confession it is more likely to be true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">481 U.S. at 192, 107 S.Ct. at 1718 (emphasis in original). The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">Its reliability, however, may be relevant to whether the confession should (despite the lack of opportunity for cross-examination) be <em>admitted as evidence </em>against the defendant, see <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530 [106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986)]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">481 U.S. at 192-193, 107 S.Ct. at 1718-1719 (emphasis in original). The Court flatly stated, at 193-194, 107 S.Ct. at 1719:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">Of course, the defendant\u2019s confession may be considered at trial in assessing whether his codefendant\u2019s statements are supported by sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d to be directly admissible against him (assuming the \u201cunavailability\u201d of the codefendant) despite the lack of opportunity for cross-examination, see <em>Lee, </em>supra, 476 U.S. at 543-544, 106 S.Ct. at 2063-2064; <em>Bruton [v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123] at 128, n. 3, [88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) ] ... and may be considered on appeal in assessing whether any Confrontation Clause violation was harmless, see <em>Harrington v. California, </em>395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arx\">In <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539, the Court suggested that the \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d requirement is met where the hearsay statement \u201cfalls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">Admission [of a hearsay statement] under a firmly rooted hearsay exception satisfies the constitutional requirement of reliability because of the weight accorded longstanding judicial and legislative experience in assessing the trustworthiness of certain types of out-of-court statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 817, 110 S.Ct. at 3147 (citations omitted). <em>See Chapman, </em>331 Md. at 456-457, 628 A.2d 676.

In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEY\">As we have seen, the Court had made clear that the cross-corroboration of the codefendant\u2019s hearsay statement and the defendant\u2019s statement was relevant in determining whether the hearsay statement was cloaked with \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">On 27 June 1990, the Supreme Court decided <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990), which confirmed existing law with one significant exception: the use of corroborating evidence in determining the trustworthiness of certain hearsay statements. The case required the Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">to decide whether the admission at trial of certain hearsay statements made by a child declarant to an examining pediatrician violates a defendant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 808, 110 S.Ct. at 3143. In reaching its decision, the Court applied the <em>Roberts </em>approach. The trial court had found that the hearsay declarant was incapable of communicating with the jury and defense counsel agreed. The appellate court had neither questioned this finding nor discussed the general requirement of necessity. Therefore, for the purpose of decision, the Court assumed that the declarant \u201cwas an unavailable witness -within the meaning of the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>frontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 816, 110 S.Ct. at 3147. The Court then looked at the second aspect of the <em>Roberts </em>approach.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">The crux of the question presented is therefore whether the State, as the proponent of evidence presumptively barred by the hearsay rule and the Confrontation Clause, has carried its burden of proving that [the declarant\u2019s hearsay statements] bore sufficient indicia of reliability to withstand scrutiny under the Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\"><em>Id. </em>It first noted that the hearsay exception before it was not a firmly rooted one so as to satisfy the constitutional requirement of reliability without more ado. <em>Id. </em>at 817, 110 S.Ct. at 3147. Rather, the hearsay exception to be admissible had to be distinguished by \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817-820, 110 S.Ct. at 3147-3149. The Court observed that courts have considerable leeway in their consideration of appropriate factors to determine the existence of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness; it \u201cdeeline[d] to endorse a mechanical test for determining \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 under the Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822, 110 S.Ct. at 3150. The statement and the circumstances surrounding the obtaining of it, however, were factors to be considered. <em>Id. </em>at 819, 110 S.Ct. at 3148.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">To this point, the Court was in full accord with the reasoning and declarations of its prior cases. Although the Court had plainly stated before that the \u201cinterlocking\u201d of a codefendant\u2019s hearsay statement with that of a defendant\u2019s statement was a proper factor to consider in ascertaining the reliability of the hearsay statement, it announced in <em>Wright </em>that this was not so. It declared that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">\u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d must be shown from the totality of the circumstances, but we think the relevant circumstances include only those that surround the making of the statement and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">497 U.S. at 819, 110 S.Ct. at 3148. It repeated this belief at 820, 110 S.Ct. at 3149. It averred, at 822, 110 S.Ct. at 3150:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABU3\">[W]e are unpersuaded by the State\u2019s contention that evidence corroborating the truth of a hearsay statement may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>properly support a finding that the statement bears \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u201cTo be admissible under the Confrontation Clause,\u201d the Court declared,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">hearsay evidence used to convict a defendant must possess indicia of reliability by virtue of its inherent trustworthiness, not by reference to other evidence at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\"><em>Id. </em>The Court declaimed at 823, 110 S.Ct. at 3150:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">In short, the use of corroborating evidence to support a hearsay statement\u2019s \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d would permit admission of a presumptively unreliable statement by bootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial, a result we think at odds with the requirement that hearsay evidence admitted under the Confrontation Clause be so trustworthy that cross-examination of the declarant would be of marginal utility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-8\"><em>Wright </em>observed, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">[W]e think the presence of corroborating evidence more appropriately indicates that any error in admitting the statement might be harmless, rather than that any basis exists for presuming the declarant to be trustworthy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">497 U.S. at 823, 110 S.Ct. at 3150.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">We have examined over 100 cases to ascertain how the courts in other jurisdictions, both federal and state, have dealt with <em>Wright. </em>The cases are not confined to allegations of child abuse, with which <em>Wright </em>was concerned, but cover many kinds of factual situations, including the situation before us: a hearsay statement by an accomplice inculpating a defendant.

The heart of his argument that the trial court erred was that his statements and Lee\u2019s hearsay statement did not \u201cinterlock\u201d sufficiently to overcome the presumption that the hearsay statement of a jointly tried codefendant implicating a defendant is presumptively unreliable. Wilson cited to <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), <em>Cruz v. New York, </em>481 U.S. 186, 107 S.Ct. 1714, 95 L.Ed.2d 162 (1987), and <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986). The State responded by asserting that the trial court did not err because Lee\u2019s confession and Wilson\u2019s confession were substantially identical, because the circumstances surrounding Lee\u2019s confession evinced its reliability, and because any error committed was harmless. Neither Wilson nor the State made even passing reference to <em>Wright, </em>although <em>Wright </em>was decided some nine months before Lee was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The Court of Special Appeals in affirming the judgments against Wilson found the law to be well established that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">ordinarily the confession of an accomplice may not be introduced at his and another\u2019s joint trial when the confession implicates the latter in the crime as well as the former, and the former is not available for cross-examination, despite an instruction to the jury to disregard the implicating confession against the co-defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\"><em>Wilson v. State, </em>95 Md.App. at 688, 622 A.2d 810. Pointing to <em>Bruton, </em>the intermediate appellate court said that \u201c[s]uch hearsay confessions of an accomplice that incriminate defendants are presumptively unreliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Relying on the teachings of <em>Lee v. Illinois </em>and <em>Cruz, </em>the court believed, however, that the <em>Bruton </em>presumption was overcome because Lee\u2019s confession and Wilson\u2019s confession were \u201csubstantially identical in all significant aspects,\u201d and that \u201c[ijmportantly the circumstances of the actual taking of the independent confessions further demonstrate their strength and reliability.\u201d 95 Md.App. at 693-694, 622 A.2d 810. The Court of Special Appeals held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>the <em>Bruton </em>rule does not apply in the context of the matter before us. The independent circumstances surrounding the taking of the confessions, in addition to their significantly interlocking detail of material aspects, clearly evidenced sufficient indicia of reliability to rebut the presumption of unreliability of the co-defendant\u2019s confession and was properly admitted as direct evidence against [Wilson],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">95 Md.App. at 694-695, 622 A.2d 810. <em>Wright </em>did not enter into the intermediate appellate court\u2019s resolution of the question \u2014 that case was not even cited. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMnK\">In any event, even assuming that the non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession was not directly admissible against [Wilson], we believe that under the facts and circumstances of this case, wherein [Wilson\u2019s] independent confession supported the co-defendant\u2019s, the Confrontation Clause violation was harmless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 695, 622 A.2d 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The question presented to us on certiorari is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that it was proper ... for the trial court to have allowed the State to introduce as substantive evidence against [Wilson] a confession made by a non-testifying codefendant [Lee] in which [Wilson] was implicated in the crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">By the time the case reached us, Wilson\u2019s counsel had discovered <em>Wright. </em>Contending that the Court of Special Appeals erred, Wilson recognizes the <em>Bruton </em>rule of presumptive unreliability and the teachings of <em>Lee v. Illinois </em>regarding the rule. But for the first time he calls upon the dictates of <em>Wright </em>to buttress his contention that the trial court erred in admitting Lee\u2019s statement and that the Court of Special Appeals therefore erred in affirming the judgments. Wilson argues that under the restraints imposed by <em>Wright, </em>the \u201cinterlocking\u201d of Lee\u2019s statement and Wilson\u2019s statements may not be used to evaluate the reliability of Lee\u2019s statement, and that its contents plus the circumstances surrounding the ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>taining of it were not sufficient to overcome the presumption of unreliability with which the statement was burdened. In other words, whether or not Wilson\u2019s statements and Lee\u2019s statement contained \u201csignificantly interlocking detail of material aspects,\u201d <em>see Wilson, </em>95 Md.App. at 694-695, 622 A.2d 810, is irrelevant with respect to a determination whether Lee\u2019s statement was sufficiently trustworthy to overcome the weighty presumption that it was not reliable so as to justify its admission in evidence against Wilson. Wilson further urges that if the admission of Lee\u2019s statement was error, the error was not harmless because the confessions of Wilson and Lee, even though \u201csimilar in many respects,\u201d were \u201chardly identical\u201d and the State \u201curged the jury to consider the <em>combined </em>effect of the various statements in determining [Wilson\u2019s] guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The State, seeing no error, counters by asserting that the circumstances surrounding Lee\u2019s confession show sufficient indicia of reliability for its admission. It urges that the timing of the confession, its voluntariness, its exculpatory nature, and its lack of a vengeful motive provide sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant its admission. Finally, the State claims that the admission of Lee\u2019s statement, if error, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">We first observe that it is perfectly clear from the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and her closing arguments at trial, that if the jury found the confessions to be voluntary, it could consider them together as substantive evidence of the guilt of both Lee and Wilson. In other words, Lee\u2019s confession was not offered by the State only as evidence of his guilt, but also as evidence of Wilson\u2019s guilt. By the same token, Wilson\u2019s confession was offered not only as evidence of his guilt, but also as evidence of Lee\u2019s guilt. That is, each confession could be considered by the jury in conjunction with the other to establish the guilt of both defendants. Neither Lee\u2019s attorney nor Wilson\u2019s attorney contested this notion. In fact, in their closing arguments to the jury, focusing primarily on the murder charges, they obviously embraced the view that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>confessions should be so considered; they spoke in terms of each confession showing the truth of the other, establishing that neither Lee nor Wilson intended to commit murder. There was nothing in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, accepted by counsel, to suggest that the two confessions were not to be considered as an entry, and nothing that had been said by the court or counsel at the pretrial hearing to suppress the confessions suggested otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We follow the established <em>Roberts </em>approach in the light of the dictates of <em>Wright </em>to determine whether the trial judge erred in admitting Lee\u2019s statement. Wilson is entitled to a new trial if the judge was wrong and the error was not harmless; the judgments stand if the judge was right, even if for the wrong reasons. Cf. <em>Securities and Exchange Com. v. Chenery Corp., </em>818 U.S. 80, 88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943); <em>Robeson v. State, </em>285 Md. 498, 502, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1021, 100 S.Ct. 680, 62 L.Ed.2d 654 (1980); <em>Aubinoe v.

As we noted above, one way to accomplish this task is to show that the hearsay declarant is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Lee, the declarant of the hearsay statement, was an accomplice of Wilson, against whom the State sought to place the statement in evidence. The two were jointly tried, a motion for severance having been denied by the trial court. Although Lee was physically present in the courtroom, he invoked his right not to testify. As Lee was a defendant, the State could not call him as a witness. And the failure of Lee to testify did, of course, preclude the cross-examination of him by Wilson. <em>See Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 132, 88 S.Ct. at 1625-1626; <em>Douglas v.

Illinois, </em>476 U.S. at 541, 106 S.Ct. at 2062. Over the years since <em>Douglas, </em>the Court pointed out, \u201c[i]t has spoken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>with one voice in declaring <em>presumptively unreliable accomplices\u2019 confessions that incriminate defendants. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The presumption of unreliability, however, may be rebutted. <em>Id. </em>at 543, 106 S.Ct. at 2063. The rebuttal invokes the second aspect of the <em>Roberts </em>approach, namely, that the hearsay statement must bear adequate \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d to be admissible. This brings us to the crux of the question before us: has the State, as the proponent of evidence presumptively barred by the hearsay rule, carried its burden of proving that Lee\u2019s statement bore sufficient reliability to withstand scrutiny under the Confrontation Clause?</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">We emphasize that the Supreme Court has long looked with a jaundiced eye upon hearsay statements by accomplices that implicate defendants in criminal proceedings. The Court imposes a heavy burden on the proponent for admission of such a statement; the presumption of unreliability is not easily rebutted. The rebuttal is rendered even more difficult than it was <em>pre-Wright. </em>As noted above, the <em>Wri,ght </em>dictates severely restrict the factors that may be considered to determine particularized guarantees of trustworthiness; they are confined to the statement itself and to the circumstances surrounding the obtaining of that statement, without resort to any corroborative evidence, including a hearsay statement by a codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">We first observe that the voluntariness of Lee\u2019s statement is not now contested. We next note that the admissibility of the statement rested on the penal interest exception to the hearsay rule. The penal interest exception has not been accepted as a firmly established one.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Simmons v. State, </em>333 Md. 547, 557-559, 636 A.2d 463, 468-469 (1994). Thus Lee\u2019s statement was presumptively unreliable. The State then had the burden of rebutting this presumption by establishing from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>totality of the circumstances that there were sufficient indicia of reliability in accord with <em>Wright </em>to render the statement admissible. The Supreme Court, as we have seen, gave the courts considerable leeway as to the factors to be considered in showing the existence <em>vel non </em>of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, but it refused to endorse a mechanical test to be applied. We examine Lee\u2019s statement and the circumstances surrounding the obtaining of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Lee was arrested at his home early in the morning under the authority of a warrant by an array of police officers including an \u201cEST team\u201d that \u201cmade entry\u201d to the house. Detective Irvin told him that \u201c[h]e was arrested for murder.\u201d The police took him to the Criminal Investigations Division where he was handcuffed to a wall of a six foot by eight foot interview room. The interrogation was neither taped nor taken down by a stenographer. Inside the interview room, Lee was alone except for Irvin, one of the officers who had arrested him less than an hour before. It was in this setting that the detective drew from Lee the incriminating words the State eventually used against Wilson, who was arrested that same day in Virginia by other law enforcement authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Irvin asked Lee about the murder and \u201cverbally he told me, and then I asked him to write a statement which he did.\u201d Then the detective posed some 20 specific questions \u201c[t]o clarify some of the things in the statement and to also make the statement more to the fact as to what happened.\u201d Irvin would \u201ctype in the question and [Lee] would give me an answer which I would type.\u201d By no stretch of the imagination was the statement an outburst or a spontaneous explanation of events;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it was the product of a deliberate and particularized police interrogation. Lee incriminated his cohort by asserting that Wilson supplied the murder weapon and the bullets, turned the gun over to Weston to rob a dope dealer and was present when Johnson was shot. And Lee\u2019s recounting of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>events surrounding the shooting of Johnson tended to show that Wilson had also committed the crimes of felony murder, attempted robbery, conspiracy to rob and accessory after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">It is apparent that Lee had a motive to lie. He would naturally want to deflect blame for the murder from himself, so he told police that Weston was the trigger man and that he had nothing to do with the shooting. \u201cI could not believe he had done that,\u201d Lee claimed. Later he added that he had asked Weston why he had shot Johnson but Weston gave no reason. A \u201creality of the criminal process,\u201d the Supreme Court noted in <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7P\">that once partners in a crime recognize that the \u201cjig is up,\u201d they tend to lose any identity of interest and immediately become antagonists, rather than accomplices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">476 U.S. at 544-545, 106 S.Ct. at 2064. \u201cTaking on the full blame for a minor role in an offense ... does little to demonstrate trustworthiness because the declarant still has the motive to shift the blame to others so as to receive a lesser penalty.\u201d <em>United States v. Flores, </em>985 F.2d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Lee\u2019s character, as revealed by his own words, also made his statement suspect. They showed that he was not averse to engaging in criminal conduct. He admitted that he had freely joined Wilson and Weston to rob drug dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">From our perusal of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the obtaining of Lee\u2019s statement, in light of <em>Wright, </em>we are by no means content that the State overcame the jealously guarded presumption that the statement was untrustworthy. We believe that those circumstances did not show sufficiently that there were present the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness required to make the statement admissible. In short, the statement was not reliable. We hold that the trial court erred in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Our final inquiry is whether the error was harmless. As noted <em>supra, Wright </em>indicated that the interlocking nature of a declarant\u2019s hearsay statement and a defendant\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>ment may be considered in determining whether any error in admitting the hearsay statement might be harmless. 497 U.S. at 823, 110 S.Ct. at 3150. But even so, we believe that the erroneous admission of Lee\u2019s statement was not harmless. The harmless error rule we adopted in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976) is more demanding than the prejudicial error test in civil cases. <em>See id. </em>at 659, n. 15, 350 A.2d 665. We concluded in <em>Dorsey:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, </em>such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 659, 350 A.2d 665 (emphasis added). We stressed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVq\">Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is <em>no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014 </em>whether erroneously admitted or <em>excluded </em>\u2014 may <em>have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Lee\u2019s statement and Wilson\u2019s statements were the heart of the State\u2019s case. There was no other evidence legally sufficient to establish Wilson\u2019s guilt of any of the crimes charged. On our independent review of the record, we find that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in observing that Wilson\u2019s statements and Lee\u2019s statement were substantially alike in all significant aspects. The statements \u201cinterlocked\u201d and cross-corroborated each other; the discrepancies in them were not substantial; the differences in them were no more than irrelevant and trivial. Although Wilson\u2019s statements as well as Lee\u2019s statement tended to exculpate Wilson with respect to the murder, they showed that Wilson committed the other crimes charged, including conspiracy and accessory after the fact, the offenses of which he was convicted. Thus Wilson\u2019s own statement to the effect that he had committed crimes other than the murder was corroborated and strongly buttressed by Lee\u2019s statement. In those circumstances, with Lee\u2019s statement before the jury as substantive evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>against Wilson, we are unable to declare a belief, \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt, that the error [in admitting Lee\u2019s statement] in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d And we are not satisfied that \u201cthere is no reasonable possibility that [Lee\u2019s statement] ... may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict[s].\u201d We conclude that the erroneous admission of Lee\u2019s statement was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We hold that the trial court erred in permitting Lee\u2019s statement to be placed in evidence. It follows that the Court of Special Appeals was wrong in affirming the judgments entered by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. We reverse its judgment. Wilson is entitled to a new trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\n<em>CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTION TO VACATE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGES COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\n<em>COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGES COUNTY.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Dissenting Opinion by RODOWSKY, J., in which McAULIFFE and KARWACKI, JJ., join.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\">.

The error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, even if the error were not harmless, this Court should not rule now that \u201cLee\u2019s statement would be inadmissible\u201d on the retrial of Wilson. 334 Md. 313, 339 n. 10, 639 A.2d 125, 138 n. 10 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Under all of the evidence, it was undisputed that Weston was the shooter, that Lee furnished the car and was the driver, and that Wilson furnished the handgun. The general object of the joint enterprise, robbing one or more drug dealers, led Wilson to furnish the handgun on the night of the murder. Wilson gave one oral and three written confessions that acknowledged the undisputed facts. Wilson\u2019s defense strategy was to convince the jury that Weston and the murder victim became involved in a personal altercation, distinct from any attempted robbery, and Wilson used Lee\u2019s statement to support that argument. The majority unreservedly acknowledges \u201cthat Wilson\u2019s statements and Lee\u2019s statement were substantially alike in all significant aspects.\u201d 334 Md. at 338, 639 A.2d at 137. Wilson\u2019s strategy was successful in that the jury acquitted him of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Wilson did not seek a severance from trial with Lee under <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). Lee did seek a severance, but only if his motion in limine were denied. Wilson\u2019s oral statement referred to Weston\u2019s having fired the handgun at some person, other than the victim, earlier during the night of the murder. Lee sought a ruling from the trial court excluding that aspect of Wilson\u2019s oral statement, and the motion was granted. Consequently, Lee and Wilson went to trial jointly. Neither defendant sought to have the statement of his codefendant excluded at their joint trial as substantively inadmissible against the defendant. <em>See Cruz v. New York, </em>481 U.S. 186, 107 S.Ct. 1714, 95 L.Ed.2d 162 (1987). Both Lee and Wilson waived their <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Cruz </em>rights for the obvious reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>that each wanted to rely on his own statement, and on that of his codefendant, without testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Of the three youths involved in the murder, Wilson was the last to be arrested. Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland homicide detectives had faxed a copy of the arrest warrant for Wilson to the authorities in Brunswick County, Virginia where Wilson was a student at St. Paul\u2019s College. Special Agent Douglas W. Reardon of the Virginia State Police went to the dean of the college who had Wilson \u201cbrought\u201d to the dean\u2019s office. Wilson arrived with a hamburger sandwich and a large drink which he consumed during the interview by Reardon. In the dean\u2019s office Wilson signed a statement that in part read: \u201cThe man that got shot said T am the bad[d]est guy around\u2019 and Anthony [Weston] said \u2018No I am.\u2019 Anthony pulled the gun and the man smacked the gun away and then Anthony shot him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Special Agent Reardon arrested Wilson and took him to the Brunswick County Sheriffs Office. There, unshackled and seated at one of the desks in the open office area used by the deputies, Wilson gave and signed a second written statement. In that second statement Wilson said that \u201cAnthony pulled the gun and shot the man for no reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">While Wilson and Reardon were conversing, awaiting the arrival of a Prince George\u2019s County detective, Wilson orally told Reardon that Weston and Lee were interested in robbing drug dealers to get the drugs, but Wilson was interested only in getting the money. That portion of the oral statement was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">When Detective Daniel Smart, the principal Prince George\u2019s County homicide detective on the subject murder investigation, arrived at the Brunswick County Sheriffs Office, he took the third written statement from Wilson. By that time Prince George\u2019s County police officers had obtained a search warrant for the home of Wilson and his parents and seized the handgun used in the murder. That weapon, as described by Lee in his statement, was a \u201c.38 special with D.C. cop written all over it.\u201d It was introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>In his written confession to Detective Smart, Wilson said that Weston shot the victim because \u201c[t]hey got into an argument. It was a macho thing. He [the victim] reached out and hit the gun while Anthony had it on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Lee\u2019s statement described the victim as saying, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m the biggest hustler around here.\u2019 \u201d It continued, \u201cAnd Anthony said, \u2018No, you\u2019re not. I am.\u2019 The whole time the gun was at his head. At first the guy hit the gun away and then Anthony shot the guy----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Even if a defendant\u2019s own, fully-interlocking statement is the type of corroborating evidence that may not be considered under <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990), <em>Wright </em>recognizes that \u201cthe presence of corroborating evidence more appropriately indicates that any error in admitting the statement might be harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 823, 110 S.Ct. at 3150. Here the majority gives no explanation, in terms of the facts of this case, for rejecting harmless error. This is not a case in which a codefendant attempted to shift blame to the defendant or to minimize the codefendant\u2019s involvement by increasing the defendant\u2019s involvement. The majority\u2019s harmless error analysis gives no effect to the fact that Wilson embraced Lee\u2019s statement. Thus, we have here erroneously admitted evidence that is not merely cumulative, but it was relied on by Wilson as part of Wilson\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">This is forcefully demonstrated by the final argument of Wilson\u2019s counsel. After submitting to the jury that Lee had said that Weston \u201chad an argument with this individual and shot him,\u201d Wilson\u2019s counsel further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\u201cNow, we wouldn\u2019t have to be here today if both of them [Lee and Wilson] would have said that we intended to rob this victim, but before Mr. Weston could rob him he shot him, because it would have been a closed case. So now we have to determine whether or not the veracity of these statements can be relied upon. You have heard the instructions that you can believe what you want to of these statements and what you don\u2019t want to of these statements. I submit to you that both of these individuals were telling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the truth completely. They had no communication with each other. ... Mr. Lee was arrested at 8:00 o\u2019clock in the morning in Prince George\u2019s County and Mr. Wilson was arrested at 5:00 o\u2019clock in the evening at a remote location in Virginia.... If you\u2019re going to believe that they contrived the actual incident then you\u2019re going to have to believe that these statements are untrue. But, all the evidence points to the fact that they told the truth, that what happened that night[ \u2014 ]Mr. Weston got into an altercation with an individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Justice White, speaking for four dissenting Justices in <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991), has said that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s confession is \u2018probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, 111 S.Ct. at 1255 (quoting <em>Cruz v. New York, </em>481 U.S. at 195, 107 S.Ct. at 1720 (White, J., dissenting)). Nevertheless, <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>held that the admission of an involuntary confession is not <em>per se </em>beyond the pale of a harmless error analysis under <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). <em>Chapman </em>is the basis for <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). Wilson\u2019s four confessions, reinforced by the seizure of the murder weapon, are simply corroborated and confirmed by Lee\u2019s cumulative statement. The error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Harrington v. California, </em>395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969) (erroneously admitting codefendants\u2019 cumulative statements held to be harmless); <em>Evans v. State, </em>333 Md. 660, 716, 637 A.2d 117, 145 (1994) (claimed violation in capital case of right against self-incrimination held to be harmless error) [No. 149, Sept. Term, 1992, decided February 16, 1994, slip op. at 23].</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Even if the admission of Lee\u2019s statement is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court, for two reasons, should not preclude the State from undertaking to prove on retrial the circumstances surrounding Lee\u2019s statement. First, because there was not a whisper in the trial court that <em>Wright </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>blocked the admissibility of Lee\u2019s statement, the State never had the opportunity to prove circumstances of reliability. The State\u2019s foundation for admitting the Lee statement established, and was limited to, <em>Miranda </em>compliance and voluntariness. Secondly, there is substantial reason to believe that proof addressed to the circumstances surrounding Lee\u2019s statement would demonstrate its reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">When the State introduced Lee\u2019s statement, Lee\u2019s attorney objected. The objection went to one sentence in the narrative portion of the statement written in Lee\u2019s own hand. After saying that Weston, Wilson and he had gone out in Lee\u2019s father\u2019s gold Honda and that Wilson had Wilson\u2019s father\u2019s District of Columbia police officer\u2019s revolver, Lee said, \u201cWe were going to rob a dope dealer.\u201d Lee\u2019s counsel argued that the quoted sentence was proof of other crimes which should be excised. That objection was overruled. Lee\u2019s counsel then requested a special instruction cautioning the jurors not to speculate that the victim of the shooting was a dope dealer whom the three youths intended to rob. That request was denied. All of this was entirely consistent with the joint defense strategy of seeking to avoid a conviction for felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Near the conclusion of the foregoing bench conference, Wilson\u2019s counsel said, \u201cI would like to go on the record also objecting to the statement being admitted into evidence.\u201d The court asked, \u201cYou\u2019re objecting to what?\u201d Wilson\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cThe statement, because it hurts my client also.\u201d The fact that evidence offered against an accused tends to prove guilt of the crime charged has not been recognized as an objection that renders the evidence inadmissible. Further, judicial review of an objection ordinarily is limited to the reason given for the objection. <em>See Thomas v.

Illinois </em>raised an issue that had not been preserved. The Court of Special Appeals considered the confrontation issue by applying <em>Lee </em>and without citing <em>Wright. Wilson v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 680, 622 A.2d 810 (1993). Wilson\u2019s petition for certiorari to this Court did not cite <em>Wright. </em>The decision was first cited by Wilson in his brief on the merits in this Court. In short, the State has never had an opportunity to present the facts surrounding Lee\u2019s statement in support of its reliability under <em>Wright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">This Court\u2019s foreclosure of that inquiry on remand is particularly inappropriate because there is a strong indication that reliability under <em>Wright </em>could be proved. Proof relevant to reliability is not limited to evidence that is admissible before the jury. Whether a foundation for admitting the statement has been established is a mixed question of fact and law for the trial judge to decide, subject to independent, appellate, constitutional review.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">One of the indicia of reliability which the <em>Wright </em>Court identified as properly considered in determining reliability is the absence of a motive to fabricate. 497 U.S. at 821-22, 110 S.Ct. at 3150. If Lee were motivated to lie, it would only be because he and Wilson in some way had colluded to cast the principal blame on Weston. But the majority tells us nothing about Weston\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Weston had been tried previously before a jury presided over by the same trial judge who in April 1991 presided over the joint jury trial of Lee and Wilson. Weston was found guilty of felony murder. The unreported opinion of the Court of Special Appeals in Weston\u2019s appeal from that conviction reflects that Weston</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">\u201cconfessed to the police and to a witness, Daryl Shropshire, that he and two Mends had gone to the scene of the crime in order to rob drug dealers. [Weston] admitted that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>shot the victim with a .38 caliber weapon when the victim had \u2018bucked on him.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">It further appears from the Statement of Charges filed against Wilson, from the affidavit in the search warrant for the Wilson family premises, and from the pre-sentence investigation report that the police were led initially to Weston and Lee, and then to Wilson. More specifically, the above-mentioned sources indicate the following sequence of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The victim\u2019s body was found at 6:30 a.m. on January 6,1990. Shortly thereafter Weston admitted to an informant that he had shot the victim. On January 9 the informant telephoned the \u201cCrime Solvers\u201d telephone number of the Prince George\u2019s County police and implicated Weston as the shooter. That informant identified himself or herself. Subsequently, when interviewed, the informant confirmed Weston\u2019s admission against penal interest and identified Weston from a photo array. By January 10 Weston and Lee had been identified as two of the three suspects in the case. Warrants were issued for the arrest of Weston and Lee on January 10. Both were arrested on January 11, and both admitted involvement in the murder. Both identified Wilson as the third participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Lee was arrested at 8:07 a.m. on January 11. After signing a written waiver of rights, Lee began giving his written statement at 8:55 a.m. and concluded it by 10:00 a.m. In that statement Lee also admitted having told his girlfriend, prior to his arrest, about the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">The statement of charges for Wilson was obtained at 10:30 a.m. on January 11. Special Agent Reardon began his interview of Wilson in the dean\u2019s office at St. Paul\u2019s College in Virginia at 5:30 p.m. that same day. At 7:08 p.m. on January 11, the search warrant for the Wilson family home was executed in Capitol Heights, Maryland, and the Washington Metropolitan Police Department service revolver used in the killing was seized. At 8:00 p.m. Detective Smart of Prince George\u2019s County obtained in Virginia the fourth confession from Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Thus, the jury argument that Wilson\u2019s counsel made about the reliability of the Lee and Wilson statements has considerable legal merit. Any motive that Lee would have to lie about the extent of Wilson\u2019s participation, said by Lee to be equal with his own, would not likely falsely inculpate Wilson at the expense of falsely inculpating Lee as well. Further, because the Lee statement is in tandem with the four Wilson statements, any unreliability of the Wilson and Lee statements must lie in their falsifying Weston\u2019s participation, but it appears from Weston\u2019s statement that they do not falsify his participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">What we do not know from court records on this joint indictment is whether Weston was arrested prior to Lee and whether Weston confessed prior to Lee\u2019s confessing. If that is the fact of the matter, as it may well be, it is highly relevant, not because Weston\u2019s statement corroborates Lee\u2019s, but because Lee then has no motive falsely to inculpate Weston or Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The State should be permitted the opportunity on remand to demonstrate reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Judges McAuliffe and Karwacki have authorized me to state that they join in the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
