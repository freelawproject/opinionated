Phoenix Assurance Co., 259 </em>Md. 564, 570, 270 A.2d 476 (1970), quoting <em>Brown v. Fraley, 222 </em>Md. 480, 483, 161 A.2d 128 (1960). We reminded in <em>Noble v. State, 293 </em>Md. 549, 557, 446 A.2d 844 (1982) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">[t]his Court has firmly adhered to the principle that the rules of procedure are precise rubrics to be strictly followed, and we shall continue to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We proclaimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">A violation of one of these rules constitutes error, normally requiring such curative action or sanction as may be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Maryland Rule 4-326(c) concerns communications with the jury. It commands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">The court shall notify the defendant and the State\u2019s Attorney of the receipt of any communication from the jury pertaining to the action before responding to the communication. All such communications between the court and the jury shall be on the record in open court or shall be in writing and filed in the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Maryland Rule 4-231(b) concerns the right of a defendant to be present in a criminal action. It declares, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-12\">A defendant is entitled to be present at ... every stage of the trial....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">Subsections (1), (2), and (3) list exceptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-14\">(1) at a conference or argument on a question of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-15\">(2) when a nolle prosequi or stet is entered ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-16\">(3) at a reduction of sentence----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-17\">Section (c) speaks to waiver of the right. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-18\">The right to be present under section (b) of this Rule is waived by a defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>(1) who is voluntarily absent after the proceeding has commenced, whether or not informed by the court of the right to remain; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\">(2) who engages in conduct that justifies exclusion from the courtroom, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">(3) who, personally or through counsel, agrees to or acquiesces in being absent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County presiding at the jury trial of Nathaniel Antonio Stewart, who was charged with robbery with a deadly weapon and related offenses, violated both of these rules. His error in not abiding by them came about in this manner. The evidentiary phase of the trial had concluded and the jury retired to deliberate its verdicts. The jury had not returned when the court clerk informed the judge that \u201cthere was a problem\u201d with one of the jurors. The judge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">went to the jury room and was handed a note signed by Sandra Rubin, one of the jurors, that said I need to talk to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">According to the judge, he \u2018Vas reluctant to talk with her at all.\u201d But, he explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">[apparently she was upset and tearful so I asked her to come out of the jury room and she stood just out the jury room door and said that she [was] nervous and upset and afraid she was going to say something she shouldn\u2019t say to one of the other jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">The judge told her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">Well, I don\u2019t want to know why you feel you can\u2019t say something to another juror. If there is disagreement you have to use your conscience about how you handle disagreements when you are discussing the case among yourselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJu\">\u201cFrom her comments and from her attitude it seemed apparent [to the-judge] there was a division of opinion among the jurors.\u201d So the judge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>asked her to go back and continue deliberating and exercise her best judgment as to how her duty should be discharged. She agreed to do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The jury resumed its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">When the jury had been out about four hours, the forelady sent a note to the judge asking, \u201cDoes a hung jury mean he goes free for this crime?\u201d At this point, the judge realized that he had been remiss in his encounter with the juror. He told Stewart and counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">There have been a couple matters that have occurred since we broke and the \u2014 the jury began deliberation I think we should discuss here on the record and in the presence of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The judge recounted the circumstances of the matter involving Rubin as he recalled them, and explained how he had handled the situation. He informed the defendant and counsel of the forelady\u2019s question and stated that he would have to answer it. Defense counsel said that she would prefer to address the Rubin matter first. She said that she would like the record to reflect that she was in the courtroom when, about a half hour before, Rubin asked to see the judge \u2014 \u201cI was staying here most of the deliberation.\u201d Defense counsel pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">I was standing in the courtroom when I heard someone yelling and crying. I don\u2019t mean to dispute with you, Your Honor, I think your description as \u201cupset\u201d and tearful\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiV\">The judge interrupted, \u201cPerhaps a little conservative.\u201d Defense counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">She came out and she was audibly sobbing and crying to the point where some of the Court personnel in other chambers came out to see. Clearly she asked to see you. You came. I, for the record, no question in speaking to the jury in that context, however, as soon as you finished I did approach you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">The judge agreed that she did. Defendant\u2019s counsel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-12\">I asked to go on the record for a mistrial for the purposes that I believe that the personalities involved among the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>jurors had deteriorated to such a point that one juror is visibly upset, sobbing and crying. I do not wish \u2014 I think that there comes a point where the resolution of this matter is not possible when you have jurors this upset. I don\u2019t know which way she is. I don\u2019t think any of us know which way the split is or anything like that, but because of the conduct of the jurors, because of her coming out of the room speaking to the Court, I would at this time ask for a mistrial based on manifest necessity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The judge replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">I will hold [the motion for a mistrial] under advisement, consider the possibility of granting it depending on further development.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">It was not long thereafter that the jury rendered its verdicts. Stewart was convicted of robbery with a deadly weapon, robbery, and the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. The jury was polled; the verdicts stood. The State announced that it was seeking enhanced punishment in view of Stewart\u2019s status as \u201ca three time loser.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 643B(c). Defense counsel requested a pre-sentence investigation; the judge granted the request. At this point, the judge ruled on defense counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial. He said without elaboration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Incidentally, with respect to the defense motion for mistrial, I did reserve on that motion. I have thought about it further, I\u2019m going to deny the motion for mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">About three and a half months later the sentencing phase of the case was reached. In the meantime, Stewart had filed a motion for a new trial alleging numerous errors, one of which was, \u201cThe verdict resulted from misconduct of the jurors.\u201d The motion was argued on the day of sentencing. Counsel for Stewart noted that the trial judge \u201chad essentially a private conversation with\u201d Rubin and that telling her to go back and rejoin the deliberations was tantamount to \u201ccoercing a verdict____\u201d The motion for a new trial was denied. Sentences were duly imposed. Stewart appealed from the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments in <em>Stewart v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 770. One of the questions Stewart presented to the intermediate appellate court was whether the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial. The Court of Special Appeals noted that the reason advanced by Stewart\u2019s trial counsel for the grant of a mistrial was \u201cbased on manifest necessity.\u201d <em>Id., </em>slip opinion at 2. Stewart\u2019s counsel on appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, however, looked to Rule 4-326(c). But, the Court of Special Appeals observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">[Stewart] now complains that the court improperly communicated with the juror [, Rubin,] and that sending her back to deliberate was a coercive measure. The arguments [Stewart] presents to us, therefore, are somewhat different arguments than those he advanced before the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APs\"><em>Id. </em>Nevertheless the court asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">We shall address the issue as if it had been properly preserved; [Stewart] still does not prevail. Whether to grant a mistrial is a decision vested in the sound discretion of the trial judge, who can best weigh the danger of prejudice arising from any alleged impropriety within the context of the entire case, and who is, therefore, in the best position to determine if a mistrial is warranted. <em>See Hunt </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 422[, 583 A.2d 218] (1990), <em>cert. denied </em>[\u2014 U.S.-], 112 S.Ct. 117, [116 L.Ed.2d 86] (1991). We will not reverse a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial unless the accused was so clearly prejudiced that the denial constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>Hunt, supra </em>[321 Md.], at 422 [583 A.2d 218].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ8\"><em>Id., </em>at 2-3. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">Since we are not persuaded that the court\u2019s advice to the distraught juror to use her \u201cconscience\u201d and \u201cbest judgment\u201d in coping with her fellow juror prejudiced the accused, we perceive neither error nor abuse of discretion in denying the motion for mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">We granted Stewart\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. The only question presented to us by his petition was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">Did the lower court err in denying petitioner\u2019s Motion for Mistrial where the court communicated with and sent an emotionally distraught juror back into the jury room to continue deliberations without first communicating with counsel?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">Stewart had different counsel representing him at each stage of the case. As we have seen, trial counsel relied on \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d as reason for a mistrial. Counsel on direct appeal looked to Rule 4-326(c) (Communications With Jury). Counsel on our grant of certiorari adhered to Rule 4-326(c). Now we add Rule 4-231 (Presence of Defendant) to the pot. Rule 8-131(a) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-15\">Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any ... issue [other than the issues of jurisdiction over the subject matter or over a person] unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>guide the trial court or to avoid the <em>expense </em>and <em>delay </em>of another appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The word \u201cordinarily\u201d gives us discretion to consider <em>issues </em>not raised or decided below. <em>See State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 113, 638 A.2d 107 (1994); <em>Crown Oil v. Glen, </em>320 Md. 546, 561, 578 A.2d 1184 (1990); <em>Taub v. State, </em>296 Md. 439, 441-442, 463 A.2d 819 (1983), and cases therein cited. We exercise our discretion here to determine the propriety of the denial of the motion for a mistrial on the basis of Rules 4-326(c) and 4-231 even though those Rules were not relied on by \u2014 or argued before \u2014 the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">As we have seen, Rule 4-326(c) concerns \u201cthe receipt of any communication from the jury pertaining to the action ____\u201d The court is obliged to notify the defendant and the State\u2019s Attorney of the receipt of such communication <em>before </em>responding to it. \u201cAll such communications between the court and jury <em>shall </em>be on the record in open court or <em>shall </em>be in writing and filed in the action\u201d (emphasis added). These prescriptions are mandatory, not directory, but the trial judge disregarded every command of the Rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The Court of Special Appeals explored Rule 4-326(c) in <em>Allen v. State, </em>77 Md.App. 537, 551 A.2d 156, <em>cert. denied, </em>315 Md. 692, 556 A.2d 674 (1989). The intermediate appellate court held that the Rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>requires full communication of the contents of a jury communication so that both parties can have input into the response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><em>Id. </em>77 Md.App. at 545, 551 A.2d 156. The court quoted from its <em>Smith v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 603, 624, 505 A.2d 564, <em>cert. denied, </em>306 Md. 371, 509 A.2d 134 (1986) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201c[wjhile the rule expressly requires notice to the parties of any communication from the jury, its very spirit is to provide an opportunity for input in designing an appropriate response to each question in order to assure fairness and avoid error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\"><em>Allen, </em>77 Md.App. at 545, 551 A.2d 156. In <em>Graham v. State, </em>325 Md. 398, 415, 601 A.2d 131 (1992), we agreed with <em>Allen </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">the spirit of the Rule is to provide relevant information to those most vitally concerned with the trial....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">But we tempered the averment in <em>Allen, </em>77 Md.App. at 545, 551 A.2d 156, that the Rule always required \u201cfull communication of the contents of a jury communication.... \u201d We noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">there may be occasions when at least a part of a communication from a jury may properly be withheld from the parties and/or from the public record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-11\"><em>Graham, </em>325 Md. at 415, 601 A.2d 131 (citation omitted). We pointed out that the Rule relates to communications \u201cpertaining to the action,\u201d and we suggested, for example, \u201cthat the failure to disclose the contents of a note from a jury requesting transmittal of a purely personal message to a member of the juror\u2019s family or to a babysitter\u201d would not constitute error. <em>Id. </em>We recognized in <em>Graham, </em>moreover, that in certain circumstances, a violation of the Rule may not require reversal because the issue was not preserved for appeal or was harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">The communication between Rubin and the trial judge surely \u201cpertained to the action;\u201d it was during the course of a vital part of the trial. A juror\u2019s reluctance to continue to deliberate with the other jurors and separating from the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>jurors by leaving the jury room cannot be divorced from the action. There is no question that the ex parte meeting between the judge and the juror was an erroneous procedure. But that did not stand alone. Stewart was not present during this discourse between the juror and the judge. He was in the lockup awaiting the return of the jury. He was not informed at that time of the communication from the juror and the judge\u2019s response thereto. The prosecutor was not timely notified, nor was defense counsel. The communication between the judge and the juror was not on the record in open court or in writing and filed in the action contemporaneously with its occurrence. It is clear that the failure of the trial judge to obey the commands of Rule 4-326(e) constituted error. Before us, the State conceded that there was at least a \u201ctechnical violation\u201d of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">We have explored in a number of cases a defendant\u2019s entitlement to be present at every stage of his trial as guaranteed by Rule 4-231. <em>See, </em>for example, <em>Noble v. State, </em>293 Md. at 557-558, 446 A.2d 844; <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 211-212, 438 A.2d 1301 (1981); <em>Porter v. State, </em>289 Md. 349, 353-356, 424 A.2d 371 (1981); <em>Hughes v. State, </em>288 Md. 216, 221-227, 421 A.2d 69 (1980); <em>Bunch v. State, </em>281 Md. 680, 683-688, 381 A.2d 1142 (1978) and cases therein cited; <em>Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. 26, 36-38, 139 A.2d 209 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Maryland has long recognized the common law right of a defendant to be present at trial. <em>See Hughes v. State, </em>288 Md. at 221, 421 A.2d 69. We said in <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. at 211, 438 A.2d 1301 (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">As we have often pointed out, a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at every stage of his trial is a common law right, is to some extent protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and is guaranteed by Maryland Rule 724 [now Maryland Rule 4-231].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcCd\">Any communication pertaining to the action between the jury and the trial judge during the course of the jury\u2019s delibera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>tions is a stage of the trial entitling the defendant to be present. <em>See Bunch v. State, </em>281 Md. at 685, 381 A.2d 1142; <em>Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. at 36-37, 139 A.2d 209. The right is deemed \u201cabsolute,\u201d and a judgment of conviction ordinarily cannot be upheld if the record discloses a violation of the right. <em>See Porter v. State, </em>289 Md. at 352-353, 424 A.2d 371. It is clear that the judge\u2019s failure to obtain Stewart\u2019s presence at his encounter with the juror, Rubin, was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The close alliance between Rule 4-326(c) and Rule 4-231 is apparent. So it is that an error with respect to them may be excused when the error is waived, and any error may be defanged if it is harmless. In either case, reversal would not be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Until <em>Williams, </em>292 Md. 201, 438 A.2d 1301, was decided, we consistently held that \u201cthe right to be present is personal to the accused and cannot be waived by his counsel.\u201d <em>Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. at 37, 139 A.2d 209, quoted in <em>Williams, </em>292 Md. at 214, 438 A.2d 1301. <em>See Porter, </em>289 Md. at 353, 424 A.2d 371; <em>Hughes, </em>288 Md. at 223, 421 A.2d 69 and cases cited therein; <em>Bunch, </em>281 Md. at 688, 381 A.2d 1142. In <em>Williams, </em>we took a fresh look at the common law. It was our judgment that the Maryland common law principle</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKH\">that the right to be present at every stage of the trial can never be waived by counsel\u2019s action or inaction, should now be modified in light of present conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">292 Md. at 217, 438 A.2d 1301. We acknowledged that \u201c[w]hile the role of counsel in criminal cases has been generally the same over the past two hundred years, nevertheless there have been some significant changes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">When many of our earlier cases involving waiver of the right to be present were decided, there was no right to counsel, including state-furnished counsel to indigents, in many criminal cases presenting the possibility of incarcera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>tion. Now, however, we do recognize such right under the Sixth Amendment and under Art. 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, implemented by the Public Defender Act....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 217-218, 438 A.2d 1301 (citations omitted). We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">Today, with the complexity of many criminal trials and the absolute right of counsel if there is a danger of incarceration, our system proceeds upon the assumption that it is primarily counsel\u2019s function to assent or waive most \u201crights\u201d of the defendant. Unless a defendant speaks out, normally he must be bound by the trial decisions, actions and inactions of counsel. Otherwise, the system simply would not work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 218, 438 A.2d 1301 (citations omitted). We noted an important limitation in our change in the common law, namely, when a violation of the right to be present is also a violation of the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and of Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Then there must be an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 219, 438 A.2d 1301. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">With respect to all criminal trials, or parts of trials, taking place after the issuance of our mandate in this case, an effective waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to be present at every stage of the trial will not always require a personal waiver by the defendant. Where the right of confrontation is not implicated, and where there is involved no other right requiring intelligent and knowing action by the defendant himself for an effective waiver, a defendant will ordinarily be bound by the action or inaction of his attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\"><em>Id. </em>We emphasized, however, that our change in the common law affected only the <em>waiver </em>of the right to be present at all stages of the trial; it did not affect the right itself. <em>Id. See Noble v. State, </em>293 Md. at 554-556, 446 A.2d 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">In the case at hand, it is perfectly clear that Stewart did not waive his right to be present at the encounter between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>judge and the juror. He had no opportunity to object when the error was committed; he was in the lockup awaiting the jury\u2019s return to deliver its verdicts. The exceptions to the right to be present spelled out in Rule 4-231(b)(l)(2) and (3) were not applicable, and he was not within the ambit of what constituted waivers set out in \u00a7 c of the Rule. He was not even informed of the incident until well after it had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Inasmuch as the right to be present at a communication with the jury was not a constitutional right requiring intelligent and knowing action by Stewart himself, he could have been bound if there was a waiver by his counsel. But it is certain that Stewart\u2019s counsel did not waive his right to be present. She demanded a mistrial when she first approached the judge upon Rubin\u2019s return to the jury room, and again when the judge convened the defendant and counsel upon receiving the forelady\u2019s note. When the judge described his encounter with the juror, Rubin, defense counsel\u2019s position was that it was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d to grant a mistrial. And the record amply indicated a <em>manifest, </em>that is, as the Court said in <em>State v. Crutchfield, </em>318 Md. at 207, 567 A.2d 449,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">palpable, evident, obvious, clear, plain, or patent, necessity for the trial judge to have aborted the trial----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-8\"><em>Cf. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>438 U.S. 422, 459-462, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 2884-86, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978); <em>Rogers v. United States, </em>422 U.S. 35, 40-41, 95 S.Ct. 2091, 45 L.Ed.2d 1 (1975). The <em>manifest </em>necessity, of course, was the judge\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 4-326(c) and Rule 4-231. Unless there is an effective waiver of the right to be present at every stage of the trial bestowed by Rule 4-231, a violation of the Rule is error that ordinarily results in granting a new trial. <em>Noble v. State, </em>293 Md. at 557-558, 446 A.2d 844. We hold that there was not an effective waiver of Stewart\u2019s right to be present when the juror communicated with the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">We declared in <em>Noble, </em>293 Md. at 568-69, 446 A.2d 844:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the harmless error principle is fully applicable to a defendant\u2019s right to be present during a stage of the trial. Prejudice will not be conclusively presumed. If the record demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the denial of the right could not have prejudiced the defendant, the error will not result in a reversal of his conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We defined the harmless error principle henceforth to be followed by us in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976) (footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7c\">We discussed <em>Dorsey </em>in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>325 Md. 511, 520, 601 A.2d 1093 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">In <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976) we adopted a test to determine whether an error in criminal causes is harmless or prejudicial. We went beyond constitutional dictates. We saw</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">no sound reason for drawing a distinction between the treatment of those errors which are of constitutional dimension and those other evidentiary, or procedural, errors which may have been committed during a trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4_\">(quoting <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 657, 350 A.2d 665.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">We believe that the record here demonstrates that Stewart was prejudiced by the judge\u2019s errors. The eleven other jurors, who remained in the jury room when Rubin stalked out \u201caudibly sobbing and crying\u201d were not made aware on the record of what occurred while Rubin was out of their presence. We, of course, do not know what Rubin said to the other jurors when she returned, or how she explained her actions, and we do not know how the remainder of the panel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>reacted to her conduct. The judge expressed a belief that the jury was divided, but we have no way to ascertain which side Rubin was on. Furthermore, Stewart\u2019s absence at the meeting between the judge and Rubin precluded him from having \u201cinput\u201d in the judge\u2019s response to the juror\u2019s conduct. Stewart may have had other suggestions as to how the situation could be handled, for example that the trial be continued upon agreement with eleven jurors. No matter how innocent the motives of the judge may have been, and no matter what may have actually been said to the juror (the conversation here was not recorded), the mere opportunity for improper influence in Stewart\u2019s absence prejudiced him. Stewart was denied the chance to evaluate the distress of the juror and the judge\u2019s solution to the problem and make such objection and suggestions as he deemed to be advisable. It may be that what the judge said to the juror was no more than a repetition of a part of his instructions to the entire panel before the jury retired. Even so, Stewart was entitled to be present. <em>See Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. at 36, 139 A.2d 209. It was clearly prejudicial for the judge to further instruct one juror rather than the entire panel. We are aware of no authority that authorizes a judge to instruct or give additional instructions to other than the entire panel duly assembled in the presence of the defendant and his counsel pursuant to the dictates of Rule 4-326(c) and Rule 4-231. <em>See </em>Rule 4-325 (Instructions to the Jury). Further, the substance of the judge\u2019s conversation with the juror, as described by the judge, prevents the error from being harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Surely, the trial judge\u2019s motive in urging the recalcitrant juror to \u201cgo back and continue deliberating and exercise her best judgment as to how her duty should be discharged\u201d was to obtain unanimous verdicts of the jury on the offenses charged. This supplemental instruction was improper even had it been given to the entire jury. It was in the nature of an <em>Allen </em>charge, but was so foreshortened as to be woefully inadequate. We have approved an instruction that closely follows the language of 15-4.4 of the <em>American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice </em>(1978, 1986 Supp.), \u201cpro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>vided there is no deviation in substance from the language of that standard.\u201d <em>Graham v. State, </em>325 Md. at 409, n. 4, 601 A.2d 131. <em>See Goodmuth v. State, </em>302 Md. 613, 622-23, 490 A.2d 682 (1985); <em>Burnette v. State, </em>280 Md. 88, 96, 371 A.2d 663 (1977); <em>Kelly v. State, </em>270 Md. 139, 144, 310 A.2d 538 (1973). What the judge here said to Rubin in no way met the requisites of the instruction we have indicated would be proper to give a jury having difficulty reaching a verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">We have found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">1) the trial judge erred in his encounter with the juror, Rubin; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">2) the error was not waived by Stewart or his counsel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">3) the error was not harmless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Thus, the trial judge abused his discretion in denying Stewart\u2019s Motion for a Mistrial.
