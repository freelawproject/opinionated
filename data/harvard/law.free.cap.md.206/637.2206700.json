The contention of a prisoner that he was not given compulsory process for witnesses in a criminal prosecution can be raised on appeal, but cannot be raised on <em>habeas corpus. </em>Denial of an opportunity to obtain witnesses at a trial goes only to the regularity of the proceeding, not to the jurisdiction of the trial court. <em>Selby v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>201 Md. 653, 92 A. 2d 756; <em>Bowen v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>202 Md. 646, 96 A. 2d 489; <em>Spence v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>204 Md. 661, 103 A. 2d 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">He also contends that the evidence produced against him was so insignificant that it was ridiculous, and led him to believe that the desire of the State\u2019s Attorney to obtain a conviction was \u201cthe primary factor regardless of who was made to suffer.\u201d As we have often stated, <em>habeas corpus </em>cannot be made to serve the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>pose of an appeal or a new trial to review the question of guilt or innocence of the petitioner, and the contention that the evidence produced at the trial did not prove that the petitioner had committed a crime cannot be considered in a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding. <em>Bonsuk v.
