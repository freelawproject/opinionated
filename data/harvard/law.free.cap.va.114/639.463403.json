(Seal)\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Apn\">The secretary and treasurer of the Real Estate Company, who Avas permitted to testify over the objections of Mrs. McKee, stated that \u201chis company held the lots mentioned in the contract of purchase at $3,950.00, from which $400.00, as a discount of about 10 <em>per cent., </em>was deducted for cash, making the consideration for the lots $3,550.00; that the contract of purchase was executed on April 5, 1906, and the deed prepared the next day, April 6th, but Avas not acknowledged and delivered for several days after-wards, as the offices of the company were in Norfolk; that the deed recites the payment of the consideration of $3,-550.00, but that only $3,000.00 was paid at the time the deed was delivered. As to the said $550.00, the contract of purchase provided as folloAvs: \u2018And I do hereby agree to erect on said lot a dAvelling house to cost not less than $4,100.00, as soon as the Bunting, McNeal Real .Estate Company can assure me sewerage, water and electric or gas lights for use of said dwelling, and if I fail to erect said house as stated, I will pay to said Bunting, McNeal Real Estate Company a further sum of $550.00, this amount being alloAved for the erection of said building, notwithstanding I have a deed for said lots.\u2019 That the plaintiff was a real estate company interested in having houses built upon the lots it might sell, in order to enhance the value of its other lots. That in the summer of 1910 he had notified Mr. McKee, the husband of the defendant, who was acting for her in these matters, that sewerage, Avater and lights could be assured her by the company, and in January, 1911, he served a written notice on her to that effect; that the defendant had failed to erect the dAvell<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ing mentioned in said contract of purchase and had sold said lots at an advanced price; that he, the witness, thought that the defendant should pay this additional sum of $550.00.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-4\">The whole matter of law and fact having been submitted to the trial court, it rendered judgment in favor of the Beal Estate Company for the sum sued for.

(22 Va.) 219, 10 Am. Dec. 519; <em>Trout </em>v. <em>N. &amp; </em>W. <em>Ry. Co., </em>107 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Va. 582, 59 S. E. 394; <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>105 Va. 569, 54 S. E. 33, 5 L. R. A. 1194, 115 Am. St. Rep. 880; 2 Minor on Real Prop., sec. 1158; 2 Dev. on Deeds (3rd ed.), secs. 822, 823, 830; Browne on Parol Ev., sec. 92; 2 Sugden on Vendors (8th Am. ed.), p. 338, note b, where many cases are cited; 4 Wigmore on Ev., sec. 2433; Beach on Mod. Law of Contracts, sec. 275; Bishop on Contracts, sec. 386; 2 Page on Contracts, secs. 1203, 1204; <em>Hebbard </em>v. <em>Haughian, </em>70 N. Y. 54, 58-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">As we understand the argument of the counsel for Mrs. McKee, he does, not controvert the rule as above stated, but his contention is that th\u2019e provision in the executory contract of sale for the erection of a dwelling house on the lots to cost not less than $4,100 was not a part of the consideration, but was one of the conditions upon which the lots were sold; and that since such condition was not carried into the deed th\u2019e contract between the parties was altered to that extent, and the deed became \u201cthe exclusive and conclusive evidence of the terms of purchase, and prohibits the reading into the deed\u201d that provision of the contract which the parties themselves abandoned. And he further insists that the provision as to the erection of the $4,100 dwelling house contained in the contract of sale was not only omitted from the deed, but that the deed contains another provision in lieu thereof, viz.: \u201cThat no dwelling house should be built on any of th\u2019e said lots to cost less than twenty-five hundred ($2,500.00) dollars\u201d; and that the contract of sale was, therefore, not admissible in evidence since it contradicted the express conditions of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">It clearly appears from a comparison of the two writings that that condition or covenant in the deed was not in lieu of or a substitute for the provision as to the erection of a $4,100 dwelling house. On the contrary, the contract of sale provides that \u201cwhen the 'entire purchase price is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>paid a deed with general warranty is to be executed with the following covenants * * *\u201d Among these covenants is one (the fifth) that no dwelling house shall b'e built on any lot fronting on the Boulevard (as do the lots in question) costing less than twenty-five hundred dollars. That covenant was, therefore, not only not in lieu of but had nothing to do with the provision in the consideration clause of the contract of sale providing how the purchase price might be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">As we understand and construe that contract, the provision in the consideration clause for the erection of a $4,100 dwelling house was a benefit which would enure to the vendor, and was therefore a part of the consideration it was to receive for the property. The vendor was a real estate company interested in having houses built upon lots sold, and such improvements would enhance the value of its other lots. Mrs. McKee had the option, under the contract, to build such a house; but if she did not, she bound herself to \u201cpay said Bunting, McKeal Beal Estate Company <em>a further sum of five hundred and fifty </em>dollars, <em>this amount being allowed for the erection of said </em>building, <em>notwithstanding I have a deed for said lots. </em>* *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">That the real consideration for the lots purchased and sold was $3,550 is clear, we think, from the language of the consideration clause in the contract; but the language of the deed leaves no room for doubt on that point, for it declares that the conveyance was made \u201cfor and in consideration of the sum of thirty-five hundred and fifty ($3,-550) dollars\u201d; and the evidence of the secretary of the real estate company shows that the $3,000, which the contract of sale provided was to be paid at that time, was paid, leaving $550 of the consideration unpaid. That sum was not payable when the deed was delivered, which was only a few days after the contract of sale was entered into, and it did not become payable until the real estate company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>notified Mrs. McKee that it conld assure water, sewerage and electric lights for the use of the dwelling house. This notice was not given until January, 1911. When that notice was given it became the duty of Mrs. McKee either to erect the $4,100 dwelling house or to pay the said sum of $550, notwithstanding, as the contract provides, she had \u201ca deed for said lots.\u201d She declined or failed to erect the dwelling house, and the $550 at once became payable in money.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">But if it were true, as insisted by the counsel of Mrs. McKe\u2019e, that when the deed was executed by her vendor and accepted by her the contract for sale was merged for all purposes, and that the rights of the parties thereafter rested solely in the deed, the evidence of the secretary of the company, which was clearly admissible, showed that only $3,000 of the $3,550, the consideration stated in the deed, had been paid. This being so, it would leave Mrs. McKee owing $550 on the purchase price of the lots, with interest thereon from the date or delivery of the deed. If the court could not have rendered judgment for that sum because of a variance between the plaintiff\u2019s pleading and its evidence, the court ought to, and no doubt would, have given the plaintiff leave to amend its pleadings in accordance with the provisions of section 3384 of the Code. That section applies to motions heard by the court as well as to jury trials. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Grant\u2019s Admr., </em>32 Gratt. (43 Va.) 769, 777-8. It is remedial and should be construed liberally <em>(Langhorne </em>v. <em>Richmond City, </em>91 Va. 364, 367, 22 S. E. 357), especially where the amendment will further the ends of justice and permit the controversy to be determined on its merits. 3 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. of L. &amp; P., 617, 744-748.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim, whether evidenced by the contract of sale or by the deed, was the unpaid purchase price due from Mrs. McKee on the lots sold her. The evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>the case, excluding the contract of sale, showed beyond question that there was still a balance of $550 of purchase money due from Mrs. McKee, and it is hard to see how we could deny the real estate company\u2019s right to recover and at the same time satisfy the demands, of common justice. It is difficult to conceive of a case in which a more palpable wrong would be done, or a worse example set, by suffering an agreement to be broken with impunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">It is clear to us that the trial court did not 'err in overruling Mrs. McKee\u2019s motion to exclude the contract of sale, and that upon the whole case there is no error in the judgment complained of to the prejudice of the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
