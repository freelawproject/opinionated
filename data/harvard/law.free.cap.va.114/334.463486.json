Such damage as the jury may believe the plaintiff to have suffered by reason of being permanently deprived of the quiet and comfortable use and enjoyment of her house as a residence and home, due' to the smoke, cinders, dust and noise which the jury may believe to be emitted from the defendant\u2019s said plant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>The injury, if any, to the actual market value of the plaintiff\u2019s property caused by reason of such smoke, dust, cinders and noise, and in considering whether the market value of such property has been so injured, and if it has been so injured, then in arriving at the amount of such injury, the jury should be guided by the difference in its fair market value occasioned by such smoke, dust, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>cinders and noise, bnt should not take into consideration any increase of such value caused by a general advance in real estate values or caused by its proximity to the Virginian railway, or to the freight depot or passenger station of said railway company. They should take into consideration any increase in such value caused by its proximity of convenience to the round house, machine shops and coal tipple of the defendant, if they believe such proximity to said round house, machine shops and coal tipple has increased its value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-4\">\u201c(3) The court instructs the jury that, although they may believe from the evidence that the pecuniary value of the plaintiff\u2019s property has not been diminished or has been increased by the construction and operation of the defendant\u2019s round house and other adjacent machinery, nevertheless, if the jury believe that the plaintiff has been damaged by the same in the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of her property as a home for herself and family, then the jury shall find for the plaintiff, and shall assess her damages. at such sum as the jury believe will be a reasonable compensation to her for the damages so sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-5\">To the giving of which instructions, the defendant, by counsel, objected, but the court overruled said objection and gave said instructions offered by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-6\">And, thereupon, the defendant moved the court to instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-7\">\u201c (1) The court instructs the jury that the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the property involved in this suit has been damaged.by the nuisance alleged to have been caused by the defendant; and the burden is also on the plaintiff to show the amount of such damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-8\">\u201c(2) The jury are instructed that, in order to recover damages for the nuisance, the plaintiff must show such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>annoyance, discomfort or other interruption of the use of her property as would disturb or annoy persons of ordinary sensibilities or of ordinary taste and habit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">\u201c (3) The jury are further instructed that, in determining the market value of the plaintiff\u2019s property, they should consider all purposes for which the property may be available, either now or in the future, which would affect the present market value of the property, if offered for sale, and not merely its value for the use to which it was put prior to the establishment of the alleged nuisance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">\u201c(4) The court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that the alleged nuisance caused by the defendant damages the plaintiff\u2019s property, and is of a permanent character, the measure of plaintiff\u2019s damages is the depreciation of the market value of the property by reason of the existence of the nuisance. In arriving at the depreciation the jury should find the market value of the plaintiff\u2019s property immediately before the commencement of the alleged nuisance and deduct therefrom the market value of the plaintiff\u2019s property immediately after the commencement of the alleged nuisance. The difference between the market values immediately before and immediately after the commencement of the alleged nuisance is the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-7\">\u201c(5) The court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that the plaintiff, Cora D. London, acquired the property which she alleges has been damaged by the defendant, after the defendant had located and commenced to operate its terminal facilities, which the plaintiff claims injures her property, and that the nuisance caused by the location and operation of the same is of a permanent character, they must find for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-8\">\u201c(6) The court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that the alleged nuisance caused by the defendant damages the plaintiff\u2019s property and is of a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>manent character, the measure of the plaintiff\u2019s damages to her said property is the depreciation of the market value of the property by reason of the existence of the nuisance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-4\">\u201cThe jury are further instructed that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in addition to the damages above referred to any damages on account of the discomfort and inconvenience caused by the alleged nuisance during the time she has remained in the property and occupied it as a home.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">\u201c(7) The court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that the alleged nuisance caused by the defendant is of a permanent character, the measure of the plaintiff\u2019s damages is the depreciation of the market value of the property by reason of the existence of the nuisance. If, however, the jury believe from the evidence that the alleged nuisance is only temporary, and not permanent in its character, the measure of the plaintiff\u2019s damages is the depreciation of the usable or rental value of the property by reason of the existence of said nuisance between the date of the commencement of said nuisance and the commencement of this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">\u201cThe jury are further instructed that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action damages for both a permanent injury to the market value of the property and damages for an injury to the usable or rental value of the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">\u201cAnd if the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s property has not been injured by the alleged nuisance, either in its market value or in its usable or rental value, they must find for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\">\u201c(8) The jury are also instructed that, in determining , the question of whether a nuisance exists or not, they must take into consideration the location of the plaintiff\u2019s property and the surrounding circumstances; and if the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>tiff\u2019s property was, at the. time of the commencement of the alleged nuisance, situated in a locality suitable for and principally devoted to manufacturing and industrial enterprises, the same conditions would not be considered as causing a nuisance to residence property in such a locality as in a locality principally devoted to and suitable for residential purposes. For example, a livery stable or manufacturing plant might constitute a nuisance in a residential section, whereas they would not constitute a nuisance in a section principally devoted to business of a like or similar character.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\">To the giving of which instructions, the plaintiff, by \u25a0counsel, objected, and the court gave instructions Nos. 2 and 3, as offered by the defendant, and refused to give instructions 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, as offered by the defendant, and offered to give instructions Nos. 1, 5 and 6, if amended \u25a0so as to read as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\">\u201c(la) The court instructs the jury that before she can recover for damage to her property, the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the property involved in this suit Fas been damaged by the nuisance alleged to have been caused by the defendant; and the burden is also on the plaintiff to show the extent of such damages.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\">\u201c(5a) The court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that the plaintiff, Cora D. London, acquired the property which she alleges has been damaged by the defendant, after the defendant had located and \u25a0commenced to operate its terminal facilities, in the manner which the plaintiff claims injures her property, and that the nuisance caused by the location and operation of the same is of a permanent character, they must find for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-8\">\u201c(6a) The court instructs the jury that if they believe .from the evidence that the alleged nuisance caused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>defendant damages the plaintiff\u2019s property and is of a permanent character, the measure of the plaintiff\u2019s damage to her said property is the depreciation of the market value of the property by reason of the existence of the nuisance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-4\">\u201cThe jury are further instructed that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, in addition to the damages above referred to, any damages on account of the discomfort and inconvenience caused by the alleged nuisance during the time she remained in the property and occupied it as a home; but, if the damage to the property is less than the damage from being deprived of the quiet and comfort of her home, she may, nevertheless, recover the damage from being so deprived of such quiet and comfort.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-5\">Thereupon, the defendant offered instructions Nos. la and 5a, modified as suggested by the court, which instructions were given by the court, but declined to offer instruction No. 6, with the amendment suggested by the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-6\">To which ruling of the court in refusing to give instructions 1 to 8, inclusive, as offered by the defendant, the defendant, by counsel, excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-7\">And thereupon, after the court had given the aforesaid instructions offered by the plaintiff and had refused to give the instructions as hereinbefore set forth, which were offered by the defendant, the defendant offered instruction No. 9, which is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-8\">\u201c(9) The court instructs the jury that before they can find for the plaintiff, on her theory of this case, any damages because of the disturbance or inconvenience suffered from noise and smoke from the defendant\u2019s works, they must believe from the evidence she continued to live in her said property in absolute good faith, and because she could not obtain a location as suitable and convenient for her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>purposes as her present residence and at a price as low as the price readily obtainable for her present residence, and did not continue to live there with a view to recovering damages against the defendant company or forcing the defendant company to buy her said property.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-5\">And the court refused to give instruction No. 9 as offered by the defendant, and thereupon the defendant offered instruction No. 9a, which is as follows: .</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\">\u201c(9a) The court instructs the jury that before they can find for the plaintiff, on her theory of this case, any damages because of the disturbance or inconvenience suffered from noise and smoke from the defendant\u2019s works, they must believe from the evidence she continued to live in her said property in absolute good faith, and because she could not obtain a location as suitable and convenient for her purposes as her present residence and did not continue to live there with a view to recovering damages against the defendant company or forcing the defendant company to buy her said property.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">And the court refused to give instruction No. 9a; to which ruling of the court in refusing to give instructions Nos. 9 and 9a the defendant, by counsel, excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\">The opinion states the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-9\"><em>Hall &amp; Woods </em>and <em>G-.

At the first trial the jury rendered a verdict for the defendant, which, iipon motion of the plaintiff, the court set aside, and at a subsequent trial the jury awarded the plaintiff $500, upon which verdict the court entered judgment, and the case is before us upon the petition of the railway company, which assigns as error, first, the. action of the court in setting aside the first verdict and granting a new trial, and, second, certain \u2022rulings of the court made during the progress of the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">We have no difficulty in saying that the court did not err in setting aside the first verdict. Whatever may be the difference of opinion as to the true measure of damages in such a case, it is certain that the plaintiff had sustained substantial damage, and that the jury erred in finding a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The errors assigned by the plaintiff in error with respect to the second trial are as follows: First, that the court erred in overruling the demurrer to the amended declaration; second, that the court erred in refusing to give the instructions asked for by the plaintiff in error; and,.third, that the court erred in refusing to set aside the verdict of the jury rendered on the second trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u2022 Upon the demurrer the contention of the plaintiff in error is that inconsistent elements of damage are claimed in the declaration; that the declaration alleges that the plaintiff is damaged in the use and possession of her property, and is also damaged by the permanent depreciation of the market value of her property; and that these elements of damage are inconsistent, because the permanent depreciation in the market value of property comprehends the whole damage that can be caused to property by the establishment of a permanent nuisance. The same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>assignment of error is made in connection with the instructions asked for and which the court refused to give, and is the controlling question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Plaintiff in error relies upon <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Newport News, </em>105 Va. 108, 52 S. E. 821, 3 L. R. A. (N. S.) 404, where it is stated that where private property has been damaged by a public improvement, but no part thereof has been taken, the measure of damages is the diminution in the value of the property by reason of the improvement \u2014 the difference between the fair market value of the property immediately before and after the construction of the public, improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In that case the court was dealing with an injury to property only, caused by a change in the grade of a street, and as a matter of course, if the change in the grade added to the market value, no injury was sustained by the act complained of, but in the case before us another element enters, and is to be considered. There are nuisances in Avhich the harm attributed consists of damage to realty itself, and, secondly, those in which the damage consists of an interference with some right incident to the ownership or possession of realty. The case of <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Newport News, supra, </em>belongs to the first class, in which there must be substantial diminution in the value of the property, while the case before us belongs to the second class, where the injury consists of a substantial impairment of the plaintiff\u2019s comfort and convenience and enjoyment of it. See I Street\u2019s Foundation of Legal Liability, pp. 211-223, inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The author adopts the definition of a private nuisance given by Pollock as follows: \u201cA private nuisance is the using, or authorizing the use of, one\u2019s property, or of anything under one\u2019s control, so as to injuriously affect an owner or occupier of property (1) by diminishing the value of that property; (2) by continuously interfering with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>his power of control or enjoyment of that property; (3) by causing material disturbance or annoyance to him in his use or occupation of that property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The contention of the plaintiff in error seems to be that damages for diminution .of the value of property include every element of damage which may be recovered, and that if a nuisance be a continuing nuisance \u2014 a permanent nuisance \u2014 (and it is conceded that the nuisance under consideration is a permanent nuisance) it excludes every other element of damage. In this view we cannot concur. The result of a nuisance may be to add to the value of the property, and yet involve a substantial impairment of the owner\u2019s comfort, convenience and enjoyment of it by causing a material disturbance or annoyance to him in the use or occupation of that property. Any other conclusion would seem to involve the right to set off a benefit resulting from the nuisance against the injury which it occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">There can be no doubt, under the facts of this case, that the value of the house of the defendant in error was, for residential purposes, greatly impaired by the nuisance created by the plaintiff in error. That is a conceded wrong, and to deny her the right to recover damages on account of that wrong because the market value of her property had been increased by the wrong would be to say that she could be improved out of her home against her will by the wrongful act of the plaintiff in error, and the law would afford her no redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In <em>Baltimore &amp; Potomac R. Co. </em>v. <em>Fifth Baptist Church, </em>108 U. S. 317 27 L. Ed. 739, 2 Sup. Ct. 719, in dealing with the subject of damages for such an injury, Mr. Justice Field uses the following language: \u201cMere depreciation of the property was not the only element for consideration. That might, indeed, be entirely disregarded. The plaintiff was entitled to recover because of the inconvenience and discomfort caused to the congregation assembled, thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>necessarily tending to destroy the nse of the building for the purposes for which it was erected and dedicated. The property might not be depreciated in its salable or market value, if the building had been entirely closed for those purposes, by the noise, smoke and odors of the defendant\u2019s shops. It might then, perhaps, have brought in the market as great' a price to be used for some other purpose. But as the court below very properly said to the jury, the congregation had the same right to the comfortable enjoyment of its house for church purposes that a private gentleman has to the comfortable enjoyment of his own house, and it is the discomfort and annoyance in its use for those purposes which is the primary consideration in allowing damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The principle established in that case is, we think, conclusive of the one under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We are of opinion that the demurrer to the declaration was properly overruled and that the court committed no error with respect to the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">With respect to the instructions which were refused, it is proper to mention that the plaintiff in error asked the court to instruct the jury as follows: \u201cThe court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that the alleged nuisance caused by the defendant damages the plaintiff\u2019s property and is of a permanent character, the measure of the plaintiff\u2019s damage to her said property is the depreciation of the market value of the property by reason of the existence of the nuisance;\u201d which the court refused to give in that form, but expressed itself as willing to give with the following addendum, if the plaintiff in error desired it: \u201cThe jury are further instructed that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, in addition to the damages above referred to, any damages on account of the discomfort and inconvenience caused by the alleged nuisance during the time she remained in the property and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>occupied it as a home; but if the damage to the property is less than the damage from being deprived of the quiet and comfort of her home she may, nevertheless, recover the damage from being so deprived of such quiet and comfort.\u201d The effect of which would have been, of course, to prevent the recovery of what plaintiff in error claims would have been double damages \u2014 that is to say, damage to the use of the property on account of discomfort and inconvenience caused by the alleged nuisance as well as to its market value; but the plaintiff in error, with respect to that instruction, declined to offer instruction No. 6 with the amendment suggested by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Upon the whole case we are of opinion that the judgment complained of should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
