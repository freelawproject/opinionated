Customs carries out this responsibility, in part, with the help of detector dogs trained by Canine Enforcement Officers (\u201cCEOs\u201d) to find drugs hidden in incoming containers. Training these dogs is not a one-time event, but rather, it is an on-going process that continues throughout the dog\u2019s career. One training exercise the dogs repeat regularly is the detection of tightly-rolled terry cloth towels scented with narcotics and hidden in training aid containers of varying complexity. When a dog successfully locates a training towel, his CEO rewards him with some play time using either the recently-found training towel or a clean, unscented towel. Because neither the training aid containers nor the scented towels are available for purchase at the local pet store, the CEOs are tasked with constructing and maintaining the training aid containers, as well as laundering the towels as needed. Both of these tasks are vital to effective dog training. And although they may not be unduly onerous, they are time consuming nevertheless.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Most important, these duties are work that CEOs must perform, under pain of penalty for nonperformance. In spite of that, Customs required the CEOs to do this work on their own time and without compensation. Approximately sixty CEOs eventually became so dissatisfied with this state of affairs that they filed suit against the United States in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, seeking overtime pay pursuant to FLSA. The case was subsequently transferred to the Court of Federal Claims on January 26, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">In June of 2004, during the pendency of this suit in the court below, Robert Jacks-ta, Customs\u2019 Executive Director of Border Security and Facilitation at the Office of Field Operations, issued a directive via a memorandum to all POEs changing this historical practice of requiring uncompensated overtime. Jacksta\u2019s memorandum read in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aat\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>The first policy treated herein concerns the care and maintenance of \u201creward\u201d towels used in detector dog training. As outlined in the Detector Dog Training Manual (Section 3, pg. 94) and the Canine Handbook CIS HB 3200-07A dated August 2002, (Chapter 5, paragraph 5.9), the type of reward a legacy Customs detector dog receives for responding to an odor for the detection of which he has been trained is a retrieving towel constructed of a terry cloth material. After each use, the retrieving towel must be properly cleaned, and the officer must use caution to ensure that the retrieving towel is not contaminated with the odor(s) of cleaning detergents, etc. For this reason, it is required that the retrieving towel be washed in plain hot water and rinsed in cold water. Further, paragraph 5.9.2 of the Canine Handbook states that \u201cthe port management will ensure that only clean towels are utilized.\u201d In order to guarantee that this procedure is properly implemented, each Director, Field Operations shall take the necessary measures to fulfill the requirement to maintain clean retrieving towels used in training of our detector dogs. Necessary measures could include the immediate purchase and setup of a washer and dryer or the use of contract services. If necessary, on a rotating basis, canine officers may be directed to spend all or part of a normal duty shift washing and drying training towels consistent with the Handbook requirements, through whatever means are made available by management.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-5\">Secondly, each Port Director is to provide direction to [the Office of Field Operations] canine officers, reminding them that supervisory approval is required before performing any overtime work, either on or off the work site; and that the performance of any work-related tasks, including, but not limited to, the construction of detector dog training aids, will be accomplished only during the officer\u2019s normal duty hours. For example, during those times that the detector dog is resting, the canine officer can construct training aids or roll and tape towels. Port Directors and Supervisors will ensure that during all periods of downtime (e.g., while the detector dog is resting or during any spare time at the beginning or end of shifts), all canine officers are engaged in performing official duties. Supervisors will also advise [the Office of Field Operations] canine officers who construct training aids outside their normal duty hours that they will not be compensated for the time spent performing such tasks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Joint App. at 469-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Then, on August 3, 2004, the government moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), arguing that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims should be dismissed because \u201cthe Customs Officer Pay Reform Act (COPRA or the Act), 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 261, 267 (2000), enacted in 1993, is the exclusive pay system for CEOs, excluding them from coverage under FLSA.\u201d <em>Bull v. United States, </em>63 Fed.Cl. 580, 581 (2005) (footnote omitted) <em>(\u201cBull </em>I\u201d). The court denied the motion. <em>Id., </em>at 590. The court held that COPRA, as correctly interpreted, only covers overtime compensation for <em>officially assigned </em>overtime work. The court concluded that the work at issue in this case, while required, was not officially assigned. The CEOs were required\u2014on pain of discipline or termination\u2014to construct and maintain training aid containers and to launder towels on their own time without compensation simply because Customs did not \u201cofficially assign\u201d those tasks. <em>See </em>Digital audio recording: Oral Argument in Case No.2006-5038, at 2:11 (Dec. 4, 2006) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>(\u201cOral Argument\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court concluded that non-officially assigned overtime work is properly compensated under the terms of FLSA. <em>Bull I, </em>at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">In addition, due to the large number of plaintiffs, the court sought to simplify the upcoming bench trial by directing each side to select three trial plaintiffs to proceed. The parties complied, and a six-day trial commenced on May 3, 2005. Shortly thereafter, the parties submitted post-trial briefs for the court\u2019s consideration. On September 27, 2005, the court issued its written opinion explaining its conclusions that Customs had violated FLSA willfully, and that all six plaintiffs are entitled to compensation for 2 hours per week for \u201claundering and processing training towels,\u201d and 1.5 hours per week for \u201cConstructing training aids.\u201d <em>Bull v. United States, </em>68 Fed.Cl. 212, 276 (2005) <em>(\u201cBull II\u201d). </em>No damages were awarded for any overtime work performed after the distribution of the Jacksta memorandum. <em>Id., </em>at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">The court then ordered the parties to \u201cjointly calculate and present to the court the amount of compensation to which each representative plaintiff is entitled in accordance with [the hours of overtime found by the court].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 276. The parties were unable to reach an agreement, however, because certain plaintiffs had originally sought less than the amount of overtime awarded by the court. Thus, according to the government, the court\u2019s award should have been interpreted as a maximum that would not create a windfall for such plaintiffs. The court disagreed, explaining that \u201cthe reasonable time which the court is charged to determine will be more than the approximated time some plaintiffs have claimed and less than the approximated time others have claimed.\u201d <em>Bull v. United States, </em>68 Fed.Cl. 276, slip op. at 5 (Oct. 14, 2005) <em>(\u201cBull III\u201d). </em>Having lost that dispute, the government subsequently agreed to an appropriate amount of compensation due to each plaintiff. The agreed-upon amount was then doubled pursuant to the court\u2019s award of liquidated damages based on its finding that Customs had not acted in good faith by denying overtime pay. A final judgment in the amount of $287,489.94 was entered against the United States on October 21, 2005. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">\u201cIn reviewing decisions of the Court of Federal Claims, we apply a de novo standard to legal conclusions ... and a dear-error standard to factual findings.\u201d <em>Adams v. United States, </em>350 F.3d 1216, 1221 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">Before we resolve the issues disputed on appeal, it is first helpful to explain a few evolutionary aspects of the statutory and regulatory framework that governs the compensation of Customs inspectors in this country. Beginning at least as early as 1799, the owner of a vessel entering a port of the United States was responsible for paying for the cost of the inspectional services he received. Act of Mar. 2, 1799, \u00a7 53,1 Stat. 627, 667. Thus, it was historically the private sector\u2014not the taxpayer\u2014who bore the burden of paying the compensation of the Customs inspectors. But because transportation in the early days of our nation\u2019s history was rather unpredictable, cargo-bearing vessels would arrive at any time of the day on any day of the week. As a consequence, Customs inspectors faced uncertain work schedules. From 1873 to 1909, Congress passed vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>ous bills intended to ameliorate this situation by directing the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations to provide additional compensation (at the vessel owner\u2019s expense) for nighttime inspectional services. <em>See </em>Act of Mar. 3, 1873, 17 Stat. 579, 579; Act of June 26, 1884, \u00a7 25, 23 Stat. 53, 59; Act of June 30, 1906, 34 Stat. 633, 633; Act of Mar. 4,1909, 35 Stat. 1065, 1065. Thus, if the owner of an incoming vessel desired the services of Customs inspectors in the middle of the night, he could obtain them by paying a higher price than he would during the daytime hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">In 1911, Congress replaced the prior legislation with a more comprehensive statutory scheme that, among other things, directed the Secretary of the Treasury to \u201cfix a reasonable rate of extra compensation ... [, which] shall not exceed an amount equal to double the rate of compensation allowed to each such officer or employee for like services rendered by day\u201d for inspections at night, on Sundays, and on holidays. Act of Feb. 13,1911, \u00a7 5, 36 Stat. 899, 901. In 1920, Congress amended the 1911 Act by directing the Secretary of the Treasury to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARq\">fix a reasonable rate of extra compensation for overtime services of inspectors, storekeepers, weighers, and other customs officers and employees who may be required to remain on duty between the hours of [5:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.], or on Sundays or holidays, to perform services in connection with the lading or unlading of cargo, or ..., or examination of passengers\u2019 baggage, such rates to be fixed on the basis of one-half day\u2019s additional pay for each two hours or fraction thereof of at least one hour that the overtime extends beyond [5:00 p.m.] (but not to exceed two and one-half days\u2019 pay for the full period from [5:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.]), and two additional days\u2019 pay for Sunday or holiday duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Act of Feb. 7, 1920, 41 Stat. 402, 402. Thus, under the generous terms of the amended 1911 Act, a Customs inspector could receive four hours\u2019 pay (one-half day\u2019s pay) by working one additional hour beyond 5:00 p.m., and sixteen hours pay (two days\u2019 pay) by working only a few minutes on a Sunday or holiday.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">The compensation system became even more generous under subsequent Treasury Department regulations which calculated overtime hours on a basis that had little to do with the amount of time actually worked. For example, if a Customs inspector having a typical 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. schedule was called back to perform a one-hour assignment at night, he could (depending on the time of night) receive credit for up to five hours of overtime, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 24.16(g) (as enacted on Dec. 31, 1963), which corresponded to three two-hour overtime units, <em>ie., </em>twelve hours\u2019 pay, under the 1911 Act, <em>see </em>41 Stat. 402, 402 (providing \u201cone-half day\u2019s additional pay for each two hours or fraction thereof of at least one hour\u201d). Notably, however, the 1911 Act, for all its generosity, failed to provide compensation for overtime work performed either during customary working hours or during the first hour after 5:00 p.m. In other words, if a Customs inspector began an inspection at, say, 4:45 p.m. and concluded that inspection at 5:30 p.m., he would not qualify for thirty minutes of overtime under the 1911 Act. Instead, he was supposed to be compensated (at least in later years) pursuant to the overtime provisions of FLSA or the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5541-5550b (\u201cFEPA\u201d). GAO Report, <em>Customs Service: 1911 Act Governing Overtime is Outdated, </em>at 49 (1991) (\u201cGAO 1911 Act Report\u201d) (\u201cOvertime work from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. is not compensable under the 1911 Act; thus, for example, overtime work within these hours on an inspector\u2019s day off (including Saturdays) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>compensated under FEPA or the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 201 et seq., instead.\u201d), <em>available at </em>http://archive.gao. gov/d20t9/144138.pdf; <em>see also </em>GAO Report, <em>Premium Pay for Federal Inspectors at U.S. Ports-Of-Entry, </em>at 3 (1975) (\u201cGAO Premium Pay Report\u201d), <em>available at </em>http:// archive.gao.gov/f0302/095057.pdf. Under FEPA, Customs inspectors were entitled to receive (subject to certain limitations) one and one-half times pay for \u201chours of work <em>officially ordered or approved </em>in excess of 40 hours in an administrative workweek.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5542(a) (emphasis added). Coverage under the FLSA, which was made applicable to federal employees in 1974, was broader. Customs inspectors were entitled to one and one-half times their normal pay if they were \u201cemploy[ed]\u201d for more than forty hours in a workweek, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(2); the statutory definition of \u201cemploy\u201d included \u201cto suffer or permit to work,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(g). Thus, for work outside the time periods covered by the 1911 Act, Customs inspectors were eligible for FEPA overtime if the work was \u201cofficially ordered\u201d and FLSA overtime even if the work was merely \u201csuffered or permitted.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">Customs operated under this lucrative regime for many years, largely at the expense of the passengers and vessels paying for the inspectional services they received. <em>See </em>GAO Premium Pay Report, at 2. This changed in 1976 when Congress shifted the financial responsibility for overtime charges incurred on Sundays and holidays to the Federal Government. <em>See </em>Airport and Airway Dev. Act Amendments of 1976, sec. 15, \u00a7 53(e), Pub.L. No. 94-353, 90 Stat. 871, 882 (codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1741 (repealed)). Shortly thereafter, Congress became concerned with the financial burden being caused by the 1911 Act. According to a report by the House Committee on Appropriations, in fiscal year 1979, 2,045 Customs inspectors received over $10,000 in overtime pay, 277 Customs inspectors received over $20,000 in overtime pay, and three Customs inspectors received over $39,000 in overtime pay. H.R.Rep. No. 96-248, at 11 (1979). The Committee expressed concern not only about the high dollar amounts, but also about the \u201cwell known fact that such excessive overtime is injurious to a person\u2019s health as well as being the cause of serious family disruptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">These concerns prompted the Committee to propose an annual cap to limit the amount of overtime pay a Customs employee could receive. <em>Id. </em>at 11. In so doing, the Committee recognized that \u201cthe reduction in overtime will result in the need for additional manpower\u201d because \u201cof course, [Customs employees] may not be required to work such overtime without pay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. Thus, the proposal also \u201cincluded funds in the accompanying bill for 200 additional inspectional personnel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A report from the Senate Committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>on Appropriations expressed similar views, S.Rep. No. 96-299, at 15 (1979), and it was agreed at conference that the cap should be set at $20,000 per year, H.R.Rep. No. 96-471, at 6 (1979) (Conf.Rep.). The cap was enacted into law on September 29, 1979, Treasury Dep\u2019t Appropriations Act of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-74, 93 Stat. 559, 560 (1979) (\u201c[N]one of the funds made available by this Act shall be available for administrative expenses to pay any employee [of the United States Customs Service] overtime pay in an amount in excess of $20,000.\u201d), and it was maintained at that level<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> until it was raised to $25,000 for fiscal year 1985, see Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, \u00a7 702, Pub.L. No. 98-573, 98 Stat. 2948, 3043 (codified at 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2075(d)) (\u201cNo part of any sum that is appropriated under subsection (b) for fiscal years after September 30, 1984, may be used for administrative expenses to pay any employee of the United States Customs Service overtime pay in an amount exceeding $ 25,000\u201d). Although the 1979 cap was immediately successful in preventing the 277 Customs inspectors identified in the Committee report from again receiving over $20,000 in overtime pay, a substantial number of inspectors were still receiving significant overtime pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (\u201cCOBRA\u201d), \u00a7 13031, Pub.L. No. 99-272, 100 Stat. 82, 310 (1986) (codified at 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 58c), brought about another significant change in the overtime system. With the passage of COBRA, Customs was directed to collect user fees from virtually every passenger and vessel entering the United States for deposit into a reimbursement account to cover \u201cexpenses incurred by the Secretary of the Treasury in providing overtime customs inspectional services.\u201d COBRA \u00a7 13031(f)(2)(A). Though relatively nominal in amount, these fees were more than sufficient in the aggregate to pay for inspectional overtime expenses. <em>See </em>GAO Report, <em>Customs Service: Information on User Fees, </em>at 13 (1994) (\u201cGAO User Fees Report\u201d), <em>available at </em>http://archive.gao. gov/t2pbat3/152022.pdf. And although reimbursement from the user fee account was technically an appropriation from Congress, it was not subject to the same Office of Management and Budget controls as other appropriations. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 102-186, at 28-29 (1992); GAO User Fees Report, at 11; <em>U.S. Customs Service\u2019s Abuse of Overtime Compensation: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Oversight of the H. Comm, on Ways and Means, </em>102d Cong. 77 (1991) [hereinafter <em>Abuse Hearing] </em>(testimony of Lowell Dodge, Director, Administration of Justice Issues, U.S. General Accounting Office). Nevertheless, Congress maintained an interest in the disposition of these funds because some of the account surplus could be used to offset the federal budget deficit. <em>See </em>GAO User Fees Report, at 13; 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 58c(f) (3) (C) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>Both a General Accounting Office (\u201cGAO\u201d) investigation and an internal study performed by Customs found that inspection managers were treating the user fee account as a \u201cbottomless pit,\u201d and further that inspectional overtime was being monitored only to the extent necessary to ensure that employees were not exceeding the annual cap. GAO 1911 Act Report, at 28. For example, GAO analyzed Customs\u2019 \u201cworktickets,\u201d which were the \u201ctime and attendance records for Customs\u2019 inspectional overtime system,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 13, and \u201cfound worktickets that (1) were not certified by a supervisor, (2) were approved by the person who worked the overtime, (3) were improperly completed or altered, and (4) showed incorrect start and stop times for assignments,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 17. Flaws in the workticket system allowed some employees to receive duplicate payments for a given overtime period. <em>Id. </em>at 19-20. GAO investigators even found an instance where an inspector had received two overtime payments in addition to his regular pay for a single period. <em>Id. </em>at 20; <em>Abuse Hearing, </em>at 82 (testimony of Director Dodge). It was also discovered that the workticket system was allowing 1911 Act payments for overtime that should have been paid at FEPA (or FLSA) rates, i.e., overtime work performed either during customary working hours or during the first hour after 5:00 p.m. GAO 1911 Act Reports, at 32. Similarly, non-inspectional employees, <em>e.g., </em>secretaries and aides, were sometimes being paid for overtime at 1911 Act rates instead of FEPA (or FLSA) rates. <em>Id. </em>at 34. These latter practices drove up costs because FEPA and FLSA generally provide only time-and-a-half overtime pay. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5542 (FEPA); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 (FLSA). Moreover, under Office of Personnel Management regulations, FEPA and FLSA overtime is paid in fifteen-minute increments, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 550.112(a) (FEPA), 551.521 (FLSA), as opposed to the 1911 Act\u2019s half-day increments. GAO 1911 Act Report, at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The results of the GAO investigation\u2014 which was done at the behest of the Subcommittees on Trade and Oversight within the House Ways and Means Committee\u2014 prompted the reformatory legislation at issue in this case. Customs Officer Pay Reform Act (\u201cCOPRA\u201d), H.R. 3837, 103rd Cong., 107 Stat. 312, 668-672 (1993). That legislation was written to provide double-time pay rates for \u201cofficially assigned\u201d work in excess of forty hours per week or eight hours in a day, <em>see </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 267(a)(1), and to replace the 1911 Act\u2019s half-day increments for night work and two-day increments for Sunday/holiday work with \u201cpremium\u201d pay rates, <em>see </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 267(b). It was Congress\u2019 intent that this new pay-rate regime, coupled with the promulgation of Treasury Department regulations designed to prevent abuse of the overtime system, would mirror FEPA and FLSA in the sense that payments would reflect the amount of time actually worked. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 267(d); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 24.16(c)-(g); H.R.Rep.

Pickle).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">In fact, both the GAO and the Congressional Research Service, in reports that provided the factual basis for the enactment of COPRA, noted the possibility of eliminating the 1911 Act and paying overtime to Customs inspectors primarily under FEPA and its time and half rate. GAO 1911 Act Report, at 45-46; <em>Abuse Hearing, </em>at 43 (Congressional Research Service report). However, concerns were expressed that the double-time rate appropriately reflected both the nature of Customs inspectors\u2019 work and the comparable pay in the private sector. <em>See </em>GAO 1911 Act Report, at 70-71 (comments of National Treasury Employees Union); House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>Report, at 139-142 (statement of Robert M. Tobias, President, National Treasury Employees Union). Accordingly Congress amended the 1911 Act to mirror FEPA while retaining the double-time rate. <em>See </em>139 Cong. Rec. 289, 290 (1993) (extension of remarks by Rep. Pickle) (\u201c[T]he Customs Service overtime pay laws\u2014the 1911 Act\u2014would be modified to mirror the Federal Employees Pay Act [FEPA] rules which generally apply to Federal Government workers.\u201d); 138 Cong. Rec. 20850, 20861 (1992) (statement of Rep. Rangel) (\u201cThe committee came to recognize that the 1911 law needed revision, but that it did not want to reduce the overall compensation of Customs inspectors.\u201d). Of particular relevance, COPRA contained a similar provision to FEPA\u2019s \u201cwork officially ordered or approved\u201d limitation which limited COPRA to \u201cofficially assigned\u201d work. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 267(a)(1); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5542(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Congress also limited eligibility for these increased hourly rates to \u201ccustoms inspector[s][and] canine enforcement officer[s],\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 267(e)(1), and included an exclusivity provision which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-7\">A customs officer who receives overtime pay under subsection (a) or premium pay under subsection (b) for time worked may not receive pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 267(c)(2). In addition, paragraph (c)(1) of COPRA, though duplicative of the broader pre-existing cap prohibiting <em>any </em>Customs employee from receiving more than $25,000 in annual overtime,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> explicitly capped COPRA overtime payments at the same amount, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 267(c)(1). The legislative history reveals that Congress was fully aware that paragraph (c)(1) would be duplicative of prior law, <em>see </em>H.R.Rep. No. 102-486, at 19 (noting that \u201cCustoms inspectors may receive up to $25,000 in overtime pay, annually\u201d), a fact that is not surprising given the instances of overtime abuse by Customs.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-14\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">The primary question presented in this appeal is whether COPRA is the exclusive source of overtime pay for CEOs, and thus is an absolute bar to compensation under FLSA for overtime work not officially assigned but nonetheless required to be performed by CEOs. The government contends that such non-officially assigned (but required) work must be performed for free. The plaintiffs argue that such overtime work, never officially assigned until the Jacksta memorandum required it to be done during regular work hours, is work \u201csuffer[ed] or permitted]\u201d under FLSA, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(g), and must be reimbursed under FLSA\u2019s overtime provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>As the court below correctly stated, \u201c[t]he starting point for statutory interpretation is the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Bull I, </em>at 583 (citing <em>Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, </em>525 U.S. 432, 438, 119 S.Ct. 755, 142 L.Ed.2d 881 (1999)). \u201c[W]here the statutory language provides a clear answer [to the question at issue], it ends there as well.\u201d <em>Hughes Aircraft, </em>525 U.S. at 438, 119 S.Ct. 755. \u201cBeyond the statute\u2019s text, [the \u2018traditional tools of statutory construction\u2019] include the statute\u2019s structure, canons of statutory construction, and legislative history.\u201d <em>Timex V.I. v. United States, </em>157 F.3d 879, 882 (Fed.Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Chevron U.S.A, Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)). \u201cIf a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect,\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778, and an agency\u2019s alternative interpretation of the statute is not entitled to deference under either <em>Chevron </em>or <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). <em>Gen. Dynamics Land Sys. v. Cline, </em>540 U.S. 581, 600, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004) (\u201c[W]e neither defer nor settle on any degree of deference [owed to the EEOC under either <em>Chevron </em>or <em>Skidmore </em>] because the Commission is clearly wrong.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">The relevant portions of the statute provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-5\">In general. Subject to paragraph (2) and subsection (c), a customs officer who is <em>officially assigned </em>to perform work in excess of 40 hours in the administrative workweek of the officer or in excess of 8 hours in a day shall be compensated <em>for that work </em>at an hourly rate of pay that is equal to 2 times the hourly rate of the basic pay of the officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 267(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOL\">Exclusivity of pay under this section. A customs officer <em>who receives overtime pay under subsection (a) or premium pay under subsection (b) for time worked </em>may not receive pay or other compensation <em>for that work </em>under any other provision of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 267(c)(2) (emphasis added). Thus, COPRA provides double time for \u201cofficially assigned\u201d overtime work, \u00a7 267(a)(1), and precludes additional pay that might otherwise be obtained \u201cfor that work\u201d through non-COPRA sources, \u00a7 267(c)(2). In other words, if a CEO \u201creceives overtime pay under subsection (a),\u201d <em>i.e., </em>for \u201cofficially assigned\u201d overtime work, he or she \u201cmay not receive pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of law.\u201d Nothing in the language of these provisions precludes a CEO who does <em>not </em>\u201creceive[] overtime pay under subsection (a)\u201d for overtime work that was <em>not </em>\u201cofficially assigned\u201d from \u201creceiving] pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of law.\u201d Therefore, the plain language of the statute clearly indicates that COPRA is not the exclusive source of overtime pay for CEOs.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">In support of its argument to the contrary, the government proposes a tortured reading of section 267 by contending that \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018that work\u2019 within the context of COPRA broadly refers to all overtime and premium work performed by customs officers.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14. We disagree. The antecedent basis for \u201cthat work\u201d in paragraph (c)(2) is work for which a CEO \u201creceives overtime pay under subsection (a) or premium pay under subsection (b).\u201d And since only \u201cofficially assigned\u201d work can entitle a CEO to \u201covertime pay under subsection (a),\u201d the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>\u201cthat work\u201d cannot encompass work that was not \u201cofficially assigned.\u201d Had paragraph (a)(1) been written to cover a customs officer who \u201cperforms work\u201d in excess of forty hours per week or eight hours per day, the statute might have the breadth urged by the government. Instead, Congress drafted the statute as it did, and thereby left open the possibility that some overtime work would not be \u201cofficially assigned.\u201d <em>See Bull I, </em>at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">At the very least, the government\u2019s position is at odds with the \u201cexpansive nature\u201d of FLSA coverage. <em>Doe v. United States, </em>372 F.3d 1347, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2004); <em>cf. Mitchell v. Ky. Fin. Co., </em>359 U.S. 290, 295, 79 S.Ct. 756, 3 L.Ed.2d 815 (1959) (\u201cIt is well settled that exemptions from the Fair Labor Standards Act are to be narrowly construed.\u201d). Nothing in the legislative history suggests that FLSA overtime compensation, as historically available to Customs workers, was being abolished by COPRA. Indeed, for the longest time it has been understood that Customs officers should not be \u201crequired to work such overtime without pay.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 96-248, at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\"> The portion of the legislative history highlighted by the government is likewise unpersuasive. As a threshold matter, we note that \u201c[t]he \u2018strong presumption\u2019 that the plain language of the statute expresses congressional intent is rebutted only in \u2018rare and exceptional circumstances,\u2019 <em>Rubin v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 424, 430, 101 S.Ct. 698, 66 L.Ed.2d 633 (1981), when a contrary legislative intent is clearly expressed.\u201d <em>Ardestani v. INS, </em>502 U.S. 129, 135-36, 112 S.Ct. 515, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991). Moreover, mere ambiguities in the legislative history are insufficient to rebut the strong presumption in favor of the plain language of the statute. <em>See id. </em>at 137, 112 S.Ct. 515. The government points to the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-7\">The Committee intends that Customs officials will be compensated for actual time worked at only one of the following rates for any given <em>tour of duty: </em>(1) basic pay rates as prescribed in Title 5 of the United States Code; (2) premium pay rates as prescribed in this legislation; or, (3) overtime pay rates as prescribed in this legislation, exclusively. The Committee does not intend that these rates be additive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">H.R.Rep. No. 102-486, at 20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">We, like the court below, do not believe this brief excerpt compels the government\u2019s reading of COPRA. The Committee may have intended the undefined \u201ctour of duty\u201d term to include only \u201cregularly scheduled work, such as inspections, rather than work \u2018suffer[ed] or permitted]\u2019 to be performed,\u201d <em>Bull I, </em>at 583, especially in light of the fact that the flawed workticket system used for inspectional overtime was a significant driving force behind COPRA\u2019s enactment. A Conference Report issued subsequent to the Committee Report adds additional support to this interpretation of \u201ctour of duty\u201d: \u201c[T]he annual overtime pay limitation [with respect to holidays, nights, and Sundays under section 267(b) ] would be made a part of the same law that controls payment of <em>inspectional </em>overtime.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 103-213, at 919 (1993) (Conf.Rep.), <em>as reprinted in </em>1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1088, 1608 (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>H.R.Rep. No. 102-486, at 20 (\u201cThe Committee\u2019s purpose in requiring Customs officials to work 40 hours in a week or 8 hours in a day without regard to the hour or the day or the day of the week before they qualify for overtime pay is to encourage U.S. Customs Service to adjust its <em>inspectional </em>resources to meet actual trade patterns, rather than the trade community being forced to adjust to a predetermined Customs workday.\u201d (emphasis added)). Accordingly, this is not a \u201crare and exceptional circumstance\u201d where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>Committee\u2019s comments override the plain meaning of the statute. Furthermore, because we find the congressional intent behind the scope of COPRA\u2019s exclusivity provision to be adequately revealed by the statutory language itself, we owe no deference to Customs\u2019 alternate interpretation. <em>See Cline, </em>540 U.S. at 600, 124 S.Ct. 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">We note that there is no reason for concluding that recovery under the FLSA would circumvent the COPRA statutory cap on overtime compensation. From 1979 until 1994\u2014a time period which extends both before and after the enactment of COPRA\u2014all Customs employees who received overtime pay from <em>any </em>source were subject to the same annual cap.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, with or without the duplicative cap provided in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 267(c)(1), a CEO seeking overtime from non-COPRA sources would not have been able to receive more than $25,000. Even today, all Customs employees are subject to the same cap, regardless of the source of the overtime pay.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, we have no reason to believe that our interpretation of COPRA as a non-exclusive regime will permit CEOs to circumvent the cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">In summary, COPRA merely precludes recovery for \u201cofficially assigned\u201d work under another pay statute. As discussed above, Congress was well aware before it enacted COPRA that Customs inspectors received overtime under the FLSA and FEPA if the 1911 Act did not apply. Congress\u2019 inclusion of the \u201cofficially assigned\u201d limitation in COPRA, which mirrored FEPA\u2019s \u201cwork officially ordered or approved\u201d limitation, demonstrates (as does the legislative history) that COPRA was meant to supersede coverage under FEPA for Customs inspectors. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 267(a)(1); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5542(a). However, nothing supports a similar conclusion for FLSA overtime. The GAO report and House hearings upon which COPRA was based clearly alerted Congress to the availability of FLSA overtime, <em>see </em>GAO 1911 Act Report, at 49, and the text does not support a reading that would exclude recovery under the FLSA for work that is not \u201cofficially assigned.\u201d Given the Supreme Court\u2019s restrictive view of FLSA exemptions, <em>see, e.g., Mitchell, </em>359 U.S. at 295, 79 S.Ct. 756, we conclude that FLSA overtime remains available for Customs inspectors after the enactment of COPRA in situations in which COPRA does not apply. Thus, for \u201cofficially assigned\u201d overtime, COPRA is the exclusive source of remuneration, but for other overtime work suffered or permitted, FLSA remuneration is available.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">In the event we hold\u2014as we do\u2014that COPRA is not exclusive, the government does not challenge the lower court\u2019s finding of liability under FLSA. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 29. Instead, the government challenges the lower court\u2019s conclusion that Customs willfully violated the overtime provisions of FLSA. Where an agency violates FLSA willfully, the ordinary two-year statute of limitations on employee causes of action is extended to three years. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a). Proof of willfulness requires the plaintiffs to show that Customs \u201ceither knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute.\u201d <em>McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co., </em>486 U.S. 128, 133, 108 S.Ct. 1677, 100 L.Ed.2d 115 (1988). In other words, \u201c[i]f an employer acts reasonably in determining its legal obligation, its action cannot be deemed willful ... under the standard [stated above].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135 n. 13, 108 S.Ct. 1677. Similarly, \u201c[i]f an employer acts unreasonably, but not recklessly, in determining its legal obligation, then [its action] should not be ... considered [willful].... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether Customs acted recklessly, as opposed to unreasonably, is a question of fact which we review for clear error. <em>See Adams, </em>350 F.3d at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">In finding that Customs had in fact acted willfully, the court below relied upon extensive testimony to establish that Customs knew the plaintiffs were working off duty without compensation, as well as an internal memo predicting that such work \u201ccould open Customs management to compensation issues because the CEOs are using their off duty time to meet Customs requirements.\u201d <em>Bull II, </em>at 274. The court also found that the Jacksta memorandum (directing that previously off-duty work was to be performed during working hours) was \u201can admission by defendant that it knew it had been engaging in activity in possible violation of the FLSA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274. This evidence is plainly sufficient to support a finding of willfulness. Furthermore, we have considered the arguments in opposition presented by the government, and find that those arguments amount to nothing more than an attempt to have us re-weigh the evidence weighed below. That is not our role on appeal. Therefore, because we find no clear error, we affirm the lower court\u2019s finding of willfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">As noted earlier, we do not decide in this case whether any of the work in question is \u201cofficially assigned.\u201d If the work had been officially assigned, recovery for this work under FLSA at the rate of three times the base rate (the standard overtime rate of 150% doubled for willful violations) would be precluded by paragraph (c)(2) of COPRA. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 267(c)(2). However, the government specifically disclaimed at oral argument any suggestion that the work here was officially assigned. <em>See </em>Oral Argument, at 2:12, 4:43.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">The government next challenges the lower court\u2019s award of liquidated damages. Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260, \u201cif the employer shows to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission giving rise to such action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the [FLSA], the court may, in its sound discretion, award no liquidated damages.\u201d \u201cThe burden rests on the government to establish its good faith and the reasonable grounds for its decision.\u201d <em>Adams, </em>350 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>F.3d at <em>1226. </em>Because the lower court has broad statutory discretion, we review its decision for abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">The court below relied upon the same facts in determining that Customs did not act in good faith as it did in determining that Customs acted willfully. Because such determinations are closely intertwined, reliance upon the same evidence for both is not necessarily problematic. <em>See id. </em>at 1229. As we held above, we likewise hold here that the evidence was sufficient, and the court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. As such, the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding liquidated damages. Furthermore, we note that the government\u2019s arguments in favor of its good faith compliance with FLSA reveal its view, prior to issuance of the Jacksta memorandum, about the nature of the overtime work at issue. The government contended that \u201can awareness that towels are dirtied and then cleaned is separate from awareness from how the towels become clean.\u201d <em>Bull II, </em>at 241. This argument, correctly dismissed as specious by the Court of Federal Claims, is revealing. Far from \u201cofficially assigned\u201d overtime work, the government sought to treat the circumstances of cleaning of the towels as something of which it was not even aware. That Customs suffered this work to be performed is indisputable.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">With respect to the determination below that the plaintiffs are entitled to two hours of compensation per week for the time they spent laundering towels, the government contends that the trial court erred because the plaintiffs were \u201cwaiting to be engaged,\u201d as opposed to being \u201cengaged to wait,\u201d during the downtime between loading and unloading the washer and dryer. <em>See Skidmore, 323 </em>U.S. at 137, 65 S.Ct. 161. In particular, the government argues that \u201c[g]iven the variety of personal activities that plaintiffs could and did perform while the towels were in the washer and dryer <em>[e.g., </em>eating, reading, watching television, etc.], Customs did not significantly restrict their activities for two hours.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 30. At most, the government continues, the plaintiffs should be awarded fifteen minutes of compensation for their weekly laundry duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">Because the government does not challenge the lower court\u2019s findings of fact, we review the compensability under FLSA of the plaintiffs\u2019 downtime <em>de novo. See Huskey v. Trujillo, </em>302 F.3d 1307, 1310 (Fed.Cir.2002) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>the compensability of on-call time under FEPA). Under that standard of review, we conclude that the plaintiffs were \u201cengaged to wait\u201d because their activities during the downtime were significantly limited by their need to monitor their running washers\u2014appliances capable of overflowing\u2014 and running dryers\u2014appliances capable of causing fires. Indeed, as the Court of Federal Claims found, CEOs generally remained at or near their home laundering facilities during the cleaning cycles. <em>Bull II, </em>at 241. Therefore, we affirm the award of two hours per week for laundering towels.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Finally, we address the government\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in awarding three plaintiffs 1.5 hours per week for the construction of training aid containers even though those three plaintiffs testified that they spent less than that amount of time performing that duty. However, the government has not cited any authority for the proposition that damage awards cannot exceed the amount requested by the plaintiff. Thus, we find no reason to disturb the award of 1.5 hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">In sum, and for the reasons stated above, we affirm decision of the Court of Federal Claims in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-7\">.
