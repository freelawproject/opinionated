The Hammitts argue that this constituted a taking of their leasehold, warranting just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. The Court of Federal Claims held that the only path of relief for the Hammitts was in the district court and regional circuit in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983, and not in the Court of Federal Claims. We affirm the dismissal on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">In 1999 the Hammitts entered into a 25-year lease agreement with Phillip Mark Vaughan for certain real property including a house in Gastonia, North Carolina, in which the Hammitts lived (\u201cthe Gastonia Property\u201d). The lease agreement contained a first option to purchase the property. In 2001 the Hammitts attempted to exercise the purchase option after Mr. Vaughan was indicted and charged with various racketeering-type federal crimes. Mr. Vaughan refused to sell the property to the Hammitts. They filed a quiet title claim in the Superior Court of Gaston County on April 30, 2003, and obtained a default judgment on June 3, 2003 when Mr. Vaughan failed to respond, apparently due to his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">On May 30, 2003, while the quiet title case was pending in Gaston County, the United States filed a complaint under the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981 <em>et seq., </em>in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, seeking civil forfeiture <em>in rem </em>of various properties associated with Mr. Vaughan, including the Gastonia Property. The notice of proposed forfeiture was posted on the Gastonia Property where the Hammitts were residing, and stated that \u201ca person asserting an interest in seized property ... shall file an answer to the Government\u2019s complaint for forfeiture not later than 20 days after the date of the filing of the claim.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">The Hammitts filed a \u201cVerified Statement of Interest and Show Cause\u201d in the district court on June 20, 2003, but did not directly file an answer to the complaint, and in any event exceeded the 20-day response period by one day. The Ham-mitts\u2019 argument was that their state adjudication of property rights controlled, and they concurrently sought to enforce their quiet title judgment in state court. The district court held the Hammitts in default under the forfeiture statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">The statute contains an \u201cinnocent owner defense,\u201d \u00a7 983(d), that \u201cAn innocent owner\u2019s interest in property shall not be forfeited under any civil forfeiture statute.\u201d \u00a7 983(d)(1). The statute provides no additional procedure for innocent owners who receive actual notice for the filing of the complaint for forfeiture of the 20-day statutory period for answering the complaint. The Hammitts unsuccessfully petitioned the district court and appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals by way of mandamus motion, which the court denied. <em>In re Hammitt, </em>81 Fed.Appx. 790 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">On October 26, 2004 the federal district court issued final judgment to the United States for civil forfeiture of the Gastonia Property, and on March 11, 2005 the district court ordered the Hammitts to vacate the Gastonia Property. They resisted, and only after contempt proceedings were brought (apparently at the initiative of the holder of the mortgage, whose interest in the property had been timely asserted and had been recognized by the district court), did they vacate the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">On April 7, 2005 the Hammitts filed a Fifth Amendment takings claim in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking just compensation for the taking by the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>States of their leasehold and option interest in the Gastonia Property. The Court of Federal Claims held that the only remedy available to the Hammitts was through the district court and the proceedings provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983. The Hammitts do not now dispute that the district court had authority to order the <em>in rem </em>forfeiture of the Gastonia Property. However, they argue that their constitutional claim cannot be preempted, and that the government\u2019s taking of their property interest, although there was no wrongdoing on their part, raises an issue of Fifth Amendment taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The Court of Federal Claims applied <em>Vereda, Ltda. v. United States, </em>271 F.3d 1367 (Fed.Cir.2001), which held, in connection with the forfeiture provision in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a), that when \u201ca \u2018specific and comprehensive scheme for administrative and judicial review\u2019 is provided by Congress, the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 Tucker Act jurisdiction over the subject matter covered by the scheme is preempted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1375 (quoting <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center v. United States, </em>32 F.3d 548, 549-50 (Fed.Cir.1994)). The Court of Federal Claims held that the provisions in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983 meets the criteria of being \u201cspecific and comprehensive,\u201d that they provide for notice and the opportunity to respond in the district court, and that Tucker Act jurisdiction is preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Applying <em>Vereda, </em>the Court of Federal Claims correctly held that whether the Hammitts\u2019 participation was adequate and timely, and whether the adjudications were correct, are not subject to collateral review by the Court of Federal Claims. The forfeiture statute provides reasonable procedures, and the Hammitts\u2019 claim was presented, in mandamus petition, to the cognizant circuit court of appeals. There remains no basis for Tucker Act jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-16\">. <em>Hammitt v.
