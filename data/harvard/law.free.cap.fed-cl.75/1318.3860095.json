The trial court dismissed the cause of action upon finding under Rule 19 of the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d) that the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma (\u201cCNO\u201d) is both a necessary and an indispensable party that cannot be joined in the action because of the CNO\u2019s governmental sovereign immunity. <em>United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians of Oklahoma v. United States, </em>67 Fed.Cl. 695 (Fed.Cl.2005). Because we find that the trial court erred in finding the CNO a \u201cnecessary\u201d party under RCFC 19(a), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">The underlying dispute in this case derives from The Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations Claims Settlement Act, Pub.L. No. 107-331, 116 Stat. 2845 (2002) (codified at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1779-1779g) (\u201cSettlement Act\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d). This Settlement Act was enacted by Congress to resolve a dispute brought in 1989 in the Court of Federal Claims by the CNO, Choctaw, and Chickasaw tribes (the \u201csettling tribes\u201d) in which the three tribes alleged that the federal government had mismanaged the Arkansas Riverbed Lands of Oklahoma (\u201cRiverbed Lands\u201d) held in trust by the federal government. <em>See </em>United States Court of Federal Claims, Case Nos. 218-89L and 630-89L (Cl.Ct. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">The 1989 suit proceeded slowly and was stayed indefinitely pending quiet title actions that the federal government intended to bring against non-Indian occupants who occupied certain portions of the Riverbed Lands. This court in <em>Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 1413, 1414-15 (Fed.Cir.1997), vacated the trial court\u2019s stay. In March of 2000, the UKB submitted an amicus brief urging dismissal of the case, claiming it was a necessary and an indispensable party to the litigation. In early 2000, the CNO, Choctaw, and Chickasaw began settlement discussions with the federal government to draft federal legislation settling the mismanagement claims brought in the 1989 suit and extinguishing all tribal claims to certain portions of the Riverbed Lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-17\">The settlement discussions between the government and the CNO, Choctaw, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>Chickasaw resulted in legislation enacted as the Settlement Act, which resolved the pending 1989 litigation. The Act specifically refers to the three named settling tribes\u2014the CNO, Choctaw, and Chickasaw who were parties to the 1989 suit\u2014collectively as the \u201cIndian Nations.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1779b. The Settlement Act identifies the \u201cRiverbed Lands\u201d to include the \u201cDrybed Lands,\u201d \u201cDisclaimed Drybed Lands,\u201d and \u201cWetbed Lands.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>One of the major reasons the federal government agreed to pursue the settlement was to avoid thousands of quiet title actions it would have had to bring against non-Indian landowners in portions of the Drybed Lands that those landowners had occupied and economically developed. As the Act explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-4\">Much of the Indian Nations\u2019 Drybed Lands have been occupied by a large number of adjacent landowners in Oklahoma. Without Federal legislation, further litigation against thousands of such landowners would be likely and any final resolution of disputes would take many years and entail great expenses to the United States, the Indian Nations, and the individuals and entities occupying the Drybed Lands and would seriously impair long-term economic planning and development for all parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">The Settlement Act was enacted to resolve all possible claims involving the Riverbed Lands, including all the claims brought against the United States by the three settling tribes in the 1989 suit and all claims brought by any non-settling Indian tribes. Specifically, the Settlement Act resolves two distinct categories of claims. The first category of claims resolved by the Act includes claims for mismanagement of the Riverbed Lands, which lands were held in trust by the United States. The second category of claims resolved by the Act includes claims for the extinguishment by the United States of any right, title, or interest in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands. The Settlement Act explains its purposes in regards to these two categories of claims as applied to the three settling tribes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-9\">The purposes of this title are to resolve all claims that have been or could have been brought by the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations against the United States, and to confirm that the Indian Nations are forever disclaiming any right, title, or interest in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, which are contiguous to the channel of the Arkansas River as of the date of the enactment of this title in certain townships in eastern Oklahoma.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-10\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779a.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Thus, with respect to the three settling tribes, the Settlement Act accomplishes two purposes: first, it extinguishes any claims against the federal government for mismanagement of any of the Riverbed Lands; and second, it extinguishes any right, title, or interest in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands (those Drybed Lands that non-Indians had occupied and developed).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">In exchange for settling the two categories of claims (settlement of the claims of mismanagement of all the Riverbed Lands and extinguishment of all entitlements to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands), the three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>settling tribes named in the Settlement Act received a combined compensation of $40 million from the United States. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779c. Of the $40 million, fifty percent, or $20 million, was authorized for and appropriated to the CNO. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779c(c), (d). Under the Settlement Act, the $40 million award was to be appropriated to three separate trust fund accounts corresponding to each of the three named Indian tribes in $10 million dollar allotments over four years, from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2007. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">The Settlement Act, under \u00a7 1779f, also establishes a procedure to resolve any claims brought by any other Indian tribe not named in the Act as one of the three settling tribes, if the claims are brought under the Act and relate to the Riverbed Lands. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779f (entitled \u201cRelease of Other Tribal Claims and Filing of Claims\u201d). The Settlement Act refers to all other non-settling Indian tribes as \u201cclaimant tribe[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779f(a)(l)(A). By its terms, \u00a7 1779f does not apply to the CNO, Choctaw, and Chickasaw tribes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">In keeping with the overall purpose of the Settlement Act to extinguish all claims against the United States with regard to the Riverbed Lands, \u00a7 1779f attempts to annul all claims brought by all non-settling tribes if the claims fall within the same two categories of claims that the Settlement Act resolves with respect to the three settling tribes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-7\">Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this title, any claimant tribe that claims that any title, interest, or entitlement held by the claimant tribe <em>has been extinguished by operation of section 605(a) [25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1779c(a) ] or section 608(a) [25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1779f(a) ] </em>may file a claim against the United States relating to the extinguishment in the United States Court of Federal Claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779f(b)(l)(A) (emphasis added). Incorporating by reference \u00a7 1779c(a) into \u00a7 1779f, the Settlement Act effectively extinguished non-settling Indian tribe claims that fell within the first category of claims\u2014claims for mismanagement of the Riverbed Lands: \u201cNo claims may be asserted in the future against the United States ... for actions taken or failed to have been taken by the United States for events occurring prior to the date of the extinguishment of claims with respect to the Riverbed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779e(a). Likewise, \u00a7 1779f(a) extinguished non-settling Indian tribe claims that fall within the second category of claims\u2014claims for the extinguishment of all right, title, or interest in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-10\">[A]ll right, title, and interest of any Indian nation or tribe other than any Indian Nation defined [in this Act] ... in or to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, and any such right, title, or interest held by the United States on behalf of such a claimant tribe, shall be considered extin-. guished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779f(a)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">Significantly, all claims brought by non-settling Indian tribes that fall within the two categories of claims described in the Settlement Act were extinguished by operation of law on the date the Settlement Act was enacted, December 13, 2002. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779f(a)(l). The Settlement Act, however, includes a provision that permitted any non-settling tribe to file a claim against the United States for any claims extinguished by the Settlement Act, provided that such an action was filed within 180 days after the date of enactment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779f(b)(l)(A). If a non-settling tribe failed to file a claim under the Settlement Act within the 180-day statute of limitations, the tribe is \u201cbarred from filing any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>claim described\u201d in the Settlement Act. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779f(b)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">To provide compensation to the non-settling Indian tribes for extinguishing all categories of claims covered by the Settlement Act, the statute creates \u201can interest-bearing special holding account\u201d that is funded by ten percent of the funds \u201cthat would otherwise be deposited in a tribal trust account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779f(b)(l)(B). Thus, $2 million of the CNO\u2019s $20 million award deposited in the CNO\u2019s trust account established by the settlement agreement was statutorily set aside for this special holding account. <em>Id. </em>Distribution of the funds in the special holding account depends on whether a claim was filed by a non-settling Indian tribe within the 180-day statute of limitations. If a claim was filed pursuant to \u00a7 1779f(b)(l) of the Act, the funds are not dispersed until a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d is rendered following a \u201cfinal adjudication of that claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1779f(b)(3)(B). According to the Settlement Act, if a final judgment is less than the amount in the special holding account, the remaining funds revert back to the settling tribe trust fund. <em>Id. </em>If a final judgment is more than the amount in the special holding account, the entire account is used to satisfy the judgment and the United States provides any additional funds through a separate congressional appropriation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">\n<em>C.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">The UKB are descendents of the Cherokee people who originally occupied the southeastern portion of the United States in lands presently forming Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and the Carolinas. Through a series of treaties with the United States spanning the period from approximately 1817 to 1906, the Cherokee Indians were granted and re-located to lands now including the state of Oklahoma. The UKB claims that as a tribe of the Cherokee people, it can sue under \u00a7 1779f of the Settlement Act as a \u201cclaimant tribe\u201d (or non-settling tribe) to recover damages from the federal government\u2019s mismanagement of the Riverbed Lands and extinguishment of any right, title, and interest in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, which lands were held in trust by the government for all the tribes of the Cherokee.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">The UKB filed the complaint in this action under \u00a7 1779f(b)(l) on June 10, 2003, within the period of the 180-day statute of limitations. All of the claims in the UKB\u2019s complaint fall within the two categories of claims permitted by the Settlement Act to be brought against the United States by a non-settling tribe. Count I of the UKB\u2019s complaint seeks compensation for the extinguishment of all right, title, and interest to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, as permitted under \u00a7 1779f(a) of the Settlement Act, which describes the second category of claims. Counts II through VI of the UKB\u2019s complaint seek damages for breaches of the federal government\u2019s fiduciary duties with respect to the Riverbed Lands and the minerals therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">The UKB is the only non-settling tribe to file a complaint under the Settlement Act. In fact, \u00a7 1779f of the Settlement Act was included on behalf of the UKB:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-10\">Several months ago, United Keetowah [sic] Band of Cherokee Indians, UKB, filed a motion to intervene in the Court of Federal Claims lawsuit. Although this motion was denied, the Department of Justice expressed reluctance to endorse H.R. 3534 [the Settlement Act] unless it was drafted to preclude the UKB from either bringing quiet title actions or from petitioning the United States to bring such actions. In order to ensure the UKB was not left without a remedy for pursuing its claims, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>Justice Department proposed that the bill be amended to allow the UKB to pursue such claims in an action in the Court of Federal Claims. In addition, the Justice Department suggested that H.R. 3534 be amended to reserve some portion of the settlement proceeds until any claims that can be raised by the UKB are fully and finally litigated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">148 Cong. Rec. S11725-01 (daily ed., Nov. 20, 2002) (remarks of Senator Inhofe). The legislative history indicates that due to the UKB\u2019s attempt to intervene and dismiss the original 1989 lawsuit brought by the three settling tribes, which lawsuit triggered the negotiations that led to the Settlement Act, the federal government demanded that \u00a7 1779f be included in the Settlement Act for the UKB\u2019s benefit before it agreed to a final settlement. The federal government required \u00a7 1779f as part of the Settlement Act in order to receive its part of the bargain in the settlement that it would not be sued by any non-settling Indian tribes on claims similar to those resolved by the Settlement Act. There is no dispute that the CNO, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations consented and agreed to include \u00a7 1779f in the Settlement Act and that the CNO specifically agreed to the financial provisions including the $2 million special holding account.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The Settlement Act was enacted on December 13, 2002, thereby simultaneously barring the UKB from bringing a mismanagement suit against the United States and extinguishing the UKB\u2019s title to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands. Pursuant to \u00a7 1779f(b) of the Act, the UKB filed this action in the Court of Federal Claims seeking compensation for the extinguishment of all right, title, and interest in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands and for the federal government\u2019s mismanagement of the Riverbed lands. The UKB is the only tribe to file an action under \u00a7 1779f of the Settlement Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">On September 7, 2004, the CNO filed a motion in this action for limited intervention as of right under RCFC 24(a) for the sole purpose of filing a motion to dismiss under RCFC 19. In its motion to intervene and motion to dismiss, the CNO argues that it is the sole titleholder of all Riverbed Lands identified in the Settlement Act and that therefore it is a necessary and an indispensable party to the present action. The CNO further argues that the UKB\u2019s claims are essentially claims against the CNO over which the Court of Federal Claims has no jurisdiction because of the CNO\u2019s sovereignty. The Court of Federal Claims granted the CNO the right to intervene under RCFC 24(a) and found the CNO a \u201cnecessary\u201d and an \u201cindispensable\u201d party under RCFC 19. Because the court found the CNO an indispensable party that could not be joined because of its sovereignty, it concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the action and dismissed the case. <em>UKB, </em>67 Fed.Cl. at 704. The court entered a final judgment on September 19, 2005. We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">The CNO contends that it is both necessary and indispensable to the UKB\u2019s action and that the UKB\u2019s cause of action should be dismissed under RCFC 19<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because the CNO cannot be joined to the suit because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>of its sovereignty. The trial court granted both the CNO\u2019s motion to intervene as of right under RCFC 24(a) and the CNO\u2019s motion to dismiss under RCFC 19.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">Under RCFC 19, a court must perform a two-step analysis in determining whether a claim should be dismissed for failure to join an indispensable party. First, under RCFC 19(a), the court must determine whether the absent party is \u201cnecessary.\u201d If an absent party is \u201cnecessary\u201d but cannot be joined, the court must then determine under RCFC 19(b) whether the case should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">RCFC 19(a) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-6\">A person ... shall be joined as a party in the action if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-7\">(1) in the person\u2019s absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-8\">(2) <em>the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action </em>and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person\u2019s absence may</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-9\">(i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person\u2019s ability to protect that interest or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-10\">(ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">(Emphasis added). This circuit has not decided whether RCFC 19(a) determinations by the Court of Federal Claims are reviewable <em>de novo </em>or for abuse of discretion. We see no need to decide the issue here because we can reverse the trial court\u2019s decision under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">The parties do not dispute that under RCFC 19(a)(1) complete relief can be accorded without joining the CNO as a party. Accordingly, we do not address this provision. However, under RCFC 19(a)(2), we hold that the CNO does not claim an \u201cinterest relating to the subject\u201d of the UKB\u2019s action, which action was filed under and can be resolved by the Settlement Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-16\">While this court has not directly defined the \u201cinterest\u201d requirement of RCFC 19(a)(2), this court has defined the equivalent \u201cinterest\u201d requirement for intervention of right under RCFC 24(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In order to be joined as a party to a pending action under RCFC 24(a), the absent party\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d must be \u201cof such a <em>direct </em>and <em>immediate </em>character that the [absent party] will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment.\u201d <em>Am. Mar. Transp., Inc. v. United States, 870 </em>F.2d 1559, 1561 (Fed.Cir.1989) (emphasis in original). We elaborated in <em>American Maritime </em>that the interest \u201cmay not be either indirect or contingent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-17\">We hold that our application of the \u201cinterest\u201d requirement under RCFC 24(a) applies similarly to RCFC 19(a)(2). Thus, an absent party that claims it is \u201cnecessary\u201d under RCFC 19(a)(2) to adjudicate an action must show that its \u201cinterest\u201d in the subject matter of the underlying action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>is not \u201cindirect or contingent\u201d but is \u201cof such a direct and immediate character that the [absent party] will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our understanding of the \u201cinterest\u201d required in RCFC 19(a)(2) is supported by a majority of circuits that have addressed this issue. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>192 F.3d 951, 959 (10th Cir.1999) (holding that the \u201cinterest\u201d claimed by the non-party cannot be \u201cfabricated\u201d or \u201cfrivolous\u201d); <em>In re Torcise, </em>116 F.3d 860 (11th Cir.1997) (finding that the non-party did not have an \u201cinterest\u201d in the action because the underlying causes of action were different); <em>Ramah Navajo Sch.

The court concluded that \u201c[t]he Cherokee Nation rightfully claims that ... it is the titleholder to both the drybed and wetbed lands that are at issue in this case\u201d and that \u201cany decision regarding the UKB\u2019s interest in the lands would directly implicate the [CNO\u2019s] interest in the same lands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700, 701. The trial court found this \u201cinterest\u201d to be a legally protectable interest sufficient to confer \u201cnecessary\u201d party status to the CNO. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">The court went on to analyze whether the CNO\u2019s interest would be adversely impacted if the CNO was absent from the litigation. The court concluded that because the UKB claimed an interest in the same Riverbed Lands to which the CNO claimed exclusive title, the action could adversely affect the CNO\u2019s ability to exercise sovereignty over the Riverbed Lands. <em>Id. </em>at 701. In so finding, the trial court further concluded that the pending litigation was really a dispute over competing claims to the same property and in such litigation, \u201cone party\u2019s attempt to litigate the claim may impair or impede[ ] the other party\u2019s interest in the same property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, the court determined that the CNO was situated as required by RCFC 19(a) so that \u201cits interest in the Riverbed lands may be impaired or impeded by this litigation\u201d and that the CNO was therefore necessary to the UKB\u2019s litigation related to claims regarding these lands. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">We conclude that the trial court erred in finding the CNO a necessary party to the UKB\u2019s suit because the CNO does not claim an interest relating to the subject of the UKB\u2019s action. Unlike the trial court, we do not begin our analysis under RCFC 19(a)(2) by characterizing the CNO\u2019s \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>terest.\u201d Rule 19(a)(2) requires that the \u201cinterest\u201d claimed by the absent party \u201cre-latte] to the subject of the action.\u201d Thus, the proper analysis to determine whether an absent party has an \u201cinterest\u201d under Rule 19(a)(2) sufficient to permit intervention in a pending action must begin by correctly characterizing the pending action between those already parties to the action. Hence, our analysis under Rule 19(a)(2) begins by characterizing the UKB\u2019s action because it is the UKB\u2019s action that is \u201cthe subject of the action\u201d in which the CNO must have an \u201cinterest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">The CNO claims and the trial court found that the subject of the UKB\u2019s action is the UKB\u2019s claim that it is a successor in interest in the Riverbed Lands themselves. We find, however, that the subject matter of the UKB\u2019s action is the statutory extinguishment of the UKB\u2019s claims by the government, which extinguishment occurred by virtue of the enactment of the Settlement Act and for which the UKB seeks compensation from the federal government. It is not, as the CNO contends and as the trial court agreed, an action to establish title to the Riverbed Lands themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The UKB\u2019s action arises under the provisions of the Settlement Act. The Act strictly limits the claims that non-settling tribes can bring against the federal government to: 1) claims under \u00a7 1779c(a) for pre-Settlement Act mismanagement of the Riverbed Lands; and 2) claims incurred under \u00a7 1779f(a), which provision immediately extinguished non-settling tribes\u2019 interests in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands. Significantly, an action filed under the Settlement Act by a non-settling tribe may be filed only in the Court of Federal Claims and may demand only monetary eompensation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Act expressly prohibits adjudication of current title to any portion of the Riverbed Lands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-10\">This title shall not be construed to resolve any right, title, or interest of any Indian nation or of any claimant tribe, except their past, present, or future claims relating to right, title, or interest in or to the Riverbed and the obligations and liabilities of the United States thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1779g. Thus, the Act only permits parties to sue the federal government for monetary damages and prohibits resolution of any claims of title to the Riverbed Lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">The UKB filed the present action against the United States under \u00a7 1779f of the Settlement Act, which authorizes non-settling tribes to seek compensation from the federal government for the two categories of claims extinguished by the Settlement Act. In Count I of its complaint, the UKB seeks compensation for extinguishment of its interest in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, which count arises under \u00a7 1779f(a) of the Act. In Counts II-VI of its complaint, the UKB seeks compensation for mismanagement by the United States of the Riverbed Lands, which counts fall under \u00a7 1779e(a) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">As we find that the \u201csubject\u201d of the UKB\u2019s action is limited to claims permitted under the Settlement Act, we consequently find that the CNO does not have \u201can interest relating to\u201d the UKB\u2019s statutory claims. The \u201cinterest\u201d the CNO alleges and that it claims is \u201crelated\u201d to the subject matter of the UKB\u2019s statutory action is its interest in retaining its alleged exclusive rights to the Riverbed Lands. However, the CNO\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d in retaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>exclusive rights to the Riverbed Lands is an \u201cindirect\u201d and a \u201ccontingent\u201d interest to the UKB\u2019s statutory claims against the federal government. <em>See Am. Mar. Tramp., </em>870 F.2d at 1561. The CNO will not \u201cgain or lose\u201d title to lands that it alleges ownership over if the trial court awards the UKB monetary damages under the Settlement Act. See id.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Moreover, because the Settlement Act permits and the UKB\u2019s claims are limited to only money damages, the CNO does not have a \u201clegally protectable interest\u201d in the UKB\u2019s statutorily extinguished claims. In American <em>Maritime, </em>we required the \u201clegally protectable interest\u201d to be \u201c \u2018one which the <em>substantive </em>law recognizes as belonging to or being owned by the applicant.\u2019 \u201d 870 F.2d at 1562 (quoting <em>New Orleans Pub. Serv. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., </em>732 F.2d 452, 464 (5th Cir.1984)) (emphasis in original). Because the UKB\u2019s action is a claim for damages under a statute, the CNO does not have a sufficient \u201cinterest\u201d under RCFC 19(a) to permit it to intervene as a party who is \u201cnecessary\u201d to adjudicate the UKB\u2019s action against the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">Because we hold that the CNO has not claimed a sufficient \u201cinterest\u201d under Rule 19(a), we need not and do not decide whether the other requirements of Rule 19(a) are met, namely, whether the disposition of the trial court\u2019s action will impair or impede the CNO\u2019s ability to protect its interest. On the bases set forth above, we reverse the finding by the trial court that the CNO is a necessary party and we remand to the Court of Federal Claims for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">\n<em>REVERSED and REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-7\">.

Because the UKB did not appeal the trial court\u2019s grant of the CNO\u2019s motion to intervene as of right under RCFC 24(a), we do not address this issue. We note, however, as does the Rules Advisory Committee to the Fed. R.Civ.P. that Rule 24(a)(2) was drafted as a \"counterpart\u201d to Rule 19(a)(2) and that an applicant is entitled to intervene in an action when his interest is comparable to that of a person that is found \"necessary\u201d under Rule 19(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b955-19\">.

We note that this is consistent with the fact that the Court of Federal Claims is a court of limited jurisdiction that may only award monetary relief except where statutorily provided. <em>See Kanemoto v.

Even though the CNO further argues that it has an \"interest\u201d in the UKB\u2019s action because of a reversionary interest in the funds set off in the special holding account pursuant to \u00a7 1779f, such interest is still contingent rather than direct. We still conclude that the CNO is not a necessary party.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
