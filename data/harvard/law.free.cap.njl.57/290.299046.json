The prosecutor here ruled the Common Pleas to certify what that court found proved in regard to the \u25a0consideration of the contract sued on, and in answer the court certified \u201c a promise in writing to pay the amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Under these circumstances, the court should have decided \u2022that the \u201c contract \u201d was without legal force.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">If the certificate means that there was no consideration for the defendant\u2019s \u201ccontract\u201d except such as might be implied in his written promise to pay, then his \u201ccontract\u201d was <em>nudum pactum, </em>for, outside of commercial paper, unsealed promises do not imply any legal consideration. If it means that what \u2022the state of demand described as the debt of another was merely the written promise of that person to pay, then this was <em>nudum pactum, </em>and could not form a legal consideration for the defendant\u2019s \u201ccontract,\u201d neither of these promises affording any evidence of benefit to the promisor or detriment to the promisee, or to any other person, without which such promises have no legal vitality.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">The judgment of the Common Pleas must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
