L., p. </em>185), the board of aldermen, common council or township committee of any .municipality or township, upon the petition of the directors-of a company incorporated under that act for a location of the tracks of its railway therein, and upon fourteen days\u2019 notice of the time and place at which they would consider such application, published or posted in a specified manner, were empowered and directed, after hearing, to pass an ordinance refusing or granting such location, but the section contained, among other provisos, one which prohibited the passage of an ordinance until the applying company had filed the written consent of the owners of at least one-half of the-property fronting on the portion of the highway through which the railway was to be laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">By an amendatory act approved April 24th, 1888 <em>{Pamph. L., p. </em>541), the eighth section of the original act was amended so as to give like power, with similar restrictions and conditions, to the board of aldermen, common council, board of commissioners, township committee or other governing body of any municipality or township.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">By a further supplement, approved March 27th, 1889 <em>{Pamph. L., p. </em>100), the eighth section was further amended so as to give like power, with similar conditions and restric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Rons, to the board of aldermen, common council or township \u2022committee of any municipality or township. By this amendment, it will be observed, the power to refuse or grant locations for such railways was conferred on the same governing bodies of municipalities and townships on whom it had been \u2022conferred by the original act. The amendment of 1888 was thereby superseded and repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">It appears in the case, by the agreement of the attorneys \u25a0of the parties, that the resolution under review was passed without any notice having been given for a hearing, as required by the legislation above referred to, and that no written consent of the property owners fronting on the highway on which the tracks were located was filed by the railway company.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">It was properly conceded in the argument that no power to pass the resolution complained of existed in the defendant municipality under the acts above cited, because of the \u25a0absence of notice and consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Defendant\u2019s contention is that, by subsequent legislation, it became endowed with powrer to pass the resolution without \u2022giving any notice or hearing, and notwithstanding the want \u2022of the previously required consent of property owners. This force is, it contends, to be attributed to a further supplement to the act first cited, which supplement was approved March '24th, 1890. <em>Pamph. L.,p. </em>113.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">By this act, it is provided that the board of commissioners \u25a0or other authority having control of the streets and highways in any borough or other municipality, shall have all the powers in relation to the location of the tracks of the railway of any company organized under the original act or its supplements as were conferred by said act and supplements \u2022upon the board of aldermen or common council of any municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">On the part of defendant, it is contended that this supplement conferred upon it no new power, but that it is a municipality falling within the classes mentioned in the previous legislation and acquiring powers thereby. In my judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>it is immaterial whether this contention can be sustained, for, if defendant acquired its power in this regard under the-former acts, it was burdened with the conditions and restrictions before set out. If it acquired power under the supplement of 1890, that power is expressly declared to be the-same as that which had been conferred by those acts upon-boards of aldermen and common councils, and their power,.as we have seen, was equally burdened with the same conditions and restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The supplement of 1890 further proceeds to enact that where application for a location is made to any board, committee or other authority having control of the streets and highways in any borough or township, such board, committee- or other authority shall consider said application and grant or refuse the location by a motion or resolution duly passed for-that purpose. Upon this, it is contended for defendant that boroughs and townships are endowed with power to refuse or-grant such locations- without the restrictions and conditions-with which such power is burdened when conferred by this-legislation upon other municipalities. But I cannot yield to-this contention. The purpose of this supplement was to-grant power, with the same restrictions and conditions to-municipalities which were not affected by the previous legislation, or to which there might be do'ubts whether it was-applicable. The clause on which this contention is based is plainly intended, not to change the scope and extent of the powers conferred, but only to alter in certain cases the mode-of their execution. The previous legislation had required all municipalities to exercise this power by ordinance; this-clause was designed to permit the smaller municipalities\u2014 townships and boroughs \u2014 to exercise this power by the less-formal motion or resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The result is that the defendant municipality possessed no power to pass the resolution in question in the absence of the-required notice aud consent of the property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">It is further objected that prosecutor has shown no standing to attack this proceeding. It has been held in this court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>'that, under existing rules, the allowance of a <em>certiorari </em>is an adjudication that the prosecutor therein has a right to the writ, which will maintain his standing in court until it is \u25a0attacked by evidence. <em>Athletic Association </em>v. <em>New Brunswick, </em>26 <em>Vroom </em>279. But the case shows, in my judgment, that prosecutor can maintain this writ. As we have seen, \u25a0notice is required to be given of a hearing before this resolution could lawfully be passed. Such a hearing involves the \u25a0right to object and protest. It appears that the council of the borough fixed a time and place for a hearing, though they gave no notice of it. It also appears that there was subsequently presented to the council the written protest against the grant to the railway of many persons claiming to be citizens and freeholders of the borough. Prosecutor joined in that protest, which was received by the council and placed on file. In my judgment, this brings prosecutor within the rule laid down by the Court of Errors in <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>25 <em>Vroom </em>566, and entitles it to use this writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The result is that the resolution must be vacated and set \u25a0aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
