L., p. </em>506. Under this act of 1894 a new board of education was elected in the month of July, 1894, and on July 26th, 1894, Mr. Smith was appointed principal of the Guttenberg school, at a salary of $90 per month, for ten calendar months, by a vote of five ayes and four nays, and on the opening of the term of the school in September he entered upon the discharge of his duties as principal of said school, by virtue of said appointment from the board of education, and has continued to perform such duties since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-12\">Mr. Fitch has never performed any of the duties as principal, and states himself to be willing to perform such duties, and that he reported for that purpose, but was prevented by the clerk of the board of education, a Mr. Lutz, from so doing; and he also received a letter from the said clerk stating that he did not wish his services, and that Mr. Lutz ordered him out of the building. He also states that he applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the board of education of Guttenberg to put him in charge of the public school, by means of a letter, before the term of school commenced; he has never gone before them as a body, sitting as the board of education and demanded his rights, but has written to them to that effect and through his counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATO\">. He also procured the opinion of the state superintendent of education and the county superintendent of education as to his right to teach under his contract, and both of said opinions were presented to the board of education of the town, and are hereto annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-5\">\u201c Hoboken, N.

I have already given an opinion that Mr. Fitch is the principal of your school, and as such, entitled to the honors and the salary of the position. In this opinion I have been sustained by the state superintendent, and he gave his opinion after consultation with the attorney-gen eral.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-7\">\u201c It will be best in my judgment for you to defer payment until the matter is settled beyond peradventure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-8\">\u201cYours truly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-9\">\u201cG.

L., p. </em>506. Such a choice could give the relator no title to the office, as the power of appointment belonged to the board which would be in existence when the office became vacant. <em>Bownes </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>16 <em>Vroom </em>189.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">There is nothing in the letter of the county superintendent which can entitle the relator to the remedy now sought. <em>Buren </em>v. <em>Albertson, </em>25 <em>Vroom </em>72.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Leave to file an information in the nature of <em>quo warranto </em>should be denied, and the rule to show cause is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
