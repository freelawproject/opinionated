While endeavoring to effect \u25a0this settlement for the Niagara company, Selvage received word from the defendant that whatever settlement was made for the Niagara would be accepted by the defendant, and that he might draw on it for the amount. No such settlement, however, was reached, and on December 21st, 1893, Selvage notified the defendant that the plaintiffs would take nothing but a total loss, and that the Niagara company had been sued. On January 8th, 1894, an action was commenced against the defendant, and the summons was served on Selvage, as its agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">From this brief statement of uncontroverted facts, it is \u25a0clear that, on January 8 th, Selvage was not the agent of defendant corporation for the purpose of receiving a summons or for any purpose. His only connection with it had \u25a0been the contingent one that if he reached a settlement for the Niagara company the defendant would, through him, pay to the plaintiff a like sum of money. When the com-. promise with the Niagara fell through and the defendant \u2022company was notified of this result, which was on December 21st, 1893, all semblance of agency between Selvage and the \u2022defendant was at an end. He no longer had any relation to its business, nor was he under any duty with respect to its affairs. The case bears no likeness to <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Berlin Bridge Co., </em>22 <em>Vroom </em>442, nor is the reasoning of that and similar cases applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The judgment will be vacated and the service of the \u00abummons set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
