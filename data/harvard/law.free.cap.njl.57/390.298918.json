L. </em>1892, <em>p. </em>257) authorizes an appeal from a judgment rendered by the-First District Court of the city of Newark for a sum in <em>excess </em>of \u00a7200.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-7\">Rule to show cause.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b422-8\">Argued at June Term, 1894, before Justices Magie and; Garrison.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-9\">For the relator, <em>James M.

L. </em>1892, <em>p. </em>257. The contention of the relator is that this statute-gives no right of appeal from the judgment-in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">We are unable, however, to see any possible ground for-questioning the defendant\u2019s right to this appeal. The legislature has given it in language so plain and comprehensive-that there is neither room for interpretation or construction. \u201c From any judgment obtained in <em>any </em>District Court established by law in <em>any </em>city of this state, whether by general or-special statute.\u201d Where the amount in dispute is over $25,. \u201c either party may appeal both as to matter of law and fact to the Court of Common Pleas,\u201d &amp;c. Such is the language of the lawmaker. It may be true, as argued, that this act works confusion; that it produces absurd results; that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>never would have been enacted if its consequences had been foreseen, but whence arises any authority in the judicial department to nullify legislative action because of these or similar reasons ?</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Admitting without examination the force of all the relator\u2019s criticisms of this act, it still remains as a perfectly plain and explicit legislative mandate, to be obeyed accordingly until it is repealed by the authority that brought it into existence. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">There is not shown any pretext for judicial interference. The writ of <em>mandamus </em>is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
