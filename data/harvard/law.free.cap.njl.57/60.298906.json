The only effect of the act of March 23d, 1892, entitled \u201cAn act constituting courts for the trial of small causes\u201d [Revision], approved March 27th, 1874 <em>{Pamph. L.} p. </em>182), was to confer on such courts jurisdiction over corporations of other states. The eighteenth section of the Small Cause act, which specifically provides for the mode of serving process on corporations, was not altered.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b92-11\">\u20223. The eighty-eighth section of the Corporation act, which provides for service of process on a foreign corporation not holding its charter \u2022 under the laws of this state <em>{Rev., p. </em>198), applies only to process issued out of the upper courts, and not to justices\u2019 courts.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b92-12\">\u25a04. A summons issued out of the court for the trial of small causes was served on a ticket agent of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>foreign corporation, at its Bahway station. <em>Held, </em>that the ticket agent was not a representative of the company within the designation, of the eighteenth section of the Justice\u2019s Court act.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-5\">On <em>certiorari </em>to the justice\u2019s court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-6\">Argued at June Term, 1894, before Justices Depue, Van Syckel and Reed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b93-7\">Eon the plaintiff in <em>certiorari, William S. Gummere.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b93-8\">\n<em>Contra, William D.

A summons issued out of the court for the trial of small causes must be served as directed by the act, to give the justice jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Prior to the act of 1892 the court for the trial of small causes had no jurisdiction of a suit against a foreign corporation. <em>Wheeler &amp; Wilson Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>24 <em>Vroom </em>336. The act of 1892 simply amended the seventh, section of the Justice\u2019s Court act. That section, as it stood! originally, provided \u201cthat any body politic or corporate, in. this state, may sue or be sued in any court for the trial of small causes in any action or proceeding oyer which said1 court has jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Rev., p. </em>539. The only change-made in this section by the act of 1892 was the inserting in that section, as it originally stood, the words \u201cor of any other state\u201d after the words \u201cany body politic or corporate, in this state.\u201d <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>182. The effect of the latter act was to confer on these courts jurisdiction over corporations of other states. But the eighteenth section of the Small Cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>act, which specifically provides for the mode of serving process on corporations, was not altered. That section was left in the same condition as it was when Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Bennett was decided. The eighty-eighth section of the Corporation act, which provides for service on a foreign \u2022corporation or body corporate not holding its charter under the laws of the state <em>(Rev., p. </em>193), applies only to process issued out of the higher courts, and not to justices\u2019 courts. <em>Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Ditton, </em>7 <em>Vroom </em>361.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The summons in this case was served on Francis Thorne, a ticket agent of the defendant, at the Rahway station. Mr. Thorne was not a representative of the company within the designation of the eighteenth section of the Justice\u2019s Court act. Consequently, the justice had not jurisdiction of the case, and the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
