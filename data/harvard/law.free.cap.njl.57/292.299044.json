L., p. </em>293); and, as we have held that those proceedings are to be instituted in thecouit for the trial of small causes, the prosecutor\u2019s right to relief by <em>certiorari, </em>without appeal to the Common Pleas, can be-based only upon a lack of jurisdiction in the trial court. <em>White </em>v. <em>Neptune City, </em>27 <em>Vroom </em>222.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">We think such a lack of jurisdiction appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">The complainant charges the prosecutor with being engaged in the grocery business and soliciting business and delivering groceries within the limits of the borough, with a wagon drawn by one horse, without having a license from the borough.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">The statute mentioned does not empower boroughs to pass-ordinances for licensing and regulating a business of that character, and only for the violation of ordinances enacted by authority of that statute is the procedure there indicated applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-16\">The proceedings should be set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
