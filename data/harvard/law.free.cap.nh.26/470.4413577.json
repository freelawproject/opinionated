He employed Thomas R. Davis to teach the school for six weeks, and paid him $24 for his services. The district claims this sum on the ground that Davis did not furnish to the superintending committee a register, as required by law. The register furnished the committee was produced, and it appeared not to have been signed, and to be defective in other respects.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-10\">At the time of the payment of the $24, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>was confined to his room by sickness, and Davis produced to him a certificate from the superintending committee, of which the following is a copy: r</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\">\u201c To whom it may concern.

Act of July 8, 1846, \u00a7 2 p. 297; Comp. Laws 179 \u00a7 19. The case finds that he made a report, (called a <em>register </em>in the case,) but it was not signed, and was otherwise defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The f\u00e1ct, then, being, that he did not make such a report as the law required, he was not entitled to .compensation for his services. Whether, if it had not appeared affirmatively that the report was defective, the certificate of the superintending school committee, supposing one to be required, would be competent evidence that such a report was made-as the law required, is a question that need not be determined at present. As we know what the report was, their ' certificate cannot make it anything different from the facts, and those show it to have been defective. Moreover, their certificate is not made in pursuance of any duty imposed on them by law. It is a mere voluntary statement, made by third persons, who could be witnesses, and is essentially hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">As Davis was not entitled to any compensation for his services, of course the defendant was not authorized to pay him. He disposed of the money of the district, contrary to the provisions of the statute. He must account to the district for the money he has paid to Davis, and as he has failed to make any valid defence to the suit, there must be</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
