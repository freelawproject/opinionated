This left the result reached by former Chief Justice Carr in full force and effect. That result taken from the Carr opinion was, at p 60:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\u201cThe writ [of mandamus] will accordingly issue directing the defendant hoard to grant a proper license for the operation of the plaintiff\u2019s Battle Creek pharmacy and drug store.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Secondly, on February 4, 1964, 4 members of the Court, in letter form communication to the clerk, instructed him as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">\u201cFebruary 4,1964</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">\u201cMr. Donald F.

That means the Court is deadlocked with respect to final judgment for or against issuance of writ.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">\u201cIt is hardly necessary to add that, the case being addressed to original rather than appellate jurisdiction, no order or judgment of a subordinate court is before us for affirmance or reversal; also that no vote of a subordinate court judge is involved in any way. Therefore, a majority vote of the Court is requisite to any action by the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">\u201cThe Court being thus deadlocked, issue no writ and enter no judgment.

He did not participate either in the vote for rehearing or in the directions to the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Without rethreshing old straw, it may be fairly said the question which divided this Court was the pre-emption of review of defendant board\u2019s decision by this Court as opposed to review in the manner provided by the administrative procedure act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Three views were expressed in the 4 opinions originally handed down:</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-9\">Chief Justice Carr, joined by Justices Dethmers and Kelly, wrote:</judges>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">\u201cThe conclusion, therefore, follows that if an application for the issuance of a license, of the character here involved, results in a \u2018contested case\u2019 within the meaning of the statute the party claiming to he aggrieved'by the order entered by the agency <em>is not limited, </em>in any case, to the method of review specified <em>but has an election </em>to seek relief by any other means sanctioned by law.\u201d <em>Superx Drugs Corporation </em>v. <em>State Board of Pharmacy, supra, </em>p 54. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Justice Black held as follows and was joined in his result by Justices T. M. Kavanagh and Souris :</judges>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\">\u201cIt is said next, by the Chief Justice, that the plaintiff\u2019s remedy of judicial review \u2014 under the act of 1952 \u2014 is not exclusive, and a portion of the first paragraph of section 8 of the act is quoted as follows :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">\u201c \u2018Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent resort to other means of review, redress, relief or trial <em>de novo, </em>provided by law.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u201cTrue enough, such remedy is not exclusive if another remedy is \u2018provided by law.\u2019 But there is no such \u2018other\u2019 remedy, the present pleadings and record considered. The question again is whether plaintiff\u2019s remedy of review, under section 8, is fully adequate. If it is, no peremptory writ or order should issue as a matter of \u2018policy\u2019 (GrCR1963, 711.2), to say nothing of Toon\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rule, previously quoted.\u201d <em>Superx Drugs Corporation </em>v. <em>State Board of Pharmacy, supra, </em>pp 38,39.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Justice Smith, whom I joined, held that the Court having assumed jurisdiction and by order having required extensive fact-finding proceedings before a circuit judge and having required of him specific findings of fact and recommendations, we were duty-bound to adjudicate the issue finally.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The stalemate resulting from the conflicting directions to the clerk has persisted since February, 1964. Realizing as we did that the judicial dead-center upon which we found ourselves was no credit to us and a disservice to the litigants, a majority of us voted for rehearing. In some cases we did so irrespective of our individual conviction that the effect of our first decision and the denial of rehearing mandated issuance of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">We now here hold, as held by former Chief Justice Carr:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>(1) The right of this Court, as the final judicial arbiter of our State in our discretion to issue a writ of mandamus in any case is restated and reaffirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">With Justice Black in his dissent, we also declare:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">(2) The policy of this Court is to adhere in all but extremely rare instances to the method of review of the decisions of administrative agencies which is provided by specific statutes and covered generally by the administrative procedure act.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">In this case, having assumed jurisdiction, even though contrary to the above presently stated policy, we retain jurisdiction. We direct transmittal to the State board of pharmacy of the record made before Judge Coleman, together with his findings of fact and opinion. We direct the board to proceed to an administrative hearing of this matter. In order that this may be done as expeditiously as possible, counsel for the interested parties may stipulate that the record adduced before Judge Coleman was complete and that no additional factual matter need be added. In such event, the board may proceed to decision on such record or the board may, in its discretion, for the purpose of achieving the full administrative hearing required by statute, supplement said record or conduct such further hearings as may be required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Upon completion of said administrative hearing, the board shall make its determination whether or not to issue a pharmacy license to plaintiff. In the event any party desires to appeal from said determination, appeal would normally be taken in accordance with the duly authorized statutory procedure  to the circuit court. Upon proper application to this Court, in accordance with GrCR 1963, 711, this Court could thereupon determine whether to grant leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>appeal directly to it. However, since this Court is retaining jurisdiction of this matter, should any party desire to appeal, appeal may be taken directly to this Court without application for leave to do so. In the event no appeal is taken within 20 days of the issuance of decision by the board of pharmacy, said decision shall be final.</p>\n<judges id=\"b365-5\">Dethmers, Kelly, Smith, and Adams, JJ., concurred with O\u2019Hara, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b365-6\">Black, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auh\">Successive conferences following our order for rehearing leave me the more convinced that the attorney general was right \u2014 from the very start \u2014when he insisted that plaintiff\u2019s instant petition for mandamus should be denied as an unconcealed effort to bypass the administrative procedure act (CLS 1961, \u00a7 24.101 <em>et seq. </em>[Stat Ann 1961 feev \u00a7 3.560 (21.1) <em>et seq.])</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Our order of October 30, 1962, directing that the circuit court take proofs as on framed issues of fact, and our subsequent order of January 28,1963, directing that the circuit court determine such framed issues of fact and make due report thereof to this Court, were \u2014 the foregoing considered \u2014 ill-advised as well as improvident. When a judicial error of such magnitude is discovered, and then is swept under the Court\u2019s rug upon pretense of its nonexistence, it is always compounded into bad law. All similarly situated litigants have a right now to say: \u201cIf, in the face of the specific question having been raised at the outset, the Supreme Court is going to let Superx bypass review under the administrative procedure act, have we not a right to the same benison?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>My former opinion (372 Mich at 43, 44) concluded this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\">\u201cAccepting plaintiff\u2019s petition as having sued out certiorari to the defendant board, I conclude that the defendant board\u2019s determination of September 26, 1962, should be vacated, and that the record should be remanded to such board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. I would enter an order accordingly, awarding no costs, and at the same time would enter a separate order continuing in effect the quoted portion of our said order of October 16, 1962, until final determination is made, either by the defendant board or by a court of review, of all issues that are properly presented to and decided by the board upon remand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">I cast the same vote on rehearing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b366-6\">T.
