As held by this court in Burns v. State, 25 Wyo. 491, 503, 173 Pac. 785, 786 \u201cthe petitioner, not being a party to the cause, and ashing to appear only as amicus curiae, is not entitled to file a petition for a rehearing, at least without the consent of the parties.\u201d If such a consent would confer a right to file the petition, none is here shown, nor has any party to the cause filed a petition for rehearing. The former client of counsel was interested only as administrator, and that part of the decree complained of, which settled and approved said administrator\u2019s final account, was affirmed; indeed, there was no controversy concerning said account. The plaintiff in error was claiming the entire estate as against the claim of one of the defendants in error, and pending the proceedings in error she had become administratrix of the estate, succeeding the deceased administrator. Concerning the administrator\u2019s account, we said in the original opinion (226 Pac. 452, 455) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff in error neither claimed a right nor manifested a desire to object to the administrator\u2019s accounts, and as it is clear that she was not prejudiced by their approval, the decree in settlement of those accounts should be affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">And an order to that effect was entered in this, court. In view of recent decisions of this court, it might be at least questionable also whether the administrator, as such, would have any interest in the determination of the matters in dispute relating to the distribution of the estate. Black\u2019s Estate (Wyo.) 216 Pac. 1059, 1063; Church v. Quiner, (Wyo.) 224 Pac. 1073. If the court might grant a rehearing upon its own motion, we are not inclined to do that, nor do we see any good reason therefor. The cause was well presented by oral argument and upon briefs at the original hearing, and the court\u2019s conclusions were the result of mature deliberation upon a careful consideration of the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>tory provisions involved and tbe authorities bearing upon the questions considered. The petition for rehearing will, therefore, be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\">\n<em>Rehearing Denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b31-4\">Blume and Kimball, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
