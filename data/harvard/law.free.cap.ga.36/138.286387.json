Tucker and Henry J. Dickinson, of Savannah, Georgia, executed and delivered their joint and several bond, in the usual form, in the sum of $107,300.00 to Henry Laurens Toomer, of Charleston, South Carolina. The condition of said bond was that said Tucker and Dickinson should pay, or cause to be paid, to said Toomer, his executors, administrators, or assigns, the sum of $53,650.00, to be paid as follows: $17,833.33 1st January, 1861; $17,833.33 1st January, 1862; $17,833.33 1st January, 1863, with interest annually from the date of the bond on the whole amount unpaid, until the whole principal and any interest that may become due and unpaid shall both be paid and satisfied fully*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQ\">[On this bond the following payments were afterwards endorsed : 5th January, 1859, $3,750.50, for interest up to 1st instant; $3,750.50 10th January, 1860, interest to 1st Jan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>uary, 1860; $3,823.37 on account of interest to 1st December, 1861; and three hundred dollars on account of principal, April, 1862; $3,545.50 on account of interest for one year* and $650.00 on account of principal, January 3d, 1863; and $3,508.05 for one year\u2019s interest January 12th, 18-67. Each of these endorsements was dated at Charleston, and signed by H. Laurens Toomer.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-4\">On the said first day of December, 1857, said Tucker made and delivered to said Toomer his mortgage deed, in usual form, whereby he conveyed to said Toomer, &amp;c., a part of the plantation named Drakie\u2019s, then lately purchased by William C. Daniel of J. A. Eraser, describing it by metes and bounds, for the purpose of securing the payment of said bond, and conditioned to be void upon such payment. This mortgage was recorded in Savannah 8th December, 1857, and in Charleston, South Carolina, 23d December, 1857. At May Term, 1866, of Chatham Superior Court, a <em>rule nisi </em>was had, calling on said mortgagor to show cause why said mortgage should not be absolutely foreclosed, and his equity of redemption be taken away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\">The mortgagor for cause showed that said mortgage should be credited with the sums of money paid at the times and place stated in said endorsement; partial failure of consideration in this : that said bond was given for ninety-one negro slaves sold by said plaintiff to said defendant on the 24th November, 1857, and that on the 11th December\u2019, 1864, said slaves, or the survivors and increase of them, were captured by the military forces of the United States from out of defendant\u2019s possession, and emancipated and set at large without defendant\u2019s consent, in said county, and that afterwards, while said negroes were so out of defendant\u2019s possession, to wit: in the year 1865, by the concurrent action of the Governments of the United States and the State of Georgia1, said capture and emancipation of said negroes were legalized, and thus said defendant wholly lost the property and services of said negroes; that without the fault of the defendant, and by reason of the late war between the United States and the Confederate States, and the consequent emancipation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>slaves, it became impossible for said defendant to perform the condition of said bond, and that such impossibility was equivalent to a performance thereof to the extent of the balance unpaid thereon on the 11th December, 1864; that on or about the 16th day of September, 1864, he was able and willing to pay, and then offered to pay, said balance in the money then current in the Confederate States, but that said plaintiff refused to receive said currency, only and solely on the ground that he could not invest the amount profitably; and that defendant was then willing and ready to deliver up said slaves, or a sufficiency of them, to said plaintiff, in discharge of said balance; but that the refusal of the plaintiff to take said currency, which was then the only obtainable and circulating currency, and the terms in which said refusal was conveyed, excused said defendant from further offer to perform, under the results of said war, the. emancipation aforesaid, and the destruction of said currency, except, perhaps, as to the. interest due on the bond; and last, that the debt, to secure which said bond and mortgage were executed, was contracted in South Carolina, in consideration of certain ninety-one negro slaves, to wit: on the 25th November, 1857, which was to be consummated by a mortgage on said slaves, and also personal security and the mortgage on said land. The bond, with personal security, and said mortgages were so executed and delivered, the mortgage on the negroes (being executed and delivered in South Carolina) was amply sufficient to pay said debt; that said bond became forfeited on defendant\u2019s first failure to pay, and thereupon,'under the laws of South Carolina, the title to said slaves vested in the mortgagee, and the loss of said slaves by emancipation should and does in law fall upon said mortgagee; and their value being sufficient to pay said debt, the debt is paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\">Upon these pleadings the parties were at issue, and trial was had January Term, 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-6\">The plaintiff read in evidence said bond and said mortgage deed on the plantation aforesaid, and closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-7\">Defendant then read in evidence a consent agreement of counsel, as follows: <em>\u201c </em>It is admitted by counsel in this case,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>\u201c </em>1st.

Sales of rice are almost impossible to be effected, and they do not know who would pay if sold to, but I have directed them to sell if possible, and hope in a few days to be able to forward you the amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-5\">It is with feelings of sincere regret that I am compelled to say that it will be impossible for me to reduce the principal of my indebtedness to you. I regret it the more, as when I made the purchase I made it in good faith, expecting the instalments as they became due would be promptly <em>met; </em>but a series of misfortunes have befallen me since I made the purchase, and it is now only a question of time, which, if you will give me, will enable me to pay you all, and as these are troublous times we have fallen on, and an unparalleled commercial pressure, it is impossible to raise a dollar. I am compelled consequently to throw myself on your magnanimity and generosity, nor am I desirous that you should do so without being paid for it, and it will be much better than stocks or any other security at this time to invest in. I propose to pay you in addition to the legal interest, 2J per cent, on all amounts of principal that I fail to pay when they become due, I giving you my note, payable on the first day of January, when the interest becomes due, say for the excess of interest the ensuing year, which would be considered in the light of commission, not interest, for advancing $447 48-100, and so on for all amounts of principal not paid at maturity, would make the amount to pay you next January $4,-202 58-100 instead of $3,755 50-100, making the investment equal to 9J per cent, on all amounts of principal due. As I said before, it is merely a question of time, and I am not disposed you shall be the loser for a single dollar. It now rests with yourself whether I am ruined or aided along by your kindness, and should beg in these times your sympathy. I have considerable amount of money due me from parties here, but the appeals have been made to me, and I cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>find it in my heart to press them, (even if the law did not prevent it,) when there is no demand for what they have to sell nor money to buy with; and as all seem to be struggling to vindicate our rights in the South, I trust that God will soften the hearts of all who hold the prosperity of another in their hands.

It is with sincere regret that I am compelled to say that in times like the present I cannot raise a dollar beyond the settlement of the interest due, which shall be paid in a very short time. You ask me to write you and let you know what arrangements I can make towards the settlement of the bond now due. I cannot raise the money without the sale of property. I cannot sell, for there are no purchasers, except at a price, in times like these, that some hard-hearted old usurer would stand and gloat over the large gains he might make because he had held his money to take advantage of just such times as the present. Deeply regretting the position my failure to pay has placed you, I have suffered ten thousand times more than the whole concern is worth, for the reason that I could not pay the money or help myself. When I pay the interest now due, it will make some over $17,500 I have paid you in principal and interest, and I trust you will take such a view of the case as will enable ufe to get along amicably in this matter. I assure you it would afford me more pleasure to pay you, if I had the money, than to withhold it; in fact, more than to receive it, if I did not need it to pay a debt. I desire to do what is right, and will do so to the utmost of my power. You shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>not lose one dollar, although it may inconvenience you to wait.

Tucker arguing and insisting that the aforesaid agreement for sale of negroes, the said bond, the said sale of negroes, and mortgage of negroes, became and were a contract made in and governed by the laws of South Carolina in its construction, application and enforcement; that the said mortgage on land was only collateral or auxiliary to said contract in regard to the negroes ; that, after default made by the said mortgagee of the negroes, the title to said mortgaged negroes ceased to be conditional, and became absolute in said mortgagee, Henry L. \u25a0 Toomer, according to the said law of said contract, to-wit, the law of the State of South Carolina; and that, consequently, the loss of the value of said slaves, by their emancipation, without the fault of said mortgagor, should fall on the said mortgagee, to the extent at least of the value of the legal title to said slaves, and should not fall on said mortgagor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-9\">The argument on both sides having closed, the Judge charged the jury, amongst other things stated in the following motion, that whilst the law of the place of the contract should govern, yet it did not follow that the loss by emancipation of said slaves should fall on the mortgagee, who became the legal owner on condition broken, and that the .loss which said mortgagee suffered by said emancipation was only his mortgage security on the slaves, and not the loss of the debt.

Toomer <em>vs. </em>John F. Tucker. Motion for New Trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">This motion for new trial having been submitted without argument, I propose to do little more than to give the substance of my charge to the jury, \u2014 from which it will appear whether the exceptions to my charge, and which excejitions are the ground upon which this motion is made, are well founded. I charged the jury</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">1st. That the mortgage of the negroes, introduced as evidence in the cause for the purpose of proving payment, and upon which the argument has been made, is a South Carolina contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">2d. That, being a South Carolina contract, it is governed in its construction by the laws of South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">3d. That by the laws of South Carolina, in a mortgage of personal property upon condition broken, the <em>legal </em>title to the property mortgaged, becomes vested in the mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">4th. That this vesting of the legal title in the mortgagee, does not operate <em>eo instanti </em>as a payment of the debt due on t.he mortgage, but is intended to give the mortgagee control of the property, so as to enable him with more ease and facility, speedily to collect his debt by applying the property, or so much of it as might be necessary for that purpose. That until such application was made, there was no payment. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>don\u2019t mean that the mortgagee upon taking possession of the property, may be negligent in the use of his power to apply it to the payment of his debt. If loss accrues by reason of his negligence, he would doubtless be answerable for such loss. I am now only controverting the position of defendant\u2019s counsel, <em>that condition broJeen operates as payment. </em>I say that it gives him control of the property for the purpose of enabling him the more speedily to apply it to the payment of the debt. If he proceeds with due diligence to do this, it is then and then only, that the payment is consummated. If loss occurs without his fault, it must fall on the mortgagor. Suppose that upon condition broken, the mortgagee proceeds at once to assert his lights, he takes possession of the property, but before he could advertise and sell, the negroes die; would his debt be paid ? Assuredly not. Substitute emancipation for death, and where is the difference ? In either case he fails to realize anything, and surely he cannot be made to credit more than he does realize, unless the failure to realize has been the result of his own conduct. Now if such be the case where the morgagee proceeds with all the diligence he can, to assert his legal rights by taking possession of the property, how much stronger is the case for him, when he abstains from the assertion of his legal rights and suffers the property to remain in the possession of the mortgagor, at his (the mortgagor\u2019s) own earnest request. If death or emancipation, while in the hands of the mortgagee and before he could realize, relieves the mortgagee from the obligation to give credit on his debt, then surely he is relieved from all obligation to give credit, if death or emancipation occurs while the property is in the hands of the mortgagor, and in his hands at his (the mortgagor\u2019s) request.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Again, suppose that the mortgagee finds it impossible to take possession of the property, as may happen if the property is in the hands of a third party under purchase from the mortgagor, in such a case he may have to institute a suit,\u2014 is he bound to give credit before recovery had ? Assuredly not. \u25a0 But <em>he is bound </em>to give credit if it be true that the debt is paid on condition broken. In such a case, the mortgagor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>with the price of the negroes in his pocket, is entitled to be credited again with their value on the mortgage. There is no escape from this result, if' the position of the defendant\u2019s counsel be right.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">I would not speak disrespectfully of any position taken by the learned counsel who represent the defendant in this case, but I must say that I have no patience with this argument. It seems to me to be an outrage alike upon common sense and common justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">That I am right in the views I have expressed, is evident from the practical operation of the law in South Carolina. What is the course pursued in South Carolina in the collection of debts of this kind? So far as I am informed, the course is this: <em>upon condition broken </em>the mortgagee either proceeds himself, or if he chooses, he places his mortgage in the hands of the sheriff or of some friend, who takes possession of the mortgaged property, to sell it and credit the net proceeds of the sale. If the property sells for less than the debt, the mortgagor is still liable for the <em>deficiency; </em>if it sells for more than the debt, the overplus goes to the morgagor. This I understand and believe to be the usual proceeding in South Carolina. If I am not mistaken in this, then clearly condition broken is not regarded as payment, although by the law of that State, condition broken vests the fee in the mortgagee. For if it be payment, then there can be no deficiency for which the mortgagor is still liable, \u2014 and if there be an overplus, the mortgagor would have no right to it. In one word, if the mortgaged property is the property of the mortgagee in the absolute sense contended for by counsel, \u2014 then the money for which it sells would also be absolutely his, and there would be no obligation to pay over the surplus. What better proof do we want that the vesting of the legal title in the mortgagee, is simply for the purpose of enabling him more speedily and effectually to collect his debt ? To this extent the mortgagee is but the trustee of the mortgagor, and the trust becomes executed when the property, or so much of it as may be necessary, has <em>been applied to the payment of the debt. </em>If before this is done, loss occurs without the fault of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the mortgagee, by death or emancipation, it does not fall upon the mortgagee; for up to that moment the debt is unpaid, and remains unpaid unless the death or emancipation of the negroes, has the effect of payment. It does not necessarily follow that the loss must fall upon the mortgagee, because under the law he is the legal owner; for, though he be legal owner, he is made so for a special purpose. It has been harped on in the argument, that [the loss must fall on the legal owner; that I at this very term so decided. In the case referred to, the legal owner was the <em>absolute </em>owner, \u2014 not the legal owner for a particular purpose. He not only held the legal title, but he had the beneficial interest. An executor or administrator is the legal owner of the personal property of the estate; but if a negro dies or is emancipated, who loses \u2014 the executor or the heirs and distributees of the estate? Loss, then, does not necessarily follow the legal title. That the vesting of the legal title in the mortgagee does not operate as payment, is evident also from this; that if it be true, then when a mortgage of personal property has been taken to secure a debt, it destroys every other security that a creditor may have, and puts it out of his power to add to his security. Suppose for example that the creditor has in addition to his mortgage, taken personal security, as I believe was done in this case, he could never make that personal security liable. Why? Because, so long as the conditions of the mortgage were complied with, every installment paid as it fell due, he would have no right of action, \u2014 and upon <em>condition broken, </em>he would have no right to proceed against the security, <em>for then the debt would have been paid. </em>In other words, the failure to pay is <em>payment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">I want no stronger argument against the proposition of counsel than is contained \u25a0 in the proposition itself. Let me present another view, to show that the legal title vested in the mortgagee by condition broken does not create that absolute ownership which would cast the loss by emancipation on him. If under certain circumstances he is to be prejudiced, then under certain other circumstances he ought to be beneT fited. \u201c It is a bad rule that don\u2019t work both ways,\u201d If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>mortgagee is to lose all by emancipation, when it would take all to pay his debt, then if there had been no emancipation and the property was more than sufficient to pay his debt, he ought to gain the excess. Why should he lose in the one case and not gain in the other ? If there had been but one thousand of this fifty thousand dollars remaining unpaid, the failure to pay that one thousand dollars would vest that legal title in him as fully and effectually and absolulely as the failure to pay fifty thousand dollars. If in the one case he is to lose the ninety negroes, in the other he ought to gain them. The truth is, that either proposition is monstrous. All this absurdity is avoided if what I contend for be true \u2014 that the legal title is vested in the mortgagee for the purpose of enabling him to collect his debt. He is bound to account to the mortgagor for such amount as he may realize from the property. I care not whether this accountability is at law or in equity; it is enough for my argument that he is accountable. If the property more than pays his debt, he is liable for the excess. If it falls short of paying his debt, the mortgagor is still liable for the deficiency. This must be law, for it is justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">I grant that if loss occurs by reason of the neglect or fault of the mortgagee, he is responsible. But nothing of the kind has been shown in this case. Neither party is in fault. True, the mortgagee did not assert his legal right immediately on condition broken ; but it is also true that the mortgagor earnestly appealed to him for indulgence. The negroes were allowed to remain with the mortgagor at his own request, and were in his possession when emancipation came. The result, to my mind, is very clear; the mortgagee has lost his security, the mortgagor his means of payment, so far as that security, or those means depended on the negroes mentioned in the mortgage.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
