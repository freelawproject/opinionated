The assignment of error is that the said charge was erroneous generally.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-5\">B. Hill, Blaeford &amp; Miller, solicitors for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-6\">B. B. Harteee, solicitor for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b63-7\">Harris, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">1. There is a difficulty that this Court has to encounter very often, of passing upon the credibility of witnesses indirectly, who are utterly unknown to us, who are not sworn and' examined in our presence, \u2014 which we feel very sensibly, and which furnishes generally the reasons for acquiescence in verdicts, especially when new trials are moved and refused by the presiding Judge. But cases sometimes come up which forbid that our practice should be unalterable \u2014 not to be modified. In this case all are paper witnesses. Three swear distinctly that the Confederate notes paid by McCrary were taken conditionally, <em>not absolutely </em>\u2014 that is, if old Mr. \"Wall could use these notes in payment of debts due by him \u2014 old man Wall being one of the three witnesses \u2014 and by them all circumstances attending the transaction are narrated. This body of testimony is really opposed only by the oath, of McCrary in a general denial. If ever a verdict was rendered against the weight of testimony, this is the case. There must be a new trial on this ground. And whilst we award a new trial on the ground stated, we deem it proper to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>we are neither satisfied with the instructions of the Court, nor the manner of submitting them to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">2. \"We find nothing in the record to authorize that portion \u25a0of the charge in reference to false representations by Wall as to the mills, and the measure of damages in such case. There are other portions which do not accord with our ideas, in the mode of submission pursued, which we forbear to remark upon, as the case goes back for a re-hearing; and if it should be returned here again, it will come back unembarrassed by admissions said to have been made by counsel in the progress of the trial, which counsel <em>here </em>assert were misapprehensions of what they said.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">New trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
