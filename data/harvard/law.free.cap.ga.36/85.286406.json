Tried before Judge Vason. From the Superior Court of Sumter County, April Term, 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-11\">This case being upon trial, plaintiff introduced John V. Price, who swore that he had in his possession the negro Amanda; that plaintiff had left with him on sale a negro man who belonged to the plaintiff, plaintiff\u2019s mother and brother jointly, and said negro man had been swapped for Amanda. She was a good cook, washer, ironer, seamstress, and house-woman, worth $2,500.00, and worth for hire$150.00 <em>per annum.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-12\">In the fall of 1860, Amanda went away on the Southwestern Railroad, and remained away a year and a day, and was then brought back by the agents of the Company, the Company having exerted themselves to recover her from the date of her leaving. S\u00f1e had a ticket and went on a train on which Mr. Hancock, an employe of the Company, though not an agent or a conductor, also went to Macon. Witness went to Macon in pursuit of her, at an expense of fifty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Upon cross-examination, he stated that she was as white as himself, &amp;c.; and that no one who did not know her and her <em>status </em>would have suspected that she was a slave; and that she went away on Sunday. It was admitted that she paid the Company for the ticket which she had.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">The plaintiff closed. Defendant introduced no testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">After the argument and charge of the Court, the jury gave a verdict for $207.00, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-7\">During the argument, defendant\u2019s attorney requested the Court to charge the jury \u201c that in order to recover, plaintiff must prove property in himself, and right of possession at the commencement of the action, possession by defendant, and a demand and refusal, from which a conversion was presumed or inferred; also, that there must be negligence on part of defendant, and that the color of the girl Amanda, being white, the defendant was justifiable in selling her a ticket, for the presumption was she was a free woman; and plaintiff having proved property in himself and two others, he could not recover in that event, for there was a variance between allegations and proof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-8\">The Court refused so to charge, and charged that no matter what was Amanda\u2019s color, if the defendant allowed her to go off on their cars without a ticket from her owner or controller, the defendant was liable for her hire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-9\">For this refusal to charge, and for the charge as given, the plaintiff in error asks a reversal of the Court below.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b86-10\">James J.

There is no question in the case as to whether Amanda, the mulatto woman, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>taken on the cars of the Company, was a slave or not, and the property of Pickett. These facts admitted coerce an affirmance of the judgment below. ' However white in color, as it seems she was (though she had negro blood in her veins), we have no power to regard that fact as excusatory or altering the right of the owner to a recovery of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">This is, in its peculiar character, a hard case on the Railroad <em>Company; </em>but such an one cannot, since the abolition of slavery, occur again.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
