Motion for new trial. Decided by Judge Holt. Burke Superior Court, November Term, 1860.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-13\">Floyd stood conversing witb the two Messrs. Brinson. He bad open in his hand such a knife as farmers carry, and was perhaps whittling or cleaning his finger nails.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-14\">Whilden approached and asked Floyd if he had been accusing him of collecting money for his (Floyd\u2019s) slave and stealing it. Floyd said he did. Immediately Whilden struck Floyd with his fist, and Floyd stabbed him, and pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>suing Whilden, who walked backward, continued stabbing him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-5\">Whilden drew his knife; Floyd ranWhilden caught him and stabbed him. An interval occurred while each was examining his wounds : Whilden got an axe-helve, ran after Eloyd, (who retreated,) and beat him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-6\">The Court charged the jury that, if they found against the defendant the fact of stabbing as alleged in the indictment, they must inquire whether or not the stab was inflicted in defendant\u2019s own defence; that the degree of violence which defendant might use, and the weapon he might employ, must depend upon the nature and violence of the assault. The Court read to the jury the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth sections of the fourth division of the Penal Code, relating to homicide, as the law governing the measure and extent of self-defence in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-7\">The jury found the defendant guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-8\">He moved for a new trial upon the grounds\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-9\">1st.

As it does not appear by the record that there was great superiority in physical strength on the part of the assailant over that possessed by Floyd, nor it appearing that Floyd was in ill-health 'at the time, nor other circumstance existing at the time which produced relatively great inequality between them for sudden combat, we are not able to find any fact in the case which could justify him in repelling the blow of the fist by the use of his knife. As a general rule, it may safely be asserted that the law will not excuse or justify a man who repels a blow given him with the fist, by stabbing the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
