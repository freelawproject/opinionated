We have no power to disregard a plain provision of law, definite and unambiguous, and furnishing no opening for construction, so as to reconcile apparently contradictory provisions. It is enough to say that when a <em>certiorari </em>is sued out on the decision of the right of possession under a possessory-warrant by a County-Judge, it must be sued out <em>within </em>the time prescribed by the act creating the County-Courts, <em>and not otherwise; </em>that by failure to conform to those aets the party here has lost the benefit which the law allowed him upon compliance with its provisions. /</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
