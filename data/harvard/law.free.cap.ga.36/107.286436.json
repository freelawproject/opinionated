Evidence. Tried before Judge Cole. Macon Superior Court. March Term, 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-7\">Plaintiff in error was sued by defendant in error on a promissory note for $67.50, made 1st March, 1861, by said Archer, with D. A. Smith as security, payable to said deceased. The plea was failure of consideration. Upon the trial, after the note had been read in evidence, Archer proved by John M. Greer, that he was the administrator of said deceased, that deceased was the agent of D. H. Wilcox <em>&amp; </em>Co., and as such agent, sold to Archer Phoenix guano, which was the consideration of said note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-8\">Archer then offered to swear in his own behalf, that the article sold to him as guano was not guano, and was wholly worthless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-9\">Objection was taken upon the ground that Carver, with whom he contracted, was dead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-10\">The Court sustained the objection.

Until the act of the Legislature of 1866, parties were not authorized to give testimony in their own behalf, and by it only in certain circumstances. The question here is, could Archer be a witness as the case was situated. The facts are, that Carver, to whom the note was made payable, and of whom the purchase of the fertilizer was made, <em>is dead, </em>\u2014 that Greer, the plaintiff in the suit, is his administrator. In a case thus situated, the surviving party is not allowed to testify for himself. The fact drawn out by the examination of Greer, that Carver was the agent of Wilcox &amp; Co. of Augusta, to sell the guano for them, cannot change the rule \u2014 as <em>Garner was an agent with a del-credere commission, and having taken the note payable to himself, </em>he should be deemed, in giving a fair interpretation to the act of 1866, as an original party to the contract and competent to have testified, had he been alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
