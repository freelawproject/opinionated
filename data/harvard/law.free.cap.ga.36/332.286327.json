In 1863, he called on Jackson Martin for a settlement, and agreed to let said Jackson have the whole of the stock and crop bought with the land, receiving therefor one-half of six bales of cotton then on hand, and half of three or four hundred pounds of lint cotton; and it was -then, or about that time, agreed that the land should be divided and each take his share of it. He and his brother Jackson went into the army j Jackson never returned, and the land was not divided. After Jackson\u2019s death and administration on his estate, the administrator had half of the land appraised, which Wright Martin did not object to, as he supposed it was proper to sell it and pay Jackson\u2019s debts. He and his brother borrowed from Favor $811.80, for which the note exhibited was given, and they gave Waldroup a note for <em>$1,137.50; </em>the money borrowed from Favor was to pay in part for the land, and the note to Waldroup was for the balance of the purchase money. He sold the six bales of cotton for $1,230.00 or $1,240.00 to James Austin on a credit till the first of May, 1866; after deducting some claims which Austin held against Jackson Martin, he (Austin) gave Wright Martin his note for $1,000.00, due as aforesaid, which note he had placed in the hands of one of his securities on his bond, and to secure counsel fees. He received in cash for the cotton only $49.00, and is responsible for half of the proceeds of the cotton to Jackson\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-4\">He admits that Yates, as administrator, sold some personal property of Jackson Martin\u2019s, but denies that he (Yates) sold any property belonging to him and Jackson as partners, or any joint property, except a corn-sheller, which was bought with the land, and the administrator paid him his half of what it brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-5\">The land is worth as much as charged; it and the proceeds of the six bales of cotton is all of the joint property. He admits the insolvency as charged, and that he has no family except his wife; but denies any intention to leave the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>State, and all collusion or fraud; says lie has not paid complainants, because there are other creditors, and' has not said that they shall never have their money; but said that they cannot collect the same by their bill, because he and Jackson were not partners, and did not farm together as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AD-\">By an amendment to the answer, Wright Martin says that Jackson Martin alone carried on said farm, and had his (Wright\u2019s) negroes only part of the time, paying hire for them as aforesaid; that the labor of his slaves was nothing like equal to that of Jackson\u2019s slaves, and denies that he was to receive one-half of the proceeds of the farm, or that hq was in any sense a partner in the same. He says that Jackson Martin impliedly owed him for hire of slaves and rent for his half of the land and one-half of the stock purchased. He says that the land is still jointly owned by him and said estate; t\u00fcat Austin\u2019s note for $1,000.00 was given for the cotton, and is still unpaid; and that he paid out $49.00 as a part of the expenses on said cotton. He denies having any assets or evidence of debt belonging to said estate in his possession or control.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-6\">By a second amendment to his answer, he says he paid $25.00 to Williamson Jenkins for hauling three bales of said cotton to Atlanta, Georgia, five dollars to Nathaniel Grizzard for assisting in hauling them; that he owes $20.00 to Mary Martin, and to James Austin $10.00 for repacking one bale, and whatever is right for patching and roping said cotton; that Austin agreed to take the cotton at forty cents per pound if he were allowed to retain $177.80 to apply to a note Austin held against Jackson Martin, which he (Wright) agreed to, and though he has never seen the note, and knows nothing of it, he believes it was so honestly applied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-7\">The complainants\u2019 evidence was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-8\">James McEluoy swore that he lived near the farm of Jackson Martin; Wright Martin\u2019s hands worked there with Jackson\u2019s; witness ginned the cotton, six bales, of which one-twentieth was witness\u2019 for the toll; Wright sometimes stayed at Jackson\u2019s and sometimes at Hobgood\u2019s; Wright <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>and Jackson both claimed the land; Jackson claimed all the Stock except one mule, which was Wright\u2019s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-4\">Me.- Thompson testified that in fall of 1861, Jackson employed him to oversee Jackson\u2019s and Wright\u2019s farm. At Eairburn, Jackson asked him what he would work for; witness informed him; he said he would see Wright about it; shortly afterwards, Wright asked witness if he had seen Jackson and traded with him; witness said \u201cYes,\u201d and Wright said \u201cAllright; I will be satisfied with any arrangement Jackson makes; do the best you can.\u201d Witness went there in fall of 1861, and lived there in 1862; left six bales of cotton on the place.

Witness and Yates then agreed to leave the question to Blalock, Huie and Tidwell whether the cotton was copartnership property or not. Tidwell told witness to sell the cotton, that it was copartnership property; witness told Tidwell he (witness) did not know what it took to constitute a copartnership. Tidwell came to witness and said he wanted his money; witness promised to see him in Fayetteville \u2014 promised twice but saw him only once; he told witness to pay him four or five hundred dollars, and say nothing about it, and took witness into a grocery and treated him.

Austin do pay into the Clerk\u2019s office of this Court one thousand dollars, with interest from the 1st day of May, 1866, by the first day of April next; and after application of that amount tQ complainants, <em>pro rata, </em>that, on the first Tuesday in November next, after thirty days notice being given, the Receiver or Sheriff will sell the copartnership premises, containing 250 acres of lot No. 59, and fifty acres of lot No. 40, as contained in said deed, and that said Receiver or Sheriff pay the proceeds to complainants, <em>pro rata, </em>and that defendants pay the costs. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-6\">During the term a new trial was moved for, on the grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-7\">1st. That the verdict was contrary to the evidence and decidedly against the weight of evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-8\">2d. That the Court erred in charging as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-9\">3d. Because one of the jurors who tried the case, (C. S. Jones,) while the ease was being tried and before it was submitted to the jury, said, in presence of two of his fellow jurors, and in hearing of counsel engaged in said case, that there was no use for the lawyers in the case to make speeches to him, for his mind was made up, and they could not change it by anything they could say.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-10\">In support of this last ground, plaintiff in error read two affidavits as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-11\">Affidavit of R. C. Bridges, who swore that, during said trial, and before the case had been submitted to the jury, at a recess of the Court, said C. S. Jones remarked in the presence of him and others, that his mind was made up, and it would not do any good for the lawyers to speak to him, as they could not change him by anything they could say :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-12\">Affidavit of Johw D. Stewart, (one of defendant\u2019s solicitors,) who swore that, during said trial, after the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>\u25a0was closed, but before any argument or the charge of the Court, during the recess for dinner, and while deponent and and J. Q. A. Alford were walking towards the hotel, three of the jurors trying said cause, to-wit, R. C. Bridges, Burket Rentfro and Charles S. Jones, were walking before them, and said Jones remarked to the others that there was no use for the attorneys to make speeches in said case, as his mind was made up, and nothing they could say could change him. He could have been heard five or eight yards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-5\">Solicitors for defendant in error produced the affidavit of said Jones, who swore that he remarked to Bridges and others of the jurors (at time specified in the other affidavits), that he did not think it worth while for the lawyers to speak on the case, and further, he swore that he had not then made up his mind, and that he did not say to Bridges that he had made up his mind, and that it was unnecessary for the lawyers to speak, and that he thinks all the testimony had been given in when he spoke as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-6\">The Court refused a new trial. Defendant\u2019s counsel excepted, and assign as error the grounds aforesaid.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b344-7\">J. L. Blalock, J. D. Stewart, and J. Q. A. Alford, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-8\">Tidwell &amp; Fears, and John Huie, (represented by \u00da. J. Hammond,) for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b344-9\">Walker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">1. The evidence in this case was conflicting; perhaps it preponderated against the verdict; but, as there was a considerable amount of evidence in favor of it, and the Judge who presided on the trial was satisfied, we will not disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">2. The second error alleged, is that the Court charged the jury \u201c that a partnership might exist where there was a joint interest in property, and a joint interest in profits and losses of any adventure or enterprise.\u201d If there be error in this charge, it was not such an error as defendants below can complain of. The Code, \u00a71892, says, \u201cAjoint interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the partnership property, <em>or </em>a joint interest in the profits and losses of the business, constitute a partnership as to third persons.\u201d The rule laid down by the Court required more proof to constitute a partnership than the statute does \u2014 he required both a joint interest in the property and in the profits and losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">3. While the conduct of the juryman (Jones) was unbecoming for a man acting under the solemnities of an oath, still, we cannot for this cause set aside the verdict. It is the duty of the jury to hear all the evidence, and all the reasons urged by counsel in favor of their respective sides of the case, as well as the law given in charge by the Court, and when the c\u00e1se is thus submitted to their determination, <em>then </em>proceed to make up their verdict <em>and not before. </em>The verdict should speak the truth of the case, and until the jury hear the whole case their minds should be entirely free, so that upon an impartial consideration of all the fact's and the law applicable thereto, they may do equal and impartial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We might not have granted a new trial in this case, if the the juryman\u2019s misconduct had been unknown to the counsel, until after the rendition of the verdict; but certainly we ought not to do so when the counsel, knowing the facts, chose to take his chances before the jury notwithstanding. If, with a full knowledge of the facts, he permitted the trial to proceed, he must submit to the consequences. Doubtless if the matter had been brought to the knowledge of the \u2019 Court at once, he would have taken such action as would have been proper under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">4. When a Court of Equity obtains jurisdiction for one purpose, it will retain it, until full and satisfactory justice is rendered to all the parties concerned. Walker vs. Morris, 14 Ga. Rep., 323. We think, therefore, the Court very properly so moulded its decree as to do complete justice and settle the entire partnership business.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">5. We intimate no opinion as to what may be the rights of others, not before the Court, in portions or all of this property. This being a creditor\u2019s bill, others may be heard here<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>after, in the assertion of their rights, -if such rights exist. M. &amp; W. R. R. Co. vs. Parker, 9 Ga. Rep., 394-6 ; McDougald vs. Dougherty, 11 Ga. Rep., 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
