We conclude that the statute imposes a duty to warn that extends only to material risks not obvious to a reasonably prudent product user, and to material risks that are not, or should not be, a matter of common knowledge to persons in the same or a similar position as the person who suffered the injury in question. Because the material risk associated with ingesting and inhaling Wonder 8 Hair Oil, as occurred here, would have been obvious to a reasonably prudent product user, the failure to warn against the risk is not actionable. The Court of Appeals misunderstood this duty and held that a duty also existed to warn of the kind of injuries that were suffered. The Court of Appeals also incorrectly allowed various warranty claims to proceed on the basis that the warning was inadequate. Because no warning was required, these holdings were in error. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order granting summary disposition to all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>I. UNDERLYING facts and procedural history</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">In April 1999, plaintiff purchased a spray bottle of African Pride Ginseng Miracle Wonder 8 Oil, Hair and Body Mist-Captivate (Wonder 8 Hair Oil) from defendant Pro Care Beauty Supply, which is currently known as Super 7 Beauty Supply, Inc. Defendant A.P Products, which was subsequently acquired by Revlon Consumer Products Corporation, packaged and labeled Wonder 8 Hair Oil. Wonder 8 Hair Oil was marketed principally to African-Americans as a new type of spray-on body and hair moisturizer containing eight natural oils. Plaintiff decided to try the oil after reading the ingredients on the label,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> some of which were familiar to her and some of which were not. Although the bottle\u2019s label cautioned the user never to spray the oil near sparks or an open flame, it did not warn that the hair oil should be kept out of reach of children or that it was potentially harmful or fatal if swallowed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs 11-month-old son, Keimer Easley, had been left unattended. Somehow he obtained the bottle of hair oil, which had been left within his reach. He ingested and inhaled the hair oil.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The child died about one month later from multisystem organ failure secondary to chemical pneumonitis, secondary to hydrocarbon ingestion. In other words, the mineral oil clogged the child\u2019s lungs, causing inflammatory respiratory failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Plaintiff filed this products-liability action, alleging that defendants breached their duty to warn that the product could be harmful if ingested and that it should be kept out of reach of small children. Plaintiff further claimed that defendants breached an implied warranty by failing adequately to label the product as toxic.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Defendants moved for summary disposition. AP Products and Revlon argued that they had no duty to warn because the material risks associated with ingesting Wonder 8 Hair Oil were obvious to a reasonably prudent product user. They further argued that the lack of warning was not the proximate cause of the injury and that the product had been misused in a way that was not reasonably foreseeable. Super 7 Beauty Supply argued that plaintiff failed to establish that it, as a nonmanufacturing seller, had independently breached an express or implied warranty or was independently negligent. It further argued that plaintiff failed to show that the product was not fit for its ordinary uses or for a particular purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motions for summary disposition. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, concluding that the questions whether the Wonder 8 Hair Oil required a warning label, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>defendants breached an implied warranty, and whether plaintiff established proximate cause should have been submitted to a jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Defendants sought leave to appeal in this Court. We granted defendants\u2019 applications for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">This case requires us to determine whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of defendants under MCR 2.116(C)(10). We review this issue de novo. <em>Rose v Nat\u2019l Auction Group, </em>466 Mich 453, 461; 646 NW2d 455 (2002), citing <em>Maiden v Rozwood, </em>461 Mich 109, 118; 597 NW2d 817 (1999). \u201cIn reviewing such a decision, we consider the affidavits, pleadings, depositions, admissions, and other documentary evidence submitted by the parties in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Rose, supra </em>at 461, citing <em>Quinto v Cross &amp; Peters Co, </em>451 Mich 358, 362; 547 NW2d 314 (1996). \u201cSummary disposition under MCR 2.116(0(10) is appropriately granted if there is no genuine issue regarding any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Rose, supra </em>at 461, citing MCR 2.116(C)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Before 1995, a manufacturer\u2019s or seller\u2019s duty to warn of material risks in a products-liability action was governed by common-law principles. Tort reform legislation enacted in 1995,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> however, displaced the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>law. MCL 600.2948, in chapter 29 of the Revised Judicature Act, now governs a defendant\u2019s duty to warn of an obvious danger in a products-liability action. It states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">A defendant is not liable for failure to warn of a material risk that is or should be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user or a material risk that is or should be a matter of common knowledge to persons in the same or similar position as the person upon whose injury or death the claim is based in a product liability action. [MCL 600.2948(2).][<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Under the plain language of MCL 600.2948(2), a manufacturer has no duty to warn of a material risk associated with the use of a product if the risk: (1) is obvious, or should be obvious, to a reasonably prudent product user, or (2) is or should be a matter of common knowledge to a person in the same or a similar position as the person upon whose injury or death the claim is based.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, this statute, by looking to the reasonably prudent product user, or persons in the same or a similar position as the injured person,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> establishes an objective standard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In determining what constitutes a material risk, we are mindful that the statutes governing statutory construction direct us to construe \u201call words and phrases... according to the common and approved usage of the language,\u201d but construe \u201ctechnical words and phrases, and such as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law\u201d according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning. MCL 8.3a; <em>Horace v City of Pontiac, </em>456 Mich 744, 756; 575 NW2d 762 (1998). Our research reveals that the term \u201cmaterial risk\u201d has no prior \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the law.\u201d It is thus not a term of art. When considering a word or phrase that has not been given prior legal meaning, resort to a lay dictionary such as <em>Webster\u2019s </em>is appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 756. <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997) defines \u201cmaterial,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cimportant: to make a material difference; pertinent: a material question.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997) defines \u201crisk\u201d as \u201cexposure to the chance of injury or loss.\u201d We thus conclude that a \u201cmaterial risk\u201d is an important or significant exposure to the chance of injury or loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Finally, regarding the meaning of the statute, we conclude that the Legislature has imposed no duty to warn beyond obvious material risks. The statute does not impose a duty to warn of a specific type of injury that could result from a risk. The Court of Appeals, however, mistakenly held that warnings must cover not only material risks, as described, but must also cover potential injuries that could result.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">While the Court of Appeals properly applied an objective standard in determining the suitability of the warning, it stated that it could not conclude that \u201cas a matter of law, <em>the risk of death </em>from the ingestion of Wonder 8 Hair Oil would be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user and be a matter of common knowledge, especially considering the lack of <em>any </em>relevant warning.\u201d 264 Mich App at 401 (first emphasis added). The Court of Appeals thus required that the warning indicate specific injuries a product user could incur. Yet, as we have stated, the statute does not require that a warning address possible injuries that might occur.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Here, tragically, plaintiffs 11-month-old son died after ingesting and inhaling Wonder 8 Hair Oil.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under the law, however, defendants owed no duty to warn of specific injuries or losses, no matter how severe, if it is or should have been obvious to a reasonably prudent product user that ingesting or inhaling Wonder 8 Hair Oil involved a material risk. We conclude that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>obvious to a reasonably prudent product user that a material risk is involved with ingesting and inhaling Wonder 8 Hair Oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The product, as plaintiff concedes, was not marketed as safe for human consumption or ingestion. Rather, the label clearly states that the product is intended for use as a hair and body oil. Although subjective awareness is not the standard, we find it noteworthy that plaintiff herself demonstrated an understanding that Wonder 8 Hair Oil posed a material risk if ingested. We believe it would also be obvious to a reasonably prudent user that ingestion and inhalation of the product poses a material risk. The ingredient label\u2019s inclusion of eight natural oils has no bearing on our conclusion. Many, if not all, oils are natural. It should be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user that many oils, although natural, pose a material risk if ingested or inhaled. For instance, the reasonably prudent product user would know that breathing oil would be harmful. A reasonably prudent product user would also know that ingesting such things as crude oil or linseed oil poses a material risk although such oils are natural and pose no immediate danger from contact with hair or skin. In fact, paraffin oil is listed as one of the ingredients in Wonder 8 Hair Oil. It should be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user that ingesting paraffin oil poses a material risk since paraffin is commonly associated with such things as wax.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Additionally, the product label on Wonder 8 Hair Oil does not state that it contains <em>only </em>natural oils. Indeed, it lists numerous other ingredients, many of which would be unfamiliar to the average product user, such as isopropryl myristate, fragrance, and azulene. Given such unfamiliar ingredients, a reasonably prudent product user would be, or should be, loath to ingest it.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Accordingly, we hold that defendants owed no duty to warn plaintiff that her son\u2019s ingestion and inhalation of the Wonder 8 Hair Oil posed a material risk. Moreover, defendants owed no duty to warn of the potential injuries that could arise from ingesting and inhaling the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The plaintiff also pleaded breach of implied warranty under MCL 600.2947(6)(a) and breach of implied warranty of merchantability under MCL 440.2314(2) (e) with respect to the nonmanufacturing seller, Super 7 Beauty Supply. Plaintiff claimed that, in the absence of a warning, the oil was not properly labeled. Because no warning was required, however, these claims are without merit. Defendants are therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">IV RESPONSE TO JUSTICE CAVANAGH\u2019S DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The crux of Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s dissent is that we erroneously conclude that the obviousness of <em>one </em>risk means the obviousness of <em>all </em>risks. This contention, however, is a gross mischaracterization of our holding and can be found nowhere in our opinion. Rather, we hold that a defendant has no duty to warn of a material risk that is or should be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user. We further hold that the material risk associated with the ingestion and inhalation of hair oil is or should be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user. This conclusion is entirely consistent with the plain language of the statute and focuses on the obviousness of the material risk in question. It does not charge Michigan consumers with \u201cknowledge of hidden dangers\u201d as suggested by Justice CAVANAGH. <em>Post </em>at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Justice CAVANAGH also contends that we fail to identify the material risk in question and mislabel the risk as \u201cingesting or inhaling\u201d the hair oil. Contrary to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>contention, we have clearly identified the material risk in this case. To the contrary, Justice CAVANAGH has mislabeled the risk as the \u201cconsequence\u201d that results from the misuse of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The material risk in this case is neither the misuse of the product (the inhalation or ingestion) nor the consequence of the misuse (injury or death). Rather the material risk is the important or significant exposure to the chance of loss or injury stemming from certain behavior, in this case, the ingestion and inhalation of hair oil. In simple terms, the material risk is the chance that injury could result from drinking or inhaling hair oil. Because a reasonable person knows or should know that ingesting or inhaling hair oil would expose that person to the chance of injury or loss, a defendant has no duty to warn that ingesting or inhaling hair oil could result in exposure to injury or loss. Furthermore, the statute does not require that a person be aware of the worst injury or loss (death) that could possibly result from the misuse of the product. Rather, under the plain language of the statute, it need only be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user that a chance exists that he or she might suffer an injury or loss if they drink or inhale hair oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We respectfully remind our dissenting colleague that the Legislature, not this Court, refused to impose a duty to warn of obvious material risks. Justice CAVANAGH does not deny this, but evidently chooses to ignore it. By what authority can a court under our Constitution do that? Justice CAVANAGH gives none. The Legislature also refused to require that a defendant list every possible injury that could result from the misuse of a product. Again, Justice CAVANAGH does not deny this, but chooses to ignore it. How does a court obtain such authority? Justice Cavanagh fails to provide an answer, probably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>because no such authority exists. The rule must and should be that a court applies the statute as written. Applying the plain language of the statute to the facts of this case, we conclude that the material risk associated with ingesting and inhaling hair oil is or should be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user. Thus, defendant had no duty to warn of that material risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We conclude that the Court of Appeals erroneously reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition to defendants A.P Products and Revlon. The material risk of harm associated with ingesting and inhaling Wonder 8 Hair Oil is obvious to a reasonably prudent product user. Defendants thus owed no duty to warn plaintiff of that harm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b589-6\">Taylor, C.J., and Young and Markman, JJ., concurred with Corrigan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-5\"> The ingredients listed on the label are Gin Gro Oil Complex (paraffin oil, tea tree oil, kuki nut oil, evening primrose oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, wheat germ oil), isopropryl myristate, fragrance, Gin Gro herbal complex (rosemary, sage, angelica root, licorice root, Job\u2019s tears, cedar, hyacinth, dove, lemon balm, chamomile), carrot oleo resin, azulene, tocopherol acetate (Vitamin E), retinyl palmitate (Vitamin A), and cholecalciferol (Vitamin D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-6\"> The hair oil was packaged in a clear plastic 7.5 ounce bottle with a nonaerosol pump actuator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\"> When plaintiff first observed that her son had possession of the hair oil, he was standing with the bottle of Wonder 8 Oil in his hand and oil in and around his mouth.

When he was admitted to the hospital, he was diagnosed with hydrocarbon ingestion and chemical pneumonitis. It is not clear how Keimer managed to put the oil into his mouth. Plaintiff testified that when she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>last used the product earlier that day, the cap had been intact.

A manufacturer or seller could be held liable for failure to warn if it (a) had actual or constructive knowledge of the claimed danger, (b) had no reason to believe that those for whose use the product is supplied would realize its dangerous condition, and (c) failed to exercise reasonable care to inform users of the product\u2019s dangerous condition or of the facts that make it likely to be dangerous. <em>Id., </em>citing 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 388, p 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Michigan also recognized the common-law \u201cobvious danger\u201d rule. <em>Glittenberg, supra </em>at 393. A manufacturer had no duty to warn if it reasonably perceived that the product\u2019s potentially dangerous condition was readily apparent or could have been disclosed by a mere casual inspection. <em>Id. </em>at 390. Michigan, however, narrowed application of the \u201cobvious danger\u201d rule to cases involving \u201csimple tools or products.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, citing <em>Owens v Allis-Chalmers Corp, </em>414 Mich 413, 425; 326 NW2d 372 (1982). No duty existed to warn of the obvious danger of a simple product because an obvious danger was no danger to a \u201creasonably\u201d careful person. <em>Glittenberg, supra </em>at 395-396. In other words, as stated by this Court in <em>Glittenberg, </em>\u201cwhere the very condition that is alleged to cause the injury is wholly revealed by casual observation of a simple product in normal use, a duty to warn serves no fault-based purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, <em>citing Prentis v Yale Mfg Co, </em>421 Mich 670; 365 NW2d 176 (1984).

The plaintiff in <em>Glittenberg </em>argued that the danger of diving in a shallow pool was not open and obvious because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>the specific harm of paralysis or death is not generally recognized. <em>Id. </em>This Court noted, however, that the \u201cthreshold issue is not whether a shallow dive can be successfully executed but, rather, whether people in general are unaware of the fact that there is a risk of serious harm when diving in shallow water.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401. This Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">[W]here the facts of record require the conclusion that the risk of serious harm from the asserted condition is open and obvious, and no disputed question exists regarding the danger of the product, the law does not impose a duty upon a manufacturer to warn of conceivable ramifications of injuries that might occur from the use or foreseeable misuse of the product. <em>[Id. </em>at 402.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">If the Legislature had intended to require a defendant to warn of specific dangers, it would have explicitly mandated that alteration in MCL 600.2948(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Justice Cavanagh mistakenly asserts that we rely on common-law principles set forth in <em>Glittenberg, supra, </em>in reaching our conclusion. We, however, rely solely on the plain language of MCL 600.2948(2) in reaching our conclusion.

She further contends that none of the ingredients alerts a reasonably prudent product user to the fatal result of ingestion. We reiterate, however, that plaintiffs 11-month-old son died from complications stemming from <em>inhaling </em>Wonder 8 Hair Oil into his lungs. That the child swallowed some of the hair oil was incidental to his death. But because it would be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user that harm could result from allowing a young child to possess a bottle of oil, whether the harm occurs through ingestion or inhalation or some other action, we hold that no duty exists to warn of the injuries that actually result from allowing the child to possess the oil.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b589-7\">WEAVER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATC\">0concurring).

Notably, then, the word that \u201ca\u201d precedes is limited to \u201ca single\u201d noun. Thus, in this case, \u201ca material risk\u201d refers to \u201ca single,\u201d or one, material risk. As a result, the otherwise unspecified single material risk to which the statute refers must be identified before it can be determined whether that risk was common knowledge or obvious to a reasonably prudent product user.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">But the majority ignores the word \u201ca,\u201d fails to correctly identify the material risk at issue, and writes the word \u201cobvious\u201d completely out of the statute. In doing so, the majority erroneously concludes that all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>risks are obvious as long as some risk is obvious. Accordingly, the majority holds that the alleged obviousness of \u201cany\u201d material risk absolves a manufacturer from warning about \u201call\u201d material risks, even if other material risks are not obvious. The effect on this case is the result that because a reasonably prudent product user would have purportedly known that there was a risk of illness from misusing the Wonder 8 Hair Oil, plaintiff should have known there was a risk of death. Therefore, defendants had no duty to warn their consumers about any risk at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">By concluding this way, the majority rewrites the statute and, consequently, fails to effectuate the protections the Legislature intended. Had the Legislature intended what the majority holds, it would have written the statute as follows: \u201cA defendant is not liable for failure to warn of <em>any </em>material risk when <em>a </em>material risk should be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user____\u201d Or it would have stated, \u201cA defendant need not warn about <em>all </em>material risks if <em>one </em>material risk should be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user----\u201d Plainly, it did not write the statute that way, and the majority errs by ignoring the unambiguous language. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">To determine in what instances a manufacturer will have no duty to place a warning on its product and what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>exactly it must warn about, it must first be determined what the \u201cmaterial risk\u201d is alleged to be. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By the majority\u2019s own proffered definition, \u201cmaterial\u201d means \u201c \u2018important: to make a material difference; pertinent: a material question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 510, quoting <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997). The first question, then, is \u201cIn what must the material difference be made?\u201d According the word its common meaning in the context in which it is used, for the risk to be \u201cmaterial,\u201d it must make an important or pertinent difference in the consumer\u2019s actions with respect to the product. For instance, the risk would be material if it would bear on whether the consumer purchases the product or how the user deals with the product after purchasing it. Thus, if, to require a warning, the risk must be an important one that makes a material difference in the user\u2019s actions, and it must be obvious as well, then the risk involved must be identified. Otherwise, there is no way to determine whether the risk is obvious and no way to determine whether it would make some \u201cmaterial difference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">So it is clear from the statutory language that all risks are not equal, for one is likely to act differently depending on the risk involved. Simply stated, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>assuming that a reasonably prudent product user would know that there was a risk of becoming ill from a product, this same consumer does not necessarily know that there is a risk of death. It is not enough to equate two different risks and charge the consumer with knowledge of the more serious one if he has knowledge of the one less serious because it is unreasonable to assume that a reasonably prudent product user would act the same in both circumstances. Thus, the risk of illness, if found to be <em>\u201ca\u201d </em>material risk, must be considered separately from other material risks, such as death. In other words, because the statute states that a manufacturer has no duty \u201cto warn of a material risk that is or should be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user or <em>a </em>material risk that is or should be a matter of common knowledge to persons in the same or similar position,\u201d MCL 600.2948(2), the question becomes whether knowledge of the risk of death would have caused the person to act differently, making it a \u201cmaterial\u201d risk, and, if so, whether that risk was or should have been \u201cobvious.\u201d We can determine neither whether a risk was \u201cmaterial\u201d nor whether it was obvious unless we know what the risk is alleged to be.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">By alternatively failing to identify the material risk at issue in this case and mislabeling the risk as \u201cingesting or inhaling\u201d the oil, the majority prevents the statute from operating as the Legislature intended and deprives Michigan consumers of their right to assess levels of risk when making purchasing decisions. The majority seems to try to hide its incomplete analysis by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>repeatedly asserting that the product posed \u201ca material risk,\u201d because, though that refrain recurs numerous times, the majority either does not name the \u201cmaterial risk\u201d that was supposed to have been obvious or it misidentifies it. Consider the following: \u201cBecause the material risk associated with ingesting and inhaling Wonder 8 Hair Oil, as occurred here, would have been obvious to a reasonably prudent product user, the failure to warn against the risk is not actionable.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 504. \u201cWe conclude that it is obvious to a reasonably prudent product user that a material risk is involved with ingesting and inhaling Wonder 8 Hair Oil.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511-512. \u201c[W]e find it noteworthy that plaintiff herself demonstrated an understanding that Wonder 8 Hair Oil posed a material risk if ingested. We believe it would also be obvious to a reasonably prudent [product] user that ingestion and inhalation of the product poses a material risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512. \u201cIt should be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user that many oils, although natural, pose a material risk if ingested or inhaled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA reasonably prudent product user would also know that ingesting such things as crude oil or linseed oil poses a material risk ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt should be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user that ingesting paraffin oil poses a material risk since paraffin is commonly associated with such things as wax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cGiven such unfamiliar ingredients, a reasonably prudent product user would be, or should be, loath to ingest it.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]e hold that defendants owed no duty to warn plaintiff that her son\u2019s ingestion and inhalation of the Wonder 8 Hair Oil posed a material risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513. \u201cThe material risk of harm associated with ingesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>and inhaling Wonder 8 Hair Oil is obvious to a reasonably prudent product user.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The inconsistencies are self-evident. On one hand, the majority claims that the material risk is \u201cingesting or inhaling\u201d the product. On the other, the majority asserts that ingesting or inhaling this product poses a material risk, which risk is unidentified. Neither conclusion squares with a plain reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Ingesting or inhaling a product is not the material risk in question. That would make no sense at all because a warning that the product could be accidentally ingested or inhaled does not reveal the specific risk involved with ingesting or inhaling and, thus, does not allow a person to assess the risk and act accordingly. So the risk that must be warned about is not ingestion or inhalation itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Rather, ingesting or inhaling is a <em>misuse </em>of the product, and the risk posed by that misuse \u2014 the one that must be warned of if not obvious \u2014 is the consequence of that misuse, i.e., the consequence of ingestion or inhalation. As such, each risk must be identified, assessed for materiality (whether that risk would affect a reasonably prudent product user\u2019s actions), and assessed for obviousness. The majority fails at each of these tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">This leads to another of the majority opinion\u2019s shortcomings: its assumption that knowledge of one risk is knowledge of all. The majority\u2019s erroneous conclusion is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute, which speaks of \u201ca\u201d material risk. As two of the defendants aptly explained in their brief, \u201cNo one needs to be told what is already known,\u201d citing <em>Dist of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>Columbia v Moulton, </em>182 US 576, 581; 21 S Ct 840; 45 L Ed 1237 (1901).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See also <em>Glittenberg v Doughboy Recreational Industries (On Rehearing), </em>441 Mich 379, 391; 491 NW2d 208 (1992). Thus, if a risk, such as illness, is \u201cmaterial,\u201d and if someone knows or should know that risk, then that person need not be warned of it. But that says nothing regarding whether that person knows of a different risk, here, the risk of death. Defendants did not need to warn of the risk of death only if a reasonably prudent product user would have already known of it because a person need not be told what he or she already knows.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In this case, then, to absolve defendants from liability, it must be shown that a reasonably prudent product user would or should have known of the specific material risk the product posed or that that material risk was common knowledge. Even assuming that a reasonably prudent product user would or should have known that inhaling or ingesting Wonder 8 Hair Oil posed a risk of illness, plaintiff raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the user would have known that inhaling or ingesting Wonder 8 Hair Oil posed the risk of death and whether the same was common knowledge. Thus, it cannot be concluded as a matter of law that the manufacturer had no need to attach any warnings to this product merely because a reasonable person might know that the product could make one <em>sick. </em>The risks of illness and death simply do not have the same level of materiality because reasonably prudent product users will most likely act differently in each instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>In affirming the grant of summary disposition for defendants, the majority allows manufacturers to keep consumers ignorant of hidden dangers, i.e., material risks, posed by their products. Consider other common household or health and beauty products. For example, a hair spray bottle may warn that spraying the product in the user\u2019s eyes could cause irritation and instruct the user to rinse the eyes thoroughly for 15 minutes should that misuse occur. This information would likely cause the consumer to employ a specifically tailored level of care based on the potential risk of eye irritation. But if that product could also cause blindness, a very different material risk is at play. Knowledge of the material risk of irritation, be it from a warning or from common knowledge, is not knowledge of the risk of blindness. The two risks do not have the same level of materiality because the two risks would likely cause a consumer to make drastically different decisions with regard to the product. In other words, while the risk of eye irritation is a material one because it would cause a user to employ one specific level of care, the risk of blindness is quite another material risk indeed, and one that would likely significantly alter the user\u2019s decision-making process. Thus, each is <em>\u201ca </em>material risk\u201d that must be assessed independently. If the material risk of blindness cannot be said to be obvious, even if the material risk of irritation can, then hairspray that could cause blindness would require a warning to that effect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The same can be said for a tube of toothpaste, to use an example provided by plaintiff. If reasonably prudent product users could be said to assume that eating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>contents of a tube of toothpaste would cause an upset stomach, for instance, then becoming sick from ingesting the toothpaste would be an obvious risk requiring no warning. Toothpaste is routinely left on countertops, despite that consumers presumably understand that there may be a slight risk if a child ingests it. That risk is known and assessed, and the consumer acts accordingly. But assume that the toothpaste could actually kill a child if ingested. Presumably, the toothpaste would be treated quite differently. If that consequence were widely known or if toothpaste tubes carried a warning that swallowing the contents could be fatal, then consumers would most probably act differently by either seeking a different product or by keeping the toothpaste under lock and key. Yet under the majority\u2019s reasoning, as long as the user knows of some material risk, all material risks are deemed known.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In charging consumers with knowledge of hidden dangers, the majority completely writes the word \u201cobvious\u201d out of the statute. As such, warnings that spraying hairspray into one\u2019s eyes may cause blindness, that swallowing toothpaste may cause death, or that inhaling hair oil could prove fatal are not required. Under today\u2019s opinion, manufacturers need not alert consumers of hidden risks or allow consumers to assess those risks and make informed choices. Rather, knowledge of one material risk is knowledge of all.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">An opposite conclusion does not necessarily mean that a manufacturer must warn of the specific medical consequences of misusing the product.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For instance, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>this case, the label did not need to state that the product, if inhaled, could cause \u201cmultisystem organ failure secondary to chemical pneumonitis,\u201d which is the medical consequence the product caused the child in this case. Rather, it is enough that a warning speak in general terms, as long as the particular material risk that is not obvious to the reasonably prudent product user is revealed. So in this case, the manufacturer could have simply warned, as multitudes of manufacturers do, that the product could be fatal if inhaled or ingested.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">A consumer has a legislatively given right to rely on product labeling in making purchasing decisions, and when a label does not warn of a material risk such as death, the consumer has a right to assume that the product does not pose that risk. By wording the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the way it did, the Legislature attempted to ensure a consumer\u2019s ability to make an informed decision regarding whether to buy the product and how to handle the product after purchase. But warning of one risk is not warning of all, and the lack of warning of an obvious risk, such as illness, is not a warning of a hidden risk, such as death. By its clear words, the Legislature deemed it unnecessary for a manufacturer to warn of \u201ca\u201d material risk, e.g., illness, when that risk is obvious, but it in no way obviated the need to warn of a different material risk, i.e., death, that is hidden. Yet, after today, manufacturers need warn of nothing, as long as a consumer should know that <em>something </em>could happen as a result of misusing a product.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Thus, all hidden and unknown risks are now relegated to the realm of \u201ccommon knowledge,\u201d and consumers must play a guessing game with the biggest risk being that their guess turns out to be fatal. Despite being given one by the Legislature, consumers now have no right to know of hidden risks that would have changed their decision-making process regarding the products they choose to buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">For these reasons, I concur with Justice Kelly that plaintiff presented a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether a reasonably prudent product user would have known that ingesting or inhaling Wonder 8 Hair Oil could prove fatal. This Court gravely errs by rewriting the law of products liability clearly set forth by the Legislature and thereby depriving plaintiff of an opportunity to seek redress for the death of her child. As such, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-10\"> This is interesting in light of the majority\u2019s self-described inexorable adhesion to the categorical interpretation of words such as \u201ca\u201d and \u201cthe.\u201d See e.g., <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439, 458-459; 613 NW2d 307 (2000); <em>Massey v Mandell, </em>462 Mich 375, 382 n 5; 614 NW2d 70 (2000). I have consistently maintained that the words \u201ca\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d must be read in context and not in rigid isolation. For example, in <em>Robinson, </em>I joined Justice Kelly\u2019s dissent, which recognized the dictionary meanings of the words but would have also recognized that in that particular instance, \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d had several possible meanings when considered in light of governing causation principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">The majority\u2019s unbending faithfulness to reading the word \u201ca\u201d flounders in this case. Interestingly, under either an isolationist view or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>a contextual one, the result is the same: \u201ca\u201d material risk can mean nothing other than the material risk of which a plaintiff claims she had no warning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-6\"> In most, if not all, instances, a plaintiff will be the first to identify the material risk when the plaintiff sues, complaining that he or she was not warned of that particular material risk. The defendant will then affirmatively defend by asserting that the material risk the plaintiff claims was not warned of was obvious or common knowledge. In this instance, plaintiff alleges that she was not warned that ingesting or inhaling the product could be fatal. It makes no sense to say that defendant can defend that it warned of some other material risk or that some other material risk was obvious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b593-5\"> Although this is not a subjective inquiry, it is worth noting plaintiffs testimony that she assumed this product could cause illness if misused but that she would not have bought the product if she had known or been warned that the product would cause death. In other words, the risk of death was a material risk because it would have caused plaintiff to act differently with respect to this product.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\"> Of course, whether one is \u201cloath to ingest\u201d a product is not the test. Many people would be \u201cloath to ingest\u201d castor oil or Play-Doh, but that says nothing about whether those products pose a material risk if ingested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\"> Notably, though, under the majority\u2019s apparent conclusion that inhalation or ingestion is the risk, that risk is obvious, so no -warning is needed at all \u2014 not even, \u201cDo not ingest or inhale.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\"> The <em>Moulton </em>Court examined whether, when a steamroller was left on the street in plain view, the plaintiff needed to be warned of its presence so that his horses would not be frightened by it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b597-5\"> It should again be noted that if the risk of eye irritation could be said to he obvious to the reasonably prudent product user, the majority would require no warning on the label, even if spraying it in the eyes might cause blindness, because knowledge of the material risk of eye irritation is knowledge of the material risk of blindness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\"> The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Glittenberg </em>is misplaced. There, this Court\u2019s analysis was governed by the common law. In contrast, this case is governed by MCL 600.2948, which, as the majority itself notes, \u201cdisplaced the common law.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 507-508. A number of the majority\u2019s statements in <em>Glittenberg </em>did not survive the enactment of MCL 600.2948. Particularly, its analysis was largely, if not entirely, informed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the principles surrounding simple tools and products, which principles were not incorporated into the statutory enactments. The majority ignores these facts and continues to attempt to graft common-law principles onto the statutory provision at issue. For instance, the majority asserts that had the Legislature \u201cintended to require a defendant to warn of specific dangers, it would have explicitly mandated that alteration in MCL 600.2948(2).\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 511 n 11. But the Legislature did explicitly mandate that. After <em>Glittenberg, </em>the Legislature explicitly mandated that a manufacturer warn of any \u201cmaterial\u201d risk that is not obvious to the reasonably prudent product user. When the term \u201cmaterial\u201d is given meaning, it is clear that the Legislature intended that a manufacturer warn of any danger that would cause a consumer to behave differently with respect to the product. The majority tries desperately to find a way around this simple truth, but it can do so only by a misplaced reliance on outdated concepts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b599-13\"> The majority\u2019s opinion is frighteningly far-reaching. For instance, one wonders whether manufacturers of toxic household products, such as bleach or ammonia, need no longer place any warnings on their products. I think this is the result because the majority would most likely conclude that anyone would know that accidentally drinking these products would cause illness. Thus, no warning that the products are fatal if ingested would be needed. Consumer protection has certainly taken two steps back today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b600-7\">KELLY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALA\">(dissenting). I agree with the majority that MCL 600.2948(2) imposes a duty to warn that extends only to material risks not obvious to a reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>prudent product user. I agree that the duty involves material risks that are not, or should not be, a matter of common knowledge to the person who was injured by the product. However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s determination that the risk of ingesting or aspirating Wonder 8 Hair Oil is, as a matter of law, obvious to a reasonably prudent product user. Hence, the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition to defendants should be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">There is evidence that the plaintiff in this case was a reasonably prudent product user to whom the risk may not have been obvious. The Court of Appeals observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">In her deposition, plaintiff testified that she always kept her nail care products, e.g., polish and acrylic, in a locked case because she knew that they could be harmful if swallowed. She stated that most of these products displayed a warning to that effect....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">In an affidavit, plaintiff confirmed that she kept her nail care products in a locked case because of her knowledge that such products could be toxic. Additionally, she averred that. .. she stored all products that she knew to be toxic, such as bleach and ammonia, in a locked cabinet. Plaintiff asserted that, generally, it was her habit to read product labels because she had two small children. <em>[Greene v A P Products, </em>264 Mich App 391, 396; 691 NW2d 38 (2004).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Manufacturers and sellers must disclose safety-related information when they know or should know that the buyer or user is unaware of that information. <em>Glittenberg v Doughboy Recreational Industries (On Rehearing), </em>441 Mich 379, 386; 491 NW2d 208 (1992). The Wonder 8 Hair Oil container did not bear any warning that it should be kept out of the reach of children or that it was toxic and potentially fatal, let alone harmful. It provided no information about how to respond to accidental ingestion or aspiration.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Nonetheless the majority concludes that the statute imposes \u201cno duty to warn beyond obvious material risks\u201d or \u201cto warn of a specific type of injury that could result from a risk.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 510. The majority acknowledges that the Court of Appeals \u201cproperly applied an objective standard in determining the suitability of the warning,\u201d but goes on to fault that Court\u2019s determination that it could not conclude that \u201c \u2018as a matter of law, <em>the risk of death </em>from the ingestion of Wonder 8 Hair Oil would be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user and be a matter of common knowledge, especially considering the lack of <em>any </em>relevant warning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 510, quoting <em>Greene </em>at 401 (first emphasis added in the majority opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">No duty to warn exists where the consumer is in just as good a position as the manufacturer to gauge the dangers associated with the product. <em>Glittenberg </em>at 386. I do not believe that the consumer is in as good a position as the manufacturer to realize that Wonder 8 Hair Oil can cause death.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to raise a question of material fact concerning whether the material risk of death from ingesting or aspirating Wonder 8 Hair Oil is open and obvious. Rather than allowing the jury to determine the adequacy of the general warning on the product, the majority makes the decision for itself. And it fails to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, as it must. It concludes that there is no need for any warning whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The majority dismisses the product label\u2019s inclusion of \u201ceight natural oils\u201d and simply asserts that \u201c [i]t should be obvious to a reasonably prudent product user that many oils, although natural, pose a material risk if ingested or inhaled.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 512. It also concludes that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u201c[g]iven such unfamiliar ingredients, a reasonably prudent product user would be, or should be, loath to ingest it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">I disagree. The vast majority of the ingredients listed on the label are seemingly edible food products. They include avocado oil, coconut oil, and wheat germ oil. Also, the label contains a number of safely ingestible herbs: rosemary, sage, angelica root, licorice root, Job\u2019s tears, cedar, clove, lemon balm, and chamomile. In addition, the product label announces that it contains Vitamins E, A, and D. None of these ingredients alerts a reasonably prudent product user to the fatal result of ingesting them. On the contrary, they seem harmless and inviting.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">I agree with the Court of Appeals that reasonable minds can differ on whether the danger presented by swallowing or inhaling Wonder 8 Hair Oil is open and obvious. As that Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">Whether plaintiff was aware of the specific danger of serious harm or death, i.e., knowledgeable of the true extent of the risk, remembering the lack of any warning and considering the listed ingredients, is a question for the jury to resolve, not a court as a matter of law, in light of the documentary evidence presented. <em>[Greene </em>at 404.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Here, the majority improperly holds as a matter of law that Wonder 8 Hair Oil\u2019s material fatal risk was open and obvious. It finds that all reasonable users of this product should be aware that swallowing or inhaling it can result in death. Like the Court of Appeals, I do not believe that is true. The question whether the material risk is open and obvious is for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>I would reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition to defendants and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
