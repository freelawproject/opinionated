Notwithstanding the Attorney General\u2019s broad statutory authority to intervene in cases, we hold that to pursue such an appeal as an intervenor there must be a justiciable controversy, which in this case requires an appeal by an \u201caggrieved party.\u201d Because neither of the losing parties below filed a timely appeal, and because the Attorney General does not represent an aggrieved party for purposes of this case, there is no longer a justiciable controversy. Under such circumstances, the Attorney General may not independently appeal the Court of Appeals judgment. We therefore dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In 1988, Carl M. Schultz, Inc. (hereafter plaintiff), discovered that an underground storage tank and piping system located on its property had released petroleum into the soil. The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) directed plaintiff to take action to remedy this situation, and, in 1991, plaintiff began constructing an on-site treatment system. In 1992, the treatment system began operation, and, in 1993, the DNR approved plaintiffs site investigation work plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In 1991, defendant Oakland County Road Commission released petroleum on property adjacent to plaintiffs property. In 1992, plaintiff began to suspect that some of this petroleum had migrated onto its property. By 1995, the DNR concluded that at least some of the petroleum detected on plaintiffs property had originated from defendant\u2019s property. In 2000, plaintiff and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>its insurer, Federated Insurance Company, filed a cost-recovery action against defendant pursuant to provisions of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (NREPA), MCL 324.20101 <em>et seq., </em>for the added costs associated with the cleanup of petroleum contaminants that had originated from defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition, concluding that the action was barred by the six-year limitations period found in the NREPA, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 263 Mich App 62; 687 NW2d 329 (2004). On behalf of the people of the state and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) (the successor to the DNR), which had never been a party in the trial court proceedings or in the appeal in the Court of Appeals, the Attorney General then filed a timely application for leave to appeal in this Court as an intervening appellant. Plaintiffs, however, did not file a timely application for leave to appeal even though they \u201clost\u201d under the Court of Appeals opinion. This Court granted the Attorney General\u2019s application for leave to appeal and denied plaintiffs\u2019 cross-application for leave to appeal. 472 Mich 898 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Defendant argues that the Attorney General lacks the authority to intervene to appeal the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Because this issue implicates the constitutional authority of the judiciary and the Attorney General, we review it de novo. <em>Co Rd Ass\u2019n of Michigan v Governor, </em>474 Mich 11, 14; 705 NW2d 680 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">HI. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Following adjudication in the Court of Appeals that resulted in a published opinion, where the parties were plaintiffs Federated Insurance Company and Carl M. Schultz, Inc., and defendant Oakland County Road Commission, the Attorney General, representing the people of the state and the MDEQ, has now sought to appeal in this Court, even though neither of the losing parties in the Court of Appeals sought timely leave to appeal. The Attorney General argues that the Court of Appeals misconstrued MCL 324.20140(l)(a), a statute that the MDEQ frequently litigates. Resolution of whether this intervention and appeal are permissible implicates standing, the \u201caggrieved party\u201d concept, and what constitutes a justiciable controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">As we indicated in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, </em>471 Mich 608, 612; 684 NW2d 800 (2004), citing <em>Lee v Macomb Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>464 Mich 726, 734; 629 NW2d 900 (2001), standing refers to the right of a party plaintiff <em>initially </em>to invoke the power of the court to adjudicate a claimed injury in fact. In such a situation it is usually the case that the defendant, by contrast, has no injury in fact but is compelled to become a party by the plaintiffs filing of a lawsuit. In appeals, however, a similar interest is vindi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>cated by the requirement that the party seeking appellate relief be an \u201caggrieved party\u201d under MCR 7.203(A) and our case law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court has previously stated, \u201cTo be aggrieved, one must have some interest of a pecuniary nature in the outcome of the case, and not a mere possibility arising from some unknown and future contingency.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Trankla, </em>321 Mich 478, 482; 32 NW2d 715 (1948), citing <em>In re Estate of Matt Miller, </em>274 Mich 190, 194; 264 NW 338 (1936).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An aggrieved party is not one who is merely disappointed over a certain result.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, to have standing on appeal, a litigant must have suffered a concrete and particularized injury, as would a party plaintiff initially invoking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the court\u2019s power. The only difference is a litigant on appeal must demonstrate an injury arising from either the actions of the trial court or the appellate court judgment rather than an injury arising from the underlying facts of the case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">With regard to the necessity of a justiciable controversy, it derives from the constitutional requirement that the judiciary is to exercise the \u201cjudicial power\u201d and only the \u201cjudicial power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">In giving meaning to what the \u201cjudicial power\u201d is in our Constitution, we explained in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation, supra </em>at 614-615:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">The \u201cjudicial power\u201d has traditionally been defined by a combination of considerations: the existence of a real dispute, or case or controversy; the avoidance of deciding hypothetical questions; the plaintiff who has suffered real harm; the existence of genuinely adverse parties; the sufficient ripeness or maturity of a case; the eschewing of cases that are moot at any stage of their litigation; the ability to issue proper forms of effective relief to a party; the avoidance of political questions or other non-justiciable controversies; the avoidance of unnecessary constitutional issues; and the emphasis upon proscriptive as opposed to prescriptive decision making.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">Perhaps the most critical element of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d has been its requirement of a genuine case or controversy between the parties, one in which there is a real, not a hypothetical, dispute, and one in which the plaintiff has suffered a \u201cparticularized\u201d or personal injury. [Citation omitted.][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The Attorney General\u2019s authority to intervene is found in two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\">MCL 14.101 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\">The Attorney General of the State is hereby authorized and empowered to intervene in any action heretofore or hereafter commenced in any court of the State whenever such intervention is necessary in order to protect any right or interest of the State, or of the people of the State. Such right of intervention shall exist at any stage of the proceeding, and the Attorney General shall have the same right to prosecute an appeal, or to apply for a re-hearing or to take any other action or step whatsoever that is had or possessed by any of the parties to such litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Similarly, MCL 14.28 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">The Attorney General shall prosecute and defend all actions in the supreme court, in which the state shall be . interested, or a party; he may, in his discretion, designate one of the assistant attorneys general to be known as the solicitor general, who, under his direction, shall have charge of such causes in the supreme court and shall perform such other duties as may be assigned to him; and the attorney general shall also, when requested by the governor, or either branch of the legislature, and may, when in his own judgment the interests of the state require it, intervene in and appear for the people of this state in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>any other court or tribunal, in any cause or matter, civil or criminal, in which the people of this state may be a party or interested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">These statutes purport to provide the Attorney General with the authority to prosecute, defend, and intervene in certain \u201cactions.\u201d But, this case ceased to be an \u201caction\u201d when the losing parties below (plaintiffs) failed to file a timely application for leave to appeal in this Court. Once plaintiffs\u2019 deadline for filing a timely application for leave to appeal expired, the case ceased to be a justiciable controversy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the extent one might read MCL 14.101 or MCL 14.28 as allowing the Attorney General to prosecute an appeal from a lower court ruling without the losing party below also appealing, and without the Attorney General himself being or representing an aggrieved party, the statutes would exceed the Legislature\u2019s authority because, except where expressly provided,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this Court is not constitutionally authorized to hear nonjusticiable controver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>sies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation, supra </em>at 614-615. To give these statutes such a reading would contravene an operative presumption of this Court that we presume constitutional intent on the part of the Legislature. See <em>Phillips v Mirac, Inc, </em>470 Mich 415, 422; 685 NW2d 174 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\">IV RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">The dissent relies on two cases in arguing that the Attorney General should be allowed to appeal in this Court notwithstanding the fact that the losing parties below did not file a timely appeal: <em>Mundy v McDonald, </em>216 Mich 444; 185 NW 877 (1921), and <em>Russell v Peoples Wayne Co Bank of Dearborn, </em>275 Mich 415; 266 NW 401 (1936). These cases, however, are not inconsistent with our holding today; nor do they support the holding the dissent would adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In <em>Mundy, </em>a circuit judge was sued in circuit court for libel. The Attorney General\u2019s office, on behalf of the circuit judge, sought dismissal of the lawsuit. On appeal, this Court rejected the argument that the Attorney General\u2019s office could not defend a circuit judge who had been sued. The Attorney General\u2019s office represented an actual defendant party in that lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In <em>Russell, </em>a receiver of the Detroit Banker\u2019s Company filed a lawsuit seeking to have liquidating receivers appointed for other banks. The Attorney General\u2019s office intervened in the case and moved to dismiss the lawsuit. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the Attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ney General should not have been permitted to move to dismiss the case because the public had no interest in the litigation. This Court rejected the plaintiffs claim because the banking commissioner became a \u201cparty\u201d when the plaintiff sought to have receivers appointed. Again, the Attorney General\u2019s office represented an actual party in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Each of these cases is inapposite because it presented a justiciable controversy wherein the Attorney General represented an actual party. In the case at bar, however, no justiciable controversy exists and the Attorney General does not represent a party to the dispute. Moreover, none of these cases cited by the dissent involved the Attorney General attempting to appeal a decision of a lower court without the losing party below also appealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Our opinion does not overrule any cases. Under our holding, the Attorney General remains free to prosecute actions on behalf of the state and may appear on behalf of state parties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, it is not inconsistent with the Attorney General\u2019s authority to intervene in \u201cactions.\u201d As previously explained, we merely hold that the Attorney General\u2019s authority to intervene does not include the ability to appeal a nonjusticiable case. Given the untethered language in the dissent, one has to wonder if there is any circumstance in which the dissent would conclude that the Attorney General would not have the authority to intervene and pursue an appeal no matter how unrelated the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d may be to traditional standing considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Contrary to the dissent\u2019s contention, the issue of the Attorney General\u2019s authority to independently intervene and appeal the Court of Appeals opinion was raised by the defendant in its brief on appeal; it was argued at oral argument, and it was briefed by the Attorney General and defendant in supplemental briefs. Finally, contrary to the dissent\u2019s contention, we are not expanding the standing theory; rather, our holding is consistent with our prior case law as cited in n 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">We conclude that there is no justiciable controversy because the Attorney General does not represent an aggrieved party and because neither of the losing parties below chose to file a timely application for leave to appeal. Under such circumstances, this Court does not have the authority to hear the Attorney General\u2019s appeal. Therefore, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-5\">Corrigan, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Taylor, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-4\"> Plaintiffs filed an application for leave to appeal in this Court after the deadline for filing an application for leave to appeal had expired. Plaintiffs sought to avoid MCR. 7.302(C)(3) (\u201c[l]ate applications will not be accepted\u201d) by designating the appeal as a cross-application for leave to appeal. Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ccross-application\u201d fully supported the Attorney General-intervening appellant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. But, plaintiffs cannot be considered cross-appellants where their position is the same as that taken by the Attorney General-intervening appellant. Therefore, although plaintiffs referred to their application for leave to appeal as a cross-application, it was actually an untimely application for leave to appeal. This is why we denied plaintiffs\u2019 application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-4\"> See, e.g., <em>Ford Motor Co v Jackson (On Rehearing), </em>399 Mich 213, 225; 249 NW2d 29 (1976) (Coleman, J.), citing <em>In re Critchell\u2019s Estate, </em>361 Mich 432; 105 NW2d 417 (1960). \u201c \u2018A party who could not benefit from a change in the judgment has no appealable interest.\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018[0]f course one may not appeal from a judgment, order or decree, in his favor by which he is not injuriously affected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226, quoting 4 Am Jur 2d, Appeal and Error, \u00a7\u00a7 182, 184.

Consistent with the principles of appellate standing, where the Attorney General intervenes solely to advocate a general position on the law, the intervention statutes on which the Attorney General relies confer on the Attorney General only a form of \u201cstatutory amicus,\u201d not true party, status. Thus, if the Attorney General had sought to intervene in a timely filed appeal by a party with appellate standing \u2014 not to represent a client that had suffered an adverse decision of a lower court but only to advance a perspective on the law \u2014 the Attorney General\u2019s role would have been limited to advocating the state\u2019s position on the law. Whatever role the Attorney General may properly play in an appeal in which he intervenes, the precondition for intervention is that there must be a timely appeal by a party that has appellate standing as outlined in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> See, e.g., Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 8, which permits the legislative and executive branches of government to request an opinion of this Court on the constitutionality of legislation not yet in effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\"> Although the MDEQ might well have an interest in how MCL 324.20140(l)(a) is interpreted, it has not yet suffered a concrete injury on the basis of the alleged misconstruction of the statute.

Pursuant to MCL 14.28, the Attorney General may,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">when in his own judgment the interests of the state require it, intervene in and appear for the people of this state in any other court or tribunal, in any cause or matter, civil or criminal, in which the people of this state may be a party or interested.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>MCL 14.101 provides that the Attorney General\u2019s power to intervene exists</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-3\">at any stage of the proceeding, and the Attorney General shall have the same right to prosecute an appeal, or to apply for a re-hearing or to take any other action or step whatsoever that is had or possessed by any of the parties to such litigation.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">This Court, including the members of this majority, has broadly construed the authority of the Attorney General to litigate on behalf of the people of the state. <em>In re Certified Question (Wayne Co v Phillip Morris, Inc), </em>465 Mich 537, 543-545; 638 NW2d 409 (2002); <em>Mundy v McDonald, </em>216 Mich 444, 450-451; 185 NW 877 (1921). This Court, including this majority, has stated that \u201ccourts should accord substantial deference to the Attorney General\u2019s decision that a matter constitutes a state interest.\u201d <em>In re Certified Question, supra </em>at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Until this majority\u2019s decision today, the only limitations on the Attorney General\u2019s power to intervene have been that the intervention must advance a state, rather than a merely local, interest,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Attorney General\u2019s intervention must not be \u201cclearly inimical to the public interest... .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But now this majority ignores <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>its own precedent and the express statutory authority provided by MCL 14.101 that permits the Attorney General to intervene on behalf of a state interest at any time. The majority legislates from the bench a new restriction on the Attorney General\u2019s authority to intervene by premising it on a losing party\u2019s decision to pursue or not pursue an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The majority declares that without a losing party, there is no justiciable controversy. But as this Court stated in <em>Mundy, supra </em>at 451, \u201cIt is too narrow a view of the case to say that the people of this State are not interested in the defense in a case of this nature, which involves the purely legal question . ...\u201d <em>Mundy, supra, </em>involved an action for libel against a circuit judge. The Attorney General intervened and filed a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that the judge was acting in his official capacity when the allegedly libelous statement was made. The party alleging libel against the judge challenged the Attorney General\u2019s authority to intervene to address a purely legal question. This Court in <em>Mundy, supra </em>at 451, affirmed the authority of the Attorney General to intervene and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">Certainly if the people of the State can be said to be interested in a criminal proceeding, they are, we think, equally interested in this action growing out of it, depending as it does entirely upon whether the acts of the defendant complained of were judicial acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">In this case, the legal issue involves the proper interpretation of a statute of limitations within the NREPA. The resolution of this question affects the proper allocation of costs for response activities for environmental contamination. The Legislature has very clearly provided that a person who causes environmental contamination should pay for its cleanup. MCL 324.20102(f) provides that \u201cliability for response activities to address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>environmental contamination should be imposed upon those persons who are responsible for the environmental contamination.\u201d The logic of <em>Mundy </em>is decisive in this case: Because the people of Michigan through their Legislature have expressed an interest in the proper allocation of response activity costs for environmental cleanup, it is \u201ctoo narrow a view\u201d to conclude that the people would not also be interested in the proper interpretation of a statute that affects the allocation of those costs. The majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Mundy </em>on the ground that the Attorney General represented an \u201cactual party\u201d in that case is unpersuasive. The majority fails to grasp that the people of Michigan became an \u201cactual party\u201d once the Attorney General intervened in a timely manner on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">I would conclude that the Attorney General may intervene on behalf of the people of Michigan to seek a proper interpretation of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In addition to having the authority to intervene on behalf of the people of Michigan, the Attorney General has the authority to intervene in this matter on behalf of the MDEQ. The MDEQ is a department of the executive branch. MCL 14.29 provides that \u201c[i]t shall be the duty of the attorney general, at the request of the governor ... to prosecute and defend all suits relating to matters connected with [the Governor\u2019s] departments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">This Court, including the members of this majority, has specifically recognized that the Attorney General\u2019s authority to litigate in matters of state interest necessarily includes the authority to litigate \u201con behalf of the state\u2019s political subdivisions in matters of state interest.\u201d <em>In re Certified Question, supra </em>at 545, citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><em>Michigan ex rel Kelley v CR Equip Sales, Inc, </em>898 F Supp 509, 514 (WD Mich, 1995). Further, the NREPA expressly provides that the Attorney General may commence a civil action \u201con behalf of the state\u201d seeking relief, including \u201c[a]ny other relief necessary for the enforcement of this part.\u201d MCL 324.20137(l)(k).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>majority\u2019s opinion, however, fails to recognize or analyze the interest of the MDEQ in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The MDEQ has a tangible interest in the resolution of this case. In 1995, the MDEQ notified defendant, Oakland County Road Commission, that the department had identified and confirmed a release of \u201cfree product\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> from an underground storage tank on defendant\u2019s property that had migrated to plaintiffs property. The MDEQ\u2019s letter refers to plaintiffs property as the CMS \u201cfacility.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The MDEQ letter states that the treatment system constructed to remediate the plaintiffs 1988 separate release of hazardous substances at the CMS facility had been activated in August 1992. The system had removed hazardous substances associated with the plaintiffs release at the CMS facility through approximately June 1993. The letter indicates that from January 1994 through September 1994, no hazardous substances had been observed in the plaintiffs treatment system.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>However, in November 1994, the letter states that the CMS treatment system encountered hazardous substances again. After an investigation by the department staff, it was confirmed that the hazardous substances appearing in CMS\u2019s treatment system were different in kind from that which had been released by the plaintiff. The investigation confirmed that the new hazardous substances that had appeared in plaintiffs treatment system derived from a separate release from defendant\u2019s facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The record does not suggest that the MDEQ\u2019s investigation of the separate release from defendant\u2019s facility is complete. Indeed, the letter recommends that several actions be taken by defendant to address the hazardous substances, and that remedial action for the confirmed April 5, 1991, release at the defendant\u2019s facility be continued. The letter recommends that remedial actions taken by the defendant be coordinated with those already occurring at the CMS facility. The letter also provides that the letter \u201cshould not be construed as a sign-off on all site investigations or corrective actions that may be required at [defendant\u2019s] site.\u201d In other words, the MDEQ has an interest in ongoing investigations and remediation of environmental contamination from defendant\u2019s facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The MDEQ\u2019s interest in this case derives from its enforcement responsibility under the NREPA.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The NREPA provides that the owner or operator of a facility \u201cis responsible for an activity causing a release\u201d of hazardous substances into the environment. MCL 324.20126(l)(a). MCL 324.20126a(l) provides that a person who is liable for a release is jointly and severally liable for the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>(a) All costs of response activity lawfully incurred by the state relating to the selection and implementation of response activity....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-3\">Ob) Any other necessary costs of response activity incurred by any other person consistent with rules relating to the selection and implementation of response activity promulgate under this part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">(c) Damages for the full value of injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources, including the reasonable costs of assessing the injury, destruction, or loss resulting from the release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The letter from the MDEQ to defendant reveals that there was a confirmed release of hazardous substances into the environment at defendant\u2019s facility in April 1991, but that the release from defendant\u2019s facility did not appear in plaintiffs treatment system until November 1994. Under the NREPA, defendant is jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with defendant\u2019s release. MCL 324.20126a(l). The MDEQ is and should be interested in the proper enforcement of the NREPA against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The Court of Appeals, however, concluded that this cost-recovery action against defendant was barred by the statute of limitations because more than six years had passed since plaintiff began construction of its treatment system in November 1991. The NREPA statute of limitations at issue provides that the period of limitations</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">[f]or the recovery of response activity costs and natural resources damages pursuant to section 20126a(l)(a), (b), or (c), [is] wdthin 6 years of initiation of physical on-site construction activities for the remedial action selected or approved by the department at a facility.... [MCL 324.20140(l)(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Plaintiff initiated its cost-recovery action against defendant in November 2000, within six years from the date that it was confirmed that defendant\u2019s separate release had comingled with plaintiffs. The Attorney General, on behalf of the MDEQ, argues that the Court of Appeals conclusion that the period ran from November 1991, before plaintiff was even aware of defendant\u2019s separate release, was wrong. Therefore, the Attorney General intervened on behalf of the MDEQ and filed this timely application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The Attorney General has the authority to represent the MDEQ\u2019s interest in challenging the Court of Appeals interpretation of the NREPA statute of limitations. The MDEQ is conducting an ongoing investigation into the separate release of hazardous substances for which defendant is liable at defendant\u2019s separate facility. There is no evidence in the record that there has been any \u201cinitiation of physical on-site construction activities for the remedial action selected or approved by the department\u201d at defendant\u2019s facility.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is notable that plaintiffs treatment facility was constructed to remediate the contamination caused by plaintiff at plaintiffs separate facility. It defies common sense to commence the running of the period of limitations from the initiation of construction activities at plaintiffs facility, when those activities preceded any confirmation of and perhaps even any actual comingling of hazardous substances from defendant\u2019s separate release and facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The majority fails to analyze the independent interest of the MDEQ in this matter. Instead, it ignores it and suggests that the Attorney General\u2019s authority to intervene must be predicated on a losing party\u2019s decision to appeal. This reasoning ignores this Court\u2019s prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>case law that recognized that the interest of a state department in the subject matter of a lawsuit justifies the Attorney General\u2019s participation in the suit on behalf of that department.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\">In <em>Russell v Peoples Wayne Co Bank of Dearborn, </em>275 Mich 415; 266 NW 401 (1936), this Court held that the Attorney General could intervene on behalf of the state banking commissioner in a matter involving agreements for the liquidation of certain banks. The state banking commissioner had approved the agreements, but when a dispute later arose between the parties, the Attorney General intervened on behalf of the banking commissioner. This Court rejected a challenge to the authority of the Attorney General to intervene, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">[T]he suits at bar grew out of the mentioned agreements, approved by the banking commissioner, and assertion of right by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation as a creditor and, therefore, the State, through its banking commissioner, with power over banks and banking, had an interest in the subject-matter of the litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">The liquidation by agreement was consented to by the banking commissioner and, inasmuch as liquidation of a State bank is under control of the banking commissioner, when plaintiff sought by the suit for the appointment of liquidating receivers rather than under the approved agreements, the banking commissioner was again a party in interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">The attorney general not only had a right to intervene but to move to dismiss the bills for want of jurisdiction in the court to appoint a receiver. <em>[Russell, supra </em>at 418-419.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">As in <em>Russell, </em>I would hold that the Attorney General has the authority to intervene and represent the interests of the MDEQ in this case. The majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Russell </em>on the ground that the Attorney General in that case represented an \u201cactual party\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>again misses the mark, because in this case the MDEQ was an actual party once the Attorney General intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The people, through the Legislature, have expressed in the NREPA a strong interest in appropriate response activities with respect to releases of hazardous substances<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and in the proper allocation of liability<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for such releases. With respect to the allocation of response activity costs, MCL 324.20102(f) provides that \u201cliability for response activities to address environmental contamination should be imposed upon those persons who are responsible for the environmental contamination.\u201d The statute further provides at MCL 324.20126a(7) that the \u201ccosts recoverable under this section may be recovered in an action brought by the state or any other person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The MDEQ is charged with the enforcement of the NREPA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Attorney General, on behalf of the MDEQ, has standing to challenge the Court of Appeals interpretation of the six-year statute of limitations at issue in this case. The Court of Appeals holding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>limitations period commenced running when plaintiff began construction of a treatment system fails to recognize that plaintiffs construction began before plaintiff was even aware of the release at defendant\u2019s site and years before comingling of defendant\u2019s release with the plaintiffs was confirmed by the MDEQ. The Court of Appeals interpretation of the statute of limitations at issue undermines the MDEQ\u2019s ability to enforce the NREPA\u2019s cost-recovery provisions against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Even though the specific issue of who qualifies as an \u201caggrieved party\u201d was not raised or briefed by the parties, the majority chooses this case to redefine and limit who is an \u201caggrieved party\u201d for the purpose of invoking appellate court jurisdiction.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The majority uses this case to expand the erroneous standing theory that it adopted in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>by applying it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>to parties appealing from a trial court judgment. The majority requires that to have the right to appeal, a party must be an \u201caggrieved party,\u201d and to be \u201caggrieved\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">a litigant must have suffered a concrete and particularized injury, as would a party plaintiff initially invoking the court\u2019s power. The only difference is a litigant on appeal must demonstrate an injuiy arising from either the actions of the trial court or the appellate court judgment rather than an injury arising from the underlying facts of the case. <em>[Ante </em>at 291-292.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">For this new test, the majority cites two inapplicable federal cases that address the limitation on federal court jurisdiction imposed by the case or controversy requirement of the federal constitution, art III, \u00a7 2. In <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, </em>the same majority superimposed the same inapplicable federal constitutional constraints on the standing of Michigan citizens in state court actions. As I previously addressed in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, </em>art III, \u00a7 2 constraints do not apply to state court jurisdiction. See <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, supra </em>at 660-661 (WEAVER, J., concurring in result only.) This is true at both the trial court and appellate court levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The majority\u2019s redefinition of \u201caggrieved party\u201d to require a \u201cconcrete and particularized injury\u201d imposes a higher threshold than this Court\u2019s previous articulations of \u201caggrieved party.\u201d This Court has previously held that to be an \u201caggrieved party\u201d simply requires that a party have some interest, \u201cpecuniary or other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>wise,\u201d in the subject matter of a case. See <em>In re Critchell\u2019s Estate, </em>361 Mich 432, 450; 105 NW2d 417 (1960). <em>In re Critchell </em>recognized that an interest may be something other than pecuniary, for example, in cases involving the adoption of a child. <em>Id. </em>at 449, citing <em>In re Draime, </em>356 Mich 368; 97 NW2d 115 (1959). The majority\u2019s new test for invoking appellate jurisdiction unnecessarily heightens the burden of all parties who pursue an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\">The majority\u2019s decision severely erodes the authority of the Attorney General to defend state interests in this Court. Without analysis, the majority concludes that neither the MDEQ nor the people of the state of Michigan are aggrieved by the decision of the Court of Appeals under the majority\u2019s new test. The majority implies that the people of Michigan and the MDEQ\u2019s interests are \u201ctangential\u201d and declares that despite the Attorney General\u2019s timely and proper intervention on behalf of state interests in this case, the Attorney General cannot appeal to this Court unless a losing party also files a timely appeal. The majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">To the extent one might read MCL 14.101 or MCL 14.28 as allowing the Attorney General to prosecute an appeal from a lower court ruling without the losing party below also appealing, and without the Attorney General himself being or representing an aggrieved party, the statutes would exceed the Legislature\u2019s authority because, except where expressly provided, this Court is not constitutionally authorized to hear nonjusticiable controversies. <em>[Ante </em>at 294-295.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">As explained in the preceding parts of this dissent, in the context of this case, the people of Michigan and the MDEQ have clear and defined interests in the outcome of this appeal. The interests of the people of Michigan and the MDEQ in this case are sufficient under Michigan\u2019s prior case law to make them \u201caggrieved parties.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>As discussed above, both the people of Michigan and the MDEQ have some interest, pecuniary or otherwise, in the outcome of this case. See, e.g., <em>In re Critchell, supra </em>at 450. Further, the Attorney General intervened in a timely manner to represent those interests and has the statutory authority to \u201cprosecute and defend all actions in the supreme court, in which the state shall be interested ... .\u201d MCL 14.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Yet, the majority fails to analyze or address the state\u2019s interests in this case. Instead, the majority opines that there is no \u201cjusticiable controversy\u201d before this Court because Federated did not appeal properly. <em>Ante </em>at 294. In so holding, the majority overrules without any explanation Michigan\u2019s longstanding precedent that recognized the Attorney General\u2019s broad authority to intervene, prosecute, and defend matters of state interest in the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In order to represent the interests of the people of Michigan or the MDEQ in this litigation, the majority effectively requires the Attorney General to convince another party, over whom the Attorney General has no control and who the Attorney General does not represent, to pursue an appeal. There are many reasons that a party might not pursue an appeal, and it is wrong to hinge the defense of the interests of the people of Michigan and those of the MDEQ on the decisions or strategies of another party. Moreover, it is wrong for the majority to use this case to limit who is an \u201caggrieved party\u201d for the purpose of invoking appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>jurisdiction, especially since the definition of \u201caggrieved party\u201d was neither raised nor briefed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">For these reasons, I dissent and would hold that the Attorney General has the authority, on behalf of the people of Michigan and on behalf of the MDEQ, to pursue this appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b389-4\">CAVANAGH and KELLY, JJ., concurred with WEAVER, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-10\"> <em>Federated, Ins Co v Oakland Co Rd Comm, </em>263 Mich App 62; 687 NW2d 329 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-11\"> MCR 7.302(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"> Federated Insurance Company filed an untimely cross-application for leave to appeal, which this Court denied. 472 Mich 898 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\"> MCL 14.101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b374-10\"> MCL 14.28 states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">The attorney general shall prosecute and defend all actions in the supreme court, in which the state shall be interested, or a party; he may, in his discretion, designate one of the assistant attorneys general to be known as the solicitor general, who, under his direction, shall have charge of such causes in the supreme court and shall perform such other duties as may be assigned to him; and the attorney general shall also, when requested by the governor, or either branch of the legislature, and may, when in his own judgment the interests of the state require it, intervene in and appear for the people of this state in any other court or tribunal, in any cause or matter, civil or criminal, in which the people of this state may be a party or interested.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b375-6\"> MCL 14.101 states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">The Attorney General of the State is hereby authorized and empowered to intervene in any action heretofore or hereafter commenced in any court of the State whenever such intervention is necessary in order to protect any right or interest of the State, or of the people of the State.
