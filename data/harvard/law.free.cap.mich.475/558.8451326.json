Plaintiffs filed a FOIA request for documents associated with the agreement. Requested were \u201csite plans\u201d and \u201cglobal readings\u201d on real property, all exhibits to the agreement, including certain exhibits listed as intentionally deleted, and side agreements or letters related to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision that the requested documents were exempt from disclosure. <em>Coblentz v Novi, </em>264 Mich App 450; 691 NW2d 22 (2004). We affirm in part and reverse in part that decision. We conclude that the Court of Appeals appropriately affirmed the grant of summary disposition to defendant on plaintiffs\u2019 request for \u201csite plans\u201d and \u201cglobal readings.\u201d But the Court of Appeals erred in affirming summary disposition regarding the request for all exhibits to the underlying settlement agreement, including the intentionally deleted exhibits. These exhibits were not exempt from disclosure and were sufficiently identified in the FOIA request.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The Court of Appeals also erred in affirming summary disposition for defendant on the requested \u201cside agreements\u201d to the settlement agreement. These items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>were not exempt because defendant failed to comply with MCL 15.243(l)(f)(iii). Finally, the Court of Appeals erred in finding appropriate the fees that defendant charged for its attorney\u2019s work in separating documents. The attorney in question was not an employee of defendant. Therefore, we remand this case to the trial court for entry of a judgment compelling disclosure consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">I. RELEVANT FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In a separate civil action against defendant, Sandstone Associates Limited Partnership-A (Sandstone) obtained a judgment that totaled tens of millions of dollars, including costs, interest, and attorney fees. Sandstone and defendant then entered into an agreement in which defendant waived its appellate rights and Sandstone received real property rather than the money judgment. The major component of the agreement called for defendant to turn over 75 \u201cnet usable\u201d acres to Sandstone for development.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The property had previously been set aside as parkland. It is adjacent to property owned by plaintiffs. Some of the property carried deed restrictions, including possible reciprocal negative easements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 properties contained the same deed restrictions. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>settlement agreement required defendant to arrange for the removal of the deed restrictions on its property and on plaintiffs\u2019 property. It was agreed that, if defendant failed, it would convey additional property to Sandstone. In an effort to remove the restrictions, defendant contacted plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Plaintiffs retained counsel who filed a FOIA request with defendant, seeking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">1. All exhibits, including but not limited to exhibits G, T, U, <em>V, W, </em>AA, BB, GG, MM, NN, PB for the Agreement for Entry of Consent Judgment dated June 25, 2002 between Sandstone and the City of Novi;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">2. Any and all site plans for Sandstone regarding the 75 dedicated acres; and....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Defendant\u2019s attorney responded to these requests by writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">1. Exhibits G, T, U, <em>V, W, </em>AA, BB, GG, MM, NN, PP: I have advised you by phone and letter that there are no such exhibits. The reference in the index, indicating that they were intentionally deleted, is merely to clarify for the reader that such exhibits have not been lost or detached from the Agreement. These exhibits do not exist, and never existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">2. Site Plan: I have also advised you by phone and letter that a site plan or concept plan for the 75 acres does not exist. It has never existed. I do not know how [to] provide any further explanation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">Plaintiffs then informally requested all side agreements to the Sandstone settlement agreement and the \u201cglobal readings.\u201d Defendant\u2019s attorney responded that he did not know what \u201cglobal\u201d meant. With regard to the side agreements, he stated that he assumed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>this meant the \u201cside letters\u201d to the Sandstone agreement. He indicated that he was attempting to learn from Sandstone\u2019s counsel which of the side letters were submitted with an understanding of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Plaintiffs next filed a second FOIA request. Among the items sought were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">1. Any and all side agreements entered into between the City of Novi and Sandstone and/or its attorneys or representatives;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">2. Global readings on \u201cextra land\u201d; global positioning satellite (GPS) readings on \u201cextra land\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">3. Settlement agreements, releases, copies of drafts in settlement of the insurance cases relating to this property!;.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">After plaintiffs\u2019 second FOIA request, defendant began to negotiate with Sandstone for release of the side agreements. Sandstone initially stated that none could be released, but later agreed to release five of the seven side letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">In response to this FOIA request, defendant told plaintiffs that global or GPS readings did not exist. It also refused to release the two remaining side agreements, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-11\">The request is denied with regard to two documents representing commercial and/or financial information voluntarily submitted to the City of Novi for use in developing governmental policy... as contemplated and required under MCL 15.243(g) [sic, (l)(f)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">Plaintiffs filed a complaint in the circuit court seeking production of all intentionally deleted exhibits. Plaintiffs claimed that they had located one of the exhibits, exhibit AA, despite the fact that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>contended that it never existed. They also asked the court to order production of global readings, site plans, and all side agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Defendant filed a motion for summary disposition before the close of discovery. Attached was an affidavit from its mayor, Richard Clark. Clark stated that, as of the date of the affidavit, Sandstone had submitted no site plans for the 75 acres. He also affirmed that no \u201cglobal readings\u201d or GPS readings existed in connection with the Sandstone settlement agreement. Plaintiffs responded, but did not attach any documentary evidence rebutting Clark\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The court granted defendant\u2019s motion in part. Regarding the site plans and global readings, it found, on the basis of Clark\u2019s affidavit, that none existed. It concluded that further depositions of other city officials on the topic would be duplicative. The circuit court denied defendant\u2019s request for summary disposition on the fee issue pending further hearings. It also deferred ruling on the side agreements until it could make an in camera review. With respect to the intentionally deleted exhibits, it found them irrelevant and granted summary disposition for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Following its review of the side agreements that defendant claimed were exempt, the court found that defendant properly complied with the requirements of MCL 15.243(l)(f). The side letters, it found, fell within the governmental policy exemption of FOIA because they helped to facilitate the Sandstone agreement. Thus, it granted summary disposition to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The trial court then turned to the appropriateness of the fees for its attorney that defendant charged to plaintiffs. Defendant contended that the fees were appropriate because defendant\u2019s attorney was the lowest paid employee who could separate the exempt side <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>letters from the nonexempt letters. The court granted summary disposition to defendant on this issue. It found that the attorney was defendant\u2019s employee and concluded that the fees were appropriate under MCL 15.234. In the same order, the court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">On plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, the Court of Appeals concluded that it was not appropriate for the lower court to grant summary disposition concerning the intentionally deleted exhibits on the basis of relevance. But it affirmed the decision on alternative grounds, concluding that the intentionally deleted exhibits were not part of the final settlement agreement. It based its conclusion on the fact that these exhibits were listed in the agreement with the words \u201cINTENTIONAL DELETION\u201d written next to them. <em>Coblentz, </em>264 Mich App 453-454.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Regarding the global readings and site plans, the Court of Appeals found that summary disposition was appropriate because of Clark\u2019s affidavit and plaintiffs\u2019 failure to offer factual support for their existence. It also concluded that summary disposition was appropriate despite the fact that discovery had not been concluded. The Court opined that it was unlikely that further discovery would provide the factual support necessary. <em>Id. </em>at 454-457.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">It found that the two side agreements were exempt from disclosure. Specifically, it concluded that defendant adequately complied with FOIA\u2019s requirement that it place a description of the exempt material in a central location within a reasonable time. This is despite the fact that defendant did not file the description until after plaintiffs had made their FOIA requests and until five months after Sandstone had submitted the documents. The Court of Appeals found this reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>because negotiations had continued between defendant and Sandstone over the deed restrictions. <em>Id. </em>at 458-459.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Finally, the Court of Appeals found the fees charged for the work of defendant\u2019s attorney appropriate. It concluded that defendant\u2019s attorney met the dictionary definition of an employee. And it found that he was the lowest paid employee who could handle the FOIA request. <em>Id. </em>at 460-461.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Plaintiffs sought, and we subsequently granted, leave to appeal. 474 Mich 886 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">We review questions of statutory interpretation and the proper application of statutes using a de novo standard. <em>Adams Outdoor Advertising, Inc v City of Holland, </em>463 Mich 675, 681; 625 NW2d 377 (2001). We review rulings on motions for summary disposition using the de novo standard as well. <em>Spiek v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>456 Mich 331, 337; 572 NW2d 201 (1998). Summary disposition was granted here under MCR 2.116(C)(10).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reviewing a ruling made under this court rule, a court tests the factual support by reviewing the documentary evidence submitted by the parties. <em>Spiek, </em>456 Mich 337. We review the evidence and all legitimate inferences in the light most favorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>to the nonmoving party. <em>Wilkinson v Lee, </em>463 Mich 388, 391; 617 NW2d 305 (2000). \u201cWhere the proffered evidence fails to establish a genuine issue regarding any material fact, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Maiden v Rozwood, </em>461 Mich 109, 120; 597 NW2d 817 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The standard of review for FOIA cases was clarified this term in <em>Herald Co, Inc v Eastern Michigan Univ Bd of Regents, </em>475 Mich 463; 719 NW2d 19 (2006). The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">We continue to hold that the clear error standard of review is appropriate where the parties challenge the <em>factual findings </em>of the trial court. However, where the parties do not dispute the underlying facts but rather challenge the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion, we hold that an appellate court must review that determination for an abuse of discretion, which this Court now defines as a determination that is outside the principled range of outcomes. <em>[Id. </em>at 467 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The determination whether a description of material claimed to be exempt under MCL 15.243(l)(f) was recorded in a central location within a reasonable time after submission is a discretionary one. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s decision on the defendant\u2019s compliance with the requirements of MCL 15.243(l)(f)(iii) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">III. SITE PLANS AND GLOBAL READINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">In response to plaintiffs\u2019 request for site plans and global readings, defendant provided Clark\u2019s affidavit claiming that the documents did not exist. If a record does not exist, it cannot be produced. Given that defendant denied the existence of the records and that it provided supporting documentation for its position, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>burden shifted to plaintiffs to produce documentation to counter defendant\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">MCR 2.116(G)(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">A motion under subrule (C)(10) must specifically identify the issues as to which the moving party believes there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. When a motion under subrule (C)(10) is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his or her pleading, but must, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him or her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Under this court rule, a plaintiff cannot rest solely on its complaint. Affidavits, pleadings, depositions, admissions, or other documentary evidence must be offered to survive summary disposition. See <em>Smith v Globe Life Ins Co, </em>460 Mich 446, 454; 597 NW2d 28 (1999). In this case, plaintiffs failed to provide such documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Regarding the global readings, plaintiffs admit that they are unsure what they were seeking. They base their request on a handwritten note contained in one of the drafts of the Sandstone agreement. The note is in the margin and merely states \u201cglobal.\u201d Plaintiffs concede that they were guessing at the meaning of the word. Plaintiffs offer no documentary evidence showing that their guess was well-founded. Therefore, the trial court properly granted summary disposition. MCR 2.116(G)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">The site plans present a similar situation. While everyone agrees that, eventually, site plans for the development must be filed with defendant, the question is whether they had been filed at the time of plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA request. Again, defendant provided Clark\u2019s affidavit to support its contention that site plans had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>been filed with the city, and plaintiffs offered nothing to contradict this point. They did not even demonstrate that a local ordinance required Sandstone to file a site plan by the date of the FOIA request.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Without factual support to contradict Clark\u2019s affidavit, the trial court properly granted summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(0(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Plaintiffs complain that summary disposition was premature because discovery had not been completed. They assert that they were unable to depose defendant\u2019s employees, including Clark, to obtain the information necessary to counter defendant\u2019s summary disposition motion. Such situations are controlled by MCR 2.116(H), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Affidavits Unavailable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">(1) A party may show by affidavit that the facts necessary to support the party\u2019s position cannot be presented because the facts are known only to persons whose affidavits the party cannot procure. The affidavit must</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">(a) name these persons and state why their testimony cannot be procured, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">(b) state the nature of the probable testimony of these persons and the reason for the party\u2019s belief that these persons would testify to those facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">(2) When this kind of affidavit is filed, the court may enter an appropriate order, including an order</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">(a) denying the motion, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-11\">(b) allowing additional time to permit the affidavit to be supported by further affidavits, or by depositions, answers to interrogatories, or other discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>In this case, plaintiffs did not comply with MCR 2.116(H). They did not offer the required affidavits of probable testimony to support their contentions. Therefore, they cannot complain that discovery was prematurely ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Given that plaintiffs did not counter defendant\u2019s documentary evidence as required by MCR 2.116(G)(4) or MCR 2.116(H), the trial court appropriately granted summary disposition to defendant under MCR 2.116(0(10). Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals decision with regard to plaintiffs\u2019 request for global readings and site plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">IV THE INTENTIONALLY DELETED EXHIBITS</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In the final draft of the Sandstone agreement, the table of contents listed and lettered the exhibits. Next to some of the letters, the words \u201cINTENTIONAL DELETION\u201d were inserted. In their FOIA request, plaintiffs asked for all exhibits to the Sandstone agreement, including the intentionally deleted exhibits. Defendant argues that the FOIA request was not sufficiently clear. Much of this argument is based on defendant\u2019s contention that there was only one final agreement and that plaintiffs requested the exhibits to that final agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">MCL 15.233(1) states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">Except as expressly provided in section 13 [exemptions from disclosure], upon providing a public body\u2019s FOIA coordinator with a written request <em>that describes a public record sufficiently to enable the public body to find the public record, </em>a person has a right to inspect, copy, or receive copies of the requested public record of the public body. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Defendant never claimed, and still does not claim, that it does not know what plaintiffs seek. But, focusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>on its view of what constituted the final agreement, it concludes that the requested exhibits either do not exist or that defendant is not required to produce them. It claims that only the final agreement is discoverable and that the requested exhibits were not part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Even if the exhibits were not part of the final settlement agreement, defendant had to disclose them. The FOIA request sufficiently identified them. MCL 15.233(1). Defendant does not contend that it did not know what documents plaintiffs were requesting. Because plaintiffs\u2019 description was sufficient to enable defendant to identify the documents, MCL 15.233(1) required defendant to produce them regardless of whether they were part of the final agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Defendant\u2019s restrictive reading of the FOIA request is not consistent with the language of the act. MCL 15.233(1). All that a request must accomplish is to describe the record \u201csufficiently\u201d to enable the public body to identify it. Because defendant acknowledges that the FOIA request did that much, the request was adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The Legislature chose not to require an exacting standard in MCL 15.233(1). It could have required a \u201cwritten request that describes a public record precisely or fully.\u201d But, instead, the Legislature chose to use the lesser standard of \u201csufficiently.\u201d The words chosen by the Legislature are presumed intentional. We will not speculate that it used one word when it meant another. <em>Detroit v Redford Twp, </em>253 Mich 453, 456; 235 NW 217 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Moreover, requiring only a description sufficient to permit identification of the requested items is consistent with the goals and intent of the Legislature in enacting FOIA. It is a prodisclosure act. <em>Swickard v Wayne Co Medical Examiner, </em>438 Mich 536, 544; 475 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>NW2d 304 (1991). All public records are subject to full disclosure unless they are clearly exempt. <em>Id. </em>If a request is \u201csufficient\u201d to allow the public body to find a nonexempt record, the record must be disclosed. MCL 15.233(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 request satisfies this requirement. It specifically listed the intentionally deleted exhibits by letter, G, T, U, <em>V, </em>W, AA, BB, GG, MM, NN, and PE Defendant\u2019s response demonstrates that plaintiffs\u2019 description was adequate because it also listed these exhibits by letter. It is irrelevant that defendant believed these exhibits not to be part of the final agreement. Plaintiffs\u2019 request provided defendant enough information for it to understand what documents plaintiffs wished to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">A FOIA request must be fulfilled unless MCL 15.243 lists an applicable specific exemption. MCL 15.233(1). Defendant points to no exemption applicable to the intentionally deleted exhibits. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting summary disposition to defendant, and the Court of Appeals erred in affirming that decision. MCL 15.233(1) required the trial court to order defendant to turn over the intentionally deleted exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">V THE SIDE AGREEMENTS OR SIDE LETTERS</p>\n<p id=\"A9M\">A. THE SIDE LETTERS ARE NOT EXEMPT PROM DISCLOSURE</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The trial court and the Court of Appeals found two of the side letters exempt from disclosure pursuant to MCL 15.243(l)(f). That provision reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">A public body may exempt from disclosure as a public record under this act any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>(f) Trade secrets or commercial or financial information voluntarily provided to an agency for use in developing governmental policy if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">(;i) The information is submitted upon a promise of confidentiality by the public body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">(ii) The promise of confidentiality is authorized by the chief administrative officer of the public body or by an elected official at the time the promise is made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\"><em>(Hi) </em>A description of the information is recorded by the public body within a reasonable time after it has been submitted, maintained in a central place within the public body, and made available to a person upon request. This subdivision does not apply to information submitted as required by law or as a condition of receiving a governmental contract, license, or other benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Because FOIA is a prodisclosure act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the public agency bears the burden of proving that an exemption applies. MCL 15.240(4). In this case, defendant did not carry that burden. Because it failed to meet the requirements of MCL 15.243(l)(f)(iii), the side letters were not exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">B. DEFENDANT OFFERED NO LEGAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THE DELAY IN THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">We hold that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that defendant recorded a description of the side letters within a reasonable time after they were submitted to defendant. The proffered reason for the delay, ongoing negotiations between defendant and Sandstone to secure the public release of the letters, is a consideration irrelevant to the recording requirements of MCL 15.243(l)(f)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">MCL 15.243(l)(f)(iii) requires a public body to record a description of material claimed to be exempt within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>reasonable time after its submission to the body. If it fails to comply with this requirement, the material is not exempt. MCL 15.243(1) (f). Whether the time the public body takes to record a description of the material is reasonable is measured from the date the material is submitted. It is not measured from the date the parties designate it as confidential. Because reasonableness is a discretionary determination, we review the trial court\u2019s finding for an abuse of discretion. A court abuses its discretion if its determination falls beyond the principled range of outcomes. <em>Herald, </em>475 Mich 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In this case, the side letters were sent to defendant between June and July 2002. Defendant did not record a description of them until November 26, 2002, several weeks after plaintiffs\u2019 November 1,2002, FOIA request. The question, then, is whether the trial court abused its discretion when it found that this four- to five-month interval was reasonable. Defendant argues that the delay was reasonable because, in the intervening months, defendant negotiated with Sandstone to determine which of the seven side letters it could publicly release. Defendant contends that, had it immediately recorded a description of the letters and asserted a FOIA exemption, Sandstone would have been discouraged from authorizing the letters\u2019 public disclosure later. It argues that negotiations with Sandstone to disclose the letters would have been rendered futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">We reject the argument that defendant\u2019s negotiations with Sandstone made the delay reasonable and hold that the trial court abused its discretion when it found that defendant complied with MCL 15.243(l)(f)(iii). Defendant\u2019s proffered reason cannot justify <em>any </em>delay in meeting the filing requirement. However inconvenient the recording requirement may have been to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>defendant and Sandstone, defendant was still required to comply with the provisions of MCL 15.243(l)(f). This exemption is intended to provide notice to the public that a public body possesses trade secrets, commercial information, or financial information submitted to it for use in developing governmental policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">MCL 15.243(l)(f)(iii) describes how those documents must be made available for public inspection. Only by the fortuity of plaintiffs\u2019 ongoing negotiations with defendant regarding the removal of deed restrictions from plaintiffs\u2019 property did plaintiffs become aware of the side letters. Otherwise, plaintiffs would never have known or suspected that they existed. Defendant\u2019s rationale fails to explain how a requesting party could seek disclosure of a document of which it was unaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Were we to accept defendant\u2019s rationale, a public body could knowingly possess such confidential information for extended periods without providing any notice to the public that the information exists. This would defeat the purpose of the recording requirements expressed clearly in MCL 15.243(l)(f). Therefore, whether defendant could later secure Sandstone\u2019s permission to release the side letters is a consideration not legally relevant to its statutory obligation to record a description of the letters. It cannot be interpreted as a basis for finding that defendant filed a description within a \u201creasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Justice CORRIGAN\u2019S dissent argues that the unique facts of this case warranted the lengthy delay and that the trial court\u2019s discretionary determination fell within the principled range of outcomes. It misses the point that defendant\u2019s justification for the delay is legally irrelevant. Defendant bears the burden of qualifying the side letters as exempt under MCL 15.243(l)(f). Therefore, defendant must prove that the four- to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>five-month delay in recording was a \u201creasonable time.\u201d It is true, as Justice CORRIGAN contends, that the permissible time period for filing can vary. However, we do not need to pinpoint a general rule concerning what length of time would have been reasonable in this appeal because no valid reason was offered for the delay. We conclude simply that defendant\u2019s justification for the four- to five-month delay is legally irrelevant in view of the notice requirements set forth in MCL 15.243(l)(f)(iii). Therefore, the trial court\u2019s finding that this interval was reasonable falls beyond the principled range of outcomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the delay was reasonable. Because defendant failed to comply with MCL 15.243(l)(f)(iii), the side letters are not exempt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">VI. THE AVAILABILITY OF FEES FOR THE WORK OF DEFENDANT\u2019S ATTORNEY</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The lower courts erred in allowing defendant to charge plaintiffs for the work of defendant\u2019s attorney in locating the two allegedly exempt letters and separating them from the nonexempt material. MCL 15.234(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">A public body may charge a fee for a public record search, the necessary copying of a public record for inspection, or for providing a copy of a public record. Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the fee shall be limited to actual mailing costs, and to the actual incremental cost of duplication or publication including labor, the cost of search, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>examination, review, and the deletion and separation of exempt from nonexempt information as provided in section 14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">MCL 15.234(3) describes how the public body may calculate the cost of producing FOIA documents. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">In calculating the cost of labor incurred in duplication and mailing and the cost of examination, review, separation, and deletion under subsection (1), a public body may not charge more than the hourly wage of the lowest paid public body employee capable of retrieving the information necessary to comply with a request under this act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Pursuant to this statute, the public body may charge the rate of the lowest paid <em>public body employee </em>capable of retrieving the information. While the lower courts attempted to apply the language of the statute, they failed to distinguish between an employee and an independent contractor. MCL 15.234(3) allows the public body to charge for an employee\u2019s actions; it does not mention independent contractors. Therefore, to properly determine whether charges are appropriate, a court must resolve whether the person who examined the records is an employee or an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Although we have applied the economic realities test most often in the workers\u2019 compensation field, we conclude that it is instructive here. The test is a useful tool for discerning whether an employee-employer relationship exists. See <em>Clark v United Technologies Automotive Inc, </em>459 Mich 681, 687; 594 NW2d 447 (1999). The test includes but is not limited to the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">\u201cFirst, what liability, if any, does the employer incur in the event of the termination of the relationship at will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\u201cSecond, is the work being performed an integral part of the employer\u2019s business which contributes to the accomplishment of a common objective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">\u201cThird, is the position or job of such a nature that the employee primarily depends upon the emolument for payment of his living expenses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">\u201cFourth, does the employee furnish his own equipment and materials?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">\u201cFifth, does the individual seeking employment hold' himself out to the public as one ready and able to perform tasks of a given nature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">\u201cSixth, is the work or the undertaking in question customarily performed by an individual as an independent contractor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">\u201cSeventh, control, although abandoned as an exclusive criterion upon which the relationship can be determined, is a factor to be considered along with payment of wages, maintenance of discipline and the right to engage or discharge employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-10\">\u201cEighth, weight should be given to those factors which will most favorably effectuate the objectives of the statute.\u201d <em>[Hoste v Shanty Creek Mgt, Inc, </em>459 Mich 561, 568 n 6; 592 NW2d 360 (1999), quoting <em>McKissic v Bodine, </em>42 Mich App 203, 208-209; 201 NW2d 333 (1972); see also <em>Askew v Macomber, </em>398 Mich 212, 217-218; 247 NW2d 288 (1976), and <em>Schulte v American Box Board Co, </em>358 Mich 21, 32-32; 99 NW2d 367 (1959) (SMITH, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">No single factor is controlling when applying the test. <em>Clark, </em>459 Mich 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">In this case, defendant\u2019s attorney did not receive a paycheck or other employee benefits from defendant. The record reflects that the attorney was employed by a law firm that defendant retained as city attorney. The attorney acted as the lead attorney for the firm in that capacity. His social security and other employment benefits were paid by his law firm. Defendant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>directly pay the attorney for his services. Rather, defendant paid the law firm, which, in turn, paid the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The law firm provided the material and equipment necessary for the attorney to perform services for defendant. The attorney did not work exclusively for defendant, but acted as the attorney for other municipalities as well. There was no indication that the attorney was at all dependent on defendant for his living expenses. It appears that the attorney\u2019s law firm maintained control over the attorney. Finally, defendant had no liability for the attorney in the event that his association with defendant was terminated</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">This is the classic example of an independent contractor. The attorney was the employee of the law firm. He and the law firm acted as independent contractors for defendant. Because MCL 15.234(3) does not mention independent contractors, defendant was not entitled to charge for the attorney\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">FOIA allows public bodies to charge a requesting party only for employees\u2019 labor. MCL 15.234(3). Because the attorney who examined and separated the side letters was not defendant\u2019s employee, the lower courts erred in allowing defendant to charge plaintiffs under MCL 15.234(3) for the attorney\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">We affirm the part of the Court of Appeals decision that held that defendant was not required by FOIA to produce documents regarding global readings and site plans. Plaintiffs did not, as required by MCR 2.116(G)(4), counter defendant\u2019s affidavit, and they did not demonstrate, pursuant to MCR 2.116(H), that further discovery would disclose such documents. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>fore, the trial court properly granted summary disposition to defendant on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">We reverse the part of the Court of Appeals decision regarding the intentionally deleted exhibits. Plaintiffs\u2019 request provided defendant sufficient information for defendant to know which documents plaintiffs wished to review. Because no exemption from disclosure applied, MCL 15.233(1) required the trial court to order defendant to turn over the intentionally deleted exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">We also reverse the part of the Court of Appeals decision regarding the two side letters that defendant claimed were exempt. Defendant failed to comply with MCL 15.243(l)(f)(iii). It did not place a description of the material in a central location within a reasonable time of submission. This failure eliminates the side letters from being exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Finally, we reverse the part of the decision affirming the allowance of fees for the work of defendant\u2019s attorney. The attorney was an independent contractor. The lower courts erred in failing to note the legal distinction between employees and independent contractors. MCL 15.234(3) allows recovery for the costs associated only with employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">We remand this case to the trial court for entry of a judgment compelling disclosure consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b655-9\">Taylor, C.J., and Weaver, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with KELLY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\"> This Court has provided the following definition and example of a reciprocal negative easement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">There must have been a common owner of the related parcels of land, and in his various grants of the lots he must have included some restriction, either affirmative or negative, for the benefit of the land retained, evidencing a scheme or intent that the entire tract should be similarly treated.

MCL 15.234(3) states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">A fee shall not be charged for the cost of search, examination, review, and the deletion and separation of exempt from nonexempt information as provided in section 14 unless failure to charge a fee would result in unreasonably high costs to the public body because of the nature of the request in the particular instance, and the public body specifically identifies the nature of these unreasonably high costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Defendant charged $150 for the city attorney to search, examine, and review materials for the requested side agreements. But the nature of the request for the side agreements was a routine request under the Freedom of Information Act, MCL 15.231 <em>et seq., </em>and complying with the request would not result in an unreasonably high cost to defendant. Therefore, there was nothing about the nature of the request in this particular instance to warrant charging a fee to cover defendant\u2019s costs.

I dissent from its holding that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming summary disposition for defendant on plaintiffs\u2019 request for the \u201cside letters\u201d to the settlement agreement.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding that defendant recorded a description of the side letters within a reasonable time after they were submitted. Nor did the trial court err in holding that defendant satisfied the remaining requirements of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">I. PACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Sandstone Associates Limited Partnership-A (Sandstone) sent the two \u201cside letters\u201d at issue to defendant on June 25, 2002, and July 23, 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When plaintiffs first informally requested the side letters on October 16, 2002, defendant\u2019s attorney responded on October 21, 2002, by saying that he was waiting for advice from Sandstone\u2019s lawyers regarding whether to disclose the side letters because some of them \u201cwere submitted with an understanding of confidentiality.\u201d Plaintiffs filed a formal FOIA request for the side letters on November 1, 2002, asking defendant to disclose \u201c[a]ny and all side agreements entered into between the City of Novi and Sandstone and/or its attorneys or representatives^]\u201d On November 26, 2002, after negotiating with Sandstone, defendant produced five side letters, but denied plaintiffs\u2019 request in regard to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">two documents representing commercial and/or financial information voluntarily submitted to the City of Novi for use in developing governmental policy in connection with the settlement of Oakland County Circuit Court litigation entitled <em>[Sandstone Associates Limited Partnership-A v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>City of Novi, </em>Oakland Circuit Court Docket No. 95-501532-CK], as contemplated and required under MCL 15.243[(l)(f)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">On the same day, defendant recorded and filed with the city clerk descriptions of the two side letters that it had refused to disclose. Both of these side letters had been written by Sandstone and sent to defendant\u2019s attorney and marked as confidential. In one letter, Sandstone named the prices it would pay to purchase plaintiffs\u2019 (and others\u2019) properties, assuming that the properties were free from deed restrictions (Letter 1). In the other letter, Sandstone identified which parcels of property (including plaintiffs\u2019) have deed restrictions that give their owners the enforceable right to prohibit commercial use (Letter 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Following an in camera review of the two side letters and two affidavits submitted by defendant, the trial court determined that the letters were exempt from disclosure under the \u201ctrade secrets or commercial or financial information\u201d exemption of the FOIA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">The court is satisfied that Defendant complied with each of the three listed requirements of MCL 15.243(l)(f) and thus disclosure of the two side letters would be inappropriate. The court finds that the two letters contain financial or commercial information of Sandstone\u2019s voluntarily provided to Defendant by Sandstone in confidence. Further, the letters fall within the policy-making potential contemplated by the Legislature in drafting this exemption to the FOIA. They were intended to facilitate the Settlement Agreement and Consent Judgment and assist Defendant in making the policy decisions with regard to that settlement. The court finds that the content of the letters relates to Defendant\u2019s deliberations on the selection of the best government policy for the potential expenditure of substantial sums of money and the retention of land for public use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that defendant had satisfied all the requirements of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">I cannot conclude that the lower courts erred in holding that the two side letters are exempt from disclosure under the \u201ctrade secrets or commercial or financial information\u201d exemption. When reviewing the application of an FOIA exemption, an appellate court reviews legal determinations de novo, factual findings for clear error, and discretionary determinations for an abuse of discretion. <em>Herald Co, Inc v Eastern Michigan Univ Bd of Regents, </em>475 Mich 463, 471-472; 719 NW2d 19 (2006). The \u201ctrade secrets or commercial or financial information\u201d exemption provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">(1) A public body may exempt from disclosure as a public record under this act any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">(f) Trade secrets or commercial or financial information voluntarily provided to an agency <em>for use in developing governmental policy </em>if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">(i) The information is <em>submitted upon a promise of confidentiality </em>by the public body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">(ii) The promise of confidentiality is <em>authorized by the chief administrative officer of the public body or by an elected official </em>at the time the promise is made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\"><em>(Hi) A description of the information is recorded by the public body within a reasonable time </em>after it has been submitted, maintained in a central place within the public body, and made available to a person upon request. This subdivision does not apply to information submitted as required by law or as a condition of receiving a governmental contract, license, or other benefit. [MCL 15.243(l)(f) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>The burden is on the public body to demonstrate that the record is exempt from disclosure. MCL 15.240(4); <em>Federated Publications, Inc v City of Lansing, </em>467 Mich 98, 108; 649 NW2d 383 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">A. <em>\u201cA </em>DESCRIPTION OF THE INFORMATION IS RECORDED BY THE PUBLIC BODY WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">What constitutes a \u201creasonable time\u201d is a discretionary determination, as this Court described in <em>Federated Publications, Inc, supra </em>at 106-107. Thus, the trial court\u2019s determination is subject to review for an abuse of discretion. <em>Herald Co, supra </em>at 471-472. This Court \u201ccannot disturb the trial court\u2019s decision unless it falls outside the principled range of outcomes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472. The trial court\u2019s decision that defendant recorded a description of the side letters within a reasonable time after their submission to defendant, MCL 15.243(l)(f)(iii), did fall within the principled range of outcomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Even after defendant and Sandstone agreed to settle Sandstone\u2019s multimillion dollar judgment against defendant, they continued to negotiate questions regarding deed restrictions on the subject property. Sandstone believed that certain of the seven side letters (including the two letters at issue) had been submitted upon defendant\u2019s promise of confidentiality and hence were exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. While defendant agreed that some of the letters had been submitted upon a promise of confidentiality, it kept open the possibility that the letters might not be exempt under the FOIA. Defendant thus negotiated with Sandstone to determine which of the letters might be voluntarily disclosed under the FOIA. These negotiations continued until Sandstone eventually agreed to disclose five of the seven letters on November 26, 2002, the same day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>that defendant recorded the descriptions and filed them with the city clerk. Defendant did not know whether it was going to assert an FOIA exemption regarding these side letters until its negotiations with Sandstone ended. If defendant had recorded the information contained in all of these letters and asserted the \u201ctrade secrets or commercial or financial information\u201d exemption earlier than it did, Sandstone might not have agreed to disclose five of the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The majority\u2019s holding that defendant\u2019s delay in recording descriptions of the side letters was unreasonable is inconsistent with the statutory language. By using the phrase <em>\u201creasonable </em>time,\u201d the Legislature made clear that the permissible time period can vary. MCL 15.243(l)(i)(iii) does not define what constitutes a \u201creasonable time.\u201d But this Court has defined \u201creasonable time\u201d as follows: \u201cBy reasonable time is to be understood such promptitude as the situation of the parties and the circumstances of the case will allow. It never means an indulgence in unnecessary delay ....\u201d <em>Maley-Thompson &amp; Moffett Co v Thomas Forman Co, </em>179 Mich 548, 555; 146 NW 95 (1914). Yet the majority disregards the word \u201creasonable\u201d in the statute by holding that the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s recording of the descriptions, including the negotiations between defendant and Sandstone, are \u201cirrelevant,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 574, and by concluding that the delay was unreasonable because, despite the circumstances, \u201cdefendant was still required to comply with the provisions of MCL 15.243(l)(f),\u201d <em>ante </em>at 576. The majority holds that defendant was required to record descriptions earlier than it did \u201c[h]owever inconvenient the recording requirement may have been to defendant and Sandstone,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 575-576, and despite \u201cwhether defendant could later secure Sandstone\u2019s permission to release the side letters,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 576. In so holding, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>majority consciously shifts the focus away from whether defendant\u2019s actions were <em>reasonable in this case. </em>To say, as the majority does, that the negotiations between defendant and Sandstone are irrelevant is to say that defendant was required to record the descriptions of the side letters within a certain unspecified time regardless of what time was reasonable under the circumstances. This is contrary to the text of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The majority holds that the negotiations between defendant and Sandstone were irrelevant to the statutory obligation to record descriptions of the side letters within a reasonable time because the statutory exemption\u2019s recording requirement is intended to provide notice to the public. In support of this holding, the majority states that plaintiffs would never have discovered the existence of the side letters if they had not accidentally happened on a reference to the side letters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s reasoning appears to be based on the faulty assumption that defendant never recorded the descriptions of the side letters. Defendant <em>did </em>give plaintiffs notice of the side letters when it recorded the descriptions on November 26, 2002. Thus, plaintiffs would have received notice within a reasonable time that defendant possessed the side letters even if plaintiffs had not discovered the letters before defendant recorded the descriptions. Further, the statute does not create a race between the requesting party and the public body. That plaintiffs discovered the existence of the side letters before defendant recorded the descriptions does not necessarily mean that defendant did not record the descriptions within a reasonable time. I do not question that the public body must record the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>descriptions and give notice to the public in order to comply with MCL 15.243(l)(f)(iii). But the issue is not whether defendant gave notice that it possessed the side letters before plaintiffs discovered the side letters, but whether defendant gave notice <em>within a reasonable time </em>that it possessed the side letters. This case does not involve the situation cited by the majority in which the \u201crequesting party [is required to] seek disclosure of a document of which it was unaware.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The majority believes that the four-month delay was unreasonable simply because it was too long. The majority effectively holds that whether the public body met the requirements of MCL 15.243(l)(f)(iii) depends only on the length of time the public body takes to record a description of the information, rather than whether that amount of time was reasonable under the circumstances. If the Legislature had not intended for the time to vary with the circumstances, it would have imposed a definite time limitation on the public body recording the description, rather than stating that the description must be recorded within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Additionally, after having recited the appropriate standard of review, the majority nonetheless engages in a review de novo. Given the unusual situation presented by these facts, in which defendant waited to record the descriptions until negotiations regarding disclosure had concluded, the trial court accorded leeway in the recording process to defendant. There is good reason behind the abuse of discretion standard we articulated in <em>Herald Co, supra </em>at 471-472. The trial court is given the discretion to determine what amount of time is reasonable precisely so that it may take into account the public body\u2019s recording of the description in each case and examine why the recording took the amount of time it did under the circumstances. Allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ing the trial court the discretion to determine what amount of time is reasonable under the circumstances does not defeat the purpose of the recording requirements of the statute. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals held that defendant recorded the description of the side letters within a reasonable time. This reasoned outcome accounts for defendant\u2019s decision to record the descriptions after the conclusion of successful negotiations between defendant and Sandstone. The trial court\u2019s determination fell within the principled range of outcomes. <em>Id. </em>at 472. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that defendant recorded descriptions of the information within a reasonable time after they were submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">B. \u201cSUBMITTED UPON A PROMISE OF CONFIDENTIALITY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">In one of the side letters (Letter 1), Sandstone stated that \u201c[t]he terms of this letter are confidential under all respects, not subject to disclosure and would not be covered by any FOIA request.\u201d The other side letter (Letter 2) was submitted with and related to Letter 1. Thus, Sandstone expressly stated that the letters were confidential. But to satisfy the exemption, the information must be submitted upon a promise of confidentiality <em>by the public body. </em>Defendant satisfied this requirement by offering the unrebutted affidavit of Ronald Hughes, the Sandstone partner who had signed the side letters. Hughes stated that defendant promised to keep the letters confidential before Sandstone sent them to defendant. He averred that the letters \u201cwere expressly submitted and conditioned on their confidentiality contemporaneous with their execution ....\u201d Plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence in rebuttal. In light of Hughes\u2019s uncontested affidavit, the trial court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>err in finding no genuine issue of material fact that the letters were submitted upon defendant\u2019s promise of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">C. \u201cAUTHORIZED BY THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER OF THE PUBLIC BODY OR BY AN ELECTED OFFICIAL\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Hughes also stated in his affidavit that \u201cSandstone understood that the promise of confidentiality was both known and authorized by the Mayor and City Manager, at the time of the letters^] execution, and Sandstone would not have submitted the letters absent such a promise of confidentiality from the City of Novi.\u201d As noted, plaintiffs failed to rebut this affidavit. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding no genuine issue of material fact that the chief administrative officer or an elected official had promised confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">D. \u201cFOR USE IN DEVELOPING GOVERNMENTAL POLICY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Finally, I agree with the lower courts that the two side letters at issue contain financial or commercial information that was \u201cfor use in developing governmental policy.\u201d MCL 15.143(l)(f). The FOIA does not define \u201cgovernmental policy.\u201d This Court has never interpreted this phrase in the context of the FOIA. Further, courts in other jurisdictions interpreting their own FOIAs have never defined this phrase.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is thus difficult to form a precise definition of \u201cgovernmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>policy.\u201d Governments claim authority and responsibility over large groups of individuals, and the methods they employ to decide how to carry out their numerous functions vary widely. Nonetheless, this Court has defined \u201cpolicy\u201d in the employment contract context as \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group, or individual) from among alternatives and in the light of given conditions to guide and usu[ally] determine present and future decisions;... a projected program consisting of desired objectives and the means to achieve them ....\u2019\u201d <em>In re Certified Question (Bankey v Storer Broadcasting Co), </em>432 Mich 438, 455-456; 443 NW2d 112 (1989), quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged Edition </em>(1964); see also Silberman, Chevron <em>\u2014The intersection of law &amp; policy, </em>58 Geo Wash L R 821, 822 (1990) (offering a similar definition).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This definition applies equally to the term \u201cpolicy\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>FOIA exemption at issue, and I would adopt it here. I emphasize that this definition does not encompass every decision regarding a course of action made by a governmental entity. Obviously, governmental bodies adopt many courses of action that do not guide present or future decisions. Such decisions may be categorized as \u201coperational\u201d decisions rather than \u201cpolicy\u201d decisions. Operational decisions concern routine, everyday matters and do not require evaluation of broad policy factors. See <em>Rogers v State, </em>51 Hawaii 293, 296-298; 459 P2d 378 (1969) (interpreting a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d exception to governmental immunity). Operational decisions may also be characterized as \u201cthe execution or implementation of previously formulated policy.\u201d <em>Hanson v Vigo Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>659 NE2d 1123, 1126 (Ind App, 1996) (also interpreting a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d exception to governmental immunity).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Although the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the side letters were provided to defendant for use in developing governmental policy, the panel\u2019s reasoning in reaching this conclusion was faulty. The panel stated that \u201c[t]he information in the side letters clearly concerned public policy\u201d because \u201c[i]t related to how defendant intended to settle the Sandstone litigation, a situation with the potential to bankrupt defendant and seriously affect its residents.\u201d <em>Coblentz v Novi, </em>264 Mich App 450, 458; 691 NW2d 22 (2004). The agreement was of overarching importance to defendant and the development of defendant\u2019s policy because it settled the Sandstone judgment against defendant, which could have bankrupted defendant and affected its residents by causing budget cuts and tax increases or assessments against each resident. Nonetheless, because the side letters were sent <em>after </em>defendant entered into the agreement with Sandstone, they did not affect whether defendant entered into the agreement, and accordingly did not affect whether defendant went bankrupt. The letters did not alter or void the agreement if defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>was unable to clear the deed restrictions or convince plaintiffs to sell their properties. Because the agreement had already settled the Sandstone judgment when the side letters were sent, the danger of this judgment causing defendant to go bankrupt had abated. Thus, the side letters were not provided to defendant for use in developing its policy to discharge the Sandstone judgment and avoid bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Nonetheless, defendant did use the side letters in developing governmental policy. The agreement expressly provided that defendant would forfeit additional public land (either 4.8 or 9.6 acres at Sandstone\u2019s option) if it failed to purchase plaintiffs\u2019 properties or otherwise clear the deed restrictions on the properties. Thus, the agreement demonstrates that before the side letters were sent, defendant had already made the policy decision that it would agree either to find a way to remove the deed restrictions on plaintiffs\u2019 property or to relinquish additional parkland. But at the time defendant entered the agreement, it had not yet decided which of these two alternatives it would choose. The agreement itself contained no policy to assist in this decision. Because the decision whether to remove the deed restrictions or forfeit additional parkland was not a routine decision that merely required application of policy developed in the agreement, defendant had a remaining policy decision to make after it entered into the agreement. That defendant had already agreed on the two alternatives before the side letters were sent did not alter defendant\u2019s need to develop policy in order to choose between these two alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The side letters confirm the deed restrictions on the properties and the amount Sandstone would pay defendant for plaintiffs\u2019 properties once they were free from restrictions. By offering in the letters to advance all or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>part of the money to defendant to purchase plaintiffs\u2019 properties, Sandstone sought to influence defendant\u2019s decision whether to purchase plaintiffs\u2019 properties, pay plaintiffs to waive the right to enforce their deed restrictions, or forfeit additional public land to Sandstone. Because disclosure of the letters would reveal to plaintiffs the amount Sandstone was willing to pay for their properties, it would also affect defendant\u2019s ability to purchase plaintiffs\u2019 properties. Defendant\u2019s decision regarding whether to attempt to purchase plaintiffs\u2019 properties or try to lift the deed restrictions on the properties not only directly affected plaintiffs individually, but it also affected the residents of the city because it determined whether defendant would be forced to forfeit several acres of property set aside for public use. If defendant decided to purchase plaintiffs\u2019 properties, it would result in large expenditures of public funds, which would affect defendant\u2019s budget and its residents. On the other hand, if defendant was unable to lift the deed restrictions or decided not to purchase plaintiffs\u2019 properties, defendant would forfeit additional public property to Sandstone. The loss of this additional land would affect all of defendant\u2019s residents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Regardless of defendant\u2019s ultimate decision, the information in the side letters was provided for use in guiding defendant\u2019s management of public affairs. The letters affected a budgetary decision concerning allocation and substantial expenditure of public funds to retain public land. Thus, the letters were provided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>defendant to develop a course of action that would materially affect the future of its citizens. The letters did not involve a mere operational decision regarding a routine matter for which a policy was already in place. Defendant\u2019s decision on how to deliver its governmental functions within its budget obviously constituted a policy decision. Thus, the Court of Appeals did not err in holding that the side letters contained financial or commercial information provided to defendant for use in developing governmental policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs were entitled to disclosure of the side letters. In my opinion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that defendant recorded descriptions of the side letters within a reasonable time after they were submitted. Because defendants met all of the other requirements of the \u201ctrade secrets or commercial or financial information\u201d exemption of the FOIA, the side letters were exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\"> Defendant and Sandstone entered their agreement settling Sandstone\u2019s multimillion dollar judgment against defendant on June 25,2002. Sandstone dated and sent the first draft of the first side letter to defendant\u2019s attorney on the same day. Sandstone sent a revised version of this letter, along with the other side letter at issue, to defendant on July 23, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-5\"> Plaintiffs learned of the side letters upon examining a nonfinal draft of the agreement that was voluntarily disclosed by defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b665-9\"> Other jurisdictions have interpreted their own versions of the \u201ctrade secrets or commercial or financial information\u201d exemption. None of these jurisdictions has statutes that include the \u201cgovernmental policy\u201d language found in Michigan\u2019s exemption. For example, numerous federal courts have interpreted the federal FOIA provision that exempts from disclosure \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential!.]\u201d 5 USC 552(b)(4). But the federal exemption does not require that the information he provided \u201cfor use in developing governmental policy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b666-4\"> I distinguish the phrase \u201cgovernmental policy\u201d from the phrase \u201cpublic policy\u201d because these phrases are generally used to convey different meanings. In <em>Terrien v Zwit, </em>467 Mich 56, 68 n 13; 648 NW2d 602 (2002), this Court declined to define \u201cpublic policy,\u201d but held that \u201cpublic policy is defined by reference to the laws actually enacted into policy by the public and its representatives.\u201d As the Court observed in <em>Skutt v Grand Rapids, </em>275 Mich 258, 264; 266 NW 344 (1936), quoting <em>Pittsburgh, C, C &amp; St L R Cov Kinney, </em>95 Ohio St 64; 115 NE 505 (1918):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201cWhat is the meaning of \u2018public policy?\u2019 A correct definition, at once concise and comprehensive, of the words \u2018public policy\u2019, has not yet been formulated by our courts....

Deciding what specific pieces of equipment to have on the playground would not be a policy decision, but rather would he an operational level decision. <em>See, e.g., Warrington v. Tempe Elementary Sch. Dist., </em>[187 Ariz 249, 252; 928 P2d 673 (Ariz App, 1996)] (school district\u2019s decision regarding placement of bus stop is an operational level decision); <em>Evenstad </em>[v <em>State], </em>178 Ariz.

Nonetheless, I find persuasive the analyses of \u201cpolicy\u201d versus \u201coperational\u201d in these cases in interpreting what constitutes \u201cpolicy\u201d within the meaning of Michigan\u2019s \u201ctrade secrets or commercial or financial information\u201d exemption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b670-6\"> Thus, this case is distinguishable from <em>Herald Co, Inc v Tax Tribunal, </em>258 Mich App 78, 85; 669 NW2d 862 (2003), in which the Court of Appeals held that the \u201ctrade secrets or commercial or financial information\u201d exemption did not apply because the <em>single </em>individual tax determination \u201clack[ed] the policy-making potential contemplated by the Legislature in drafting this exemption to the FOIA.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
