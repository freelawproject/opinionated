The Court of Appeals held that the circuit court abused its discretion in dismissing the case because Wayne County is not a \u201cseriously inconvenient\u201d forum. Because we conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the case, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the circuit court\u2019s order dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Plaintiffs, who are residents and citizens of Croatia, were involved in a motor vehicle accident in Croatia. It is alleged that the Jeep Grand Cherokee in which they were seated somehow shifted from park into reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>and went off the roadway and into a ravine. One of the passengers died and the driver and other passengers were injured. The vehicle was designed and manufactured in Michigan. The vehicle was purchased in Italy and maintained and serviced in Italy and Croatia. Plaintiffs argue that the transmission, designed and manufactured in Japan, spontaneously slipped. Plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in the Wayne Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\">Defendant moved for summary disposition on the basis of forum non conveniens. The circuit court granted the motion. Plaintiffs appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal and asked the parties to address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\">(1) whether the public interest factors of the forum non conveniens doctrine set forth in <em>Cray v Gen Motors Corp, </em>389 Mich 382, 396 [207 NW2d 393] (1973), should be revised or modified; and (2) whether, even if another more appropriate forum exists, a Michigan court may not resist jurisdiction unless its own forum is \u201cseriously inconvenient.\u201d See <em>Robey v Ford Motor Co, </em>155 Mich App 643, 645 (1986).[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">This Court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to dismiss a case on the basis of the doctrine of forum non conveniens for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cray, supra </em>at 397. An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision results in an outcome falling outside the principled range of outcomes. <em>Herald Co v Eastern Michigan Univ Bd of Regents, </em>475 Mich 463; 719 NW2d 19 (2006); <em>Novi v Robert Adell Children\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Funded Trust, 473 Mich 242, 254; 701 NW2d 144 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\"Forum non conveniens\u201d is defined as the \u201cdiscretionary power of court to decline jurisdiction when convenience of parties and ends of justice would be better served if action were brought and tried in another forum.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed). The doctrine is not derived from statutes; rather, it is a common-law doctrine created by courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court adopted the forum non conveniens doctrine in 1947. <em>Gulf Oil Corp v Gilbert, </em>330 US 501, 508-509; 67 S Ct 839; 91 L Ed 1055 (1947).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This Court first recognized this doctrine in 1973 in <em>Cray. </em>In <em>Cray, supra </em>at 395, we held that a court may refuse to hear a case on the basis of the doctrine of forum non conveniens even though it otherwise may have jurisdiction. \u201cThe principle of <em>forum non conveniens </em>establishes the right of a court to resist imposition upon its jurisdiction although such jurisdiction could properly be invoked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The application of forum non conveniens \u201clie[s] within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A plaintiffs selection of a forum is ordinarily accorded deference. <em>Anderson v Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>411 Mich 619, 628-629; 309 NW2d 539 (1981). Although <em>\u201ca </em>court can and must consider the residence of the parties in deciding whether to decline jurisdiction[,] . . . a party\u2019s Michigan residence does not automatically render the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>inapplicable.\u201d <em>Russell v Chrysler Corp, </em>443 Mich 617, 624; 505 NW2d 263 (1993).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018[T]he ultimate inquiry is where trial will best serve the convenience of the parties [and the ends] of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cray, supra </em>at 391, quoting <em>Koster v (American) Lumbermens Mut Cas Co, </em>330 US 518, 527; 67 S Ct 828; 91 L Ed 1067 (1947). In <em>Cray </em>we held that the following factors should be considered in deciding a motion to dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-4\">1. The private interest of the litigant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">a. Availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing witnesses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">b. Ease of access to sources of proof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">c. Distance from the situs of the accident or incident which gave rise to the litigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">d. Enforcibility [sic] of any judgment obtained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">e. Possible harassment of either party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-10\">f. Other practical problems which contribute to the ease, expense and expedition of the trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-11\">g. Possibility of viewing the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-12\">2. Matters of public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-13\">a. Administrative difficulties which may arise in an area which may not be present in the area of origin;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>b. Consideration of the state law which must govern the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-4\">c. People who are concerned by the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">3. Reasonable promptness in raising the plea of <em>forum non conveniens. [Cray, supra </em>at 396.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">In the instant case, the trial court dismissed on the basis of forum non conveniens. The trial court determined that Croatia was a more convenient forum because this case involves a vehicular accident in Croatia in which Croatian citizens and residents were injured, where Croatian law will likely have to be applied, and the alleged cause of the accident was a transmission manufactured and designed in Japan. This conclusion does not fall outside \u201cthe principled range of outcomes,\u201d <em>Novi, supra </em>at 254, and was therefore not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">A review of the <em>Cray </em>factors reveals why the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss was within \u201cthe principled range of outcomes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We begin by noting that the requirement of reasonable promptness in bringing a plea of forum non conveniens has indisputably been satisfied in this case, because defendant moved for dismissal based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens in a timely manner. With that procedural predicate addressed, we now turn to the private and public interest factors that are in considerable dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The first factor concerns the \u201cprivate interest of the litigant.\u201d <em>Cray, supra </em>at 396. Subfactor 1(a) pertains to the \u201c[a]vailability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is undisputed that Michigan courts lack powers of compulsory process over witnesses in Croatia.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If trial were held in Michigan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>defendant would be forced to use \u201cletters rogatory\u201d in order to obtain testimony from any foreign witnesses who could not voluntarily travel to Michigan for trial.* **<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The use of letters rogatory is acknowledged to be a very time consuming and cumbersome process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, this subfactor cuts the other way as well because it is also undisputed that Croatian courts lack powers of compulsory process over witnesses in Michigan. Further, even if all the witnesses are willing to travel in order to testify, the cost of obtaining the attendance of these witnesses will be high regardless of whether this case is tried in Croatia or in Michigan; obviously, if this case is tried in Croatia, all the Michigan witnesses will have to travel to Croatia to testify and if this case is tried in Michigan, all the Croatian witnesses will have to travel to Michigan to testify. Therefore, subfactor 1(a) does not clearly favor one forum over the other where the difficulties implicit in the travel arrangements would be identical. Subfactor 1(b) concerns the \u201c[e]ase of access to sources of proof.\u201d <em>Cray, supra </em>at 396. The trial court concluded that, because the accident occurred in Croatia, a Croatian court will have easier access to sources of proof and it will be easier for defendant to obtain documents relating to the accident in Croatia. Although all the documentary evidence pertaining to the choice of transmission for the vehicle is in Michigan, it would be easier for plaintiffs to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>these Michigan documents if the trial were held in Croatia than it would be for defendant to obtain the Croatian documents if trial were held in Michigan because MCR 2.305 authorizes subpoenas for document production in connection with an action pending in another country and we are aware of no similar Croatian provision, nor have plaintiffs cited any. Therefore, subfactor 1(b) favors the Croatian forum over the Michigan forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Subfactor 1(c) concerns the \u201c[distance from the situs of the accident or incident which gave rise to the litigation.\u201d <em>Cray, supra </em>at 396. Michigan is a great distance from the situs of the accident, i.e., Croatia. However, plaintiffs argue that this is not controlling because the specific incident that gave rise to this litigation was defendant\u2019s choice of transmission, which occurred in Michigan. This subfactor does not favor one forum over the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Subfactor 1(d) concerns the \u201c[ejnforcibility [sic] of any judgment obtained.\u201d <em>Cray, supra </em>at 396. It is uncontested that a judgment in this case would be enforceable whether rendered by a Michigan court or a Croatian court. Therefore, subfactor 1(d) does not favor one forum over the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Subfactor 1(e) concerns the \u201c[p]ossible harassment of either party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neither party has argued harassment. Therefore, subfactor 1(e) does not favor one forum over the other.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Subfactor 1(f) concerns \u201c[o]ther practical problems which contribute to the ease, expense and expedition of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If this case is tried in Michigan, defendant will not be able to implead Croatian persons or entities that may be responsible for plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. As the United States Supreme Court has held, \u201cthe problems posed by the inability to implead potential third-party defendants\u201d is \u201csufficient to support dismissal on grounds of <em>forum non </em>conveniens.\u201d <em>Piper Aircraft Co v Reyno, </em>454 US 235, 259; 102 S Ct 252; 70 L Ed 2d 419 (1981). Therefore, subfactor 1(f) favors the Croatian forum over the Michigan forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Subfactor 1(g) concerns the \u201c[possibility of viewing the premises.\u201d <em>Cray, supra </em>at 396. If this case is tried in Michigan, it will not be possible for the trier of fact to view the scene of the accident because the accident occurred in Croatia. Therefore, subfactor 1(g) favors the Croatian forum over the Michigan forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In sum, three of the \u201cprivate interest\u201d subfactors favor the Croatian forum over the Michigan forum, and four of these subfactors do not favor one forum over the other. None of the \u201cprivate interest\u201d subfactors favors the Michigan forum over the Croatian forum. Therefore, \u201c[t]he private interest^] of the litigant,\u201d <em>Cray, supra </em>at 396, favor the Croatian forum over the Michigan forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>The second broad <em>Cray </em>factor pertains to \u201c[m]atters of public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Subfactor 2(a) concerns \u201c[a]dministrative difficulties which may arise in an area which may not be present in the area of origin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[ajdministrative difficulties follow for courts when litigation is piled up in congested centers instead of being handled at its origin.\u201d <em>Gilbert, supra </em>at 508. If every automotive design defect case against Michigan-based automobile manufacturers must be heard in Wayne County if a foreign plaintiff so desires, there will certainly be increased congestion in an already congested local court system. It can hardly be argued that Croatia would face increased court congestion. Unlike Michigan, Croatia is not a recognized center for automotive design, engineering, and manufacturing, or to our knowledge, a center for litigation concerning automotive design defects. Therefore, subfactor 2(a) generally favors the Croatian forum over the Michigan forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Subfactor 2(b) concerns \u201c [consideration of the state law which must govern the case.\u201d <em>Cray, supra </em>at 396. If this case is tried in Wayne County, the Wayne Circuit Court will most likely have to apply Croatian law. In order to determine whose laws apply, courts look to see which jurisdiction has a greater interest in the case. <em>Sutherland v Kennington Truck Service, Ltd, </em>454 Mich 274, 286; 562 NW2d 466 (1997). Croatia appears to have a greater interest in this case than does Michigan because it involves residents and citizens of Croatia who were injured in an accident in Croatia. Therefore, Croatian law would most likely apply in this case. See <em>Farrell v Ford Motor Co, </em>199 Mich App 81; 501 NW2d 567 (1993) (holding that North Carolina law applies in a defective automobile action involving a North Carolina resident, a North Carolina accident, and a vehicle purchased in North Carolina). As the United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[tjhere is an appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>ateness ... in having the trial... in a forum that is at home with the state law that must govern the case, rather than having a court in some other forum untangle problems in conflict of laws, and in law foreign to itself.\u201d <em>Gilbert, supra </em>at 509. Accordingly, \u201cthe need to apply foreign law favors dismissal.\u201d <em>Piper, supra </em>at 260 n 29. Therefore, subfactor 2(b) favors the Croatian forum over the Michigan forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Subfactor 2(c) concerns \u201c[p]eople who are concerned by the proceeding.\u201d <em>Cray, supra </em>at 396. The people of Croatia obviously are concerned by this proceeding given that several Croatian citizens and residents were injured and one was killed in an accident that occurred in that country. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[t]here is a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.\u201d <em>Gilbert, supra </em>at 509. The \u201clocalized controversy\u201d involved in this case concerns whether defendant is liable for injuries suffered by Croatian citizens and residents in Croatia. Croatia obviously has a considerable \u201clocal interest\u201d in determining the redress available to its citizens and residents who are injured in Croatia. That is, Croatia has a \u201clocal interest\u201d in having this \u201clocalized controversy\u201d decided by its own rules and procedures. On the other hand, there is no denying that Michigan citizens have an interest in products-liability lawsuits filed against Michigan manufacturers. On the whole, however, for the reasons we discussed concerning subfactor 2(b), we conclude that Croatia\u2019s interest is greater than Michigan\u2019s interest. Therefore, subfactor 2(c) favors a Croatian forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In sum, the three <em>Cray </em>\u201cpublic interest\u201d subfactors favor the Croatian forum over the Michigan forum. None of them favors a Michigan forum. Thus, the \u201c[m]atters of public interest,\u201d <em>Cray, supra </em>at 396, favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>the Croation forum over the Michigan forum. Therefore, an analysis of both the \u201cprivate interest\u201d and \u201cpublic interest\u201d factors of <em>Cray </em>demonstrates that the trial court\u2019s decision that Croatia is the most appropriate forum for this case was within the principled range of outcomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">In <em>Cray, </em>this Court held that the factors listed in its 1973 opinion were not the only factors that could ever be considered. <em>Id. </em>at 395. As we explained, \u201c \u2018[w]isely it has not been attempted to catalogue the circumstances which will justify or require either grant or denial of remedy\u2019 rather, \u201c \u2018[t]he doctrine leaves much to the discretion of the court to which the plaintiff resorts ....\u2019\u201d <em>Cray, supra </em>at 395, quoting <em>Gilbert, supra </em>at 508. In response to our invitation to brief whether the <em>Cray </em>public interest factors should be revised or modified, defendant argues that we should explicitly follow the United States Supreme Court\u2019s lead from <em>Piper, supra </em>at 257, in stating that a foreign plaintiffs choice of forum in entitled to \u201cless deference\u201d than would apply to a domestic plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In <em>Piper </em>the United States Supreme Court expressed its concern regarding allowing foreign plaintiffs to sue American businesses and manufacturers in America on the basis that American law is more favorable to plaintiffs as a class than is foreign law. <em>Piper, supra </em>at 252. The Court explained, \u201cAmerican courts, which are already extremely attractive to foreign plaintiffs, would become even more attractive [if dismissal was barred whenever the law in the alternative forum were less favorable to the plaintiff].[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] The flow of litigation into the United States would increase and further congest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>already crowded courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the United States Supreme Court has held, \u201cdismissal may be warranted where a plaintiff chooses a particular forum, not because it is convenient, but solely in order to . .. take advantage of favorable law.\u201d <em>Piper, supra </em>at 249 n 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In <em>Piper, supra </em>at 256, the United States Supreme Court held that in contrast to the presumption in favor of a domestic plaintiffs forum choice, \u201ca foreign plaintiffs choice [of forum] deserves less deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256. This makes sense because, as the United States Supreme Court explained, when a plaintiff chooses to bring a lawsuit in another country thousands of miles away from home and where the underlying accident occurred, there is no basis to presume that this faraway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>forum will be more convenient to the parties and to the court, and, thus, there is no basis to defer to the plaintiffs choice in forum. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we modify our statement in <em>Anderson, supra, </em>that a plaintiffs selection of a forum is ordinarily accorded deference to indicate that a foreign plaintiffs choice of forum is entitled to less deference than that accorded to a domestic plaintiffs choice of forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">In the instant case, plaintiffs are residents and citizens of Croatia who were injured in an accident in Croatia and plaintiffs have chosen to file their lawsuit in Michigan. Given that plaintiffs live in Croatia and that the underlying accident occurred in Croatia, there is no basis to presume that plaintiffs chose to file this lawsuit in Michigan out of convenience. Further, while there is no direct evidence that the primary reason why plaintiffs chose to file this lawsuit in Michigan was to take advantage of Michigan\u2019s favorable laws and to avoid Croatia\u2019s less favorable laws, no other reasonable explanation has been presented. It is important to consider the foreign jurisdiction\u2019s interest in the case and the effect that a Michigan court\u2019s resolution of the case will have in that jurisdiction. In this case, a Michigan court is being asked to apply Croatian law to Croatian plaintiffs in a lawsuit pertaining to an accident that occurred in Croatia. Certainly, a Croatian court would be better equipped at handling a matter of this sort than a Michigan court. We find it appropriate, in light of the continuing globalization of our economy, to follow <em>Piper </em>and indicate that a foreign plaintiffs choice of venue is entitled to less deference than a domestic plaintiffs choice of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Although a majority of the <em>Cray </em>private and public interest factors supports the trial court\u2019s decision that Croatia is the more appropriate forum to hear this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>the Court of Appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion in so concluding. More specifically, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing this action on the basis of the forum non conveniens doctrine because Michigan is not a \u201cseriously inconvenient\u201d forum, relying upon <em>Robey v Ford Motor Co, </em>155 Mich App 643, 645; 400 NW2d 610 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">In <em>Robey, supra </em>at 645, the Court of Appeals held that \u201cthe court... may not decline jurisdiction unless its own forum is seriously inconvenient.\u201d The Court of Appeals in the instant case relied heavily on <em>Robey\u2019s </em>\u201cseriously inconvenient\u201d requirement, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">[T]he trial court did not make a finding that Wayne County was a seriously inconvenient forum. Even if another more appropriate forum exists, the court still may not resist jurisdiction unless its own forum is seriously inconvenient.... Without a determination that Wayne County is a seriously inconvenient forum, the trial court could not resist jurisdiction. It therefore abused its discretion in granting the dismissal. [Slip op at 2-3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The \u201cseriously inconvenient\u201d language appears traceable to the Restatement Conflict of Laws, 2d, which was cited in footnote 2 of the <em>Cray </em>decision. 389 Mich 394 n 2. While this language from the Restatement was cited in a footnote of <em>Cray, </em>this \u201cseriously inconvenient\u201d language was not part of the test adopted in <em>Cray </em>and in subsequent forum non conveniens decisions from this Court we did not cite or utilize a \u201cseriously inconvenient\u201d test. See, e.g., <em>Anderson v Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co, supra, </em>and <em>Russell v Chrysler Corp, supra. </em>Indeed, imposing a \u201cseriously inconvenient\u201d requirement is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s holding, in <em>Cray, supra </em>at 396, that it is \u201cwithin the discretion of the trial judge to decline jurisdiction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>such cases as the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice dictate.\u201d Therefore, we reject the \u201cseriously inconvenient\u201d standard and overrule <em>Robey, supra, </em>to the extent that it held that a court cannot decline jurisdiction unless the exercise of such jurisdiction would be \u201cseriously inconvenient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Because there is no requirement that a trial court can only dismiss a case on the basis of the forum non conveniens doctrine if the forum is \u201cseriously inconvenient,\u201d the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing this case on the basis of the forum non conveniens doctrine without concluding that the forum is \u201cseriously inconvenient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Finally, we note the similarities this case has with <em>Piper, supra. </em>In <em>Piper, </em>the plaintiffs were residents of Scotland who were involved in an airplane crash in Scotland. The plaintiffs sued a company that manufactured the airplane in Pennsylvania and a company that manufactured the airplane\u2019s propellers in Ohio. The suit was brought in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, but was transferred to the United States District Court for the Central District of Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The federal district court dismissed the suit on the basis of the forum non conveniens doctrine and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. The United States Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Scotland was the appropriate forum. Just as the district court in <em>Piper, supra, </em>did not abuse its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>tion in dismissing the action involving Scottish residents and a Scottish accident on the basis of the forum non conveniens doctrine, the trial court in this case did not abuse its discretion in dismissing this action involving Croatian residents and a Croatian accident on the basis of the forum non conveniens doctrine. \u201cThe burden on our courts and upon the defendant\u2019s ability to prepare a defense greatly outweighs the remote interest the plaintiff has shown in behalf of conducting this trial in Michigan.\u201d <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">IV RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The dissent pays lip service to the abuse of discretion standard, but does not apply it. There are ten subfactors to be considered in evaluating a motion to dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens. According to the dissent, five of the seven private factors are a draw, i.e., do not favor one forum over the other, and one favors Croatia as a forum and one favors Michigan. (But, as noted in footnote 9, the one that Justice KELLY says favors Michigan is a conclusion that even plaintiffs do not claim.) With reference to the public interest factors, the dissent finds that two are a draw and one favors Michigan. Given that a foreign plaintiffs choice of forum deserves less deference, even using Justice Kelly\u2019s analysis of the <em>Cray </em>factors, one would be hard-pressed to conclude that a trial court\u2019s conclusion, whichever way it would have gone, was not within the principled range of outcomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Justice KELLY asserts that the trial court abused its discretion, citing language from <em>Gulf Oil Corp, supra, </em>to the effect that unless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant the plaintiffs choice of forum should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>rarely be disturbed. 330 US 508.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But, \u201c \u2018the ultimate inquiry is where trial will best serve the convenience of the parties and the end of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cray, supra </em>at 391 (citation omitted).

Liability Rep. \u00a7 4016 (1981). Rules roughly equivalent to American strict liability are effective in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg. West Germany and Japan have a strict liability statute for pharmaceuticals. However, strict liability remains primarily an American innovation. Second, the tort plaintiff may choose, at least potentially, from among 50 jurisdictions if he decides to file suit in the United States. Each of these jurisdictions applies its own set of malleable choice-of-law rules. Third, jury trials are almost always available in the United States, while they are never provided in civil law jurisdictions. G. Gloss, Comparative Law 12 (1979); J. Merryman, The Civil Law Tradition 121 (1969). Even in the United Kingdom, most civil actions are not tried before a jury. 1 G. Keeton, The United Kingdom: The Development of its Laws and Constitutions 309 (1955). Fourth, unlike most foreign jurisdictions, American courts allow contingent attorney\u2019s fees, and do not tax losing parties with their opponents\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees. R. Schlesinger, Comparative Law: Cases, Text, Materials 275-277 (3d ed. 1970); Orban, Product Liability: A Comparative Legal Restatement \u2014 Foreign National Law and the EEC Directive, 8 Ga. J.

First, the Seventh and Fourteenth Amendments give plaintiffs the right to trial by jury in most civil suits. Jury trials present several advantages to individual plaintiffs in civil suits against large businesses. American jurors have very different backgrounds and economic sympathies compared to those of the professional judges and career bureaucrats who decide disputes in most foreign courts. Consequently, these juries are more likely to award judgment to individual plaintiffs suing large [multinational corporations]. U.S. juries also award more generous damages than do foreign tribunals, particularly in instances of plaintiffs alleging injury by a corporate entity.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]For example, in the infamous litigation stemming from an industrial accident in Bhopal, India, the estimated value of the suit in India was no more than $75 million. In contrast, experts estimated that an American jury would award compensatory damages of $235 million, with an even greater amount for punitive damages. [Comment, <em>The forum non conveniens doctrine and the judicial protection </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>of multinational corporations from forum shopping plaintiffs, </em>19 U Pa J Int\u2019l Econ L 141, 146-147 (1998).][<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The United States Supreme Court has expressed its concern regarding foreign plaintiffs being allowed to sue American businesses and manufacturers in America on the basis that American law is more favorable to plaintiffs as a class than is foreign law. <em>Piper, supra </em>at 252. The Court has explained, \u201cAmerican courts, which are already extremely attractive to foreign plaintiffs, would become even more attractive [if dismissal was barred whenever the law in the alternative forum were less favorable to the plaintiff].[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>flow of litigation into the United States would increase and further congest already crowded courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>I believe that if a plaintiffs primary reason for filing a suit in Michigan is to take advantage of Michigan\u2019s favorable laws and procedures and to avoid a foreign court\u2019s less favorable laws and procedures, this should be a relevant factor to be considered by courts in deciding whether to expend the state\u2019s limited resources on a lawsuit. As the United States Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Court has held, \u201cdismissal may be warranted where a plaintiff chooses a particular forum, not because it is convenient, but solely in order to ... take advantage of favorable law.\u201d <em>Piper, supra </em>at 249 n 15. As the majority opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-3\">In the instant case, plaintiffs are residents and citizens of Croatia who were injured in an accident in Croatia and plaintiffs have chosen to file their lawsuit in Michigan. Given that plaintiffs live in Croatia and that the underlying accident occurred in Croatia, there is no basis to presume that plaintiffs chose to file this lawsuit in Michigan out of convenience. Further, while there is no direct evidence that the primary reason why plaintiffs chose to file this lawsuit in Michigan was to take advantage of Michigan\u2019s favorable laws and to avoid Croatia\u2019s less favorable laws, no other reasonable explanation has heen presented. <em>[Ante </em>at 614.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">A second additional \u201cpublic interest\u201d factor concerns the extent to which resolving a particular legal dispute in a Michigan court would compromise principles of judicial comity and undermine respect for the judicial sovereignty of a foreign jurisdiction. \u201c[Principles of judicial comity support the dismissal of controversies whose adjudication is a matter of vital interest to the alternative, foreign forum.\u201d Note, <em>Foreign plaintiffs and forum non conveniens: Going beyond </em>Reyno, 64 Tex L R 193, 195 (1985). \u201c[T]olerance of international forum shopping creates . . . conflicts with basic notions of comity and respect for foreign sovereignty.\u201d Comment, <em>The forum non conveniens doctrine and the judicial protection of multinational corporations from forum shopping plaintiffs, </em>19 U Pa J Int\u2019l Econ L 141, 142 (1998). As one commentator has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">In cases involving foreign litigants and alternative foreign forums, a shift in the focus of forum non conveniens analysis is needed, away from the convenience of the litigants and toward the appropriateness of the forum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>viewed from the perspective of judicial comity. The degree of local interest of each forum is a basis for comparison, and the determination of the applicable law, to the extent that it reflects each forum\u2019s interests, should be a vital consideration as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">Courts should recognize that the application of an American Forum\u2019s law to controversies in which other countries have a vital interest is likely to offend the sovereignty or frustrate the public policies of those countries. [Note, <em>Foreign plaintiffs and forum non conveniens: Going beyond </em>Reyno, 64 Tex L R 193, 222-223 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">It is important to consider the foreign jurisdiction\u2019s interest in the case and the effect that a Michigan court\u2019s resolution of the case would have upon that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">In this case, a Michigan court is being asked to apply Croatian law to Croatian plaintiffs in a lawsuit arising from an accident that occurred in Croatia. Certainly, a Croatian court would be better equipped at handling a matter of this sort than a Michigan court.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">A third additional \u201cpublic interest\u201d factor concerns the interests of the state of Michigan in establishing and enforcing standards that domestic businesses and manufacturers must satisfy in selling their products abroad as compared to the foreign jurisdiction\u2019s interest in establishing and enforcing standards that foreign businesses and manufacturers must satisfy in selling their products within its borders. As one commentator has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-11\">Imposing our legal solutions on other nations, however beneficial when viewed from the perspective of individual litigants, impedes the opportunity for other legal systems to craft local solutions to their citizens\u2019 legal problems. If a foreign forum proves adequate and has the greater interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>in the controversy, an American court can best serve the interest of justice by permitting justice to be done elsewhere. <em>[Id. </em>at 223.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">As another commentator has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">Allowing forum shoppers to sue in U.S. courts not only hinders foreign relations, but also hurts foreign nations by undermining their development of legal remedies to handle legal controversies in their own courts. Other countries can better assess their own localized needs and set appropriate standards for local conditions. For example, U.S. courts are \u201cill-equipped to set a standard of product safety for drugs sold in other countries.\u201d [Comment, <em>The forum non conveniens doctrine and the judicial protection of multinational corporations from forum shopping plaintiffs, </em>19 U Pa J Int\u2019l Econ L 141, 155-156 (1998), quoting <em>Harrison v Wyeth Laboratories Div of American Home Products Corp, </em>510 F Supp 1, 4 (ED Pa, 1980) (holding \u201c[t]he United States should not impose its own view of the safety, warning, and duty of care required of drugs sold in the United States upon a foreign country when those same drugs are sold in that country\u201d).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">And, as yet other commentators have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">Foreign plaintiffs will almost certainly continue to file products liability actions in American courts, instead of their local fora, in order to take advantage of the more favorable substantive law and procedural rules available in the United States. In response, American courts will likely continue to dismiss most such actions based on the flexible doctrine of forum non conveniens.... Private interest factors will often militate in favor of dismissal of suits brought by foreign plaintiffs because the bulk of the witnesses and physical evidence is likely to be located abroad. In addition, public interest factors will tend to warrant dismissal given that foreign fora plainly have a substantial interest in establishing and enforcing the standards that manufacturers must satisfy in selling products there, whereas American courts will often have only a marginal interest in such matters. Accordingly, in dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>ing these actions, American courts will promote the fundamental goals of best serving the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice. [Dunham &amp; Gladbach, <em>Forum non conveniens and foreign plaintiffs in the 1990s, </em>24 Brook J Int\u2019l L 665, 703-704 (1999).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">\u201cAn important factor that courts have looked to in deciding whether to dismiss an action is the relative importance of the foreign jurisdiction\u2019s public interest in controlling the marketing and sale of products within its borders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">In <em>Doe v Hyland Therapeutics Div, </em>807 F Supp 1117, 1130 (SD NY, 1992), the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York concluded that where Irish plaintiffs brought suit in New York against United States manufacturers, claiming that they contracted the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from contaminated blood clotting products supplied by the defendants, \u201cour \u2018generalized interest\u2019 in regulating the flow of dangerously defective American pharmaceutical products into the stream of world commerce cannot transcend Ireland\u2019s \u2018intensely local interest\u2019 in adjudicating a controversy that profoundly affects its citizens.\u201d As that court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">The forum whose market consumes the product must make its own determination as to the levels of safety and care required. That forum has a distinctive interest in explicating the controlling standards of behavior, and in enforcing its regulatory scheme. The standards of conduct implemented, and the level of damages assessed, will reflect the unique balance struck between the benefit each market derives from the product\u2019s use and the risks associated with that use; between the community\u2019s particular need for the product and its desire to protect its citizens from what it deems unreasonable risk. The forum\u2019s assessment will affect not merely the quality of the product, but also the price, quantity, and availability to its public. Such an assessment must remain the prerogative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the forum in which the product is used; each community faces distinct demands, and has unique concerns that make it peculiarly suited to make this judgment. We are ill-equipped to enunciate the optimal standards of safety or care for products sold in distant markets, and thus choose to refrain from imposing our determination of what constitutes appropriate behavior to circumstances with which we are not familiar. While imposing our presumably more stringent standards to deter tortious conduct within our borders could afford a higher degree of protection to the world community, such an approach would also ignore the unique significance of the foreign forum\u2019s interest in implementing its own risk-benefit analysis, informed by its knowledge of its community\u2019s competing needs, values, and concerns. <em>[Id. </em>at 1129-113O.][<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Courts should consider which jurisdiction has the greatest interest in establishing the legal standards that will be applied in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In this case, Croatia has a stronger interest in determining whether the Croatian plaintiffs are entitled to relief as a result of an accident that occurred in Croatia than does Michigan. Croatia has a considerable interest in protecting its citizens from unsafe products. Michigan concomitantly has an interest in protecting its businesses and manufacturers from unwarranted liability.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, given that the manufacturer in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>case does not want Michigan\u2019s protection,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Michigan\u2019s interest in providing such protection seems significantly lessened. If defendant in these circumstances is amenable to subjecting itself to a Croatian court, it is not immediately apparent why a Michigan court should interfere with this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Fourth, on a related note, courts should also consider the sovereign interests of the state of Michigan in shaping the law within a particular substantive realm as compared to the foreign jurisdiction\u2019s interests in this same regard. In this case, Michigan does have an interest in shaping the law with regard to automobile design defect cases given the importance of the automotive industry to the state of Michigan. However, Croatia has an interest in shaping the law with regard to automobile design defect cases as well, given the significant risks posed to its citizens from the use of defectively designed automobiles within its borders. Just as the United States should not, for example, impose its own standards regarding the safety of drugs onto foreign countries, the United States should not impose its standards regarding the safety of automobiles onto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>foreign countries. <em>Harrison, supra; Doe, supra. </em>Michigan\u2019s \u201c \u2018generalized interest\u2019 in regulating the flow of dangerously defective [Michigan automotive] products into the stream of world commerce cannot transcend [Croatia\u2019s] \u2018intensely local interest\u2019 in adjudicating a controversy that profoundly affects its citizens.\u201d <em>Doe, supra </em>at 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Fifth, courts should consider the interests of the state of Michigan in either encouraging or discouraging future lawsuits in which the forum non conveniens doctrine may potentially be invoked.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That is, courts should consider the extent to which accommodating the instant lawsuit in Michigan will have consequences for the numbers and types of future lawsuits heard by Michigan courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In this case, Croatian plaintiffs are asking a Michigan court to determine whether, under Croatian law, they are entitled to any relief as a result of an accident that occurred in Croatia. If the trial court in this case abused its discretion by refusing to exercise its jurisdiction, one must consider whether every case involving an automobile designed or assembled in Michigan must be tried in Michigan if so desired by the plaintiff. If a Michigan court cannot refuse to exercise jurisdiction in cases brought by foreign plaintiffs for injuries arising out of automobile accidents occurring outside the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>States, Michigan will likely become the world\u2019s automobile design defect courthouse. Because the Michigan judiciary is not equipped to handle all the world\u2019s automobile design defect lawsuits along with all its other responsibilities, the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss this action on the basis of the forum non conveniens doctrine should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Sixth, courts should consider the interests of the state of Michigan in expending limited judicial and other resources in trying a case. As commentators have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">Courts that have granted forum non conveniens dismissals of actions brought by foreign plaintiffs have often cited to the burden that would be imposed on the American judicial system if it heard such actions. One primary justification for dismissing these actions is the view that it would be fundamentally unfair to permit foreign plaintiffs to use already backlogged American courts that are \u201cpaid for by U.S. taxpayers and whose juries are composed of U.S. citizens who are asked to drop their everyday activities to\u201d help adjudicate an action. [Dunham &amp; Gladbach, <em>Forum non conveniens and foreign plaintiffs in the 1990s, </em>24 Brook J Int\u2019l L 665, 689 (1999) (internal citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201cQlury duty is a burden that ought not to be imposed upon the people of a community which has no relation to the litigation.\u201d <em>Gulf Oil Corp v Gilbert, </em>330 US 501, 508-509; 67 S Ct 839; 91 L Ed 1055 (1947). That is, the people of Michigan have a civic obligation to serve as jurors, but it is an obligation that is predicated upon the idea that the people are serving the obligations of their own community. Jurors are being asked to inconvenience themselves, and divert time and attention from their families, their businesses, and their personal affairs in order to serve the larger community of which they are a part. This rationale for the juror obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>becomes sharply attenuated where this state increasingly takes cognizance of lawsuits that cannot fairly be said to have arisen from within the community. It is not to be parochial to suggest that the people of Michigan have a primary interest in \u201cMichigan cases,\u201d cases that implicate the interests of Michigan and its people, cases in which there is a significant element of \u201cMichiganness.\u201d This indeed is the primary reason why the people of Michigan \u201cearnestly desiring to secure these blessings undiminished to ourselves and our posterity,\u201d Const of 1963, Preamble, have ordained our Constitution and established a court system to exercise the judicial power of their state. It is also to accord respect to the taxpayers of this state to recognize that their taxes should be employed only in support of a judicial system that primarily hears disputes arising from within this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">In the instant case, plaintiffs are asking the Wayne Circuit Court to expend considerable time and resources to ascertain whether, under Croatian law, defendant is liable for the injuries that these Croatian plaintiffs suffered in an accident that occurred in Croatia. As in <em>Piper, supra </em>at 261, \u201c[t]he American interest in this accident is simply not sufficient to justify the enormous commitment of judicial time and resources that would inevitably be required if the case were to be tried here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In summary, I believe that the following \u201cpublic interest\u201d factors (including the new factors, Nos. 4 through 9) should be considered when determining whether a case should be dismissed on the basis of the forum non conveniens doctrine:</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">1. Administrative difficulties that may arise in an area that may not be present in the area of origin;</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>2. Consideration of the state law that must govern the case;</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">3. People who are concerned by the proceeding;</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">4. The extent to which it is appropriate for the state to enable a foreign plaintiff to avail himself or herself of the more favorable substantive law and procedural rules afforded by state courts in comparison with those of the plaintiffs own jurisdiction;</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">5. The extent to which resolving a particular legal dispute in a state court may compromise principles of judicial comity and undermine respect for the judicial sovereignty of a foreign jurisdiction;</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">6. The interests of the state in establishing and enforcing standards that domestic businesses and manufacturers must satisfy in selling their products abroad as compared to the foreign jurisdiction\u2019s interest in establishing and enforcing standards that foreign businesses and manufacturers must satisfy in selling their products within its borders;</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">7. The interests of the state in shaping the law within a particular substantive realm as compared to the foreign jurisdiction\u2019s interest in shaping the law within a particular substantive realm;</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">8. The extent to which accommodating the instant lawsuit in this state will have consequences for the numbers and types of future lawsuits heard by state courts;</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">9. The interests of the state in expending its limited judicial and other resources in trying a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">This case is similar to <em>Jemaa v MacGregor Athletic Products, </em>151 Mich App 273; 390 NW2d 180 (1986), in which the plaintiff was injured in Ohio while playing football. The plaintiff sued the defendant in Michigan, claiming that his injury was due to a defect in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>football helmet worn by the plaintiff. Although the defendant did business in Michigan, its design and manufacture of football helmets was done elsewhere. The trial court dismissed the case on the basis of the forum non conveniens doctrine. The Court of Appeals affirmed, explaining, \u201c[N]either the plaintiff nor, apparently, the witnesses to the football accident reside in Michigan and the accident occurred in Ohio\u201d and \u201c [although MacGregor does business in Michigan,... its Michigan business is not connected to the manufacturing of the football helmets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280. Likewise, in the instant case, plaintiffs do not reside in Michigan and the accident occurred in Croatia, and although defendant does business in Michigan, its Michigan business is not connected to the manufacturing of the transmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">In <em>Anderson v Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co, </em>411 Mich 619, 631; 309 NW2d 539 (1981), a Florida plaintiff brought an action in Michigan pertaining to an incident that occurred in Florida. We held that \u201c[t]he fact that virtually all the witnesses to the incident are apparently residents of Florida or nearby southern states reveals a likelihood that the defendant will suffer considerable difficulty in preparing any defense and is sufficient to overcome plaintiffs slight interest in having a trial in Michigan.\u201d The vehicular accident at issue in this case occurred in Croatia, and, thus, the witnesses more than likely are residents of Croatia. It certainly would not be any easier to travel to Croatia to obtain witnesses than it would be to travel to Florida to obtain witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Plaintiffs argue that there were no witnesses to the accident in Croatia. However, as the trial court held, defendant should have an opportunity to confirm plaintiffs\u2019 assertions. Defendant should not have to blindly rely on plaintiffs\u2019 account of the accident. As the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>court explained, \u201cPlaintiffs want Defendant to accept Plaintiffs\u2019 good faith on many matters, such as the lack of witnesses to the accident other than the vehicle\u2019s occupants and the willingness of Plaintiffs to supply relevant documents, but Defendant will no doubt want to assess these matters itself and obtain the necessary documents first-hand, matters more easily done in Croatia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Plaintiffs argue that defendant has not established that a Michigan forum will be inconvenient because it has not established that there are any witnesses in Croatia that it will be deprived of if this case is tried in Michigan. In other words, plaintiffs argue that \u201cany inconvenience to the defendant is speculative.\u201d <em>Ander</em>son, <em>supra </em>at 630. However, as we held in <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 630-631, \u201c[w]here, as here, there is little nexus between the litigation and the forum, there is no need for the defendant to prepare extensively for trial in order to show exactly how inconvenient a trial in Michigan would prove to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">For the reasons expressed both in the majority opinion and in this opinion, I concur in the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing this case on the basis of the doctrine of forum non conveniens. I also submit that the \u201cpublic interest\u201d factors in the forum non conveniens test of this state should be expanded upon as suggested in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-4\"> These contemporary realities include the growth of multinational corporations, the expanding realm of international free trade, and the increasing attractiveness of American courts to plaintiffs. Because an increasing number of American companies are doing business, and an increasing number of American products are being sold and used, throughout the world, an increasing number of foreign citizens are being injured by, and bringing lawsuits against, these companies. Such globalization is also reflected in the evolving nature of the legal profession and the growing presence of American law firms throughout the world. As one commentator has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">This century has seen the development of the large-scale multinational corporation (\u201cMNC\u201d), an entity whose transactions can span several continents and establish contacts with many nations. The growth of these businesses, along with procedural innovations in jurisdiction, has created an environment easily exploited by forum shopping plaintiffs seeking to recover large awards against MNCs. Generous in personam jurisdiction provisions often permit plaintiffs to sue defendant MNCs in several different state or federal courts, thereby providing plaintiffs with a broad choice of fora. This flexibility in choice of forum, coupled with significant pro-plaintiff elements in U.S. courts, has made the United States a particularly attractive forum for plaintiffs seeking to recover against MNCs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">As forum shopping in the United States has become more feasible and desirable, technological advances in transportation and an increase in transnational activity have increased the potential number of international suits that plaintiffs can bring in the United States. The result has been a dramatic increase in the number of international or foreign disputes brought in the United States against MNCs. American courts have responded, through certain procedural reforms and refinements, to the increase in forum shopping involving foreign plaintiffs. The most notable of these is an expansion of the old doctrine of forum non conveniens.

West Germany and Japan have a strict liability statute for pharmaceuticals. However, strict liability remains primarily an American innovation. Second, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>tort plaintiff may choose, at least potentially, from among 50 jurisdictions if he decides to file suit in the United States. Each of these jurisdictions applies its own set of malleable choice-of-law rules. Third, jury trials are almost always available in the United States, while they are never provided in civil law jurisdictions. G. Gloss, Comparative Law 12 (1979); J. Merryman, The Civil Law Tradition 121 (1969). Even in the United Kingdom, most civil actions are not tried before a jury. 1 G. Keeton, The United Kingdom: The Development of its Laws and Constitutions 309 (1955).

I would affirm the Court of Appeals judgment and remand the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">RELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In the interest of clarity, it is necessary to give a brief statement of the facts of this case. Forum non conveniens involves fact-driven analyses. Plaintiffs and decedent, Ena Begovic, were Croatian citizens. They were using a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee (hereinafter the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Jeep) on the Island of Brae on the Dalmatian coast of the Republic of Croatia. Allegedly, when the Jeep was stationary and its transmission in park, the transmission slipped into reverse gear although no one touched the controls. This caused the Jeep to roll over the lip of a promontory and into a ravine. Ena Begovic died, and the other plaintiffs suffered serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">It is undisputed that all decisions regarding the designing of the Jeep were made in Michigan. This includes the decision that a transmission manufactured in Japan would be built into the Jeep. The vehicle was manufactured in Wayne County, Michigan, before being shipped to Italy where it was purchased. Maintenance on the Jeep occurred in both Italy and Croatia.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Because the Jeep had been designed and manufactured in Michigan, plaintiffs chose to file this products-liability lawsuit here. Although Michigan is its home state, defendant took the position that it is not a convenient forum and moved for summary disposition. The circuit court agreed and dismissed the case on the basis of forum non conveniens. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the trial court had improperly avoided acknowledging its jurisdiction. It decided that Wayne County was not a seriously inconvenient forum. <em>Radeljak v DaimlerChrysler Corp, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued December 14, 2004 (Docket No. 247781). We granted leave to appeal and directed the parties to address two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">(1) whether the public interest factors of the forum non conveniens doctrine set forth in <em>Cray v Gen Motors Corp, </em>389 Mich 382, 396 (1973), should be revised or modified; and (2) whether, even if another more appropriate forum exists, a Michigan court may not resist jurisdiction unless its own forum is \u201cseriously inconvenient.\u201d [472 Mich 924 (2005).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>THE BACKGROUND OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\">When a judge applies the doctrine of forum non conveniens, he or she seeks to determine whether the court where the plaintiff filed suit is inconvenient for the litigants and witnesses. Also, the judge determines whether there is another more convenient forum where the action should have been brought.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The central goal of forum non conveniens is to provide a fair trial for all parties involved. In the case in which the United States Supreme Court first adopted the doctrine, <em>Gulf Oil Corp v Gilbert, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">The court will weigh relative advantages and obstacles to fair trial. It is often said that the plaintiff may not, by choice of an inconvenient forum, \u201cvex,\u201d \u201charass,\u201d or \u201coppress\u201d the defendant by inflicting upon him expense or trouble not necessary to his own right to pursue his remedy. But unless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant, the plaintiffs choice of forum should rarely be disturbed. <em>[Gulf Oil Corp v Gilbert, </em>330 US 501, 508; 67 S Ct 839; 91 L Ed 1055 (1947).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The Supreme Court elaborated on this point in its discussion of the difference between the doctrine of forum non conveniens and the statute that governs change of venue, 28 USC 1404. <em>Norwood v Kirkpatrick, </em>349 US 29; 75 S Ct 544; 99 L Ed 789 (1955). The Court noted the limitations of forum non conveniens:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>\u201cThe <em>forum non conveniens </em>doctrine is quite different from Section 1404(a). That doctrine involves the dismissal of a case because the forum chosen by the plaintiff is so completely inappropriate and inconvenient that it is better to stop the litigation in the place where brought and let it start all over again somewhere else. It is quite naturally subject to careful limitation for it not only denies the plaintiff the generally accorded privilege of bringing an action where he chooses, but makes it possible for him to lose out completely, through the running of the statute of limitations in the forum finally deemed appropriate.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 31, quoting <em>All States Freight, Inc v Modarelli, </em>196 F2d 1010, 1011 (CA 3, 1952).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Earlier, the Court had stated the central goal of the doctrine: \u201c[T]he ultimate inquiry is whether trial will best serve the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Koster v (American) Lumbermens Mut Cas Co, </em>330 US 518, 527; 67 S Ct 828; 91 L Ed 1067 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">It is on this ground that the Michigan Supreme Court built its forum non conveniens precedent. In <em>Cray, </em>the Court decided that the doctrine should apply in Michigan. <em>Cray, </em>389 Mich 395. The Court enumerated several factors and subfactors that a trial court should weigh and balance in its decision on a motion based on forum non conveniens.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">A balancing out and weighing of factors to be considered in rejecting or accepting jurisdiction in such cases should include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">1. The private interest of the litigant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">a. Availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing witnesses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">b. Ease of access to sources of proof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-12\">c.

Consideration of the state law which must govern the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">c. People who are concerned by the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">3. Reasonable promptness in raising the plea of <em>forum, non conveniens. [Id. </em>at 395-396.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">In Michigan, these factors are often referred to as the <em>Cray </em>factors. <em>Cray </em>made clear that their application was intended to function as a balancing test with the object of comparing the advantages of two possible courts. \u201cThe courts are charged to consider the plaintiffs choice of forum and to weigh carefully the relative advantages and disadvantages of jurisdiction and the ease of and obstacles to a fair trial in this state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">This Court also made clear in <em>Cray </em>that the balancing test is intended to be an instrument used to avoid the injustice of forcing a party to litigate in a forum that is fundamentally unfair. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-13\"><em>[FJorum non conveniens </em>\u201cwas designed as an instrument of justice to avoid the unfairness, vexatiousness and oppressiveness of a trial away from the domicile of a defendant.\u201d ... The basic standards are said to be \u201cconvenience, efficiency and justice.\u201d Moore and Fink in <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>indicate <em>forum non conveniens </em>is applied when trial would be \u201cunduly burdensome upon the defendant\u201d. <em>[Id. </em>at 391-392, quoting Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure, p 443.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>The <em>Cray </em>Court also quoted the Supreme Court of New Jersey:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">\u201cIt is only in those exceptional cases where a weighing of all the many relevant factors, of which residence is but a part, decisively establishes that there is available another forum where trial will best serve the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice, that the doctrine is ever invoked.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 392, quoting <em>Gore v United States Steel Corp, </em>15 NJ 301, 311; 104 A2d 670 (1954).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Finally, <em>Cray </em>quoted the Restatement Conflict of Laws, 2d, with approval:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">\u201cA state will not exercise jurisdiction if it is a <em>seriously inconvenient forum </em>for the trial of the action provided that a more appropriate forum is available to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 394 n 2, quoting 1 Restatement Conflict of Laws, 2d, \u00a7 84, p 251 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">In referencing this, the <em>Cray </em>Court took special note of the comment on the quoted section of the Restatement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">In the commentary, the most important rules are said to be honoring plaintiffs choice <em>except in unusual circumstances </em>and never dismissing an action if there is no alternative forum. Appropriate forums are the site of the incident, <em>a corporation\u2019s state of incorporation or principal place of business </em>and the state of plaintiffs domicile. <em>[Id. </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">THE \"SERIOUSLY INCONVENIENT\u201d STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">It is in light of this background and history of the forum non conveniens doctrine that we must assess the judgment of the circuit court in this case. The Court of Appeals panel concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by resisting jurisdiction without determining that Wayne County was a seriously inconvenient forum. The panel reached this conclusion on the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Court of Appeals past decisions in <em>Robey v Ford Motor </em>Co<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <em>Manfredi v Johnson Controls, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> Robey </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-3\">When a party requests that a court decline jurisdiction based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens, there are two inquiries for the court to make: whether the forum is inconvenient and whether there is a more appropriate forum available. If there is not a more appropriate forum elsewhere, the inquiry ends and the court may not resist imposition of jurisdiction. If there is a more appropriate forum, the court still may not decline jurisdiction unless its own forum is seriously inconvenient. <em>[Robey, </em>155 Mich App 645.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The majority contends that the \u201cseriously inconvenient\u201d standard is inconsistent with <em>Cray. </em>Therefore, it overturns <em>Robey </em>and eliminates the seriously inconvenient standard. As one can see from the earlier discussion of the foundation of the forum non conveniens doctrine, <em>Robey </em>was far from inconsistent with <em>Cray. </em>In fact, the seriously inconvenient standard is well grounded in the precedents of this Court and the United States Supreme Court in the area. Rather, it is the decision of this majority that is inconsistent with <em>Cray.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The basic concept undergirding the forum non conveniens doctrine is that a case should be dismissed if the plaintiff brought it in a completely inappropriate forum. <em>Norwood, </em>349 US 31. But the doctrine has limited application, and the plaintiffs choice of forum is accorded significant deference. \u201c[U]nless the balance is <em>strongly </em>in favor of the defendant, the plaintiffs choice of forum should rarely be disturbed.\u201d <em>Gulf Oil Corp, </em>330 US 508 (emphasis added). The balance swings strongly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>in favor of the defendant when the plaintiff chooses a forum to \u201c \u2018vex,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018harass,\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018oppress\u2019 \u201d the defendant. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The seriously inconvenient standard falls directly in line with this precedent. It assures that a court does not force a plaintiff to run the risk of losing, or the expense of refiling, his or her claim because of a mere trifle. To warrant a dismissal based on forum non conveniens, the defendant must be faced with strong or significant inconvenience such as vexation, harassment, or oppression. <em>Id. </em>Only when a forum is \u201c \u2018completely inappropriate and inconvenient [so] that it is better to stop\u2019 \u201d is forum non conveniens appropriate. <em>Norwood, </em>349 US 31 (citation omitted). The seriously inconvenient requirement recognized in <em>Robey </em>assures that this standard is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">It stretches the imagination to hold that the seriously inconvenient standard is inconsistent with <em>Cray. </em>As has been noted already, <em>Cray </em>cited the Restatement Second with approval. The section it cited applies the very same standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">A state will not exercise jurisdiction if it is a <em>seriously inconvenient forum, </em>for the trial of the action provided that a more appropriate forum is available to the plaintiff. [1 Restatement Conflict of Laws, 2d, \u00a7 84, p 251 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Nothing else in <em>Cray </em>contradicts this standard and the Court did not distinguish it elsewhere in the opinion or in subsequent cases. Instead, the Court articulated a consistent standard of forum non conveniens review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Given that this Court noted with approval the seriously inconvenient standard when first recognizing forum non conveniens in this state, the standard is well founded in our law. It appears rash for the majority to overturn this properly recognized minimum standard for determining that a forum is sufficiently inconvenient.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">In this case, the trial court did not make a finding that Wayne County was a seriously inconvenient forum. Hence, it failed to recognize the \u201c \u2018careful limitations\u2019 \u201d that have applied to the forum non conveniens doctrine. <em>Norwood, </em>349 US 31 (citation omitted). Because the court did not make this finding, it did not conclude that the balance weighed so strongly in favor of defendant that plaintiffs\u2019 choice of forum warrants disturbance. <em>Gulf Oil Corp, </em>330 US 508. As the Court of Appeals noted, the failure of the trial court to meet this minimal standard was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">THE FAILURE TO FULLY BALANCE THE <em>CRAY </em>FACTORS</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">While the trial court reviewed the <em>Cray </em>factors in its written opinion, it did not properly weigh the two forums one against the other. The trial court focused on the difficulties presented in retaining jurisdiction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Michigan. But it did not give equal consideration to the difficulties that a Croatian court would face if it had jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">For instance, the trial court considered the burden on defendant to obtain evidence remaining in Croatia. But it ignored that plaintiffs would face a similar, if not greater, burden in obtaining documents that remained in Michigan relating to the manufacture of the Jeep. The failure to take this into consideration in a products-liability case is not excusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The trial court also considered, as a major factor disfavoring Wayne County as the proper forum, that the transmission defendant chose to place in the Jeep was designed and manufactured in Japan. However, this fact is irrelevant because a Croatian court is in no better position to obtain documents or witnesses from Japan than is a Michigan court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Also, the trial court assumed that Croatian law would apply, an impermissible assumption. To properly apply the <em>Cray </em>factors, a court should first determine which forum\u2019s law should apply. See <em>Manfredi, </em>194 Mich App 525-526. This failure is yet another sign that the trial court neglected to conduct an actual balancing test in deciding defendant\u2019s forum non conveniens motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\"><em>Cray </em>requires such a balancing test. \u201cThe courts are charged to consider the plaintiff s choice of forum and to weigh carefully the relative advantages and disadvantages of jurisdiction and the ease of and obstacles to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>a fair trial in this state.\u201d <em>Cray, </em>389 Mich 396. The failure to conduct such a balancing test is an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">THE CRAY FACTORS DO NOT STRONGLY OR SIGNIFICANTLY FAVOR CROATIA AS THE PROPER FORUM</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The majority opines that the <em>Cray </em>factors support Croatia as the more appropriate forum. I agree with the Court of Appeals assessment that, once the factors are properly weighed, Wayne County is not a significantly inconvenient forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">1. PRIVATE INTERESTS</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">a. AVAILABILITY OF COMPULSORY PROCESS FOR ATTENDANCE OF UNWILLING AND THE COST OF OBTAINING ATTENDANCE OF WILLING WITNESSES</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">The trial court focused on the ease with which a Croatian court could compel the attendance of Croatian witnesses. But this is a products-liability case involving the need for numerous documents. A great many of the necessary documents are located within this state, given that the Jeep was designed and manufactured here. Moreover, some witnesses are located in the United States. Hence, difficulties will arise in obtaining witnesses and documents in both locations. Also, it appears that neither forum would have the benefit of compulsory process in the other forum. Thus, this subfactor favors neither forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">b. EASE OF ACCESS TO SOURCES OF PROOF</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">The trial court abused its discretion by focusing only on the problems existing if Michigan remained the forum for this litigation. No matter in which country this case is tried, one of the parties will be obliged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>obtain documents from the other country. Given the nature of the case, a primary concern will be the design and manufacture of the Jeep. It seems likely that the majority of the documents needed will be in Michigan. Moreover, they will be in English. Therefore, if the case is tried in Croatia, the parties likely will be obliged to have thousands of highly technical documents translated into another language. Accordingly, this subfactor arguably tends to favor Wayne County as the proper forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The majority points out that MCR 2.305 provides that documents located in Michigan can be subpoenaed for trials outside the state. It is unknown if Croatian law has a similar provision. Therefore, this fact tends to support Croatia as the proper forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Given that there is support for both sides, this subfactor evenly favors both forums.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">c. DISTANCE FROM THE SITUS OF THE ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE LITIGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Again, this subfactor weighs evenly between the two forums. Whereas the accident occurred in Croatia, the Jeep was manufactured and designed in Michigan. Manufacture and design are incidents that give rise to the litigation, and Wayne County is much closer to these incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">d. ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY JUDGMENT OBTAINED</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">There is no indication that the judgment would be unenforceable in either forum. This subfactor favors neither forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">e. POSSIBLE HARASSMENT OF EITHER PARTY</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">This factor weighs in favor of Wayne County as the proper forum. Defendant claims that some Croatian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>witnesses may be reluctant to testify. There is evidence to the contrary. Plaintiffs offer statements by the deceased\u2019s family doctor, the mechanic who serviced the Jeep, and the person who investigated the accident for the Croatian authorities. They stated that they will be willing to travel to and testify in Wayne County. There is no countervailing evidence that witnesses located within the United States will be willing to travel to Croatia. Therefore, it is more likely that plaintiffs would have difficulty bringing reluctant witnesses related to defendant to testify in Croatia than that defendant could not bring Croatian witnesses to Michigan. Hence, this subfactor should favor Wayne County as the proper forum.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">f. OTHER PRACTICAL PROBLEMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE EASE, EXPENSE, AND EXPEDITION OF THE TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Defendant and the majority discuss defendant\u2019s need to implead third parties in this case. But it remains unknown whether the Croatian courts allow impleading. Defendant asks this Court to conclude that they do, without providing legal and factual support for the conclusion. A party may not simply announce a position and leave it to this Court to find support for it. <em>Goolsby v Detroit, </em>419 Mich 651, 655 n 1; 358 NW2d 856 (1984). \u201cThe appellant himself must first adequately prime the pump; only then does the appellate well begin to flow.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number><em>Mitcham v Detroit, </em>355 Mich 182, 203; 94 NW2d 388 (1959). Moreover, defendant names no parties it wishes to implead. There is no way to know in which forum they could be impleaded inasmuch as they are not identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Even if it is assumed that there are parties in Croatia that defendant needs to implead and that Croatia allows impleading, Croatia is not strongly favored as a forum. This is because, if the trial were held in Wayne County and if defendant could not implead third parties, defendant would face no greater liability. MCL 600.2957(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">In an action based on tort or another legal theory-seeking damages for personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death, the liability of each person shall be allocated under this section by the trier of fact and, subject to section 6304, in direct proportion to the person\u2019s percentage of fault. In assessing percentages of fault under this subsection, the trier of fact shall consider the fault of each person, regardless of whether the person is, or could have been, named as a party to the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Defendant points to no provision in Croatian law similar to this one. Hence, it could be argued that Wayne County is the more appropriate forum because a proper allocation of liability is assumed there. At the very least, considering the totality of the circumstance existing under this subfactor, it does not clearly favor either Croatia or Wayne County.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">g. POSSIBILITY OP VIEWING THE PREMISES</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">This subfactor favors Croatia as the forum because the accident occurred there.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">In summary, most of the subfactors under \u201cprivate interest\u201d weigh evenly between the two forums. The possibility of viewing the premises favors Croatia. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the possibility of witness harassment favors Wayne County. In any event, the \u201cprivate interests\u201d factor assuredly does not favor Croatia, as the majority asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">2. MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">a. ADMINISTRATIVE DIFFICULTIES THAT MAY ARISE IN AN AREA WHICH MAY NOT BE PRESENT IN THE AREA OF ORIGIN</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Again, defendant provided the trial court no information about the legal conditions in Croatia. The majority argues that the Wayne County docket would be congested if every automotive design case arising abroad were brought there. But we have no reason to believe that would occur. Instead, the evidence suggests that, despite the existence for the past two decades of the <em>Robey </em>\u201cseriously inconvenient\u201d standard, Wayne County has suffered no flood of automobile product liability cases. The majority\u2019s reasoning under this subfactor borders on fear-mongering.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Because we have no idea how busy the Croatian courts are, we cannot conclude in any event that the Wayne County docket would be more congested than a Croatian court docket. The <em>Cray </em>factors are intended as a balancing test. <em>Cray, </em>389 Mich 396. The record in this case does not permit a proper balancing of this subfactor. Therefore, it should not be concluded that it favors either forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">b. CONSIDERATION OF THE STATE LAW THAT MUST GOVERN THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">As previously discussed in my opinion, the trial court abused its discretion by failing to analyze this subfactor. It merely assumed inappropriately that Croatian law would apply to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>I agree with the Court of Appeals that Croatian law may not apply. The ancient rule in the field of choice of law was <em>lex loci delicti. </em>It required that a court always apply the law of the place where the tort or wrong occurred. <em>Sutherland v Kennington Truck Service Ltd, </em>454 Mich 274, 278; 562 NW2d 466 (1997). But Michigan long ago abandoned this rule. <em>Id. </em>at 283-284. <em>Sutherland </em>articulated the proper test for determining if Michigan law should apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">[W]e will apply Michigan law unless a \u201crational reason\u201d to do otherwise exists. In determining whether a rational reason to displace Michigan law exists, we undertake a two-step analysis. First, we must determine if any foreign state has an interest in having its law applied. If no state has such an interest, the presumption that Michigan law will apply cannot be overcome. If a foreign state does have an interest in having its law applied, we must then determine if Michigan\u2019s interests mandate that Michigan law be applied, despite the foreign interests. <em>[Id. </em>at 286.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">It is undisputed that Croatia has an interest in this case. When another state has a significant interest and Michigan\u2019s interest is minimal, Michigan courts should defer to the foreign state\u2019s law. <em>Hall v Gen Motors Corp, </em>229 Mich App 580, 585; 582 NW2d 866 (1998). But, in this case, I believe that Michigan has more than a minimal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The Jeep was designed and manufactured in this state. Michigan has easily as much interest in the safe design and manufacture of its goods as does any other state or country. Its interest may be greater because the state\u2019s good name stands to be diminished if its products are branded dangerous or deadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">In addition, Michigan has an interest in protecting its manufacturers, given that they provide a large percentage of the state\u2019s job base. Michigan has an interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>having known products-liability laws applied to ensure fair determinations of liability. The Michigan Legislature has implemented laws to protect consumers against faulty products and to protect manufacturers against Draconian liability determinations. Michigan has a legitimate interest in applying those laws.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The majority points to the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Farrell v Ford Motor Co,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to support the argument that it is more likely that Croatian law applies than Michigan law. <em>Farrell </em>can be distinguished. In <em>Farrell, </em>the plaintiffs argument was that Ford\u2019s headquarters are in Michigan. <em>Farrell, </em>199 Mich App 93-94. There was no evidence in the record regarding where the car in that case was manufactured or designed. <em>Id. </em>at 94 n 3. And the Court of Appeals paid special attention to the major connection Ford had to North Carolina:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">Ford unquestionably generates substantial commerce within the State of North Carolina. In connection with its motion for summary disposition, Ford submitted substantial documentary evidence in the form of affidavits that reveal that Ford directly employs seventy employees at its Charlotte, North Carolina, facility and purchased nearly $ 591 million worth of materials from North Carolina suppliers in 1989. In addition, Ford and Lincoln-Mercury vehicles accounted for 27.4 percent of all new cars and 30 percent of new trucks sold in North Carolina in 1989. It is obviously in North Carolina\u2019s economic interest to encourage manufacturers, such as Ford, to do business in North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Carolina. The sales taxes collected, salaries paid, and materials purchased all contribute to North Carolina\u2019s economy. <em>[Id. </em>at 93.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Defendant fails to document such significant economic connections with the Island of Brae, the Dalmatian Coast, or the Republic of Croatia. Given this, we have no way of knowing what economic connections defendant has with the alternate forum. The lack of a record in this regard clearly distinguishes this case from <em>Farrell. </em>Because of it, I believe that Michigan may apply its own law to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Given that there is strong support for Michigan applying its own law, this subfactor favors retaining jurisdiction in Wayne County.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">c. PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED BY THE PROCEEDING</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Parties from both forums have an interest in this case. Citizens of Croatia were injured in the crash. Ena Begovic had the distinction of being a famous actress.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On the other hand, as discussed earlier regarding subfactor b, Michigan has more than an incidental interest in this case. Therefore, this subfactor does not clearly favor either forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Synthesizing the subfactors under the \u201cmatters of public interest\u201d factor, neither forum is strongly favored. But the consideration of state law slightly favors Michigan as the forum. At the very least, the public interest factor does not strongly favor Croatia as the proper forum, as the majority implies.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>3. REASONABLE PROMPTNESS IN RAISING FORUM NON CONVENIENS</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">No assertion is made that defendant failed to promptly raise forum non conveniens.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In summary, considering all the <em>Cray </em>factors, neither forum is strongly favored. Instead, it appears that the two forums are rather equally matched. And a strong argument could be made that the factors favor Michigan as a forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The factors assuredly do not strongly favor Croatia. Unless the \u201cbalance is strongly in favor of the defendant, the plaintiffs choice of forum should rarely be disturbed.\u201d <em>Gulf Oil Corp, </em>330 US 508. Because the reviewed factors do not strongly weigh in favor of defendant, this is not one of those \u201c \u2018exceptional cases\u2019 \u201d where it is decisively established that there is another forum where \u201c \u2018trial will best serve the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice....\u2019\u201d <em>Cray, </em>389 Mich 392, quoting <em>Gore, </em>15 NJ 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">There is no evidence that plaintiffs brought this case to vex, harass, or oppress defendant. Therefore, the principles undergirding the doctrine are not implicated, and Wayne County is not a completely inappropriate forum. <em>Norwood, </em>349 US 31. In such situations, Wayne County should not avoid its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">The trial court abused its discretion by dismissing the case without finding that Wayne County is a seriously inconvenient forum. <em>Cray, </em>389 Mich 394 n 2; <em>Robey, </em>155 Mich App 645. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">THERE IS NO NEED TO ADD TO THE CRAY FACTORS</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">We specifically asked the parties to address whether <em>Cray\u2019s </em>public interest factor should be revised or modi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>fied. Justice MARKMAN notes several \u201ccontemporary realities\u201d that support adding public interest subfactors such as the globalization of American companies, the expansion of free trade, and the attractiveness of American courts. Justice Markman\u2019s additional factors would strongly disfavor foreign plaintiffs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> I feel that such additions are not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Despite the authority discussing the attractiveness of American courts, there is little to demonstrate that Michigan has become an especially attractive forum. There is no evidence that foreign nationals are rushing to file products-liability or other tort cases in Michigan. When specifically asked about the number of such cases in Michigan, defendant\u2019s attorney could point to only a handful, and he could specifically name just two. There is simply no evidence that Michigan\u2019s courts are flooded with cases brought by foreign nationals. And there is no indication that a sudden influx will occur if the law is not immediately altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Without a disease, there is no need for a cure. Courts have proven well equipped to apply <em>Cray </em>as it stands. And the <em>Cray </em>factors have proven eminently capable of handling the issue of forum non conveniens. Therefore, I would not add to the public interest factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Similarly, I must dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to adopt the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Piper Aircraft Co v </em>Reyno<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that a foreign plaintiffs choice of forum should be accorded less deference. The Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">The District Court acknowledged that there is ordinarily a strong presumption in favor of the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>choice of forum, which may be overcome only when the private and public interest factors clearly point towards trial in the alternative forum. It held, however, that the presumption applies with less force when the plaintiff or real parties in interest are foreign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">The District Court\u2019s distinction between resident or citizen plaintiffs and foreign plaintiffs is fully justified. In <em>Roster, </em>the Court indicated that a plaintiffs choice of forum is entitled to greater deference when the plaintiff has chosen the home forum. 330 U.S., at 524. When the home forum has been chosen, it is reasonable to assume that this choice is convenient. When the plaintiff is foreign, however, this assumption is much less reasonable. Because the central purpose of any <em>forum non conveniens </em>inquiry is to ensure that the trial is convenient, a foreign plaintiffs choice deserves less deference. <em>[Piper, </em>454 US 255-256.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><em>Piper </em>went on to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">Citizens or residents deserve somewhat more deference than foreign plaintiffs, but dismissal should not be automatically barred when a plaintiff has filed suit in his home forum. As always, if the balance of conveniences suggests that trial in the chosen forum would be unnecessarily burdensome for the defendant or the court, dismissal is proper. <em>[Id. </em>at 255 n 23.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">I do not believe that we should adopt <em>Piper. </em>The reason that the <em>Piper </em>Court is giving less deference to a foreign national\u2019s choice of forum is because the foreign national is foreign. Basing access to our courts on such a status is highly suspect and smacks of xenophobia. As the Washington Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">The Court\u2019s logic [in Piper] does not withstand scrutiny. The Court is comparing apples and oranges. Foreigners, by definition, can never choose the United States as their home forum.... [I]t is not necessarily less reasonable to assume that a foreign plaintiffs choice of forum is convenient. Why is it less reasonable to assume that a plaintiff from British Columbia, who brings suit in Washington, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>chosen a less convenient forum than a plaintiff from Florida bringing the same suit? <em>[Myers v Boeing Co, </em>115 Wash 2d 123, 138; 794 P2d 1272 (1990) (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Treating foreign nationals differently in every case simply does not make logical sense. To offer a Michigan example, person A is a resident of Windsor, Canada, but crosses the Ambassador Bridge each workday to work in Detroit. While driving a vehicle designed, manufactured, bought, and maintained in Michigan before crossing from Canada one day, person A is involved in an accident caused by an automobile design defect. Person B is a resident of California. He drives a DaimlerChrysler vehicle that was designed in Germany and manufactured outside Michigan. He is also involved in an automobile accident caused by a design defect, but it occurs in Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Under <em>Piper, </em>the circuit court must accord considerable deference to person B\u2019s choice of Michigan as a forum, but person A\u2019s choice of Michigan would not warrant such deference. This is despite the fact that person A has significantly greater contact and connection to Michigan than person B. There is no reason for this distinction aside from the desire to discriminate against person A because of A\u2019s status as a foreign national. I find such discrimination inappropriate and unnecessary. The discrimination is needless in light of the fact that application of the <em>Cray </em>factors would properly locate the correct forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Much of the 1981 <em>Piper </em>decision is based on the notion that American courts are particularly attractive to foreign plaintiffs. Its rule was apparently created with the object of preventing a flood of foreign cases into American courts. But again, there is no real evidence of a threatened influx into Michigan. And there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>no evidence that the existing <em>Cray </em>factors are ill-equipped to prevent an influx should it arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Moreover, <em>Piper </em>makes forum-shopping easier for corporations headquartered in the United States. Foreign nationals often bring cases in the home forum of the defendant corporation. But <em>Piper </em>enables a corporation based in the United States not to defend the case on its home turf in a court minutes away from home. Instead, the corporation can decide to fly halfway around the globe to defend the case in an unfamiliar court and often in a language other than English. The motivation for this is to find a forum more conducive to its victory. <em>Piper </em>facilitates forum-shopping for these corporations by lowering the standard necessary to escape the original forum\u2019s jurisdiction. Forum-shopping in general is inappropriate. And I would not encourage it by adopting the language cited earlier from <em>Piper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">But even under <em>Piper, </em>this case does not warrant dismissal based on forum non conveniens. A foreign national\u2019s choice of forum is still accorded deference. \u201cCitizens or residents deserve <em>somewhat more deference </em>than foreign plaintiffs. . ..\u201d <em>Piper, </em>454 US 255 n 23 (emphasis added). Somewhat less deference is a far cry from no deference at all. In fact, considering the statements made in <em>Gulf Oil Corp, </em>a fair amount of deference for the plaintiff\u2019s choice remains under <em>Piper. Gulf Oil Corp, </em>330 US 508. As was discussed earlier in this opinion, there is an even balance between the convenience of the forums when the <em>Cray </em>factors are applied. Hence, giving any deference at all to the plaintiffs\u2019 choice of forum would result in Wayne County retaining jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The majority contends that the only reasonable explanation for plaintiffs\u2019 decision to sue in Michigan was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>to take advantage of Michigan\u2019s favorable laws and to avoid Croatia\u2019s less favorable laws. This simply is not true. There is a legitimate argument that plaintiffs filed this case in Michigan as a matter of convenience. As noted earlier, there are likely thousands of documents in Michigan relating to the design and manufacture of the Jeep. Also there are likely numerous witnesses in the United States who could be called to testify regarding the choices made in designing and manufacturing the Jeep. This is not to mention the thousands of pages of documents that likely exist in Washington, D.C., involving a National Highway Safety Administration investigation of the problems with this kind of Jeep. All these documents are in English, and few, if any, of the witnesses speak Croatian. The choice of forum was appropriately influenced by these considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Rather than merely shopping for a favorably disposed forum, plaintiffs came to defendant\u2019s home state to facilitate calling witnesses and obtaining documents that will form the foundation of their case. This choice seems more than reasonable. It is defendant that is hard-pressed to argue that its reason for opposing Wayne County\u2019s jurisdiction is not forum-shopping. It seeks to close the doors to a court in its backyard, so that it could fly halfway around the world to defend the case in a foreign country. Given that all identified Croatian witnesses will come to this county, the sole remaining reason for defendant\u2019s resistance to the Wayne Circuit Court must be to find a more friendly forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Defendant has not and cannot demonstrate that plaintiffs\u2019 choice is unnecessarily burdensome for it or for the court. Even under <em>Piper, </em>the balancing of the conveniences is decisive when deciding whether to dismiss a case. <em>Piper, </em>454 US 255 n 23. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Wayne Circuit Court is not an unsuitable court, the forum non conveniens doctrine does not permit the circuit court to avoid jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The <em>Cray </em>factors do not strongly favor Croatia as the proper forum in this case. And Wayne County is not a seriously inconvenient forum. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing this case on the basis of the doctrine of forum non conveniens. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The majority contends that I pay only lip service to the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. It reaches this conclusion because I would decide the case differently than it does. The majority misses the fact that I am applying the correct standard, the seriously inconvenient standard, to this forum non conveniens case. When this standard is applied, the trial court\u2019s decision is <em>not </em>within the principled range of outcomes because it pays no respect to plaintiffs\u2019 choice of forum. The decision that Wayne County can avoid its jurisdiction is an abuse of discretion because the <em>Cray </em>factors do not strongly weigh in favor of Croatia as a forum. <em>Gulf Oil Corp, </em>330 US 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">As noted elsewhere in this opinion, the trial court abused its discretion in other ways as well. First, it failed to balance the <em>Cray </em>factors between the two forums. <em>Cray, </em>389 Mich 396. Next, it failed to determine which forum\u2019s law to apply. To properly use the <em>Cray </em>factors, a court must first make such a determination. See <em>Manfredi, </em>194 Mich App 525-526. It is because of these failures that I conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision is not within the principled range of outcomes. Hence it constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Also, there is no basis for adopting the <em>Piper </em>standard according less deference to foreign plaintiffs\u2019 choice of forum. Therefore, I oppose embracing the United States Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in that case. Because the <em>Cray </em>factors have served us well for many years, I would continue to use them without amendment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\"> A Latin term meaning \u201c \u2018an unsuitable court.\u2019 \u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th ed).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\"> Forum non conveniens is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">the doctrine that an appropriate forum \u2014 even though competent under the law \u2014 may divest itself of jurisdiction if, for the convenience of the litigants and the witnesses, it appear that the action should proceed in another forum in which the action might originally have been brought.

Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, it is not mere speculation that these witnesses will attend without being subpoenaed.
