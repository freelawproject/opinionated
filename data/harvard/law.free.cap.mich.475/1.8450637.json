After a bench trial, the trial court convicted defendant of second-degree murder under an aiding and abetting theory. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, because it concluded that there was insufficient evidence that defendant shared or was aware of Pannell\u2019s intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">We hold that under Michigan law, a defendant who intends to aid, abet, counsel, or procure the commission of <em>a </em>crime, is liable for that crime as well as the natural and probable consequences of that crime. In this case, defendant committed and aided the commission of an aggravated assault. One of the natural and probable consequences of such a crime is death. Therefore, the trial court properly convicted defendant of second-degree murder. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">According to the evidence adduced at trial, defendant and Pannell went to the house of the victim, Bernard Thomas, with the stated intent to \u201cf*** him up.\u201d Under Pannell\u2019s direction, defendant drove himself and Pannell to the victim\u2019s house. Pannell knocked on the victim\u2019s door. When the victim opened the door, defendant struck him. As the victim fell to the ground, defendant struck the victim again. Pannell began to kick the victim. Defendant told Pannell that \u201cthat was enough,\u201d and walked back to the car. When defendant reached his car, he heard a single gunshot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Following a bench trial, the trial court found defendant guilty of second-degree murder \u201con the prong of great bodily harm only.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the court found that defendant drove Pannell to the victim\u2019s house with the intent to physically attack the victim. The court also found that once at the victim\u2019s home, defendant initiated the attack on the victim, and that defendant\u2019s attack enabled Pannell to \u201cget the upper-hand\u201d on the victim. The court sentenced defendant to a term of 71 months to 15 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s murder conviction, holding that there was insufficient evidence to support defendant\u2019s second-degree murder conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court held that the trial court improperly convicted defendant of second-degree murder because there was no evidence establishing that defendant was aware of or shared Pannell\u2019s intent to kill the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>This Court granted the prosecution\u2019s application for leave to appeal, directing the parties to address the elements of accomplice liability and the <em>mens rea </em>required to support a conviction of aiding and abetting second-degree murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The requirements of the aiding and abetting statute<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are a question of law that this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[W]ords and phrases that have acquired a unique meaning at common law are interpreted as having the same meaning when used in statutes dealing with the same subject.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In evaluating defendant\u2019s claim regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court reviews the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecutor to determine whether any trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Findings of fact by the trial court may not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">This case involves liability under our aiding and abetting statute, MCL 767.39, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">Every person concerned in the commission of an offense, whether he directly commits the act constituting the offense or procures, counsels, aids, or abets in its commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>sion may hereafter be prosecuted, indicted, tried and on conviction shall be punished as if he had directly committed such offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Unlike conspiracy<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and felony murder, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which also allow the state to punish a person for the acts of another, aiding and abetting is not a separate substantive offense. Rather, \u201cbeing an aider and abettor is simply a theory of prosecution\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that permits the imposition of vicarious liability for accomplices.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">This Court recently described the three elements necessary for a conviction under an aiding and abetting theory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">\u201c(1) the crime charged was committed by the defendant or some other person; (2) the defendant performed acts or gave encouragement that assisted the commission of the crime; and (3) the defendant intended the commission of the crime or had knowledge that the principal intended its commission at the time that [the defendant] gave aid and encouragement. \u201d[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The primary dispute in this case involves the third element. Under the Court of Appeals analysis, the third element would require the prosecutor to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant intended to commit the identical offense, here homicide, as the accomplice or, alternatively, that a defendant knew that the accomplice intended to commit the homicide. We reaffirm that evidence of defendant\u2019s specific intent to commit a crime or knowledge of the accomplice\u2019s intent constitutes sufficient <em>mens rea </em>to convict under our aiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>and abetting statute. However, as will be discussed later in this opinion, we disagree that evidence of a shared specific intent to commit the crime of an accomplice is the exclusive way to establish liability under our aiding and abetting statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">AIDING AND ABETTING STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The theory that a defendant could be liable for another\u2019s criminal actions as an \u201caider and abettor\u201d goes back to the common law. At common law, there were four categories of offenders to a felony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">(1) principal in the first degree-he actually engaged in the felonious conduct; (2) principal in the second degree-he was present when the felony was committed and aid and abetted its commission; (3) accessory before the fact-he was not present when the felony was committed but aided and abetted prior to its commission; (4) accessory after the fact-he was not present when the felony was committed but rendered aid thereafter in order to protect the felon or to facilitate his escape.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Principals in the second degree had to intend to commit the crime charged or else be aware of the intent of the principal in the first degree to commit that crime.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But accessories before the fact were \u201cguilty of all incidental consequences which might reasonably be expected to result from the intended wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, at common law, one could be guilty of the natural and probable consequences of the intended crime or the intended crime itself, depending on whether the actor was a principal in the second degree or an \u201caccessory before the fact.\u201d Michigan\u2019s aiding and abetting statute has been in force and substantively unchanged since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>mid-1800s.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The 1855 statute, 1855 PA 77, \u00a7 19, which is nearly identical to the current statute, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\">The distinction between an accessory before the fact, and a principal, and between principals in the first and second degree in cases of felony, is abrogated; and all persons concerned in the commission of a felony whether they directly commit the act constituting the offence, or aid and ahet in its commission, though not present, may hereafter he indicted, tried and punished, as princip\u00e9is, as in the case of a misdemeanor![<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">When a statute employs general common-law terms, courts will interpret the statute by looking to common-law definitions, absent clear legislative intent to change the common law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As this Court has previously indicated, the aiding and abetting statute was a legislative abolition of the common-law distinctions between principals and accessories.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Beyond that, there has been little case law from this Court interpreting <em>the language </em>of this statute.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, we note that there is no language in the statute that demonstrates a legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>intent to abrogate the common-law theory that a defendant can be held criminally liable as an accomplice if: (1) the defendant intends or is aware that the principal is going to commit a specific criminal act;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or (2) the criminal act committed by the principal is an \u201cincidental consequenceG which might reasonably be expected to result from the intended wrong.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Accordingly, we hold that when the Legislature abolished the distinction between principals and accessories, it intended for all offenders to be convicted of the intended offense, in this case aggravated assault, as well as the natural and probable consequences of that offense, in this case death. The case law that has developed since the Legislature codified these common-law principles provides examples of accomplice liability under both theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">NATURAL AND PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Under the natural and probable consequences theory, \u201c[t]here can be no criminal responsibility for any thing not fairly within the common enterprise, and which might be expected to happen if the occasion should arise for any one to do it.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In <em>Knapp, </em>the defendant and several other men engaged in sexual intercourse with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the victim. After the defendant left, one of the men threw the woman from a second-story window. A jury convicted the defendant of manslaughter. This Court reasoned that because there was no evidence that the defendant threw the victim out the window, the jury must have held him accountable for the actions of the other men.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The <em>Knapp </em>Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for manslaughter because there was no proof that the woman\u2019s death was a part of the \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d of prostitution because one would not expect it \u201cto happen if the occasion should arise to do it.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Therefore, the defendant could not be held to be an accomplice to the manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Similarly, in <em>People v Chapman, </em>this Court held that a defendant was \u201c \u2018responsible criminally for what of wrong flows directly from his corrupt intentions . . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Chapman </em>involved a defendant who paid another man $25 to commit adultery with the defendant\u2019s wife so the defendant could divorce her. The defendant watched through a hole in the wall as the other man raped his wife. This Court held that the jury properly convicted the defendant of rape under an accomplice theory of liability because that crime directly flowed from the original corrupt intention to aid adultery.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>In view of the framework established by these early cases, the propriety of the trial court\u2019s verdict is clear. The victim\u2019s death is clearly within the common enterprise the defendant aided because a homicide \u201cmight be expected to happen if the occasion should arise\u201d within the common enterprise of committing an aggravated assault. The evidence establishes that the victim threatened his children in Pannell\u2019s presence, enraging Pannell.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> When defendant woke up at 10:00 that evening, Pannell was still \u201cranting and raving\u201d in the house. Despite knowing that Pannell was in an agitated state, defendant agreed to drive to the victim\u2019s house with the understanding that he and Pannell would \u201cf*** him up.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> When the pair arrived at the victim\u2019s home, defendant initiated the assault by hitting the victim once in the face and once in the neck with the back of his hand. After the victim fell to the ground, Pannell punched him twice and began kicking him. In our judgment, a natural and probable consequence of a plan to assault someone is that one of the actors may well escalate the assault into a murder. Just as the planned seduction of the defendant\u2019s wife in <em>Chapman </em>escalated into a rape,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Pannell\u2019s anger toward the victim esca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>lated during the assault into a murderous rage. Defendant argues that he should not be held liable for the murder because he left the scene of the assault after telling Pannell, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d We disagree. Defendant was aware that Pannell was angry with the victim even before the assault. Defendant escalated the situation by driving Pannell to the victim\u2019s house, agreeing to join Pannell in assaulting the victim, and initiating the attack. He did nothing to protect Thomas and he did nothing to defuse the situation in which Thomas was ultimately killed by Pannell. A \u201cnatural and probable consequence\u201d of leaving the enraged Pannell alone with the victim is that Pannell would ultimately murder the victim. That defendant serendipitously left the scene of the crime moments before Thomas\u2019s murder does not under these circumstances exonerate him from responsibility for the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The fact that Pannell shot the victim, rather than beat him to death, does not alter this conclusion. It cannot be that a defendant can initiate an assault, leave an already infuriated principal alone with the victim, and then escape liability for the murder of that victim simply because the principal shot the victim to death, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>instead of kicking the victim to death. Like the defendant in <em>Chapman, </em>whose accomplice used rape, as opposed to seduction, to accomplish their common criminal purpose, the defendant is criminally liable as long as the crime is within the natural and probable consequences of the intended assaultive crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">INTENDED OFFENSES</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The Court of Appeals panel in this case focused on cases that reflect the intended offenses theory, such as <em>People v </em>Kelly<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> to hold that an aider or abettor must have the identical criminal intent as the principal.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Kelly </em>involved a murder that occurred during the course of an armed robbery. The jury convicted the defendant as either a principal or an aider and abettor of the felony murder. The <em>Kelly </em>Court affirmed his conviction. In analyzing the aiding and abetting charge, this Court cited <em>Meister v </em>People<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> for the proposition that \u201c[t]he requisite intent is that necessary to be convicted of the crime as a principal.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Under <em>Kelly, </em>a defendant is liable for the offense the defendant intended to commit or intended to aid and abet. However, the Court of Appeals panel in this case went further than <em>Kelly, </em>and required the accomplice to have the identical intent as the principal.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This narrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>construction is not compelled by <em>Kelly. Kelly </em>addressed aiding and abetting felony murder. Under <em>People v Aaron, </em>to sustain a felony murder conviction, the prosecution must prove that each defendant had the necessary malice to be convicted of murder.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> <em>Aaron </em>makes clear that one who aids and abets a felony murder must have the requisite malice to be convicted of felony murder, but need not have the same malice as the principal. This principle extends to other crimes: sharing the same intent as the principal allows for accomplice liability. However, sharing the identical intent is not a <em>prerequisite </em>to the imposition of accomplice liability under the common-law principles discussed earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The Court of Appeals misread <em>Kelly. </em>In accordance with the common-law principles incorporated in the statute, <em>Kelly </em>simply stands for the proposition that, at a minimum, the aider and abettor is liable for the crime he or she had the intent to commit. Even under the intended offense theory, the defendant\u2019s conviction must stand. The intent necessary for second-degree murder is the intent to kill, the <em>intent to inflict great bodily harm, </em>or the willful and wanton disregard for whether death will result.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In this case, the judge specifically found that defendant intended to inflict great bodily harm, which is sufficient to convict him of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The two approaches outlined above are not in conflict. Instead, they merely represent two different tests for liability under an aiding and abetting theory.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Under these two tests, a defendant is liable for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>crime the defendant intends to aid or abet<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> as well as the natural and probable consequences of that crime. In this case, the trial court found that defendant intended to inflict great bodily harm.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> That intent is sufficient for a conviction of aggravated assault or second-degree murder. Alternatively, defendant is liable for the homicide because death is one of the natural and probable consequences of aggravated assault, the crime defendant committed and aided. Either analysis is sufficient to support defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">We hold that a defendant must possess the criminal intent to aid, abet, procure, or counsel the commission of an offense. A defendant is criminally liable for the offenses the defendant specifically intends to aid or abet, or has knowledge of, as well as those crimes that are the natural and probable consequences of the offense he intends to aid or abet. Therefore, the prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant aided or abetted the commission of an offense and that the defendant intended to aid the charged offense, knew the principal intended to commit the charged offense, or, alternatively, that the charged offense was a natural and probable consequence of the commission of the intended offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Under either prong of the aiding and abetting analysis, defendant was properly convicted. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Court of Appeals erred in reversing defendant\u2019s conviction of second-degree murder, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b90-6\">Taylor, C.J., and Weaver, Corrigan, and Markman, JJ., concurred with YOUNG, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-7\"> The parties stipulated that the victim died from a gunshot wound.

I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that under Michigan law, a defendant who intends to aid, abet, counsel, or procure the commission of a crime is liable for <em>that </em>crime, as well as the natural and probable consequences of <em>that </em>crime. But the majority\u2019s sweeping application of this principle to the facts of this case prevents me from fully embracing this interpretation of MCL 767.39.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, I believe that today\u2019s decision sets a dangerous precedent for how MCL 767.39 will be applied in the future, and it stretches aider and abettor liability beyond any defensible bounds. Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In a nutshell, the majority opines that defendant and his codefendant, Samuel Pannell, committed an aggravated assault. Next, the majority posits that \u201cone of\u201d the natural and probable consequences of an aggravated assault is death. Thus, the majority reasons that the trial court properly convicted defendant of second-degree murder, MCL 750.317, under an aiding and abetting theory, MCL 767.39. But, as Justice KELLY <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>notes in her dissent, such an approach completely ignores the trial court\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">For example, the trial court specifically found that defendant only intended to beat up the victim. Further, the trial court found that the victim did not die from the beating; rather, the victim died from a gunshot wound after being shot by Pannell. Importantly, the trial court also found that defendant did not intend for or know that Pannell was going to shoot and kill the victim. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s findings do not support the imposition of criminal liability for second-degree murder under an aiding and abetting theory based on how MCL 767.39 has been traditionally interpreted. See, e.g., <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750, 757; 597 NW2d 130 (1999) (\u201c \u2018To support a finding that a defendant aided and abetted a crime, the prosecutor must show that (1) the crime charged was committed by the defendant or some other person, (2) the defendant performed acts or gave encouragement that assisted the commission of the crime, and (3) <em>the defendant intended the commission of the crime or had knowledge that the principal intended its commission at the time he gave aid and encouragement.\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d) (emphasis added; citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">But even under the majority\u2019s interpretation of MCL 767.39, these same factual findings do not support a second-degree murder conviction. Here, an evenhanded review of the trial court\u2019s findings does not support the conclusion that this death was a natural and probable consequence of this beating because the shooting death was not foreseen and not agreed to. Accordingly, even if I were prepared to accept the majority\u2019s interpretation of MCL 767.39, the majority\u2019s application of its interpretation defies logic and well-established principles of our criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>For example, the majority\u2019s rationale that defendant\u2019s second-degree murder conviction was proper because \u201cone of\u201d the natural and probable consequences of a beating is death is akin to saying that defendant\u2019s conviction was proper because, in general, a death might be the natural and probable consequence of some abstract beating. However, this rationale utterly destroys one of the most basic principles on which our criminal law is grounded: there can be no criminal liability without individual culpability. See, e.g., <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672, 708; 299 NW2d 304 (1980). Accordingly, it does not matter that in some hypothetical sense, a death could result from some beating. What should matter under the majority\u2019s interpretation of MCL 767.39 is whether <em>this </em>death was the natural and probable consequence of <em>this </em>beating. But in this particular case, the trial court answered this question in the negative. Again, it cannot fairly be said that this death was the natural and probable consequence of this beating where the trial court found that the victim did not die from injuries inflicted during the beating, defendant did not intend to kill, and defendant did not know Pannell would shoot and kill the victim. Thus, I disagree with the majority\u2019s rationale that because under some circumstances a death <em>may </em>result from a beating, defendant\u2019s conviction of second-degree murder was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Alternatively, the majority opinion could be read as using the following rationale to reach its result: because a death is <em>always </em>the natural and probable consequence of a beating, defendant\u2019s conviction of second-degree murder was proper under an aiding and abetting theory. But this rationale likewise destroys the bedrock principle of criminal law that there can be no criminal liability without individual culpability. See <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 708. Moreover, this rationale is ludicrous because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>flies in the face of common experience and knowledge; a death does not <em>always </em>result from a beating.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">In any event, regardless of whether the majority opinion can be fairly read to employ a \u201cmay be\u201d or an \u201calways\u201d rationale, I cannot join today\u2019s decision. In my view, the majority\u2019s opinion is at odds with the way our law views criminal liability and disregards the trial court\u2019s factual findings that the death in this case was not the natural and probable consequence of the assistance defendant provided. In doing so, the majority\u2019s application of its interpretation of MCL 767.39 imprudently extends the scope of aider and abettor liability. Here, I believe that defendant\u2019s conduct was deplorable and criminal. And I agree with the majority that the facts of this case do not \u201cabsolve defendant from his criminal responsibility.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 12 n 30. But on the basis of the trial court\u2019s actual findings of fact, which are not clearly erroneous, I simply disagree that defendant is criminally responsible for second-degree murder under an aiding and abetting theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Additionally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s alternative basis for reversing the Court of Appeals judgment and reinstating defendant\u2019s conviction of second-degree murder under an aiding and abetting theory merely because defendant was found to have possessed a general intent to cause great bodily harm. For reasons similar to those noted earlier in this opinion, it is insufficient under MCL 767.39 to convict defendant of second-degree murder because <em>\u201c\\o]ne of </em>the potential consequences of causing great bodily harm is that the ultimate result <em>could be </em>the death of the victim.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 12 n 30 (emphasis added). Moreover, even though defendant was found to have possessed an intent to cause great bodily harm, the trial court\u2019s factual findings do not support defendant\u2019s conviction of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Granted, the malice requirement for second-degree murder is satisfied where the defendant has the intent to cause great bodily harm. <em>People v </em>Goecke, 457 Mich 442, 463-464; 579 NW2d 868 (1998). But, in light of the trial court\u2019s other findings of fact, causation has not been established in this case because the injuries inflicted with the intent to cause great bodily harm were not the cause of death. In other words, it is largely irrelevant that the trial court may have found that defendant generally had the intent to cause great bodily harm and that defendant\u2019s actions allowed Pannell to ultimately get the upper hand because the trial court also found that the assault with intent to cause great bodily harm did not result in injuries that caused death. As such, the trial court\u2019s latter finding fails to make the necessary criminal connection between the intent to cause great bodily harm and an act that effectuated that intent <em>and </em>caused the death. Again, I believe that defendant\u2019s conduct was deplorable and criminal. But the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous and, thus, require that defendant\u2019s second-degree murder conviction under an aiding and abetting theory be reversed. Thus, I disagree with the majority\u2019s alternative basis for reversing the Court of Appeals judgment as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In sum, because this death was not the natural and probable consequence of this beating and defendant\u2019s intent and actions did not criminally cause this death, defendant cannot be convicted of second-degree murder under an aiding and abetting theory. Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\"> MCL 767.39 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">Every person concerned in the commission of an offense, whether he directly commits the act constituting the offense or procures, counsels, aids, or abets in its commission may hereafter be prosecuted, indicted, tried and on conviction shall be punished as if he had directly committed such offense.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b94-7\">KELLY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah\">(dissenting).

There was no evidence establishing that Robinson was aware of or shared codefendant Pannell\u2019s intent to kill. Instead, the trial court\u2019s findings support only a conviction of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder. MCL 750.84.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">In fact, the trial judge\u2019s findings actually preclude Robinson\u2019s conviction of second-degree murder. One of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the judge\u2019s most pertinent determinations was that Robinson did not share or know of Pannell\u2019s intent to kill. In its 18-page opinion, the Court of Appeals thoroughly reviewed the judge\u2019s factual findings and correctly held that Robinson had been improperly convicted of second-degree murder. It observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">The judge\u2019s factual findings that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">\u2022 Robinson \u201cagreed\u201d and \u201cunderstood\u201d he was \u201conly there to beat up\u201d the victim, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">\u2022 the shooting \u201cwas beyond the scope of what [Robinson] had intended to have happen; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">\u2022 Robinson intended to inflict great bodily harm only, require that his conviction of second-degree murder, as an aider and abettor, be reversed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">The judge did not recognize that since the death of the victim did not result from injuries inflicted during the physical assault committed by Robinson with the intent .to inflict great bodily harm only, Robinson could not be found guilty of second-degree murder because the victim of the physical assault [as the judge put it] \u201chappened to die.\u201d Robinson could properly he [sic] convicted of second-degree murder as an aider and abettor only if he provided aid to Pannell in killing the victim with the intent to so aid Pannell in killing the victim, sharing or aware of Pannell\u2019s intent to kill. <em>[People v Robinson, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued April 29, 2004 (Docket No. 237036), slip op at 8, 14 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">This Court, like the Court of Appeals, should defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, setting them aside only if they are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">As the Court of Appeals observed, \u201cAnother finder of fact, a jury or another judge, might have assessed Robinson\u2019s credibility and the other evidence differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ently [finding sufficient evidence to support a conviction of second-degree murder].\u201d <em>Id., </em>slip op at 4.

Because Robinson did not share Pannell\u2019s intent to kill, he cannot be held answerable under the law for the fact that Pannell fatally shot the victim. The common enterprise was a beating. The fact that Pannell shot the victim, rather than beat him to death, is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The framework established by <em>Knapp </em>and <em>Chapman </em>continues to be sound law.

However, we went on to state:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">\u201cThe facts and circumstances involved in the perpetration of a felony <em>may </em>evidence an intent to kill, an intent to cause great bodily harm, or a wanton and willful disregard of the likelihood that the natural tendency of defendant\u2019s behavior is to cause death or great bodily harm; however, the conclusion must be left to the jury to infer from all the evidence. [Emphasis added. <em>Id., </em>pp 728-729.]\u201d <em>[Kelly, supra </em>at 272-273.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The finder of fact here concluded that defendant did not have the requisite intent to kill the victim. Absent proof of the requisite intent, defendant\u2019s conviction of second-degree murder must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">I agree with and completely support the Court of Appeals opinion in this matter. I would affirm the panel\u2019s decision to reverse Robinson\u2019s conviction of second-degree murder. I would reduce the charge of which Robinson was convicted to assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder and remand for resentencing on that reduced charge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\"> \u201cFacts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\u201d John Adams, \u201cArgument in Defense of the Soldiers in the Boston Massacre Trials,\u201d December 1770, quoted at The Quotations Page, &lt;http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/3235.html&gt; (accessed April 19, 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-10\"> See <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672; 299 NW2d 304 (1980), in which this Court abrogated the common-law felony-murder doctrine.
