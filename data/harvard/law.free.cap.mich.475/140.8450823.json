Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of one count of third-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520d(l)(b), and one count of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520e(l)(b). Defendant also pleaded guilty to a charge of being a third-offense habitual offender, MCL 769.11. The trial court sentenced defendant to a term of 127 to 360 months of incarceration on the third-degree criminal sexual conduct conviction. This range was calculated by the trial court\u2019s assignment of points to defendant\u2019s \u201coffense variable\u201d and \u201cprior record variable\u201d scores under a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard. Defendant appealed his sentence, asserting that it was imposed contrary to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v Washington, </em>542 US 296; 124 S Ct 2531; 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), because the sentence was based on facts that were not determined by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Claypool, </em>470 Mich 715, 730 n 14; 684 NW2d 278 (2004). Because we conclude that Michigan\u2019s sentencing scheme does not offend the Sixth Amendment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The victim in this case and defendant were coworkers. She testified that defendant sexually assaulted her on four separate occasions between July 17, 2002, and October 25, 2002. The first incident took place on July 17, when defendant asked the victim to assist him with his computer at his cubicle. While there, defendant grabbed her hand and placed it on his clothed penis. In addition, defendant rubbed her clothed breast. The second incident occurred on July 19 at about 2:00 p.m. At that time, defendant entered the victim\u2019s cubicle, again grabbed her hand and placed it over his penis, and made a sexual comment. The third incident occurred at around 4:00 p.m. on that same day. The victim testified that defendant accosted her in the parking garage and forced her into his car. Defendant demanded oral sex, and, when she refused, he grabbed the back of her head and forced her to perform oral sex until he ejaculated. The final incident took place on October 25 while the company was moving its office to a new location. As the victim moved things out of her cubicle, defendant entered, grabbed her hand and placed it over his penis, and made a sexual comment. The victim did not report any of these incidents until after defendant left the company. Defendant was prosecuted for one count of third-degree criminal sexual conduct and two counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. The jury convicted defendant of third-degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. Following the verdict, defendant pleaded guilty of being a third-offense habitual offender, MCL 769.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>At sentencing, the trial court scored ten points for offense variable 4 (psychological injury to a victim) and 15 points for offense variable 10 (exploitation of a vulnerable victim).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s total score placed him in the C-V cell,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the trial court sentenced him at the high end of the guidelines to a minimum term of 127 months and a maximum term of 360 months on the third-degree criminal sexual conduct conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant was also sentenced to a concurrent term of 12 to 48 months on the fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Defendant appealed, asserting that his minimum sentence violated the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely </em>because it was based on judicially ascertained facts that had not been determined by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Pursuant to Claypool, the Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence, observing that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to Michigan\u2019s sentencing scheme. <em>People v Drohan, </em>264 Mich App 77, 89 n 4; 689 NW2d 750 (2004).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>limited to the issue whether <em>Blakely </em>applies to Michigan\u2019s sentencing scheme. 472 Mich 881 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The issue in this case concerns whether Michigan\u2019s sentencing scheme violates the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution because it permits a defendant\u2019s minimum sentence to be determined on the basis of facts not proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. A Sixth Amendment challenge presents a question of constitutional law that we review de novo. <em>People v Nutt, </em>469 Mich 565, 573; 677 NW2d 1 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">IH. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">A. UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">The United States Supreme Court first addressed the Sixth Amendment implications of the enhancement of a defendant\u2019s sentence based on judicially ascertained facts in <em>McMillan v Pennsylvania, </em>477 US 79; 106 S Ct 2411; 91 L Ed 2d 67 (1986). <em>In McMillan, </em>a Pennsylvania statute imposed a five-year mandatory minimum sentence if the trial court concluded, by a preponder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>anee of the evidence, that a defendant \u201c \u2018visibly possessed a firearm\u2019 \u201d during the commission of an enumerated felony. <em>Id. </em>at 81. However, the sentencing statute did not permit a sentence in excess of the maximum established for the enumerated felonies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendants, relying on <em>In re Winship, </em>397 US 358; 90 S Ct 1068; 25 L Ed 2d 368 (1970),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> argued that the visible possession of a firearm constitutes an element of the offense, and, therefore, must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court, while noting that the Pennsylvania statute provided that the possession of a firearm was \u201cnot an element of the [enumerated] crimes,\u201d <em>McMillan, supra </em>at 85-86, opined that this provision did not \u201crelieve the prosecution of its burden of proving guilt. . ..\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87. Nonetheless, the Court found it significant that the statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">neither alters the maximum penalty for the crime committed nor creates a separate offense calling for a separate penalty; it operates solely to limit the sentencing court\u2019s discretion in selecting a penalty within the range already available to it without the special finding of visible possession of a firearm. <em>[Id. </em>at 87-88.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The Court went on to note that the defendants\u2019 claims \u201cwould have at least more superficial appeal if a finding of visible possession exposed them to greater or additional punishment. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88. However, the Pennsylvania statute merely raised the minimum sentence that could be imposed by the trial court. Because the minimum sentence did not alter the maximum penalty authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict, the statute did not violate the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">While <em>McMillan </em>sanctioned the use of judicially ascertained facts to establish a minimum sentence, the United States Supreme Court, <em>va. Jones v United States, </em>526 US 227, 239; 119 S Ct 1215; 143 L Ed 2d 311 (1999), stated that the use of such facts to <em>increase </em>the maximum sentence posed \u201c \u2018grave and doubtful constitutional questions ....\u2019\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>la Jones, </em>the defendant was convicted of violating the federal carjacking statute. The statute called for a 15-year maximum, but also provided for a 25-year maximum where the victim suffered serious bodily injury, and a potential life term where the victim was killed. 18 USC 2119. The trial court imposed a 25-year sentence, determining by a preponderance of the evidence that the victim had suffered \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d The defendant argued that the statute created three distinct offenses, while the prosecutor argued that the statute created a single crime with the choice of three maximum penalties. In analyzing which interpretation of the statute should prevail, the Court observed that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Because our prior cases suggest rather than establish this principle, our concern about the Gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>ernment\u2019s reading of the [carjacking] statute rises only to the level of doubt, not certainty. <em>[Jones, supra </em>at 243 n 6.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">As a result of these concerns, the Court held that the statute established three separate offenses and, therefore, reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The following year, in <em>Apprendi v New Jersey, </em>530 US 466; 120 S Ct 2348; 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), the United States Supreme Court acted on the concerns it had expressed in <em>Jones. </em>In <em>Apprendi, </em>the defendant was sentenced to an additional two years above the statutory maximum, on the basis of the trial court\u2019s determination by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had acted with an intent to intimidate an individual based on that individual\u2019s race. The Court undertook its analysis by noting that the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cdue process\u201d clause and the Sixth Amendment \u201cright to jury trial,\u201d considered together, \u201cindisputably entitle a criminal defendant to \u2018a jury determination that [he] is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477, quoting <em>United States v Gaudin, </em>515 US 506, 510; 115 S Ct 2310; 132 L Ed 2d 444 (1995). At the time of the American Revolution, a trial court had very little discretion in sentencing. <em>Apprendi, supra </em>at 479. Rather, there was generally a specific sanction for each criminal offense \u2014 a sanction determined by a jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>The Court explained that, during this period, where a statute created a higher degree of punishment than the common law, the prosecutor</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">\u201cmust expressly charge it to have been committed under those circumstances [established in the statute], and must state the circumstances with certainty and precision. [2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown *170].\u201d Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases, at 51. If, then, \u201cupon an indictment under the statute, the prosecutor prove the felony to have been committed, but fail in proving it to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>been committed under the circumstances specified in the statute, the defendant shall be convicted of the common-law felony only.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188. <em>[Apprendi, supra </em>at 480-481.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The 19th century shift away from fixed sentences gave trial courts increasingly broad discretion in sentencing. However, such discretion was limited by \u201c \u2018fixed statutory or constitutional limits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, quoting <em>Williams v New York, </em>337 US 241, 247; 69 S Ct 1079; 93 L Ed 1337 (1949). Thus, just as in revolutionary times, a defendant\u2019s maximum sentence was fixed by the maximum sentence permitted at the time of the jury\u2019s verdict. In contrast, the New Jersey statute permitted a trial court to sentence a defendant beyond the maximum fixed by the statute that served as the basis for the jury\u2019s conviction. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">If a defendant faces punishment beyond that provided by statute when an offense is committed under certain circumstances but not others, it is obvious that both the loss of liberty and the stigma attaching to the offense are heightened; it necessarily follows that the defendant should not \u2014 at the moment the State is put to proof of those circumstances \u2014 be deprived of protections that have, until that point, unquestionably attached. <em>[Apprendi, supra </em>at 484.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Accordingly, the Court held that under the Sixth Amendment, \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490. Thus, any fact that \u201cexpose[s] the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 494, is an element of the crime that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Conversely, a fact \u201cthat supports a specific sentence <em>within the range </em>authorized by the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant is guilty of a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>offense[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 494 n 19 (emphasis in the original), is a sentencing factor that does not implicate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">The United States Supreme Court reinforced this decision two years later, in <em>Harris v United States, </em>536 US 545; 122 S Ct 2406; 153 L Ed 2d 524 (2002). In <em>Harris, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty of distribution of marijuana. At sentencing, the trial court determined by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had brandished a firearm during the drug transaction and, as a result, imposed a seven-year minimum, as required under 18 USC 924 (c)(l)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court did not alter the defendant\u2019s maximum sentence. The defendant argued that, the imposition of a minimum sentence violated <em>Apprendi </em>and that, as a result, <em>McMillan </em>was no longer sound authority. Justice Kennedy, writing for a four-justice plurality, noted that the Sixth Amendment requires that \u201c \u2018any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris, supra </em>at 563, quoting <em>Apprendi, supra </em>at 490. However, once the defendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>been convicted of an offense, \u201cthe Government has been authorized to impose any sentence below the maximum.\u201d <em>Harris, supra </em>at 565. The defendant also argued that mandatory minimum sentences violated \u201cthe concerns underlying <em>Apprendi,\u201d id., </em>because they require a trial court to impose a sentence even if it would have otherwise chosen a lower sentence. However, Justice Kennedy noted that \u201c[t]he Fifth and Sixth Amendments ensure that the defendant \u2018will never get more punishment than he bargained for when he did the crime,\u2019 but they do not promise that he will receive \u2018anything less\u2019 than that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, quoting <em>Apprendi, supra </em>at 498 (Scalia, J, concurring) (emphasis omitted). Justice Kennedy concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">Read together, <em>McMillan </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>mean that those facts setting the outer limits of a sentence, and of the judicial power to impose it, are the elements of the crime for the purposes of the constitutional analysis. Within the range authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict, however, the political system may channel judicial discretion \u2014 and rely upon judicial expertise \u2014 by requiring defendants to serve minimum terms after judges make certain factual findings. <em>[Harris, supra </em>at 567.][<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The United States Supreme Court clarified the importance of the term \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>meaning of sentencing guidelines in <em>Blakely. </em>In that case, the defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of second-degree kidnapping. While the statute called for a ten-year maximum sentence, under Washington\u2019s sentencing guidelines scheme, the defendant was subject to a fixed sentence within a \u201cstandard range\u201d of between 49 to 53 months. The guidelines statute permitted a trial court to depart above the guidelines maximum, up to the statutory maximum of ten years, if it found \u201csubstantial and compelling\u201d reasons to do so. The trial court determined that the defendant acted with \u201cdeliberate cruelty\u201d and, therefore, sentenced him to 90 months \u2014 37 months beyond the standard maximum. The prosecutor argued that the sentence was consistent with <em>Apprendi </em>because it fell below the ten-year statutory maximum. However, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">[T]he \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the </em>defendant.... In other words, the relevant \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings. <em>[Blakely, supra </em>at 303-304 (emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The defendant\u2019s prior convictions and the facts elicited from his guilty plea, by themselves, could not have supported the imposition of the 90-month sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 304. Therefore, \u201cthe State\u2019s sentencing procedure did not comply with the Sixth Amendment, [and the defendant\u2019s] sentence is invalid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305. However, the Sixth Amendment does not prohibit all judicial fact-finding. In addressing indeterminate sentencing schemes,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>[T]he Sixth Amendment by its terms is not a limitation on judicial power, but a reservation of jury power. It limits judicial power only to the extent that the claimed judicial power infringes on the province of the jury. Indeterminate sentencing does not do so. It increases judicial discretion, to be sure, but not at the expense of the jury\u2019s traditional function of finding the facts essential to lawful imposition of the penalty. Of course indeterminate schemes involve judicial factfinding, in that a judge (like a parole board) may implicitly rule on those facts he deems important to the exercise of his sentencing discretion. But the facts do not pertain to whether the defendant has a legal <em>right </em>to a lesser sentence \u2014 and that makes all the difference insofar as judicial impingement upon the traditional role of the jury is concerned. In a system that says the judge may punish burglary with 10 to 40 years, every burglar knows he is risking 40 years in jail. In a system that punishes burglary with a 10-year sentence, with another 30 added for use of a gun, the burglar who enters a home unarmed is <em>entitled to </em>no more than a 10-year sentence \u2014 and by reason of the Sixth Amendment the facts bearing upon that entitlement must be found by a jury. <em>[Id. </em>at 308-309 (emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Last year, the United States Supreme Court applied the Sixth Amendment to the federal sentencing guidelines in <em>United States v Booker, </em>543 US 220; 125 S Ct 738; 160 L Ed 2d 621 (2005). In <em>Booker, </em>the defendant was convicted of possession with intent to distribute at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>least 50 grams of crack cocaine. The evidence elicited at trial established that he had possessed 92 grams of cocaine. The statute called for a minimum sentence of ten years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison. 21 USC 841 (b) (1) (A) (iii). On the basis of the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the quantity of drugs that the jury found that he possessed, the sentencing guidelines dictated a sentence of 210 to 262 months in prison. At sentencing, the trial court found two additional facts by a preponderance of evidence: (1) that the defendant had possessed an additional 566 grams of crack cocaine, and (2) that the defendant had also committed obstruction of justice. Those findings mandated that the trial court select a sentence between 360 months and life imprisonment, and the court imposed a sentence of 360 months in prison. Just as in <em>Blakely, </em>the Court focused on the mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines. <em>Booker, supra </em>at 749-750. Solely on the basis of the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the facts supported by the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial court could not have imposed the 360-month sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 751. The Court concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">just as in <em>Blakely, </em>\u201cthe jury\u2019s verdict alone does not authorize the sentence. The judge acquires that authority only upon finding some additional fact.\u201d There is no relevant distinction between the sentence imposed pursuant to the Washington statutes in <em>Blakely </em>and the sentences imposed pursuant to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in these cases. <em>[Id., </em>quoting <em>Blakely, supra </em>at 305 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Therefore, the Court \u201creaffirm[ed] [its] holding in <em>Apprendi: </em>Any fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>Booker, supra </em>at 756. However, just as in <em>Blakely, </em>the Court did not hold that <em>all </em>judicial fact-finding violates the Sixth Amendment. Indeed, the Court clarified that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">[i]f the Guidelines as currently written could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment. We have never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range.... For when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant. <em>[Id. </em>at 750.][<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The constitutional rule of <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker </em>can be summarized as follows: (1) a trial court may not impose a sentence greater than the statutory maximum unless it does so on the basis of a prior conviction or the fact at issue is \u201cadmitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt[,]\u201d <em>Booker, supra </em>at 756; (2) where a defendant\u2019s maximum sentence is calculated through the use of mandatory sentencing guidelines, the statutory maximum is the maximum sentence that may be imposed under those guidelines, based solely on the defendant\u2019s prior convictions and those facts proven beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Blakely, supra </em>at 303-304; and (3) a trial court <em>may </em>consider facts and circumstances not proven beyond a reasonable doubt in imposing a sentence within the statutory range, <em>McMillan, supra; Harris, supra; Booker, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>B. AFTERMATH</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">State courts, consistently with <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker, </em>have held that the Sixth Amendment bars the use of judicially ascertained facts to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence only when that sentence is increased beyond the \u201cstatutory maximum.\u201d For example, the New Jersey Supreme Court recognized in <em>State v Abdullah, </em>184 NJ 497; 878 A2d 746 (2005), that the applicability of <em>Blakely </em>hinges on the question whether the trial court uses judicially ascertained facts to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum. In <em>Abdullah, </em>the defendant was convicted of murder and two counts of second-degree burglary. The defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 30-year parole disqualifier on the murder conviction and to a consecutive ten-year prison term with a five-year parole dis-qualifier on the burglary convictions. Under New Jersey law, a defendant convicted of burglary is entitled to a presumptive sentence of seven years. <em>Id. </em>at 503. Because the defendant was entitled to no more than the seven-year sentence for burglary on the basis of the jury\u2019s verdict alone, imposition of the ten-year sentence on the basis of judicially ascertained facts was \u201c \u2018incompatible with the holdings in <em>[Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and Booker]. \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505 (citation omitted). On the other hand, the court noted that there is no presumptive term for murder. <em>Id. </em>at 504. \u201c \u2018[Bjecause the crime of murder has no presumptive term, defendant, like every murderer, knows he is risking life in prison.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508 (citation omitted). Thus, the upper sentencing limit based on the jury\u2019s verdict alone was life imprisonment. Accordingly, the murder sentence was not in derogation of the Sixth Amendment. See also <em>State v Stover, </em>140 Idaho 927, 931; 104 P3d 969 (2005) (stating that \u201c[t]he <em>Blakely </em>Court recognized that an indeterminate sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>fencing system does not violate the Sixth Amendment\u201d); <em>State v Rivera, </em>106 Hawaii 146, 157; 102 P3d 1044 (2004) (noting that \u201cthe <em>Blakely </em>majority\u2019s declaration that indeterminate sentencing does not abrogate the jury\u2019s traditional factfinding function effectively excises indeterminate sentencing schemes such as Hawaii\u2019s from the decision\u2019s sixth amendment analysis\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v Junta, </em>62 Mass App Ct 120, 129 n 11; 815 NE2d 254 (2004) (finding that \u201c[t]he recent United States Supreme Court decision in <em>[Blakely] </em>has no application here, as the Massachusetts sentencing scheme provides for indeterminate sentences\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The courts in Pennsylvania, a state with a sentencing scheme bearing a strong resemblance to Michigan\u2019s, have also held that the use of judicially ascertained facts to increase a defendant\u2019s minimum sentence is permitted by the Sixth Amendment. The Pennsylvania Superior Court addressed the implications of <em>Blakely </em>on its sentencing scheme in <em>Commonwealth v Smith, </em>863 A2d 1172 (Pa Super, 2004). In <em>Smith, </em>the defendant claimed that Pennsylvania\u2019s sentencing scheme violated <em>Blakely, </em>because it allowed a trial court to use judicially ascertained facts to increase the defendant\u2019s minimum sentence. The court rejected this claim, noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">Pennsylvania utilizes an indeterminate sentencing scheme with presumptive sentencing guidelines which limit the judge\u2019s discretion only concerning the minimum sentence. 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 9721; 204 Pa. Code \u00a7 303.9(h). The United States Supreme Court has previously determined that this system does not violate the Sixth Amendment so long as the enhanced minimum sentence is not beyond that authorized by the jury verdict. <em>[Harris, supra]. </em>Because of the link with the maximum sentence, enhanced minimum sentences, when enhanced by factors in the guidelines, are not beyond sentences authorized by the jury verdict. <em>[McMillan, supra,]. Blakely </em>is only implicated in Pennsylvania to the extent that an enhanced minimum term leads to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>longer period of incarceration by extending the date at which the defendant is eligible to be released. Yet, because there is no limit, other than the statutory maximum, on the maximum term a judge may set, and due to the discretion vested in the parole board, the Pennsylvania sentencing scheme and guidelines evade even these <em>Blakely </em>concerns. The <em>Blakely </em>Court, itself, noted that indeterminate guidelines do not increase judicial discretion \u201cat the expense of the jury\u2019s function of finding the facts essential to a lawful imposition of penalty,\u201d and judicial (or parole board) fact-finding does not infringe on a defendant\u2019s \u201clegal right to a lesser sentence.\u201d <em>Blakely [supra </em>at 309].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">Here, the trial court did not employ an enhancement provision based on a judicially determined fact, but instead, imposed its sentence pursuant to the discretion provided it under the sentencing code and the sentencing guidelines. The sentence was proper under the code and the guidelines, and the guidelines, themselves, are constitutional under <em>Blakely. [Smith, supra </em>at 1178-1179.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">C. MICHIGAN\u2019S SENTENCING SCHEME</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">This Court likewise has noted that the Sixth Amendment bars the use of judicially ascertained facts to increase a defendant\u2019s maximum sentence beyond that authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Claypool, supra </em>at 730 n 14. However, a defendant does not have a right to anything less than the maximum sentence authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict, and, therefore, judges may make certain factual findings to select a specific minimum sentence from within a defined range. <em>Blakely, supra </em>at 308-309. In <em>Claypool, supra </em>at 730 n 14, this Court noted that <em>Blakely </em>does not affect Michigan\u2019s sentencing scheme. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\"><em>Blakely </em>concerned the Washington state determinate sentencing system, which allowed a trial judge to elevate the maximum sentence permitted by law on the basis of facts not found by the jury but by the judge. Thus, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>judge in that case was required to set a fixed sentence imposed within a range determined by guidelines and was able to increase the maximum sentence on the basis of judicial fact-finding. This offended the Sixth Amendment, the United States Supreme Court concluded, because the facts that led to the sentence were not found by the jury. <em>Blakely, supra </em>at [305].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">Michigan, in contrast, has an indeterminate sentencing system in which the defendant is given a sentence with a minimum and a maximum. The maximum is not determined by the trial judge but is set by law. MCL 769.8. The minimum is based on guidelines ranges as discussed in the present case and in <em>[People v Babcock, </em>469 Mich 247; 666 NW2d 231 (2003)]. The trial judge sets the minimum but can never exceed the maximum (other than in the case of a habitual offender, which we need not consider because <em>Blakely </em>specifically excludes the fact of a previous conviction from its holding). Accordingly, the Michigan system is unaffected by the holding in <em>Blakely </em>that was designed to protect the defendant from a higher sentence based on facts not found by the jury in violation of the Sixth Amendment. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Having concluded that <em>Blakely </em>applies only to bar the use of judicially ascertained facts to impose a sentence beyond that permitted by the jury\u2019s verdict, we must next determine what constitutes the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d under Michigan\u2019s sentencing scheme. MCL 769.8(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">When a person is convicted for the first time for committing a felony and the punishment prescribed by law for that offense may be imprisonment in a state prison, the court imposing sentence shall not fix a definite term of imprisonment, but shall fix a minimum term, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. The maximum penalty provided by law shall be the maximum sentence in all cases except as provided in this chapter and shall be stated by the judge in imposing the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>In other words, in all but a few cases,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a sentence imposed in Michigan is an indeterminate sentence. The maximum sentence is not determined by the trial court, but rather is set by law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Michigan\u2019s sentencing guidelines, unlike the Washington guidelines at issue in <em>Blakely, </em>create a range within which the trial court must set the minimum sentence. However, a Michigan trial court may not impose a sentence greater than the statutory maximum. While a trial court may depart from the minimum guideline range on the basis of \u201csubstantial and compelling reason[s],\u201d MCL 769.34(3); <em>Babcock, supra </em>at 256-258, such departures, with one exception, are limited by statute to a minimum sentence that does not exceed \u201c <em>2h </em>of the statutory maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>mum sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> MCL 769.34(2)(b). Thus, the trial court\u2019s power to impose a sentence is always derived from the jury\u2019s verdict, because the \u201cmaximum-minimum\u201d sentence will always fall within the range authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Defendant asserts that the \u201cmaximum-minimum\u201d under the guidelines constitutes the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Blakely </em>purposes because a trial court is required to depart on the basis of a finding of aggravating factors that, as a practical matter, will subject the defendant to an increase in the actual time the defendant will be required to serve in prison. However, defendant\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with the nature of the protection afforded by the Sixth Amendment. At common law, a jury\u2019s verdict entitled a defendant to a determinate sentence. <em>Apprendi, supra. </em>During the 19th century, American courts began moving away from such sentencing by according trial courts the discretion to determine a defendant\u2019s sentence. However, this new discretion was limited by fixed statutory or constitutional limits. <em>Id. </em>In other words, while a trial court could impose a sentence <em>less than </em>the maximum authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>could not impose a sentence greater than that allowed by the statute that the defendant had been convicted of violating. In short, the Sixth Amendment ensures that a defendant will not be incarcerated for a term longer than that authorized by the jury upon a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the Sixth Amendment does not entitle a defendant to a sentence <em>below </em>that statutory maximum. <em>Apprendi, supra </em>at 498 (Sealia, J., concurring). Rather, under the Sixth Amendment, the jury effectively sets the outer limits of a sentence and the trial court is then permitted \u201cto exercise discretion \u2014 taking into consideration various factors relating both to offense and offender \u2014 in imposing a judgment within the range prescribed by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481 (emphasis omitted); <em>McMillan, supra; Harris, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">When defendant, a third-offense habitual offender, committed third-degree criminal sexual conduct, he did so knowing that he was risking 30 years in prison. When defendant was, in fact, sentenced to a maximum of 30 years in prison, he received all the protections he was entitled to under the Sixth Amendment. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in imposing a sentence greater than the \u201cmaximum-minimum,\u201d but within the range authorized by the verdict, fully complies with the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Finally, but not insignificantly, there is no guarantee that an incarcerated person will be released from prison after the person has completed his or her minimum sentence. Ultimately, the parole board retains the discretion to keep a person incarcerated up to the maximum sentence authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, because a Michigan defendant is always subject to serving the maximum sentence provided for in the statute that he or she was found to have violated, that maximum sentence constitutes the \u201cstatutory maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>mum\u201d as set forth in <em>Blakely. </em>Therefore, we reaffirm our statement from <em>Claypool, supra </em>at 730 n 14, that \u201cthe Michigan system is unaffected by the holding in <em>Blakely </em>that was designed to protect the defendant from a higher sentence based on facts not found by the jury in violation of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">We conclude that, under the Sixth Amendment, \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, supra </em>at 490. The statutory maximum constitutes \u201cthe maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury\u2019s verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>Blakely, supra </em>at 303 (emphasis omitted). Under Michigan\u2019s sentencing scheme, the maximum sentence that a trial court may impose on the basis of the jury\u2019s verdict is the statutory maximum. MCL 769.8(1). In other words, every defendant, as here, who commits third-degree criminal sexual conduct knows that he or she is risking 15 years in prison, assuming that he or she is not an habitual offender. MCL 750.520d(2). As long as the defendant receives a sentence within that statutory maximum, a trial court may utilize judicially ascertained facts to fashion a sentence within the range authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, we reaffirm our statement in <em>Claypool, </em>and affirm defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-8\">Taylor, C.J., and Corrigan and Young, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-5\"> The amicus curiae brief of the Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan at page 11 points out that the guidelines\u2019 \u201cintermediate sanctions\u201d establish fixed and determinate sentences.

Thus, the statutory maximum sentence of a defendant who is convicted of being an habitual offender is as provided in the habitual offender statute, rather than the statute he or she was convicted of offending. <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>specifically allow for an increase in a defendant\u2019s maximum sentence on the basis of \u201cthe fact of a prior conviction . . . .\u201d <em>Apprendi, supra </em>at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Further, we note that our holding in this case does not affect the ability of the trial court to impose a jail sentence and/or probation in lieu of a prison sentence where permitted by law. See, e.g., MCL 769.34(4)(c). Generally, the maximum term of probation is two years for a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor and five years for a defendant convicted of a felony. MCL 771.2(1).

We granted oral argument on the matter, limited to what effect, if any, the <em>Blakely </em>opinion has on Michigan\u2019s statutory sentencing guidelines. 472 Mich 881 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE DOES NOT INVOLVE AN INTERMEDIATE SANCTION CELL</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In his appeal in this Court, defendant claims that the trial court incorrectly scored OVs 4,10, and 12. But it is apparent that, however these OVs were scored, defendant\u2019s sentence would not have fallen within an intermediate sanction cell. With his PRV level of 20 points and an OV level of 25 points,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> defendant would have fallen into cell C-III, which, for a third-offense habitual offender, provides a range of 36 to 90 months. MCL 777.21(3)(b) and 777.63. A sentencing guidelines cell is an intermediate sanction cell only when the upper limit of the sentencing range is under 18 months. MCL 769.34(4)(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Even if defendant\u2019s PRV level were zero, his sentence would not fall within an intermediate sanction cell. Instead, it would fall into cell C-I. For a third-offense habitual offender, cell C-I sets a minimum sentence range of 24 to 60 months. Again, this exceeds the 18-month limit for an intermediate sanction cell. MCL 769.34(4) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The significance of the fact that defendant\u2019s sentence could not fall within an intermediate sanction cell is that the problem that arose in <em>McCuller </em>cannot occur here. The reason is that the guidelines dictate defendant\u2019s minimum sentence only. The judicial findings of fact used to score the challenged OVs did not change defendant\u2019s maximum sentence. As a consequence, no <em>Blakely </em>issue arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT\u2019S PRECEDENT REGARDING THE \u201cSTATUTORY MAXIMUM\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In <em>McMillan v </em>Pennsylvania,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of Pennsylvania\u2019s mandatory minimum sentencing act, 42 Pa Cons Stat 9712 (1982). It found that the act did not change the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>McMillan v Pennsylvania, 477 </em>US 79, 86-88; 106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>S Ct 2411; 91 L Ed 2d 67 (1986). It was careful to point out, however, that there are constitutional limits on how far a state may go in defining away the facts necessary to prove a criminal offense. Specifically, the Court relied on the fact that the Pennsylvania act did not increase the maximum penalty faced by a defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 87-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The Supreme Court expanded on this point in five subsequent cases: <em>Jones v United States,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> Apprendi v New </em>Jersey,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Ring v Arizona,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> Blakely, </em>and <em>United States v </em>Booker.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> I refer to these cases as \u201cthe <em>Blakely </em>cases.\u201d The <em>Blakely </em>cases focused primarily on the \u201cstatutory maximum.\u201d <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>made clear that this phrase did not refer to the absolute maximum sentence provided by statute. Instead, the Supreme Court defined the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d as the maximum sentence that can be imposed without any judicial fact-finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">Our precedents make clear, however, that the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. </em>In other words, the relevant \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings. When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts \u201cwhich the law makes essential to the punishment,\u201d and the judge exceeds his proper authority. <em>[Blakely v Washington, </em>542 US 296, 303-304; 124 S Ct 2531; 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004) (emphasis in original; citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The <em>Blakely </em>cases reiterated a central holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">Any fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>[United States v Booker, </em>543 US 220, 244; 125 S Ct 738; 160 L Ed 2d 621 (2005).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTERMEDIATE SANCTION CELLS AND NONINTERMEDIATE SANCTION CELLS</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">When a defendant is entitled to a sentence falling within an intermediate sanction cell, Michigan\u2019s sentencing guidelines establish the maximum sentence that the defendant may face. MCL 769.34(4)(a). That maximum is either the upper limit of the recommended minimum sentence range or 12 months in jail, whichever period is shorter. Under the guidelines, a trial court is required to impose this maximum sentence unless it articulates substantial and compelling reasons to depart upward. At that point, the sentencing process is no longer focused on the individual\u2019s minimum sentence. The court\u2019s attention centers on the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d discussed in the <em>Blakely </em>cases. This is because the intermediate sanction is the maximum sentence supported by the jury verdict and defendant\u2019s criminal history alone. <em>Blakely </em>holds that any judicial fact-finding that moves a defendant above this \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d violates the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>543 US 244; <em>Blakely, </em>542 US 303-304.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In cases involving nonintermediate sanction cells, such as Joseph Drohan\u2019s case, the sentencing guidelines set the minimum sentence. If the judge engages in judicial fact-finding to increase the minimum sentence, the defendant\u2019s maximum sentence will not be increased. Instead, the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Blakely </em>purposes is the maximum sentence set by the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>statute. The defendant\u2019s criminal history, admissions, and the jury\u2019s verdict alone allow the court to sentence a defendant to the maximum sentence allowed by law, regardless of any subsequent judicial fact-finding. And the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights are not implicated because all facts needed to support the maximum sentence were admitted by the defendant or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In cases like Drohan\u2019s, judicial fact-finding moves the minimum sentence within the preexisting range rather than increasing the potential maximum sentence. As the Supreme Court noted, this does not violate constitutional rights because \u201cit operates solely to limit the sentencing court\u2019s discretion in selecting a penalty within the range already available to it without the special finding[s.]\u201d <em>McMillan, </em>477 US 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Drohan\u2019s case serves to demonstrate this point of law. Drohan\u2019s criminal history, scored through the PRVs, did not place his sentence in an intermediate sanction cell. Hence, his \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d was never an intermediate sanction. Instead, his maximum sentence was the maximum penalty allowed by law, 30 years. The judicial fact-finding necessary to score OVs 4, 10, and 12 did not and could not change his maximum sentence. Therefore, defendant always knew his potential maximum sentence; it was the maximum penalty prescribed by law. Just as in <em>McMillan, </em>adjustments to the minimum sentence create no constitutional problems. <em>Id. </em>at 86-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Because Drohan\u2019s sentence does not raise a Sixth Amendment issue, it is constitutionally unobjectionable. Therefore, I concur in the decision to affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">THE INTERMEDIATE SANCTION CELL PROBLEM AND SOLUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">As shown above, and as I discussed in <em>McCuller, </em>the existence of intermediate sanction cells in Michigan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>sentencing guidelines creates a <em>Blakely </em>problem. The reason is that judicial fact-finding used to score the OVs or to depart from the intermediate sanction cells changes a defendant\u2019s \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d sentence. The change in the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d makes the sentence constitutionally infirm. Then, the question must be addressed whether the offending portions of the sentencing guidelines can be severed from the nonoffending portions. Such severance might be possible if the Legislature had intended the sentencing guidelines to function without intermediate sanction cells. But that was not its intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">I must reiterate my belief, as set forth in <em>McCuller, </em>that the offending sections cannot be severed. Nearly every class of felony involves intermediate sanction cells. In fact, only class A and M2 felonies do not. See MCL 777.61 to 777.69. Nearly evexy single felony could present a <em>Blakely </em>problem if the defendant has the coxrect number of PRV points. The comprehensiveness of the problem creates extreme entanglement.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">At the start of any jury trial, the participants will be uncertain which sentencing method will be appropriate if the defendant is convicted. They will not know whether judicial fact-finding will be required or permitted. And the prosecution will be uncertain of the entirety of the facts it must prove to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Moreover, the offending sections of the sentencing guidelines will be difficult to spot. For one defendant convicted of a crime, it would be appropriate to score the OVs. For another convicted of the same crime, it would be impermissible to score the OVs because that defendant\u2019s PRV level places him or her in an intermediate sanction cell. Such entanglement shows that severance is simply not feasible. <em>Blank v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>462 Mich 103, 123; 611 NW2d 530 (2000) (opinion by Kelly, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Also, it is unlikely that the Legislature would have enacted a noncomprehensive version of the guidelines. The Legislature intended the guidelines to be comprehensive. <em>People v Garza, </em>469 Mich 431, 434-435; 670 NW2d 662 (2003). Its specific goals were to eliminate sentencing disparity and ensure that certain crimes not warranting prison time result in jail sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 435. Severing the intermediate sanction cells from the sentencing guidelines would work counter to both goals. This demonstrates that severance is not appropriate. <em>People v McMurchy, </em>249 Mich 147, 157-159; 228 NW 723 (1930). Given that the offending sections cannot be severed, the guidelines as a whole must be found no longer valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">However, alternative solutions should be explored. For example, we could replace all judicial fact-finding with juxy determinations. The prosecution could include in its charges the specific facts needed to score relevant OVs. Then, in a bifurcated hearing, the prosecution could present evidence regarding each of them. The jury could deliberate and make specific findings. It could indicate which facts the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Because it would be the jury making the determinations, there would be no constitutional impediment to an OV score moving a defendant\u2019s sentence out of an intermediate sanction cell. See <em>McCuller, </em>475 Mich 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">This solution would ensure that the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the guidelines would be fulfilled. At the same time, it would allow defendants full Sixth Amendment protection by putting the prosecution to its proofs. Such a system would be compatible with the <em>Blakely </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\"><em>CLAYPOOL </em>HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The Court of Appeals specifically asked us to address whether <em>Claypool\u2019s </em>discussion of <em>Blakely </em>carries any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>precedential weight. In its decision, the majority implies that it does. I strongly disagree. The discussion of <em>Blakely </em>in <em>Claypool </em>was mere dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th ed) defines \u201cobiter dictum\u201d as: \u201cA judicial comment made during the course of delivering a judicial opinion, but one that is unnecessary to the decision in the case and therefore not precedential. . ..\u201d The reference to <em>Blakely </em>in <em>Claypool </em>was completely unnecessary to that decision. <em>Blakely </em>had nothing to do with the issue presented in <em>Claypool, </em>which the Court framed as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">whether it is permissible for Michigan trial judges, sentencing under the legislative sentencing guidelines pursuant to MCL 769.34, to consider, for the purpose of a downward departure from the guidelines range, police conduct that is described as sentencing manipulation, sentencing entrapment, or sentencing escalation. <em>[People v Claypool, </em>470 Mich 715, 718; 684 NW2d 278 (2004).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In fact, the majority opinion in <em>Claypool </em>notes the irrelevance of <em>Blakely </em>to the discussion: \u201cThe Chief Justice argues that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Blakely v Washington, </em>542 US [296]; 124 S Ct 2531; 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), affects this case. We disagree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730 n 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">As I noted at the time, <em>Blakely </em>was neither raised nor addressed by the parties. It was not germane to the discussion. <em>Id. </em>at 748 (KELLY, J. concurring in part and dissenting in part). Given this irrelevance, the discussion clearly falls under the dictionary definition of \u201cdicta.\u201d Such dicta lack the force of an adjudication and are not binding under the principles of stare decisis. <em>People v Borchard-Ruhland, </em>460 Mich 278, 286 n 4; 597 NW2d 1 (1999). It is erroneous for the majority to indicate that the <em>Blakely </em>discussion in <em>Claypool </em>has any precedential weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">I concur in the majority\u2019s decision that defendant\u2019s sentence does not offend the Sixth Amendment. But I believe that the Michigan sentencing guidelines do contain a constitutional flaw, which emerges whenever OV scores determined by judicial fact-finding remove a defendant from an intermediate sanction cell. Hence, for the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in McCuller,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> I would find Michigan\u2019s sentencing guidelines no longer constitutionally sound. Also, the majority\u2019s attempt to treat <em>Claypool\u2019s </em>discussion <em>o\u00ed Blakely </em>as precedentially binding is incorrect. <em>Claypool\u2019s </em>analysis of <em>Blakely </em>was simply dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">I would affirm defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\"> 542 US 296; 124 S Ct 2531; 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-9\"> 470 Mich 715; 684 NW2d 278 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\"> MCL 750.520d(l)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\"> MCL 750.520e(l)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\"> MCL 777.34, psychological injury to a victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b240-11\"> MCL 777.40, exploitation of a vulnerable victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b240-12\"> MCL 777.42, contemporaneous felonious criminal acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b240-13\"> MCL 777.43, continuing pattern of criminal behavior.
