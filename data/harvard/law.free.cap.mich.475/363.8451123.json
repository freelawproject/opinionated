In count I of their petition, petitioners claimed that the option violated the rights of the appellants\u2019 insureds. In count II of their petition, petitioners claimed a violation of the rights of chiropractic providers. Regarding count I, we hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>petitioners do not satisfy the test for third-party standing, and may not litigate the claims of appellants\u2019 insureds. Regarding count II, assuming arguendo that petitioners have standing to sue on behalf of their membership, petitioners have not established an actual or imminent injury. Thus, petitioners\u2019 claim is not ripe for judicial review. Therefore, we vacate the judgments of the circuit court and the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the Commissioner of the Office of Financial and Insurance Services (the Commissioner).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The appellant-insurers offer a \u201cPreferred Provider Option\u201d (PPO) to their no-fault automobile insurance policyholders, allowing their insureds to elect to limit their choice of medical care providers in the event they require personal injury protection (PIP) benefits. In exchange for reduced PIP premiums, insureds agree to receive treatment from a network of medical care providers maintained by Preferred Providers of Michigan (PPOM). In the event that a policyholder seeks treatment from a provider outside the PPOM network, the insured must pay a deductible, and provider reimbursement is limited to PPOM\u2019s customary reimbursement rate. The \u201cPreferred Provider Option\u201d is entirely voluntary; if policyholders do not opt for the endorsement, they do not receive the premium discount and are not limited to the PPOM network of providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Appellants began offering the discounted policy option in July 2000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In August 2000, petitioners filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>request with the Commissioner for a contested case hearing pursuant to MCL 500.2028 and MCL 500.2029, claiming that the PPO endorsement violated the Insurance Code, MCL 500.100 <em>et seq. </em>Petitioners asked the Commissioner to withdraw approval of the endorsement pursuant to MCL 500.2236(5) and to issue a cease and desist order to respondents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The Commissioner sought additional information from respondents and petitioners, which petitioners refused to supply. On the basis of the record established, the Commissioner rejected petitioners\u2019 request for a contested case hearing. The Commissioner concluded that the endorsement did not violate the no-fault act, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq. </em>Petitioners appealed to the circuit court, which reversed the decision of the Commissioner and held that the \u201cPreferred Provider Option\u201d was not authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court judgment, holding that respondents\u2019 PPO endorsement was inconsistent with the no-fault act and that the authority to issue the endorsement must emanate from the Legislature.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>We granted leave to appeal, directing the parties to address among the issues briefed whether petitioners had standing to challenge the Preferred Provider Option on behalf of appellants\u2019 insureds and chiropractic providers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Whether a party has standing is a question of law that we review de novo.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, questions of justiciability implicate constitutional separation of powers principles.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Constitutional questions are likewise reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AUZ\">a. JUSTICIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Our tripartite system of government is constitutionally established in both our state and federal constitutions. US Const, art III, \u00a7 1 confers upon the courts only \u201cjudicial power\u201d; US Const, art III, \u00a7 2 limits the judicial power to \u201c[c]ases\u201d and \u201c[c]ontroversies.\u201d Similarly, our state constitution, Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">The powers of government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided in this constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The powers of each branch are outlined in the Michigan Constitution, which assigns to the Legislature the task of exercising the \u201clegislative power,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Governor the task of exercising the \u201cexecutive power,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the judiciary the task of exercising the \u201cjudicial power.\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, </em>this Court described and defined the Court\u2019s constitutionally assigned \u201cjudicial power\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">The \u201cjudicial power\u201d has traditionally been defined by a combination of considerations: the existence of a real dispute, or case or controversy; the avoidance of deciding hypothetical questions; the plaintiff who has suffered real harm; the existence of genuinely adverse parties; the sufficient ripeness or maturity of a case; the eschewing of cases that are moot at any stage of their litigation; the ability to issue proper forms of effective relief to a party; the avoidance of political questions or other non-justiciable controversies; the avoidance of unnecessary constitutional issues; and the emphasis upon proscriptive as opposed to prescriptive decision making. [471 Mich 614-615.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In seeking to make certain that the judiciary does not usurp the power of coordinate branches of government, and exercises only \u201cjudicial power,\u201d both this Court and the federal courts have developed justiciability doctrines to ensure that cases before the courts are appropriate for judicial action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These include the doctrines of stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ing,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> ripeness,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and mootness.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Federal courts have held that doctrines such as standing and mootness are constitutionally derived and jurisdictional in nature, because failure to satisfy their elements implicates the court\u2019s constitutional authority to exercise only \u201cjudicial power\u201d and adjudicate only actual cases or controversies.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because these doctrines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>are jurisdictional in nature, they may be raised at any time and may not be waived by the parties.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Likewise, our case law has also viewed the doctrines of justiciability as affecting \u201cjudicial power,\u201d the absence of which renders the judiciary constitutionally powerless to adjudicate the claim.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This is a point made in <em>Anway v Grand Rapids R Co:</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">\u201cThe duty of this court, as of every judicial tribunal, is limited to determining rights of persons or of property, which are actually controverted in the particular case before it. When, in determining such rights, it becomes necessary to give an opinion upon a question of law, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>opinion may have weight as a precedent for future decisions. But the court is not empowered to decide moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare, for the government of future cases, principles or rules of law which cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue in the case before it. No stipulation of parties or counsel, whether in the case before the court or in any other case, can enlarge the power, or affect the duty, of the court in this regard.\u201d [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Similarly, in <em>Novi v Robert Adell Children\u2019s Funded Trust,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">Where the facts of a case make clear that a litigated issue has become moot, a court is, of course, bound to take note of such fact and dismiss the suit, even if the parties do not present the issue of mootness. \u201c 1 \u201cCourts are bound to take notice of the limits of their authority, and a court may, and should, on its own motion, though the question is not raised by the pleadings or by counsel, recognize its lack of jurisdiction and act accordingly by staying proceedings, dismissing the action, or otherwise disposing thereof, at any stage of the proceeding.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Because \u201c \u2018[t]he judicial power... is the right to determine actual controversies arising between adverse litigants,\u2019 \u201d a court hearing a case in which mootness has become apparent would lack the power to hear the suit. [Citations omitted.][<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Because \u201cthe most critical element\u201d of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d requires that a case contain a genuine controversy between the parties,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we must ensure that one exists before exercising our judicial authority. The judiciary arrogates to itself the powers of the executive and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>legislative branches whenever it acts outside the constitutional confines of \u201cjudicial power.\u201d Fidelity to our constitutional structure compels this Court to be \u201cvigilant in preventing the judiciary from usurping the powers of the political branches.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, we reiterate that questions of justiciability concern the judiciary\u2019s <em>constitutional jurisdiction </em>to adjudicate cases containing a genuine controversy.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Questions of justiciability may be raised at any stage in the proceedings, even sua sponte, and may not be waived by the parties.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Where a lower court has erroneously exercised its judicial power, an appellate court has \u201cjurisdiction on appeal, not of the merits but merely for the purpose of correcting the error of the lower court in entertaining the suit.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>b. THIRD-PARTY STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\">In count I of their amended petition, petitioners challenge appellants\u2019 policy endorsement as violating the rights of appellants\u2019 insureds. Thus, count I of the petition concerns third-party standing \u2014 whether petitioners may litigate to vindicate the rights of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">The general rule is that a litigant cannot vindicate the rights of a third party.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The rule disfavoring <em>jus tertii </em>\u2014 litigating the rights of a third party \u2014 \u201cassumes that the party with the right has the appropriate incentive to challenge (or not challenge) governmental action and to do so with the necessary zeal and appropriate presentation.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Furthermore, this rule reflects a \u201chealthy concern\u201d that if the claim is brought by a third party, \u201cthe courts might be \u2018called upon to decide abstract questions of wide public significance even though other governmental institutions may be more competent to address the questions and even though judicial intervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">As is often the case with general rules, there are recognized exceptions. While third-party standing is generally disfavored, federal jurisprudence has permitted, under certain limited circumstances, a litigant to assert the rights of another. In addition to requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>that the litigant establish standing,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the litigant must also make two additional showings. First, the litigant must have a sufficiently \u201cclose relation to the third party.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Second, \u201cthere must exist some hindrance to the third party\u2019s ability to protect his or her own interests.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Michigan\u2019s third-party standing jurisprudence is considerably less developed. In <em>Mary v </em>Lewis,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> a garnishee defendant challenged the constitutionality of a codefendant\u2019s prejudgment garnishment. This Court discussed and denied third-party standing to the defendant after discussing factors from a United States Supreme Court <em>dissenting </em>opinion:<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">As a general rule, one party may not raise the denial of another person\u2019s constitutional rights... . Defendant quotes portions of Justice Brennan\u2019s dissent in <em>Village of Belle Terre v Boraas, </em>416 US 1; 94 S Ct 1536; 39 L Ed 2d 797 (1974), where two exceptions to this general rule are discussed: first, those situations where there is evidence that the direct consequence of the denial of the constitutional rights of the other would impose substantial economic injury upon the party asserting the right; second, those instances where the litigant\u2019s interest and the other\u2019s interest intertwine and the latter\u2019s rights may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>effectively vindicated in any other manner because they are capable of evading constitutional review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">In this case the bank does not show how it qualifies under either of these exceptions.... We therefore conclude that the bank has no standing to interpose the due process rights of the principal defendant regarding the prejudgment garnishment. [399 Mich at 416.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Thus, the <em>Mary </em>Court would permit <em>jus tertii </em>where a litigant could establish an economic injury, show that the interests between the litigant and the party possessing the right \u201cintertwine,\u201d and show that the third party\u2019s rights \u201care capable of evading constitutional review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In our judgment, the test utilized by the <em>Mary </em>Court is analytically deficient. Requiring that a litigant establish an injury, economic or otherwise, is merely a component of our traditional standing doctrine.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Moreover, that the litigant and the third party have \u201cintertwining interests\u201d does not lead to the inference that the party establishing <em>jus tertii </em>will be an ardent proponent of the rights of the third party. The third factor is the most curious, for whether a claim is capable of evading review is a consideration that is recognized as relevant to mootness, not standing.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Accordingly, we adopt the traditional federal test for third-party standing as articulated in <em>Tesmer. </em>A party seeking to litigate the claims of another must, as an initial matter, establish standing under the test established in <em>Lee, supra </em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Second, the party must have a \u201cclose relationship\u201d with the party possessing the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>in order to establish third-party standing. Last, the litigant must establish that there is a \u201chindrance\u201d to the third party\u2019s ability to protect his or her own interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">As applied to the facts of this case, petitioners cannot meet the requirements of third-party standing and cannot litigate the rights of appellants\u2019 insureds. Assuming arguendo that petitioners could satisfy the <em>Lee </em>elements,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and assuming without deciding that petitioners share a sufficiently \u201cclose relationship\u201d with appellants\u2019 insureds,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> there is absolutely no evidence that any obstacle or hindrance prevents appellants\u2019 insureds from protecting their own interests through litigation. Therefore, we hold that petitioners do not have standing to assert that the rights of appellants\u2019 insureds were violated by appellants\u2019 managed care endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">c. RIPENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The doctrine of ripeness is closely related to the doctrine of standing, as both justiciability doctrines assess pending claims for the presence of an actual or imminent injury in fact.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> However, standing and ripe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ness address different underlying concerns.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The doctrine of standing is designed to determine whether a particular party may properly litigate the asserted claim for relief.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The doctrine of ripeness, on the other hand, does not focus on the suitability of the party; rather, ripeness focuses on the <em>timing </em>of the action.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Count II of the petitioners\u2019 petition asserts that appellants\u2019 managed care option violates the rights of chiropractic providers, including petitioners\u2019 membership. As a nonprofit organization, petitioners have standing to litigate on behalf of their members to the degree that their members would have standing as individual plaintiffs.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The petition asserts that provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ers \u201care entitled to be paid their reasonable and customary charge,\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> but significantly, appellees assert as their injury that appellants\u2019 policy endorsement violates MCL 500.3157 by reimbursing providers at a rate less than their <em>customary charged.</em><footnotemark><em>46</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Review of the record in this case reveals no evidence that any of petitioners\u2019 members have experienced an actual injury as a result of appellants\u2019 policy endorsement. Because petitioners seek relief for a hypothetical injury, the ripeness of the claim comes into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The ripeness doctrine is supported by both constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>tional and prudential principles.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> As a threshold matter, the Michigan Constitution permits the judiciary to exercise only \u201cjudicial power,\u201d the \u201cmost critical element\u201d of which is the requirement that a genuine controversy exist between the parties.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> A claim lacks ripeness, and there is no justiciable controversy, where \u201cthe harm asserted has [not] matured sufficiently to warrant judicial intervention ... .\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Petitioners\u2019 allegation that appellants\u2019 policy endorsement violates the rights of their members in violation of MCL 500.3157 is not yet ripe for review. Nothing in the record before us indicates that petitioners\u2019 members have in fact been reimbursed at less than a reasonable amount. The lack of ripeness is further buttressed by the particularly fact-intensive nature of petitioners\u2019 claim. MCL 500.3157 provides that chiropractors \u201cmay charge a reasonable amount\u201d for services rendered. Petitioners have the burden of establishing the reasonableness of their members\u2019 charges in order to impose liability on the insurer.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Moreover, questions surrounding the reasonableness of petitioners\u2019 members\u2019 charges are factual in nature and must be resolved by the jury.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Because the record is completely devoid of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>any facts supporting an actual or imminent injury in fact, we conclude that petitioners\u2019 claim is not ripe for review at this juncture and is not justiciable.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Issues of justiciability concern the judiciary\u2019s constitutionally delineated jurisdiction to exercise only \u201cjudicial power\u201d and hear only cases involving an actual controversy. Therefore, questions of justiciability may be raised at any stage in the proceedings and may not be waived by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Regarding count I, we hold that petitioners do not satisfy the test for third-party standing, and may not litigate on behalf of appellants\u2019 insureds. In count II, petitioners assert the rights of their members. Assuming that petitioners could otherwise litigate the claims of their members, petitioners have not established an actual or imminent injury; thus, the claim is not ripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">We therefore vacate the judgments of the circuit court and the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<judges id=\"b456-9\">Taylor, C. J., and Corrigan, J., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> Because we dispose of this case on the basis of standing and ripeness, we do not address the substantive merits of appellants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\"> The policy option was deemed approved after the Commissioner failed to act within 30 days after the endorsement was submitted for approval pursuant to MCL 500.2236(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\"> Petitioners\u2019 amended petition contained four counts; however, only the two counts referenced above are relevant to this appeal. As noted, count I alleged that the endorsement violated the rights of insureds and count II alleged that the endorsement violated the rights of chiropractic providers. Count III alleged that the $500 deductible imposed when a policyholder sought treatment from a nonnetwork provider was a penalty, which \u201cpotentially imposes a tremendous hardship on insureds.\u201d However, following an adverse decision by the Commissioner, petitioners did not seek review of count III in the circuit court. Count IV challenged appellants\u2019 refusal to pay for chiropractic care in favor of allegedly comparable care provided by osteopathic physicians.

Relying on <em>Nat\u2019l </em>Wildlife, the same majority narrowed who qualifies as an \u201caggrieved party\u201d for the purpose of invoking the appellate jurisdiction of this Court in <em>Federated Ins Co v Oakland Co Rd Comm, </em>475 Mich 286; 715 NW2d 846 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The majority now compounds these errors by transforming the prudential doctrines of mootness<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ripeness<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> into constitutionally based doctrines that affect the jurisdiction of the Court. See <em>ante </em>at 370-374.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">When the mootness and ripeness doctrines are viewed as prudential limits, a state court has <em>discretion </em>in applying those doctrines. By contrast, the \u201ccase or controversy\u201d clause in US Const, art III, \u00a7 2 <em>requires </em>federal courts to dismiss cases that are moot or not ripe. By transforming the doctrines of mootness and ripeness into constitutional requirements, the majority requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>these doctrines to be treated as jurisdictional issues by the Michigan state courts as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">The majority states, albeit in dicta, that the mootness doctrine is a justiciability doctrine that concerns the judiciary\u2019s constitutional jurisdiction to adjudicate cases. <em>Ante </em>at 370-371, 374. But shifting mootness from a prudential doctrine to a constitutional doctrine conflicts with this Court\u2019s most recent decisions concerning mootness. In both <em>In re Midland Publishing Co, Inc, </em>420 Mich 148, 151 n 2; 362 NW2d 580 (1984), and <em>Federated Publications, Inc v City of Lansing, </em>467 Mich 98; 649 NW2d 383 (2002), the Court cited the venerable rule that the Court will not decide moot issues unless the issue is one of public significance that is likely to recur, yet may evade judicial review. However, if the mootness doctrine is one that affects the Court\u2019s constitutional jurisdiction, then the Court could not decide a moot issue, regardless of how significant it may be to the public, nor how likely it would be to recur and evade judicial review. See <em>Honig v Doe, </em>484 US 305, 330; 108 S Ct 592; 98 L Ed 2d 686 (1988) (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring) (\u201cIf it were indeed Art. Ill which \u2014 by reason of its requirement of a case or controversy for the exercise of federal judicial power \u2014 underlies the mootness doctrine, the \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019 exception relied upon by the Court in this case would be incomprehensible. Article III extends the judicial power of the United States only to cases and controversies; it does not except from this requirement other lawsuits which are \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">The majority asserts that the ripeness doctrine \u201cis supported by both constitutional and prudential principles.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 380-381. In the <em>federal </em>courts the ripeness doctrine is based on both art III \u201ccase or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>controversy\u201d limitations on judicial power and on prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction. <em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, </em>419 US 102, 138; 95 S Ct 335; 42 L Ed 2d 320 (1974). But, as I explained in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, </em>the federal constitution\u2019s art III, \u00a7 2 limitations apply to the federal court\u2019s judicial power; they do not apply to the power of Michigan\u2019s state courts. <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, supra </em>at 660-661 (WEAVER, J., concurring in result only). Thus, while the federal court\u2019s ripeness doctrine involves both the \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement of art III, \u00a7 2 of the federal constitution and prudential concerns, <em>Duke Power Co v Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc, </em>438 US 59, 81-82; 98 S Ct 2620; 57 L Ed 2d 595 (1978), Michigan\u2019s courts need only consider prudential concerns. Further, for the same reasons explained above, holding that the ripeness doctrine is based on constitutional grounds is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s recognition that a showing of futility may trigger an exception to the ripeness doctrine. See <em>Paragon Properties Co v City of Novi, </em>452 Mich 568, 581-583; 550 NW2d 772 (1996) (considering, but rejecting, the futility argument), and <em>Lucas v South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 US 1003, 1014 n 3; 112 S Ct 2886; 120 L Ed 2d 798 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">For these reasons I concur only in the result of the majority opinion, and dissent from the majority\u2019s reasoning and analysis that mistakenly transforms the prudential doctrines of mootness and ripeness into constitutionally based doctrines that affect the jurisdiction of the Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\"> \u201cGenerally, an action is considered \u2018moot\u2019 when it no longer presents a justiciable controversy because issues involved have become academic or dead.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 1008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\"> Ripeness refers to the threshold conditions that must exist before a dispute is sufficiently mature to enable a court to decide it on the merits.

Because I would order additional briefing and reargument on these questions, I cannot join in the lead opinion\u2019s analysis and results with respect to count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Intervening respondents Farmers Insurance Exchange and Mid-Century Insurance Company offered an endorsement to their no-fault automobile policies in which insureds agreed to accept medical care from a network of preferred provider organizations (PPOs) in exchange for a 40 percent discount in their premiums. Petitioners Michigan Chiropractic Council and Michigan Chiropractic Society filed a request with respondent Commissioner of the Office of Financial and Insurance Services to conduct a contested-case hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>and invalidate the endorsement as being contrary to the no-fault act, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The commissioner concluded that there was nothing improper about the endorsement and declined to conduct a hearing. Included in the commissioner\u2019s written order were findings of fact and conclusions of law addressing several of petitioners\u2019 arguments. With respect to petitioners\u2019 claim that the endorsement violated the rights of the insureds (count I), the commissioner concluded that the endorsement was not inherently inconsistent with MCL 500.3107 (setting forth the type of benefits a no-fault insurer is liable for under the act). With respect to petitioners\u2019 claim that the endorsement violated the rights of medical providers (count II), the commissioner concluded that nothing in the no-fault act, including MCL 500.3157 (detailing allowable provider charges), conferred the right on any provider to be chosen to provide care, that nothing in the endorsement conflicted with the requirement that no-fault insurers pay reasonable and customary charges, and that the endorsement did not unreasonably or deceptively affect the risk purportedly assumed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The trial court reversed the commissioner, ruling that the endorsement was inconsistent with the no-fault act, and the Court of Appeals affirmed in a published opinion. <em>Mich Chiropractic Council v Comm\u2019r of the Office of Financial and Ins Services, </em>262 Mich App 228; 685 NW2d 428 (2004). The Court of Appeals concluded that the PPO option violated the no-fault act because it (1) limited an insured\u2019s choice of medical providers and (2) could mislead consumers about the potential savings to be achieved in selecting this option.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>We granted leave to appeal, directing the parties to include among the issues to be addressed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">(1) whether an optional managed care endorsement such as that offered by intervenors is permissible under the no-fault act, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq., </em>(2) whether the Court of Appeals erred in relying on its finding that the endorsement is potentially deceptive and misleading, (3) whether petitioners have standing to bring their petition, in light of some number of their members having participated in the managed care program, or any other reason affecting standing, and whether petitioners have standing with regard to all or only some of the counts in their petition, and (4) the standard of review to be applied by the circuit court to the administrative decision denying the petition. [472 Mich 899 (2005).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Whether a party has standing and whether a dispute falls within the scope of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d are constitutional questions, which we review de novo. <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, </em>471 Mich 608, 612; 684 NW2d 800 (2004); <em>Warda v Flushing City Council, </em>472 Mich 326, 330; 696 NW2d 671 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The lead opinion focuses on justiciability inquiries usually raised in the context of questions regarding the scope of this Court\u2019s \u201cjudicial power.\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1. As noted by the lead opinion, whether the resolution of a case is within the \u201cjudicial power\u201d is usually the dispositive inquiry with respect to whether this Court possesses jurisdiction over a claim, i.e., whether the claim is justiciable. <em>Ante </em>at 373-374. The \u201cjudicial power\u201d is traditionally understood as the authority of the courts to adjudicate cases or controversies of, and to provide meaningful relief to, parties who have a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>crete and present interest in the outcome of a dispute. See <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation, supra </em>at 614-615.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">However, while most matters cognizable by this Court fall within this traditional scope of the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d our jurisdiction is not always so defined. In certain instances, the Michigan Constitution specifically permits or requires the judiciary to take cognizance of actions that fall outside the traditional understanding of the \u201cjudicial power.\u201d For instance, Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 8 permits this Court to render advisory opinions \u201cas to the constitutionality of legislation after it has been enacted into law hut before its effective date.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>In re Request for Advisory Opinion On Constitutionality of 2005 PA 71, </em>474 Mich 1230 (2006); <em>Advisory Opinion on Constitutionality of 1986 PA 281, </em>430 Mich 93; 422 NW2d 186 (1988); see also <em>In re Certified Question (Melton v Prime Ins Syndicate, Inc), </em>472 Mich 1225 (2005). Although an advisory opinion is outside the scope of the traditional \u201cjudicial power,\u201d because there is no present case or controversy, this does not preclude us from entertaining such a case in light of the language of our Constitution effectively redefining the \u201cjudicial power\u201d in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">With this in mind, I believe that significant questions arise with respect to whether the judiciary can\u2014 or must\u2014 take cognizance of the petitioners\u2019 claims under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28, which, at least on its face, does not seem to require that we engage in the usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>justiciability inquiries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">All final decisions, findings, rulings and orders of any administrative officer or agency existing under the constitution or by law, which are judicial or quasi-judicial and affect private rights or licenses, shall be subject to direct review by the courts as provided by law. This review shall include, as a minimum, the determination whether such final decisions, findings, rulings and orders are authorized by law; and, in cases in which a hearing is required, whether the same are supported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d indicates a mandatory and imperative directive. <em>Burton v Reed City Hosp Corp, </em>471 Mich 745, 752; 691 NW2d 424 (2005). What is \u201cprovided by law\u201d under the Insurance Code is that final decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>will be subject to judicial review under Michigan\u2019s Administrative Procedures Act (APA), MCL 24.201 <em>et </em>seq.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">A person aggrieved by a final order, decision, finding, ruling, opinion, rule, action, or inaction provided for under this act may seek judicial review in the manner provided for in chapter 6 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.301 to 24.306. [MCL 500.244(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The APA, in turn, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">[w]hen a person has exhausted all administrative remedies available within an agency, and is aggrieved by a final decision or order in a contested case, whether such decision or order is affirmative or negative in form, the decision or order is subject to direct review, by the courts as provided by law. Exhaustion of administrative remedies does not require the filing of a motion or application for rehearing or reconsideration unless the agency rules require the filing before judicial review is sought. A preliminary, procedural or intermediate agency action or ruling is not immediately reviewable, except that the court may grant leave for review of such action if review of the agency\u2019s final decision or order would not provide an adequate remedy. [MCL 24.301.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Here, the commissioner denied petitioners\u2019 request for a contested-case hearing, finding that they had failed to demonstrate probable cause in support of their request. However, rather than simply declining to hold a hearing, the commissioner proceeded to conclude, as a matter of law, that respondents\u2019 PPO option did not violate the Insurance Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>It seems reasonably clear that the commissioner\u2019s order here constituted a \u201cfinal order, decision, finding, ruling, opinion, rule, action, or inaction,\u201d MCL 500.244(1), and fell within the scope of \u201cfinal decisions, findings, rulings and orders of any administrative officer or agency. . . .\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28. Given that the commissioner\u2019s order contained findings of fact and conclusions of law, it also seems fair to characterize this order as \u201cjudicial or quasi-judicial\u201d in nature. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In light of the foregoing then, a number of questions arise:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">(1) Does the fact that we are dealing with a \u201cfinal decision^ ... of [an] administrative officer or agency,\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28, authorize judicial review of the commissioner\u2019s order independently of the justiciability inquiry required for cases traditionally heard pursuant to the \u201cjudicial power\u201d? In other words, <em>may </em>this Court take cognizance of petitioners\u2019 claims by virtue of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28 and the APA, without regard to whether these claims are ripe and without regard to whether the parties have <em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>standing? Indeed, <em>must </em>we take cognizance of these claims? Moreover, if Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1 <em>does </em>require the judiciary to consider a case such as the instant one, does this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>raise the concern that traditional requirements of standing can be circumvented by the mere tactic of first introducing a dispute into the administrative process? Would, for example, the <em>brother </em>of a chiropractor who challenged the administrative rule at issue in this case be equally empowered upon an adverse decision by the commissioner to pursue a judicial appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">(2) Notwithstanding Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28, to what extent, if any, is the commissioner\u2019s decision subject to judicial review? In addition to presenting a significant issue concerning the relationship between an administrative agency and the judicial branch of government, this case presents a significant issue concerning the relationship between an administrative agency and the legislative branch of government, namely, whether the Legislature intended that the commissioner\u2019s decision to hold a contested-case hearing, or not, constitutes an entirely discretionary and unreviewable decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">It could be argued, perhaps, that, even if we concluded that petitioners had satisfied justiciability requirements, petitioners would still lack a remedy because the only remedy this Court could conceivably provide would be to order the commissioner to hold a contested-case hearing. However, on initial review, even that relief may be unavailable because the commissioner\u2019s decision whether to hold a contested-case hearing would seem to be a discretionary one under MCL 500.2028 and MCL 500.2029, which provide, respectively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">Upon <em>probable cause, </em>the commissioner shall have power to examine and investigate into the affairs of a person engaged in the business of insurance in this state to determine whether the person has been or is engaged in any unfair method of competition or in any unfair or deceptive act or practice prohibited by sections 2001 to 2050. [MCL 500.2028 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>When the commissioner has <em>probable cause </em>to believe that a person engaged in the business of insurance has been engaged or is engaging in this state in an unfair method of competition, or an unfair or deceptive act or practice in the conduct of his business, as prohibited by sections 2001 to 2050, and that a hearing by the commissioner in respect thereto would be in the interest of the public, he shall first give notice in writing, pursuant to Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, as amended, being sections 24.201 to 24.315 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, to the person involved, setting forth the general nature of the complaint against him and the proceedings contemplated pursuant to sections 2001 and 2050. [MCL 500.2029 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The \u201cnondelegation doctrine\u201d forbids the delegation of legislative powers to the executive or judicial branches. <em>Taylor v Gate Pharmaceuticals, </em>468 Mich 1, 8 n 5; 658 NW2d 127 (2003).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A delegation of power to an administrative agency is proper only when the controlling statute provides the agency with sufficient standards to effectively transform an administrative agency\u2019s decision from a legislative decision into an executive decision. <em>Taylor, supra </em>at 10 n 9; <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>Turmon, </em>417 Mich 638, 641-642, 644; 340 NW2d 620 (1983). If there are no such standards, the delegation is improper because the Legislature\u2019s powers have been improperly given to an agency of the executive branch. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan v Governor, </em>422 Mich 1, 53-55; 367 NW2d 1 (1985). In evaluating the sufficiency of legislative standards set forth in an act delegating power to an agency, we presume that the act is constitutional. <em>Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources v Seaman, </em>396 Mich 299, 309; 240 NW2d 206 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">MCL 500.2028 and MCL 500.2029 suggest that the commissioner need not hold a hearing except on \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that unfair practices have occurred or are occurring. Thus, it seems that the commissioner\u2019s determination of probable cause is the critical event. We noted in <em>Warda, supra </em>at 334, that the courts have no authority to compel an actor belonging to another branch of government to undertake a decision or determination when such decision or determination is purely discretionary. The question naturally arises: Does the commissioner\u2019s probable cause determination constitute a purely discretionary determination? Or has the Legislature provided, either explicitly or implicitly, any standards to guide this determination?</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In <em>Warda, </em>we addressed the obligation of a city council (a legislative entity) to reimburse a police officer for legal fees incurred in defending himself against criminal charges. The officer sought, and the city council denied, reimbursement pursuant to MCL 691.1408(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">When a criminal action is commenced against an officer or employee of a governmental agency based upon the conduct of the officer or employee in the course of employment, if the employee or officer had a reasonable basis for believing that he or she was acting within the scope of his or her authority at the time of the alleged conduct, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>governmental agency <em>may </em>pay for, engage, or furnish the services of an attorney to advise the officer or employee as to the action, and to appear for and represent the officer or employee in the action. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">In determining that the city council\u2019s choice was a \u201cpurely discretionary\u201d decision that was not subject to judicial review absent some constitutional infirmity, we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">The use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in \u00a7 8 makes clear that the decision to pay an officer\u2019s attorney fees is a matter left to the discretion of the municipality. Further, we note that the statute does not limit or qualify the word \u201cmay\u201d (with, for instance, a requirement of reasonableness) or provide any other standards by which that discretion is to be exercised. As such, the Flushing city council had full discretion under MCL 691.1408(2) in choosing whether to reimburse plaintiffs attorney fees. <em>[Warda, supra </em>at 332.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We also noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">[t]he exercise of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d by this Court, Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1, contemplates that there will be standards \u2014legally comprehensible standards \u2014 on the basis of which agency decisions can be reviewed. Whether such standards consist of the provisions of the constitution, or the provisions of other pertinent laws, a judicially comprehensible standard is required in order to enable judicial review. <em>[Id. </em>at 339.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Because the Legislature did not include any meaningful standard by which a court could review the exercise of the municipality\u2019s discretion, we concluded that the city council\u2019s decision to deny reimbursement was not subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Unlike the standardless discretion statutorily afforded the municipality in <em>Warda, </em>however, the relevant statutes here provide that \u201c[u]pon probable cause, the commissioner shall have power to examine and invest\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>gate,\u201d MCL 500.2028, and that \u201c[w]hen the commissioner has probable cause to believe that a person\u201d is engaging in improper practices \u201cand that a hearing by the commissioner in respect thereto would be in the interest of the public,\u201d the commissioner shall take certain steps. MCL 500.2029.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In light of this language, can it be said that \u201cprobable cause\u201d is, in fact, a <em>standard </em>being employed to guide the commissioner\u2019s discretion? Or did the Legislature merely intend that \u201cprobable cause\u201d serve to define a quantum of proof, and that the commissioner\u2019s decision to hold a contested-case hearing is purely discretionary? \u201cProbable cause\u201d is a concept normally found in the criminal law,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but it is a well-understood and well-defined concept in our jurisprudence. As such, is \u201cprobable cause\u201d a \u201clegally comprehensible standards ... on the basis of which agency decisions can be [judicially] reviewed\u201d? <em>Warda, supra </em>at 339. Or does \u201cprobable cause\u201d instead establish a burden of proof that petitioners must satisfy? If it is merely a standard of proof, given that trial courts are accustomed to making probable cause determinations, and that appellate courts are accustomed to assessing whether trial courts have correctly established probable cause, does review of the commissioner\u2019s determination concerning whether probable cause exists fall squarely within the judicial power? Or should it instead be inferred from the discretionary nature of the \u201cprobable cause\u201d decision that the Legislature intended that the commissioner\u2019s assessment of \u201cprobable cause\u201d be unreviewable? If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Legislature did so intend, does that body have the power to make such a decision unreviewable, given the language of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28 and the nondelegation doctrine?</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">If we were to conclude that the commissioner\u2019s ultimate decision in this case\u2014 denying the petition for a contested-case hearing and ruling that the PPO option was valid\u2014 was authorized by law\u2014 i.e., because no probable cause was found, the commissioner was not required to hold a hearing\u2014 is judicial review precluded upon that determination? Or does the ultimate question remain whether this is a \u201ccase[] in which a hearing is required\u201d? Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28. If the latter is the case, would that require that we review the commissioner\u2019s determination of a lack of probable cause? If so, would that decision be reviewed under the standard of \u201ccompetent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record\u201d? Have petitioners here shown that they have actually been harmed by the endorsement at issue, such that the commissioner\u2019s determination was not supported by \u201ccompetent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record\u201d? Must they?</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">(3) Of what significance are the commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions apart from his decision not to hold a contested-case hearing? Even if we were to conclude that the commissioner\u2019s probable cause determination was discretionary and therefore unreviewable, it appears that MCL 500.2028 and MCL 500.2029 are not the only provisions relied on by the commissioner in reaching the decision. The commissioner also asserted that he possessed the authority to withdraw approval of insurance policy forms pursuant to MCL 500.2236(5). That provision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">Upon written notice to the insurer, the commissioner may disapprove, withdraw approval or prohibit the issu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>anee, advertising, or delivery of any form to any person in this state if it violates any provisions of this act, or contains inconsistent, ambiguous, or misleading clauses, or contains exceptions and conditions that unreasonably or deceptively affect the risk purported to be assumed in the general coverage of the policy. The notice shall specify the objectionable provisions or conditions and state the reasons for the commissioner\u2019s decision. If the form is legally in use by the insurer in this state, the notice shall give the effective date of the commissioner\u2019s disapproval, which shall not be less than 30 days subsequent to the mailing or delivery of the notice to the insurer. If the form is not legally in use, then disapproval shall be effective immediately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The commissioner proceeded to conclude\u2014 apparently pursuant to his authority under MCL 500.2236\u2014 that the PPO option did not violate the Insurance Code. With respect to petitioners\u2019 claim that the endorsement violated the rights of insureds (count I), the commissioner found that the endorsement was not inherently inconsistent with MCL 500.3107. With respect to petitioners\u2019 claim that the endorsement violated the rights of medical providers (count II), the commissioner concluded that nothing in the no-fault act, including MCL 500.3157, conferred the right on any provider to be chosen to provide care, that nothing in the endorsement conflicts with the requirement that no-fault insurers pay reasonable and customary charges, and that the endorsement does not unreasonably or deceptively affect the risk purportedly assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Thus, it appears that the commissioner did not merely decline to hold a contested-case hearing; rather, he also affirmatively reached a number of legal conclusions. Because petitioners are challenging these conclusions, and not simply the failure to hold a hearing, I am not certain that the arguably discretionary nature of the commissioner\u2019s authority to hold a contested-case hearing under MCL 500.2028 and MCL 500.2029 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>dispositive of the justiciability inquiry. Rather, if petitioners are \u201caggrieved by a final order, decision, finding, ruling, opinion, rule, action, or inaction provided for under this act,\u201d MCL 500.244(1), are they not entitled to proceed under the APA?</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">(4) Finally, are petitioners even \u201caggrieved\u201d pursuant to MCL 500.244(1)? How is this determination made? Might this ultimately boil down to the equivalent of a justiciability inquiry? That is, can it be argued that an adverse decision at the administrative level is the equivalent of a \u201cpresent injury\u201d required to meet the standing and ripeness requirements?<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Might it also be argued that an adverse decision below\u2014 even a decision on a matter that could not have been brought before the judiciary because it was otherwise not justiciable\u2014 <em>itself </em>constitutes a present injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>I believe these questions present constitutional issues that must be resolved for a proper determination of the case before us, and that they are not addressed, much less resolved, by the lead opinion. In my judgment, further briefing is required by the parties and further consideration is required by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><em>TV. </em>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">I do not believe that the justiciability analysis that is traditionally applied to inquiries under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1 is necessarily dispositive in this case. Rather, a number of constitutional questions concerning the administrative process in Michigan exist apart from this analysis, and these questions should be resolved for a proper determination of the case before us. The lead opinion fails to address, much less answer, these questions. As such, I believe additional consideration by this Court is warranted, and I would direct the parties to file supplemental briefs on the issues raised in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\"> The commissioner\u2019s findings with respect to counts III and IV are omitted because those findings are not at issue on appeal here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\"> That provision provides, in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">Either house of the legislature or the governor may request the opinion of the supreme court on important questions of law upon solemn occasions as to the constitutionality of legislation after it has been enacted into law but before its effective date.

However, it has long been the practice of this Court to raise issues sua sponte where consideration of such issues is necessary to a full and fair determination of the case before it. See, e.g., <em>City of Dearborn v Bacila, </em>353 Mich 99, 118; 90 NW2d 863 (1958); <em>Auditor General v Bolt, </em>147 Mich 283, 286-287; 111 NW 74 (1907). \u201cWhere the adversarial process fails to provide valuable assistance, a court\u2019s duty to correctly expound the law is not excused.\u201d <em>Mack v Detroit, </em>467 Mich 1211, 1213 (2002) (Young, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Moreover, questions relating to subject-matter jurisdiction, in particular questions of a constitutional dimension, may be raised at any time by the parties, or sua sponte by a court. <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation, supra </em>at 630; MCR 2.116(D)(3). Subject-matter jurisdiction involves the power of a court to hear and determine a cause or matter. <em>Langdon v Wayne Circuit Court Judges, </em>76 Mich 358, 367; 43 NW 310 (1889). It is conferred on the court by the authority that established such court. <em>Detroit v Rabaut, </em>389 Mich 329, 331; 206 NW2d 625 (1973). Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1 established the current judicial system in Michigan, and Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28 provides that certain agency decisions \u201cshall be subject to direct review by the courts . ...\u201d Accordingly, it is entirely appropriate, in my judgment, that we address the effect of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28 on the issues presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b466-10\"> In so doing, the commissioner was apparently acting pursuant to his authority under MCL 500.2236(5), which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">Upon written notice to the insurer, the commissioner may disapprove, withdraw approval or prohibit the issuance, advert\u00eds<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>ing, or delivery of any form to any person in this state if it violates any provisions of this act, or contains inconsistent, ambiguous, or misleading clauses, or contains exceptions and conditions that unreasonably or deceptively affect the risk purported to be assumed in the general coverage of the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The commissioner noted in his decision that he possessed the authority to withdraw approval of insurance policy forms pursuant to MCL 500.2236, and that in their complaint, petitioners specifically sought the withdrawal of the endorsement at issue under that section. Because the commissioner\u2019s findings and conclusions went far beyond what was necessary to simply deny petitioners\u2019 request for a contested-case hearing under MCL 500.2028 and 500.2029, I can only conclude that such findings were made pursuant to his authority under MCL 500.2236.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b469-5\"> As we noted in <em>Taylor, supra </em>at 8-9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">A simple statement of this doctrine is found in <em>Field v Clark, </em>143 US 649, 692; 12 S Ct 495; 36 L Ed 294 (1892), in which the United States Supreme Court explained that \u201cthe integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the Constitution\u201d precludes Congress from delegating its legislative power to either the executive branch or the judicial branch. This concept has its roots in the separation of powers principle underlying our tripartite system of government.
