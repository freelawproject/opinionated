Under this exception, an employer would be liable for the torts of an employee acting outside the scope of his or her employment when the employee is \u201caided in accomplishing\u201d the tort \u201cby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the existence of the agency relation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that this Court has not previously adopted this exception, and we decline to adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">We affirm in part the decision of the Court of Appeals, but for different reasons, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court for entry of a judgment of dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">We adopt the facts as related by the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">This case arises from plaintiffs allegation that defendant\u2019s employee, a nursing assistant, sexually assaulted her in the emergency room at Hurley Medical Center on July 9, 1998. On that date, plaintiff was suffering a manic depressive episode when she was brought to defendant\u2019s emergency department by police and placed in a treatment room. Because plaintiff was belligerent, yelling, swearing, and kicking, she was placed in restraints and administered treatment. Eventually she was left alone in the room with a nursing assistant assigned to clean the room. Plaintiff begged him to release her from the restraints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">While the aide was alone in the room with plaintiff, she continued to make sexually explicit remarks, enticing him to engage in sexual activity with her. According to plaintiff, she made these remarks \u201c[a]t first to get him out of the room like the other nurses,\u201d but when he went to her, she \u201csuddenly thought he was a very powerful person in the hospital\u201d and \u201cwould release [her.]\u201d The aide engaged, without resistance, in digital and oral sex with plaintiff, but he did not release her and left. One of the nurses came back into the room right after the aide left. Plaintiff did not say anything because she was scared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Plaintiff reported the incident three days later to a social worker, police were notified, and an investigation commenced. Plaintiff believed the employee might have been a janitor because he was cleaning and she provided a general description of the employee. Through the hospital\u2019s efforts, the nursing assistant was identified approximately three months later.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">Plaintiff brought a complaint against defendant Hurley Medical Center, alleging assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court denied summary disposition on these counts, finding that there was a question of fact with regard to whether Powell\u2019s agency relationship with defendant aided Powell in committing the tortious acts against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">At the close of plaintiffs case, defendant moved for a directed verdict, asserting that defendant could not be hable for the torts of an employee acting outside the scope of his employment. Plaintiff, relying on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Champion v Nation Wide Security, Inc,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>argued that defendant was hable under the \u201caided by the agency\u201d relationship exception to respondeat superior liability. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion. The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff in the amount of $750,000 in past damages and $500,000 in future damages. After reducing the verdict to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>present value, the trial court entered a judgment in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $1,147,247.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Defendant appealed, and the Court of Appeals, in an unpublished decision, reversed and remanded the case for entry of a judgment of dismissal, holding that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motions for summary disposition and a directed verdict because plaintiff failed to present a material question of fact regarding defendant\u2019s liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration. Plaintiff sought leave to appeal, and we granted the application.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">This Court reviews de novo a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Summary disposition may be granted pursuant to MCR 2.116(0(10) when \u201c[e]xcept as to the amount of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,\u201d and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When reviewing a motion for summary disposition, \u201ca trial court considers affidavits, pleadings, depositions, admissions, and other evidence... in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for a directed verdict, the standard of review is de novo and the reviewing court must consider the evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, the general rule is that an employer is not liable for the torts intentionally or recklessly committed by an employee when those torts are beyond the scope of the employer\u2019s business.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 1 Restatement Agency, 2d, \u00a7 219(2) sets forth the general rule of respondeat superior and also lists certain exceptions to employer nonliability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">(2) A master is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants acting outside the scope of their employment, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">(a) the master intended the conduct or the consequences, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">(b) the master was negligent or reckless, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">(c) the conduct violated a non-delegable duty of the master, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">(d) the servant purported to act or to speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance upon apparent authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">The question in this case is whether Michigan recognizes the fourth exception, \u00a7 219(2)(d), to the doctrine of respondeat superior nonliability. Plaintiff argues that Michigan has adopted, or should now adopt, the fourth exception to the respondeat superior nonliability rule. Section 219(2)(d) provides an exception to employer nonliability when a plaintiff can show that he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>relied on the apparent authority of the employee, or that the employee was aided in harming the plaintiff by the existence of the agency relationship between the employee and the employer. Section 219(2)(d) and the commentary on that section establish that this exception to employer nonliability applies primarily to cases involving misrepresentation and deceit, for example when a store manager is able to cheat store customers because of his or her position as store manager for the owner.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Section 219(2)(d) was first mentioned by this Court in <em>McCann v Michigan,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a case in which this Court issued four separate opinions, none of which received enough concurrences to constitute a majority opinion. A majority of this Court, however, declined to adopt the exception. Consequently, this Court did not adopt \u00a7 219(2)(d) in <em>McCann.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Nevertheless, several appellate court decisions have cited the <em>McCann </em>plurality\u2019s reference to \u00a7 219(2)(d) in subsequent tort actions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> After noting such multiple references, the Court of Appeals panel below concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>that the Michigan Supreme Court had adopted \u00a7 219(2)(d) in <em>Champion, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\">In <em>Champion, supra, </em>the plaintiff was raped by her supervisor and sought to impose liability on their employer for quid pro quo sexual harassment under the Michigan Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2103(i). The employer attempted to avoid liability under the Civil Rights Act on the theory that the employer did not authorize the supervisor to rape his subordinate. Calling the employer\u2019s \u201cconstruction of agency principles ... far too narrow,\u201d the Court in <em>Champion, supra </em>at 712, cited Restatement Agency, 2d, \u00a7 219(2)(d) in a footnote.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Champion </em>did not elaborate on this citation in reaching this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The reference to \u201cRestatement Agency, 2d, \u00a7 219(2) (d)\u201d in footnote six of <em>Champion </em>may have contributed to appellate court confusion about whether this Court adopted the aided by the agency exception to employer nonliability under the doctrine of respondeat superior.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We now clarify that the reference to \u00a7 219(2) (d) in <em>Champion, supra, </em>was made only in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>passing and on the basis of the very distinct facts of that civil rights matter.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We did not, by that reference, adopt \u00a7 219(2)(d). The Court of Appeals erred in finding that this Court affirmatively adopted the \u201caided by the agency relationship\u201d exception to liability under the respondeat superior doctrine set forth in Restatement Agency, 2d, \u00a7 219(2). However, this case again presents us with the opportunity to adopt the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In support of adopting \u00a7 219(2) (d), plaintiff cites a First Circuit Court of Appeals decision, <em>Costos v Coconut Island Corp.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Costos, </em>the plaintiff was a guest at an inn and had retired for the night to her room. The inn manager obtained a key to the plaintiffs room, entered without the plaintiffs knowledge, and raped her. In finding the employer of the manager vicariously liable under \u00a7 219(2) (d), the court focused on the fact that, as an agent of the inn, the manager was entrusted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>with the key to the plaintiffs room and knowledge of where to find her. Specifically, the key was the \u201cinstrumentality\u201d that provided the manager with the opportunity to accomplish the rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><em>Costos </em>has been sharply criticized, and appears to have been adopted by only two other federal courts.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Indeed, <em>Costos </em>was later distinguished by the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine in <em>Mahar v StoneWood </em>Transport.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Maine\u2019s highest court not only clarified that it had not expressly adopted \u00a7 219(2)(d), but also questioned the application of the exception by the <em>Costos </em>court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\">At least one critic notes that the First Circuit\u2019s \u201cinstrumentality\u201d analysis does not delineate the scope of \u201cinstrumentality.\u201d [Casenote: Costos v Coconut Island Corp: <em>Creating a vicarious liability catchall under the aided-by-agency-relation theory, </em>73 U Colo L R 1099, 1112] (\u201cBy ignoring the properly narrow scope of aided-by-agency-relation liability, the <em>Costos </em>court eroded traditional principles of agency law.\u201d); <em>see Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 760, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633, 118 S. Ct. 2257 (1998) (\u201cIn a sense, most workplace tortfeasors are aided in accomplishing their tortious objective by the employment relation: Proximity and regular contact afford a captive pool of potential victims.\u201d).[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Thus, the dissent\u2019s suggestion that the <em>Costos </em>instrumentality ruling has been generally accepted, <em>post </em>at 238, is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Courts have criticized \u00a7 219(2)(d) primarily because the exception swallows the rule and amounts to an imposition of strict liability upon employers.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of an instance when the exception would not apply because an employee, by virtue of his or her employment relationship with the employer is always \u201caided in accomplishing\u201d the tort.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Because the exception is not tied to the scope of employment but, rather, to the existence of the employment relation itself, the exception strays too far from the rule of respondeat superior employer nonliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Because we recognize that were we to adopt the exception we would potentially be subjecting employers to strict liability, we decline to do so. We further note that, employers will continue to be subject to liability for their negligence in hiring, training, and supervising their employees.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The dissent contends that these other causes of action available to plaintiffs will not provide protection to a plaintiff who is injured when an \u201cemployer does not have knowledge that an employee may misuse granted authority.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Yet, the dissent fails to recognize that were this Court to impose liability on an employer under these very circumstances, we would in fact be subjecting the employer to strict liability. If the dissent believes that an employer\u2019s prior knowledge of an employee\u2019s propensity for bad acts is required to impose liability, then the only basis for employer liability based on an employee\u2019s unknown propensities would be strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\">Given the danger of applying such a broad exception to respondeat superior employer nonliability because employers may be subject to strict liability, courts that have applied the exception have done so primarily in sexual harassment/discrimination cases on the basis that an employer is vicariously liable when a supervisory employee uses his agency position to sexually harass an employee.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>One court that chose to apply the exception outside the sexual harassment employment realm was the Vermont Supreme Court when, in <em>Doe v </em>Forrest,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> it applied \u00a7 219(2)(d) in a case where a police officer sexually assaulted a female cashier at a convenience store. The Court held that the sheriff was vicariously hable because his deputy used his agency position to commit a sexual assault while on duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The dissent asserts, <em>post </em>at 242, that this Court has the option of applying the exception in the same tailored manner as demonstrated by the Vermont Supreme Court in <em>Doe v Forrest. </em>Specifically, that court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>cited <em>Faragher v Boca Raton</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as the basis for extending \u00a7 219(2)(d) beyond the realm of sexual harassment in the employment setting. According to the dissent, there are three balancing factors from <em>Faragher </em>that courts can consider when applying \u00a7 219(2)(d).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> However, the dissent ignores the very specific context in which those factors were applied, namely to a <em>supervisor-employee relationship. </em>The actual language from <em>Faragher </em>is not broadly worded, but is in fact precisely tailored to the unique circumstances of a sexual harassment suit in an employment context.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\">As the dissenting justices in <em>Doe v Forrest </em>noted, the <em>Faragher </em>Court applied the exception in order to promote the policies of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC 2000e <em>et seq. </em>Given the <em>Faragher </em>Court\u2019s limited application of the exception, the dissenting justices were critical of the majority\u2019s extension of \u00a7 219(2)(d) to factually distinct scenarios:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">[T]he majority\u2019s analysis and conclusion are fundamentally flawed. First, as noted, the high court never intended for its decisions in <em>Faragher </em>and Ellerth[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>]to have any influence on the development of common-law agency principles or the application of \u00a7 219 (2)(d) outside the specific context of Title VH.[<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In concluding that the application of the exception to the facts of that particular case was too broad, the dissenting justices noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>[T]he majority has created a threat of vicarious liability that knows no borders. While the majority limits its holding to sexual assaults committed by \u201con-duty law enforcement officers,\u201d ante, at 48, the standard that it articulates applies to a broad range of employees whose duties grant them unique access to and authority over others, such as teachers, physicians, nurses, therapists, probation officers, and correctional officers, to name but a few. As the trial court here aptly observed, the Court\u2019s interpretation could virtually \u201ceviscerate[j the general scope of employment rule.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 505 (Skoglund, J., dissenting, joined by Amestoy, C.J.).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The Vermont dissenting justices then aptly noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">Like the finding of a duty of care in negligence law, the imposition of vicarious liability under agency principles flows not from the rote application of rules, but from a considered policy judgment that it is fair and reasonable to hold an employer liable for the harmfid actions of its employee. As Justice Souter, writing for the United States Supreme Court in <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662, 118 S. Ct. 2275 (19981, cogently observed: \u201cIn the instances in which there is a genuine question about the employer\u2019s responsibility for harmful conduct he did not in fact authorize, a holding that the conduct falls within the scope of employment ultimately expresses a conclusion not of fact but of law.... The \u2018highly indefinite phrase\u2019 [vicarious liability] is \u2018devoid of meaning in itself and is \u2018obviously no more than a bare formula to cover the unordered and unauthorized acts of the servant for which it is found to be expedient to charge the master with liability, as well as to exclude other acts for which it is not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 796 (quoting W Keaton [sic] et al., Prosser and Keaton [sic] on Law of Torts \u00a7 502 (5th ed. 1984))[.][<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">We decline to follow the approach suggested by the Vermont Supreme Court majority in <em>Doe v Forrest. </em>As noted by the dissenting justices in that case, to do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>would expose employers to the \u201cthreat of vicarious liability that knows no borders\u201d for acts committed by employees that are clearly outside the scope of employment.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We recognize the danger of adopting an exception that essentially has no parameters and can be applied too broadly. Because we decline to adopt the exception, plaintiff has failed to establish that defendant Hurley Medical Center is vicariously hable for the sexual misconduct of its nursing assistant who was clearly not acting within the scope of his employment when he engaged in acts of sexual misconduct with plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The Court of Appeals below correctly reversed the judgment of the trial court because plaintiff failed to establish that defendant is liable under the theory of respondeat superior. We therefore affirm that portion of the May 4, 2005, opinion of the Court of Appeals and remand the matter to the trial court for entry of a judgment of dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">However, the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that this Court adopted Restatement Agency, 2d, \u00a7 219(2)(d) when we held in <em>Champion, supra, </em>that an employer was liable for quid pro quo sexual harassment under MCL 37.2103(i). That part of the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. We decline to adopt the exception, which would create employer liability for the torts of an employee acting outside the scope of his or her employment when the employee is aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relationship. Therefore, plaintiffs assertion that there is a question of fact regarding whether defendant\u2019s employee was aided by his agency relationship is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-4\">Taylor, C.J., and CORRIGAN and Markman, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-9\"> <em>Bradley v Stevens, </em>329 Mich 556, 562; 46 NW2d 382 (1951), citing <em>Martin v Jones, </em>302 Mich 355, 358; 4 NW2d 686 (1942).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-11\"> Restatement Agency, 2d, \u00a7 219(2)(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b293-5\"> <em>Zsigo v Hurley Medical Ctr, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued May 4, 2004 (Docket No. 240155), slip op at 1-2.

I fully concur and join in the majority opinion. I write separately to question the validity of this Court\u2019s application of agency principles in <em>Champion v Nation Wide Security, Inc, </em>450 Mich 702; 545 NW2d 596 (1996). In <em>Champion, </em>the supervisor engaged in quid pro quo sexual harassment hy offering to \u201ctake care of\u201d the plaintiff if she submitted to his sexual requests. However, when the plaintiff rebuffed his offer, the supervisor raped the plaintiff. This Court held that an employer is \u201cstrictly liable where the supervisor accomplishes the rape through the exercise of his supervisory power over the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713-714. I fail to see how the supervisor\u2019s \u201csupervisory power\u201d aided him in sexually assaulting the plaintiff, where he accomplished the sexual assault through brute force <em>after </em>his attempt to use his supervisory powers had failed. A rape is a physical assault, and the supervisor in <em>Champion </em>was in no way \u201caided\u201d by his managerial status in raping his subordinate.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">I find it hard to square <em>Champion </em>with any conventional notion of agency, and it stands as an isolated, inexplicable exception in our Michigan Supreme Court jurisprudence.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b306-7\">KELLY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1c\"><em>odissenting). </em>We granted leave in this case to address two important questions: (1) whether this Court has adopted 1 Restatement Agency, 2d, \u00a7 219(2)(d) and, if not, (2) whether we should adopt it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Regarding the first question, this Court has not explicitly adopted \u00a7 219(2)(d). However, ten years ago in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>Champion v Nation Wide Security Inc,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we did implicitly adopt it. And regarding the second question, we should now explicitly adopt \u00a7 219(2) (d) and apply it to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Accordingly, I would affirm the Court of Appeals use and recognition of \u00a7 219(2)(d) and reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition. Summary disposition was improper because a factual question exists concerning whether the person who assaulted plaintiff was aided in committing the tort by his agency relationship with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">I. THIS COURT HAS IMPLICITLY ADOPTED \u00a7 219(2)(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">As a general rule, an employer is not responsible for an employee\u2019s intentional or reckless torts that exceed the scope of employment. <em>Bradley v Stevens, </em>329 Mich 556, 562; 46 NW2d 382 (1951). But \u00a7 219(2)(d) of the Restatement of Agency provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">(2) A master is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants acting outside the scope of their employment, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">(d) the servant purported to act or to speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance upon apparent authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation. [1 Restatement Agency, 2d, \u00a7 219(2)(d).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcK\">The exception essentially holds an employer liable for an employee\u2019s abuse of the authority that the employer granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our concern in this case surrounds the excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tion\u2019s phrase \u201caided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation\u201d and whether this Court has previously adopted \u00a7 219(2)(d). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The majority holds that this Court did not adopt \u00a7 219(2)(d) in <em>Champion. </em>I agree that the magic words \u201cwe adopt the Restatement\u201d do not appear. But I disagree that the Court\u2019s reference to \u00a7 219(2) (d) was merely in passing and that its application of the section was limited to the facts of that case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, a close reading of <em>Champion </em>suggests that the citation of \u00a7 219(2)(d) was part of the Court\u2019s rationale. Also, the citation of \u00a7 219(2)(d) was not expressly or implicitly limited to the facts presented in <em>Champion, </em>and its inclusion was designed to give guidance to the bench and bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Additionally, the citation of \u00a7 219(2)(d) was not just a cursory statement. This Court\u2019s citation of \u00a7 219(2)(d) in <em>Champion </em>was in response to one of the defendant\u2019s arguments in that- case. The defendant-employer had asserted that it could not be responsible for its supervisor\u2019s rape of the plaintiff-employee because it never authorized the supervisor to rape the employee. <em>Champion, supra </em>at 712. In direct response, this Court stated, \u201cThis construction of agency principles is far too nar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>row.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The reader is then directed to \u00a7 219(2)(d) to determine how a court should determine the proper scope of agency principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\">This Court further stated that, when an employer gives a supervisor certain authority over other employees, the employer must take responsibility to remedy any harm caused by the supervisor\u2019s misuse of the authority granted. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Henson v City of Dundee, </em>682 F2d 897, 909 (CA 11, 1982). <em>Champion\u2019s </em>citation of the <em>Henson </em>decision is especially noteworthy because <em>Henson </em>includes a discussion of \u00a7 219(2) (d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">The common law rules of respondeat superior will not always be appropriate to suit the broad remedial purposes of Title VU[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>].... In this case, however, the imposition of liability upon an employer for <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment committed by supervisors appears to be in general agreement with common law principles. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219(2) (d) (master is liable for tort of his servant if the servant \u201cwas aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation\u201d). <em>[Henson, supra </em>at 910 n 21.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Given <em>Champion\u2019s </em>direction to readers to refer to the Restatement and <em>Champion\u2019s </em>citation of <em>Henson, </em>I do not believe that \u00a7 219(2) (d) was mentioned only in passing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Nonetheless, the majority seeks, by smoke and mirrors, to hide the fact that this Court appears to have implicitly adopted \u00a7 219(2)(d). Framing the issue as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>being whether this Court adopted \u00a7 219(2)(d) allows the majority to overrule <em>Champion </em>without the need to show that it was wrongly decided. Moreover, <em>Champion\u2019s </em>validity was not questioned below. But even if this Court has not already adopted \u00a7 219(2)(d), we should explicitly adopt it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">II. THE COURT SHOULD NOW EXPLICITLY ADOPT \u00a7 219(2)(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Section 219(2)(d) correctly places responsibility on the employer to ensure that any grant of authority it makes to an employee is proper. The employer has the ultimate power to decide whom it will hire. The employer is responsible for determining what authority its employees are allowed. Therefore, it is the employer who should be responsible when its employees abuse the authority the employer gave them and the authority granted enables the employees to cause harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">But in seeking to shield employers from liability, the majority instead places the burden of preventing an abuse of authority and the corresponding harm on people powerless to prevent it. This case presents a perfect example. Plaintiff was taken to the defendant hospital against her will. She was strapped to a bed. Defendant\u2019s employee then used his employer-given authority to enter plaintiffs room to sexually assault plaintiff. She had no power over who could enter her hospital room, and she could not prevent the assault. The entity with the power to protect plaintiff was the hospital. Yet, the majority leaves plaintiff to bear the full burden for the harm she was powerless to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">However, \u00a7 219(2) (d) recognizes that the majority\u2019s approach of placing the burden on the victim is unworkable. It also recognizes that such an action would create a situation where an employer has much less reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>monitor its employees\u2019 use of authority.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, this Court should explicitly adopt \u00a7 219(2)(d) and apply it to the facts of this case. Moreover, the majority\u2019s reasons for not adopting \u00a7 219(2)(d) are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\">The majority\u2019s main reason for not embracing \u00a7 219(2)(d) is that the exception would swallow the rule. According to the majority, this would create \u201c \u2018vicarious liability that knows no borders\u2019 for acts committed by employees that are clearly outside the scope of employment.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 231 (citation omitted). But this generic rationale misunderstands the scope of \u00a7 219(2) (d). It also avoids acknowledging that this Court can adopt a narrow interpretation of \u00a7 219(2) (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Indeed, the majority seems to accept without explanation that \u00a7 219(2)(d) must be broadly construed. This is understandable in light of the majority\u2019s calculated fear that adoption of \u00a7 219(2)(d) will open a Pandora\u2019s box. But this rationale ignores the fact that the employer liability that \u00a7 219(2)(d) provides for is the tortious use of authority by an employee. Liability is not created by the employer-employee relationship alone. And \u00a7 219(2)(d) requires more than mere opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>to commit the tort.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Bozarth v Harper Creek Bd of Ed, </em>94 Mich App 351, 355; 288 NW2d 424 (1979). Moreover, the majority\u2019s blanket assertion that adoption of \u00a7 219(2)(d) will create \u201cvirtual\u201d strict liability ignores the fact that several other courts have interpreted the exception narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">For example, courts have taken several approaches to interpreting the scope of \u00a7 219(2)(d). One is to adopt the instrumentality rule which is explained in <em>Costos v Coconut Island Corp, </em>137 F3d 46 (CA 1, 1998). Another is to adopt a balancing approach as explained by the Supreme Court of Vermont in <em>Doe v Forrest, </em>176 Vt 476; 853 A2d 48 (2004). Both seek to balance the scope of \u00a7 219(2)(d) so as not to impose strict liability based solely on the employer-employee relationship or on the mere opportunity to commit the tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">With respect to the instrumentality approach, in <em>Costos, supra, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit interpreted the scope of \u00a7 219(2)(d). In that case, a hotel manager gained access to a guest\u2019s room and raped the guest. The court found that the owner and corporate manager of the hotel could be held liable for the rape. <em>Costos, supra </em>at 50. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">By virtue of his agency relationship with the defendants, as manager of the inn, [the manager] was entrusted with the keys to the rooms, including [the victim\u2019s] room, at the Bernard House. Because he was the manager of the inn, [he] knew exactly where to find [the victim]. The jury could find that [the manager] had responsibilities to be at the inn or to have others there late at night. In short, because he was the defendants\u2019 agent, [the manger] knew that [the victim] was staying at the Bernard House, he was able to find [the victim\u2019s] room late at night, he had the key to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>room and used the key to unlock the door, slip into bed beside her as she slept, and rape her. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Thus, the instrumentality approach requires that the tort be accomplished by an instrumentality or through conduct associated with the agency status. Accordingly, this interpretation in <em>Costos </em>reads \u00a7 219(2)(d) narrowly and balances interests so that employers do not become liable simply because an employer-employee relationship exists. In other words, the instrumentality approach to \u00a7 219(2) (d) does not result in strict liability for employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">With respect to the second approach, the Supreme Court of Vermont in <em>Doe, supra, </em>explored the application of \u00a7 219(2)(d) to a sexual assault committed by a police officer while the officer was on duty. In response to the dissent\u2019s contention that unfathomable strict liability would result, the court explained that it was \u201csensitive to the concern expressed by the trial court that plaintiffs arguments could lead to a rule that makes a principal liable for all intentional torts of an agent in all circumstances.\u201d <em>Doe, supra </em>at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In addressing this concern, the Vermont court, <em>id. </em>at 488, turned to the United States Supreme Court decisions in <em>Burlington Industries, Inc v Ellerth,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Faragher v City of Boca Raton, </em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>two sexual harassment cases brought under Title VII. In those cases, the United States Supreme Court concerned itself with the last phrase of \u00a7 219(2)(d) and rejected a narrow reading of its language.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Doe, supra </em>at 489-490. As such, while observing that it was not strictly bound by those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>decisions, the <em>Doe </em>court viewed <em>Ellerth </em>and <em>Faragher </em>as strong persuasive authority and helpful to the proper application of \u00a7 219(2)(d). <em>Doe, supra </em>at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Accordingly, in following the lead of the United States Supreme Court, the Vermont court in <em>Doe </em>reasoned that it is \u201cimportant not to adopt too narrow an interpretation of the last clause of \u00a7 219(2)(d), <em>but it is equally important not to adopt too broad an interpretation.\u201d Id. </em>at 491 (emphasis added). The court also reasoned that it should give appropriate deference to the policy reasons underlying the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions. It decided to apply those policy reasons in the context of an intentional sexual tort committed by a police officer while on duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">As such, the Vermont court eventually determined that the three considerations noted in <em>Faragher </em>correctly balanced the scope of \u00a7 219(2)(d) and, thus, adopted them as its own. The considerations are (1) the opportunity created by the relationship, (2) the powerlessness of the victim to resist the perpetrator and prevent the unwanted contact, and (3) the opportunity to prevent and guard against the conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 491.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>According to the Vermont court, when all three factors weigh in favor of the victim, liability may be imposed on the employer under the exception set forth in \u00a7 219(2) (d). Thus, it is clear that the Vermont court\u2019s approach does not result in strict liability and also serves to protect those who cannot protect themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>I agree with the Vermont court that \u00a7 219(2)(d) as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Faragher, supra, </em>reflects the correct balance between reading \u00a7 219(2)(d) too narrowly and reading it too broadly. I would adopt its approach for Michigan law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Again, strict liability does not result from this application of \u00a7 219(2)(d). Only in those cases where (1) the opportunity created by the relationship, (2) the powerlessness of the victim to resist the perpetrator and prevent the unwanted contact, <em>and </em>(3) the opportunity to prevent and guard against the conduct are properly balanced will a defendant be held vicariously liable. <em>Doe, supra </em>at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Still, the majority prefers to ignore or discount the fact that this Court has the power to adopt an interpretation of \u00a7 219(2)(d) that does not cause strict liability. This Court could adopt an interpretation that encompasses its previous statement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">when an employer gives its supervisors certain authority over other employees, it must also accept responsibility to remedy the harm caused by the supervisors\u2019 unlawful exercise of that authority. <em>[Champion, supra </em>at 712.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In my view, the most disturbing aspect of the majority\u2019s refusal to adopt or apply \u00a7 219(2)(d) is that its rationale is based solely on an unproven hypothesis. The majority reasons that adoption of the Restatement could lead to \u201cvirtual\u201d strict liability for employers. But this is simply an unproven assertion designed to cause fear. More importantly, the majority does not acknowledge that it can interpret \u00a7 219(2)(d) to fairly balance the interests that \u00a7 219(2)(d) seeks to protect, just as other courts have done. Instead, it merely states that it refuses to do so because of its fear that strict liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>would result. The majority is like a farmer holding a can of red paint saying, \u201cI dare not paint my barn because the barnyard will become red.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\">Unlike the majority, I would carefully adopt and amend the common law to embrace the reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 219(2)(d) expressed in <em>Doe </em>and <em>Faragher. </em>The truth about \u00a7 219(2)(d) is that it functions as good public policy and as practical law when interpreted properly. In light of the discussion above, I am unpersuaded by the majority\u2019s rationale that boundless liability will result from a careful adoption of \u00a7 219(2)(d). The majority\u2019s rationale misunderstands the scope of \u00a7 219(2) (d) and fails to acknowledge this Court\u2019s ability to craft a rule that would properly balance the interests protected under \u00a7 219(2)(d). Therefore, had we not adopted it in the past, we should adopt \u00a7 219(2) (d) today, thereby placing the burden on the party most capable of preventing loss or injury. Moreover, I would apply that interpretation to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Here, under the approach detailed above, a factual question exists whether his agency relationship assisted the nurse\u2019s aide in committing the tort. Powell\u2019s position in defendant\u2019s emergency room gave him the opportunity to sexually assault a restrained patient. It appears that plaintiff was powerless to prevent the unwanted contact because she was physically bound and was suffering from a manic episode. In general, patients are vulnerable and trust hospital staff and their care. Therefore, I would affirm the result of the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">I would find that this Court implicitly adopted \u00a7 219(2)(d) in <em>Champion. </em>And even if we did not adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u00a7 219(2)(d) before, we should adopt it now. We should interpret the exception as did the Supreme Court of Vermont in <em>Doe, supra, </em>and apply it to the facts of this case. Consequently, I dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">I would affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the Court of Appeals, and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b318-5\">CAVANAGH, J., concurred with KELLY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-11\"> 450 Mich 702; 545 NW2d 596 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-12\"> The majority claims that \u00a7 219(2)(d) is primarily applicable in cases of deceit or misrepresentation. I agree but do not believe that \u00a7 219(2)(d) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>limited to those cases. The comments on \u00a7 219(2) (d) state that liability may exist where the servant is able to cause harm because of his or her position as an agent. The comments also provide that the enumeration of situations where \u00a7 219(2)(d) applies is not exhaustive, and the section applies where an agent causes physical harm. Therefore, I would not read \u00a7 219(2)(d) so narrowly as the majority does.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\"> The majority also argues that the placement of the citation in a footnote should determine its precedential effect. This is a dubious argument, considering that footnotes do sometimes set the state of the law. Perhaps this is unfortunate, but it is true. See, e.g., <em>United States v Carotene Products Co, </em>304 US 144, 153 n 4; 58 S Ct 778; 82 L Ed 1234 (1938), which laid the groundwork for heightened constitutional scrutiny of laws that discriminate on the basis of race and religion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\"> Title VII is the section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits employment discrimination. 42 USC 2000e <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\"> The majority argues that <em>Champion </em>was carefully crafted to apply only to quid pro quo sexual harassment cases. <em>Ante </em>at 223-224.1 disagree. <em>Champion </em>was a sexual harassment case. But this Court\u2019s broad statement there that Michigan\u2019s agency principles are in line with \u00a7 219(2)(d) cannot fairly be read as an expression to limit \u00a7 219(2)(d) to sexual harassment cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b311-5\"> The majority believes that \u00a7 219(2) (d) is unnecessary in light of the existence of other tort remedies. However a review of case law involving negligent hiring, training, and supervising shows that the majority is incorrect. Negligence in hiring requires knowledge on the part of the employer that the employee has criminal tendencies. <em>Hersh v Kentfield Builders, Inc, </em>385 Mich 410, 412; 189 NW2d 286 (1971). Negligent training is inapplicable here because there is no allegation that the nurse\u2019s aide was improperly trained. Negligent supervising, like negligent hiring and retention, requires knowledge on the part of the employer that special circumstances exist that could establish a duty to protect third persons. <em>Millross v Plum Hollow Golf Club, </em>429 Mich 178, 196-197; 413 NW2d 17 (1987). This review of the torts listed by the majority shows that none adequately covers a situation where the employer does not have knowledge that an employee may misuse granted authority. Therefore, \u00a7 219(2)(d) is needed to protect victims like plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\"> The majority\u2019s focus is misplaced. The focus is not on the employment relationship, but on the authority that the employer granted to the employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\"> 524 US 742; 118 S Ct 2257; 141 L Ed 2d 633 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\"> 524 US 775; 118 S Ct 2275; 141 L Ed 2d 662 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\"> In <em>Faragher, </em>the Court specifically rejected the proffered reading that the aid-in-accomplishing theory merely refined the apparent authority theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> The majority asserts that the Vermont Supreme Court in <em>Doe </em>incorrectly relied on these factors from <em>Faragher </em>because <em>Faragher </em>was limited to cases involving a supervisor-employee relationship. See <em>ante </em>at 229. In support of this assertion, the majority relies on the Doe dissent. But I find the <em>Doe </em>court\u2019s response to that dissent persuasive and fitting in this case. The <em>Doe </em>court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">In following the United States Supreme Court decisions, we reject the dissent\u2019s claim that the Supreme Court \u201cnever intended for its decisions ... to have any influence on the development of common-law agency principles or the application of \u00a7 219(2)(d) outside the specific context of Title VII.\u201d ... The Supreme Court applied the Restatement of Agency because it found that \u201cCongress wanted courts to look to agency principles for guidance\u201d in deciding hostile environment sex discrimination cases under Title VII.... Thus, in [Ellerth, <em>supra </em>at 754], the Court noted that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>was relying on \u201cthe general common law of agency.\u201d (Citation omitted). The Court noted that state court decisions could be \u201cinstructive,\u201d but they often relied upon federal decisions, id. at 755, and found the Restatement of Agency a useful starting point to find the general common law. Id. It went through the various sections of the Restatement (Second) of Agency and finally centered on \u00a7 219(2)(d) as the most useful. It then applied the \u201caided in the agency relation principle\u201d of \u00a7 219(2)(d) to the situation before it. Id. at 760-65.. .. The analysis in <em>[Faragher, supra </em>at 801-802], is similar, and as noted in the text, the Court resolved a dispute over the meaning of the language of \u00a7 219(2)(d), holding that the \u201caided-by-agency-relation principle\u201d was not merely a refinement of apparent authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">It is, of course, the nature of the common law that every appellate decision represents the development of the common law, and nothing in the Supreme Court decisions suggests they are not an integral part of that process. Indeed, the resolution of the dispute over the meaning of \u00a7 219(2)(d) in Faragher is exactly the kind of decision that best defines and develops the common law. No common-law court engaged in this process, and certainly not the highest court of this country, would expect that a common-law decision on one set of facts would have no influence on future decisions applying the same legal principle to a different factual scenario. <em>[Doe, supra </em>at 490 n 3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In any event, the reasons underlying the <em>Faragher </em>Court\u2019s use of these factors applies with equal force here even though there is not a supervisor-employee relationship. Therefore, extension of those factors is logical and appropriate. For example, just like a supervisor (Faragher) and a police office (Doe), a hospital aide has unique access to a patient who is depending on the aide for care. The patient is often defenseless. Imposing liability on the hospital may prevent recurrence of an assault by creating an incentive for vigilance. Accordingly, I disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that I am ignoring the specific context in which <em>Faragher </em>announced and applied the factors noted above. Rather, the context and underlying policy considerations are largely the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\"> I do not reject out of hand the instrumentality approach adopted by the <em>Costos </em>court, but find the balancing approach in <em>Doe </em>more compelling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
