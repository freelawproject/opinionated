Rather, the viability of that affirmative defense turns on as yet unresolved issues of fact. Moreover, the plaintiff, who applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits in connection with the subject accident and was well aware that the defendant Hee Ju Chun was a co-employee, would be neither surprised nor prejudiced by the proposed amendment. Inasmuch as the proposed amendment was neither palpably insufficient as a matter of law nor patently devoid of merit, leave to amend the answer should have been granted <em>(see Crespo v Pucciarelli, </em>21 AD3d 1048, 1049 [2005]; CPLR 3025 [b]; <em>cf. Jacobsen v Amedio, </em>218 AD2d 872 [1995]).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>In light of our determination, we need not address whether that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion which was for leave to renew was properly denied.
