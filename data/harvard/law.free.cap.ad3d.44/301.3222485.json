Iacovetta, J., at plea, John E Collins, J., at sentence), rendered December 2, 2004, convicting defendant of criminal sale of a controlled substance in or near school grounds, and sentencing him, as a second felony offender, to a term of 4\u00bd to 9 years, unanimously modified, on the law, to vacate the DNA databank fee, and otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Defendant\u2019s claim that he was entitled to a hearing on the issue of whether he violated the terms of his plea agreement is unpreserved since he never requested a hearing or moved to withdraw his plea <em>(see e.g. People v Delgado, </em>14 AD3d 449 [2005], <em>lv denied </em>4 NY3d 853 [2005]), and we decline to review it in the interest of justice. Were we to review this claim, we would find that after a sufficient inquiry, the sentencing court properly determined that defendant had violated his plea agreement. There was no factual dispute requiring a hearing <em>(see People v Valencia, </em>3 NY3d 714 [2004]), in view of the undisputed fact that, contrary to the plea agreement, defendant failed to appear for sentencing and was returned involuntarily on a bench warrant <em>(see e.g. People v Griffin, </em>33 AD3d 561 [2006], <em>Iv denied </em>8 NY3d 881 [2007]). We also conclude that defendant received effective assistance in connection with his plea and sentencing under the state and federal standards <em>(see People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d 708, 713-714 [1998]; <em>People v Ford, </em>86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; <em>see also Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668 [1984]).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">As the People concede, since the crime was committed prior to the effective date of the legislation (Penal Law \u00a7 60.35 [1] [a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>[v] [former (1) (e)]), providing for the imposition of a DNA databank fee, that fee should not have been imposed.
