Mintz, J.), entered October 3, 2007. The order dismissed the petition seeking, inter alia, to direct respondents Dennis E. Ward and Ralph M. Mohr, as Commissioners of Board of Elections, Erie County to place petitioner\u2019s name on the ballot for the general election for the office of Niagara District Councilman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from be and the same hereby is unanimously affirmed without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">Memorandum: Supreme Court properly dismissed the petition seeking, inter alia, to direct respondent Commissioners of the Board of Elections to place petitioner\u2019s name on the ballot for the general election for the office of Niagara District Councilman as the candidate of the \u201cSavages\u201d party. We affirm. It is undisputed that petitioner failed to file a timely certificate of acceptance, and that failure renders his designation \u201cnull and void\u201d (Election Law \u00a7 6-146 [1]; <em>see Matter of Rhodes v Salerno, </em>90 AD2d 587 [1982], <em>affd </em>57 NY2d 885 [1982]). Contrary to the contention of petitioner, Election Law \u00a7 6-146 (1) does not violate his constitutional right to equal protection. The requirement that a candidate nominated by an independent body file a certificate of acceptance imposes only a minimal burden on independent candidates and small political parties and is rationally related to the State\u2019s interest in \u201cpreventing election fraud\u201d <em>(Unity Party v Wallace, </em>707 F2d 59, 63 [1983]). With respect to the contention of petitioner that his equal protection rights are violated in that judicial candidates are not required to file a certificate of acceptance, we note that \u201cjudges and judicial candidates are not similarly situated\u201d with nonjudicial candidates (M<em>atter of Spargo v New York State Commn. on Jud. Conduct, </em>23 AD3d 808, 809 [2005]). Present\u2014Hurlbutt, J.P., Centra, Lunn, Fahey and Pine, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
