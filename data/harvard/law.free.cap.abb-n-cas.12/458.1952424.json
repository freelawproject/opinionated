It is not contended that they are included in the terms 1: meat, milk or fish,\u201d or \u201cfood,\u201d or \u201cdrugs, medicine or surgical appliances.\u201d The contention is that these articles come within the exemption of \u201c necessity \u201d; but so broad a construction of that word would abrogate the statute. The motions for injunctions are denied, and in' the case where temporary injunctions have been granted they are dissolved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
