The relator sought a mandamus to compel the superintendent of the insurance department to issue a certificate of authority to its agents to effect marine as well as fire insurances. <em>Held, </em>that a- mandamus should be refused.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-11\">The relator, an insurance corporation of Rhode Island admitted to New York State to do a fire insurance business, applied for a mandamus directed to Charles Gr. Fairman as superintendent of the insurance department of the State of New York, requiring him to issue a certificate of authority to relator\u2019s agent, to do also the business of marine insurance within the State of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-12\">It appeared from an agreed statement of facts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the relator was a corporation created in 1860 under the laws of Rhode Island and authorized by its charter to .insure against risks, both of fire and marine casualties. In 1866 the relator obtained admission to do business as an insurer, in the State of New York, and from 1866 to 1870 the insurance department issued an authority to the relator\u2019s agents to do the business of fire insurance only. In 1870, 1871 and 1872 the department issued certificates of authority to relator\u2019s agents to do the business of both fire and marine insurance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-4\">In 1872 the relator notified the department that its capital had become impaired and that it would no longer effect risks in the State of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\">In 1873 the relator filed a new statement with the insurance department showing an unimpaired capital, whereupon the department again issued a certificate of authority to relator\u2019s designated agent, enabling relator to effect fire insurance only in New York State. ' The relator did not then again apply for a certificate of authority to take marine risks ; \u25a0 nor did it so apply from 1873 until 1881, when it designated an agent to do its business as a marine insurer and requested the superintendent of the insurance department to issue to such agent a certificate of authority to do such marine insurance. The superintendent refused to issue to the relator the certificate enabling it to do marine insurance. It was not made a ground of .objection to relator\u2019s admission to do a marine insurance business that it had failed to comply with the insurance laws of New York, or that it was not in a condition of solvency. The superintendent asserted that he had a discretion under the law, to grant to, or to withhold from, foreign insurance companies the certificate demanded by relator, and that this particular superintendent had never issued certificates of authority to insurance companies of other States enabling them to effect both fire and marine insurance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Thereupon the relator applied by motion to the supreme court for a peremptory writ of mandamus compelling the superintendent to issue a certificate of authority to relator to effect marine insurances in the state of New York. The court at special term, on April 13,1882, denied the relators motion for a mandamus, Avhich denial was subsequently affirmed on appeal, at a general term in the supreme court for the third department on February 10, 1883, and on the further appeal, by the court of appeals, on May 8, 1883. Neither the supreme court at general term nor the court of appeals rendered any further opinion than that reported below.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-5\"><em>Edward D. McCarthy </em>and <em>Robert Ludlow </em>Fowler, for relator and appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABF\">I. The writ of mandamus is the <em>appropriate </em>remedy (People <em>ex rel. </em>Lawrence <em>v. </em>Supervisors of Westchester, 73 N. <em>Y. </em>173; People <em>ex rel. </em>Schenectady Astron. Observ. v. Allen, 42 <em>Id. </em>404). The superintendent\u2019s duty is ministerial, not judicial, as he has no discretion in this case <em>(Laws </em>1859, c. 366 ; <em>Laws </em>1853, c. 466, \u00a7 23, amended 1862, c. 367, \u00a7 5; <em>Laws </em>1849, as modified by Laws, 1853, c. 463, \u00a7 22; <em>Laws </em>1859, c. 366, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 8).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-6\">II. The relator was admitted into this State prior to 1873, and in construing the original license to relator, it must be assumed that the business of insurance was a valid business recognized by the common law. Any statute regarding the original license, its duration and effect must be construed in reference to the principles of the common law (People <em>ex rel. </em>Osterhout <em>v. </em>Perry, 13 <em>Barb. </em>206). The fact that the relator was required to file an annual statement and to take out a renewal certificate of authority did not define the duration of the original license to relator. The original license to do business, being for an indefinite time, was for the period of relator\u2019s corporate existence or until the State by a general law shall otherwise limit the license.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>III. The relator\u2019s charter enabling it to effect both fire and marine insurances, in so far as'these chartered powers are consistent with the domestic policy of this State, the relator is entitled to have such chartered power recognized and protected by comity (Merrick v. Van Santvoord, 34 <em>N. Y. </em>208).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-5\">IV. There is no manifestation of any policy on the part of the State to exclude foreign corporations simply because they effect both fire and marine insurances. The court should not imply such a policy from c. 490, Laws of 1879, acts relating to domestic insurance corporations only (Oakley 0. Aspinwall, 3 <em>N. Y. </em>547, 568). This would be to prohibit by inference a foreign corporation from pursuing a valid common law business, in this State. The principle of sovereignty has not gone so far as to raise a principle of exclusion by inference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-6\">V. Chapter 593 of the Laws of 1873, conferring power on the superintendent in his judgment to refuse admission to any insurance corporation of another State, when such refusal shall best promote the interest of the people of this State, has no relation to the <em>status </em>of relator, as it was admitted prior to the passage of this act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">VI. Chapter 593 of the Laws of 1873 is in any event unconstitutional, because it delegates a legislative power to the superintendent of the insurance department (Barto v. Himrod, 8 <em>N. Y. </em>483, 491, 492; Bradley <em>v. </em>Baxter, 15 <em>Barb. </em>123).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-8\"><em>Austin A. Yates, </em>for respondent Fairman (superintendent Of insurance).</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANE\">I. The issuance or refusal of a certificate or a renewal certificate of authority is a matter of discretion with the superintendent of insurance <em>{Laws </em>1853, c. 463, \u00a7 22 ; <em>Id. </em>c. 466, \u00a7 28 ; <em>Laws </em>1873, c. 593, \u00a7 2). Mandamus can compel action,' but it cannot control discretion (Hutchinson v. Comm\u2019r of Canal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Fund, 25 <em>Wend. </em>692 ; 26 <em>Id. </em>658 ; 18 <em>Id. </em>78 ; People <em>ex rel. </em>Taylor v. Brennan, 39 <em>Barb. </em>522, 651).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\">II. The relator was not admitted to do business in this State, for more than one year <em>(vide </em>Hartford Life and Ann. Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Fairman,' decided special term, September, 1882); but even if it was originally admitted for a longer term the relator voluntarily retired from this State in 1872, and when it was re-admitted in-1873, it was only permitted to do fire insurance business, and it has never since effected marine risks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">* III. The doctrine of comity will not admit this company to do a class of business prohibited to New York corporations by the statute of New York. The admission of foreign insurance companies is an act of indulgence (Paul <em>v. </em>Virginia, 8 <em>Wall. </em>166) and not of right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-7\">IV. The superintendent is forbidden by law <em>(Laws </em>1879, c. 490, \u00a7 2) to issue the certificate sought.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b298-8\">Landon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AD\">The superintendent of insurance upon the application of the relator considered its request to be permitted to do a marine insurance business within this State and refused it. If a mandamus would lie against the superintendent in a matter of this nature, it would be to compel him to consider the relator\u2019s application and act upon it. The mandamus is therefore not necessary. Whether the determination of the superintendent upon the petition, and the facts applicable thereto, may be reviewed by this court upon certiorari or appeal is a question not now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Motion for mandamus denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
