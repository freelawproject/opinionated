The defendant Doyle suffered default. The cause was noticed for trial for \u201ca jury or trial term,\u201d as stated in the printed case, and a trial by jury having been waived, it was tried before a judge without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Upon the trial the plaintiff gave evidence tending to prove all the allegations contained in the complaint, his only witness being Doyle ; and the defendant Cnrley, as a witness in his own behalf, gave evidence tending to show that the mortgages were given in good faith to secure an indebtedness actually due him.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The trial judge found all of the allegations of fact contained in the complaint to be substantially true. Among his findings of fact was one \u201c that said chattel mortgages were made by said Doyle, and received by said Curley, with the intent to hinder, delay and defraud this plaintiff and said Fitzsimmons of their lawful suits, damages, debts and demands,\u201d and he found as conclusions of law that the mortgages were fraudulent and void as against the plaintiff, and were made with the intent to hinder, delay and defraud him, and that they did hinder, delay and defraud him in the collection of his claim, and that by reason thereof he suffered damage to the amount of his judgment; that the defendant Curley was liable jointly with Doyle for the amount of plaintiff\u2019s damages, and he directed1 that judgment he entered in favor of plaintiff and against the defendants for the amount of the judgment, with interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The defendant Curley filed exceptions to the findings of the judge and his refusals to find as requested, and appealed from the judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff to the general term, and there the judgment was reversed, and a new trial granted for errors of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>It appears from the opinion pronounced at the general term that the action was there treated, not as a creditor\u2019s bill, but as an action at law to recover damages for the fraud alleged, and the conclusion reached was that such an action could not be sustained, and the decision of the general term was sought by Curley\u2019s counsel to be sustained in his argument before us upon the same ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">We are of opinion, that the learned general term fell into error. The complaint contains all the allegations requisite for what is commonly called a creditor\u2019s bill, to wit: that the plaintiff was a creditor of Doyle, having a judgment and execution returned unsatisfied ; that the mortgages were executed by Doyle with the intent to . hinder, delay and defraud his creditors, and that Curley had converted the mortgaged property by a sale, and had taken the proceeds to his use. The facts alleged, show that the mortgages'were void as to the plaintiff, and the only relief the plaintiff needed was that Curley should pay him out of the money received by him from the debtor\u2019s property, or to the extent of the value of such property taken and converted by him. Hence there can be no reasonable objection to the judgment prayed for. Even if the prayer for judgment was defective for equitable relief, an answer having been interposed, the plaintiff could have any relief \u201cconsistent with the case made by the complaint, and embraced within the issues\u201d (Code, \u00a71207). Under our present system of practice a plaintiff is not to be turned out of court when an answer has been interposed, because he has prayed for too much or too little, or for wrong relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">It matters not that the cause was noticed for trial at a jury term. It does not appear that either party claimed that the action was a legal action, triable by a jury. It was, in fact, tried by the judge, just as equitable actions are required to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>No claim was made, upon the trial, that this was not an equitable action. The judge found all the facts requisite to sustain a creditor\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">It is said that there was no proof that the execution was returned before the commencement of the action. But it does not appear when the action was commenced. The summons is dated October 12, 1878, and the complaint was sworn to on the same day, and alleges that the execution had been issued, and returned unsatisfied. It was proved that the execution was returned in the usual form, unsatisfied, on October 12,1878, and the judge found that it was returned before the commencement of the action. There was no claim at the trial that the execution was returned after the commencement of the action, and we think that the finding, that it was returned before, was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">There was proof sufficient to justify a finding, that the property taken by Curley was worth much more than the plaintiff\u2019s judgment. At the time the first mortgage was given, in 1872, the property mortgaged was worth upwards of $3,000. No other proof as to its value was given. There was no claim, upon the trial, and no request to find, that it was not worth, at least, the amount of plaintiff\u2019s claim ; and, in the absence of other proof, the judge was justified in finding, as we must assume he did, that it was worth, when taken and converted by Curley, at least that sum. It cannot be alleged, for legal error, that the judge based his decision upon the evidence of Doyle, which was in direct conflict with that of Curley. That conflict raised a question of credibility, which was to be settled by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">There can be no valid objection to the form of the judgment ordered. Curley did not ask that any other judgment should be given to the plaintiff. He did not claim that any accounting should be ordered between him and Doyle, or as to the proceeds of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>sold by him. He gave all the proof he desired to defeat plaintiff\u2019s action. Under the circumstances of the case, this judgment for the recovery of the precise sum of money claimed, was the proper judgment, and the form of the judgment does not stamp this as a legal, rather than an equitable action. A court of equity adapts its relief to the exigencies of the case in hand. It may restrain or compel the defendant, it may appoint a receiver, or order an accounting; may compel specific performance, or order the delivery to the plaintiff of specific real or personal property, or it may order a sum of money to be paid to the plaintiff, and give him a personal judgment therefor. Here no accounting was needed. Even if something was honestly due from Doyle to Gurley, on account of the fraud, Curley could not retain the property, or use its proceeds against a pursuing creditor to pay his debt. The -transaction between him and Boyle was, as to the plaintiff, void, and he could take no benefit from it. The plaintiff was the vigilant creditor, and had priority over other creditors, if there were any. But there appears to have been but one other creditor of Boyle, and that one Fitzimmons, and his claim was apparently barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Besides, the property was sufficient to pay the plaintiff Fitzsimmons, and Curley. Under such circumstances, all the relief that plaintiff needed was to compel Curley to pay him. There-was no property to be sold. He had converted it, and had the proceeds. Ho receiver was needed, and there were no accounts to be taken or stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The judgment ordered was therefore proper. The order of the general term should be reversed, and the judgment of the trial term affirmed, with costs</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">All the judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
