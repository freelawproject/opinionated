At that time she made a cash payment of $71.05 (including a $10.00 deposit on February 8, 1944), and traded in a (used 1936 Plymouth) car, for which she was allowed $63.80 ($135.00 for the car, less a lien of $71.20), leaving a balance of $363.60, to be paid in 12 (monthly) instalments of $30.30 each. On February 21st the defendants paid the lien on the Plymouth and got the certificate of title from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>lienor, and also began repairs and improvements to the Plymouth which cost about $200. The plaintiff had not assigned the certificate; the defendants did not ask her to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The plaintiff signed a \u201cconditional sale contract,\u201d dated February 19, 1944, between \u201cthe undersigned Seller\u201d and \u201cthe undersigned Buyer,\u201d on a printed form prepared by counsel for the Automobile Trade Association of Maryland in triplicate, containing \u201cinstructions to dealer\u201d to \u201cgive pink copy to buyer, retain green copy, white copy is for record\u201d and that the form \u201cmust be made out in triplicate, all blanks filled in.\u201d The plaintiff received a carbon copy, designated \u201cbuyer\u2019s copy,\u201d bearing her signature to the contract and also to an \u201cacknowledgment by buyer,\u201d viz.: \u201cBuyer hereby acknowledges receipt of an exact, executed copy of this contract at time of execution hereof.\u201d She testified that she never received any other copy of the contract; this testimony is uncontradicted. One of the defendants testified that her copy was \u201ca copy they usually give\u201d the buyer. This copy does not bear the defendants\u2019 signature or their names. Cf. Code, 1943 Supplement, Art. 83, Sec. 117 (a). It contains unfilled blanks for mention and description of the traded-in car [cf. Sec. 117(a) (4)], for the time of the instalment payments [cf. Sec. 117(a) (10)], for \u201cdate of signature of buyer,\u201d name and signature of seller and addresses of both [cf. Sec. 117(a)], besides several correct figures <em>(e. g., </em>\u201cfinance charge\u201d and cost of insurance) in wrong blanks [cf. Sec. 117 (a) (6) (9)].) There is no evidence that the plaintiff was prejudiced by the fact that the copy received by her was not \u201csigned by the seller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The plaintiff soon became dissatisfied with the Packard. After taking it back to the defendants several times for correction of alleged defects, on February 24th she left it with the defendants and asked for \u201cher money back\u201d and the Plymouth. The defendants refused to comply with her request, but did not tell her they had made repairs or improvements on the Plymouth. She did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>then mention the Retail Instalment Sales Act. On February 28th they wrote her that they had \u201crepossessed\u201d the Packard \u201cas of February 26, 1944,\u201d and that \u201cto redeem it\u201d she \u201cmust pay off the entire balance of $368.60.\u201d As she was not then in default, they say this letter was a \u201cmistake\u201d \u2014 which they did nothing to correct. She consulted counsel and demanded, under the Retail Instalment Sales Act, a refund of all payments and deposits made. On March 11th the defendants\u2019 counsel wrote the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that \u201cthere has been no departure from any law which entitles your client to the action demanded\u201d; the letter did not mention the Plymouth. On March 21st the defendants wrote the plaintiff that she had \u201cdefaulted\u201d in her \u201cfirst note payment\u201d on the Packard. Later they sold the Packard for $395.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">On April 24th the plaintiff brought suit under the Speedy Judgment Act for $134.85 (the cash payment of $71.05 plus the allowance of $63.80 for the Plymouth), claimed under the Retail Instalment Sales Act (Art. 83, Sec. 116, Acts of 1941, Ch. 851). The defendants disputed the whole claim. Trial before the court without a jury resulted in a verdict and judgment for the defendants, from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The Retail Instalment Sales Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC1\">\u201c116. (Form and Delivery of Instalment Sale Agreements.) (a) Every instalment sale agreement shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing containing all of the agreements of the parties. It shall be signed by all the parties before the seller delivers to the buyer any of the goods covered by the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">\u201c (b) At or before the time the buyer signs the instrument, the seller shall deliver to him an exact copy of it. If that copy was not executed by the seller, then unless the seller within fifteen (15) days after the buyer has signed, delivers to him a copy of the instrument signed by the seller, the agreement and the instruments signed by the buyer shall be absolutely void without any action by the buyer, and the seller shall immediately refund to the buyer all payments and deposits theretofore made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\u25a0 \u201c(c) Until the buyer signs an instalment sale agreement and receives a copy of it signed by the seller\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">\u201c(1) The buyer or prospective buyer has an unconditional right to cancel the agreement or prospective agreement and to receive immediate refund of all payments and deposits made on account of or in contemplation of the agreement; a request for such refund shall operate to cancel the agreement or prospective agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">\u201c(d) Any written acknowledgment of delivery of a copy of an instrument shall be printed in 12-point bold type or larger and, if contained in the agreement, shall be printed immediately below the signature to the agreement and shall be independently signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">\u201c135. (Waivers by the Buyer.) No act, agreement, or statement of any buyer in any instalment agreement, shall constitute a valid waiver of any benefit or protection under the provisions of this sub-title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\">\u201c136. (Violations of Sections 116, 117, 118.) (a) Whenever an instalment sale agreement does not contain the material required by Sections 116 and 117 of this sub-title or the seller fails to deliver a copy to the buyer, no seller or holder of such agreement shall collect or receive any finance, delinquency or collection charge from the buyer, except that a written acknowledgment of the delivery of the contract by the buyer pursuant to Section 116 shall be conclusive proof of such delivery as between the buyer and any assignee of the instalment agreement, without actual knowledge to the contrary. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">At the argument counsel differed in their interpretation of the trial court\u2019s \u201cbrief statement of the grounds of its decision.\u201d General Rules of Practice and Procedure, Trials, Rule 9(a). We have considered all grounds suggested by the trial court or by counsel, but we are unable to concur in the conclusion. This Court \u201cmay review upon both the law and .the evidence\u201d and \u201cmay affirm, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>verse, modify or remand, as in appeals from equity.\u201d Rule 9, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The Retail Instalment Sales Act was enacted in 1941. after extended consideration and investigation. Joint Resolution No. 8 of 1939 directed that the subject be investigated by the Legislative Council, who were to report their findings to the next regular session of the General Assembly. The Council referred the matter to its Research Division, which made a study and a report indicating that legislation was desirable. The Council, after a hearing and further consideration, had a bill prepared and recommended its passage. The Retail Instalment Sales Act is the bill submitted by the Council, with amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The Research Report (No. 6, September, 1940) reviews regulation in other jurisdictions, especially recent legislation, generally similar but differing in details, in Indiana, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Michigan and England. Indiana, Retail Instalment Sales Act, Acts of 1935, Ch. 231, Burns Indiana Statutes Annotated, Title 58, Ch. 9, Secs. 59-901 <em>et seq.; </em>Wisconsin, Acts of 1935, Ch. 474, Wisconsin Statutes (1941) 218.01; Massachusetts, St. 1939, c. 509, Annotated Laws of Massachuetts, c. 255, Secs. 11-13H; Michigan, Motor Vehicle Retail Instalment Sales Contracts, Act 305, 1939, Michigan Statutes Annotated, Secs. 19.435(1) to 19.415(34); England, Hire-Purchase Act, 1938 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 6, c. 53), Halsbury\u2019s Statutes of England, Vol. 31, p. 659. This legislation reflects the view that \u201cimprovident and careless consumers who buy on the instalment plan need legal protection\u201d (Report of Committee on Consumers Credit, Massachusetts, 1936), and that without such protection \u201cin the usual case the buyer probably is discouraged from reading the contract and might not fully understand its terms even if he did read it.\u201d This legislation aims to eliminate \u201ccontract abuses\u201d by requiring the contract to be in writing, to be delivered to the purchaser within a definite period, to contain certain information and not to contain certain provisions. Research Report No. 6. Thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the Maryland act aims not only to prevent actual frauds <em>(Cooke v. Real Estate Trust Co., </em>180 Md. 133, 139, 22 A. 2d 554), but to close avenues to fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The legislative history of the act, and both the similarities and the differences between , such legislation in different jurisdictions, indicate that the words of the act were chosen with care. Section 116(b) and (c) (1) are inore explicit \u2014 more drastic perhaps \u2014 than corresponding provisions in other jurisdictions. This Court cannot mitigate these provisions by assuming a dispensing power not conferred by the act <em>(cf. Hire-Purchase Act, 1938, </em>Sec. 2, <em>supra), </em>or by creating exceptions or artificial estoppels which would shift upon the buyer the seller\u2019s responsibility for neglect to comply with statutory requirements designed for the buyer\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">It is not necessary to decide whether the words of the plaintiff\u2019s acknowledgment of \u201creceipt of an exact, executed copy of this contract at the time of execution hereof\u201d mean \u201cexecuted by some party\u201d or \u201cexecuted by all parties,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>whether they mean less or more than \u201cexecuted by the seller.\u201d Except in favor of an assignee without knowledge, the acknowledgment is not conclusive. The contract itself (on which the acknowledgment was signed) shows that it was not executed by the seller \u201cat time of execution\u201d of the acknowledgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The defendants could not, by making repairs or improvements on the Plymouth, prevent rescission or \u201ccancellation\u201d of the contract of sale of the Packard. The plaintiff sued, not for return of the Plymouth but for \u201crefund of all payments and deposits,\u201d including the \u201ctrade-in allowance\u201d of $63.80 for the Plymouth. The Act requires recital of the \u201cdown payment, whether made in cash or represented by the agreed value of goods or both.\u201d Section 117(a) (4). The contract accordingly treats the \u201ctrade-in allowance\u201d as part of the \u201cdown payment,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>as cash from sale of the Plymouth. The defendants cannot complain of the plaintiff\u2019s willingness to treat the sales of the Packard and the Plymouth as separable.' It is not necessary to consider questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>which would have been presented if the plaintiff had sued for return of the Plymouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The defendants are not, by their neglect to obtain an assignment of title to the Plymouth, absolved of neglect to comply with the act. Presumably such an assignment is to be had for the asking; if not, the defendants (upon payment of the judgment in the instant case) will have whatever remedies they would have had if the act had not been passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">On the facts, under the plain words of Section 116(c) of the act the plaintiff is entitled to recover \u201call payments and deposits made,\u201d including the \u201ctrade-in allowance.\u201d We leave open any questions as to the construction or application of Section 116(a) or (b) or 117 in the instant case or on different facts. <em>Cf. Lehan v. North Main Street Garage, </em>312 Mass. 547, 45 N. E. 2d 945, 144 A. L. R. 1100 and annotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and judgment entered for the appellant for $134.85 plus interest from April 24, 1944 to date of entry of judgment, with costs and a counsel fee of $50.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
