Ali concedes deportability, but argues his notice to appear violated Immigration and National Service (\u201cINS\u201d) regulations. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 239.1 (indicating those officials authorized to issue a notice to appear). Therefore, he argues his removal proceedings should have been terminated. For the reasons below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-25\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b569-26\">Ali is a native and citizen of Pakistan. He was admitted to the United States in Dallas, Texas on September 1, 2000 as a non-immigrant visitor for a period not to exceed six months. In April 2001, he allegedly filed a labor certification, which is currently pending. The Immigration Judge, however, noted that there was no record of this filing and, therefore, did not find it sufficient to warrant a continuance of Ali\u2019s deportation proceeding. On March 11, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) personally served Ali <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>with a notice to appear, charging that he was deportable under the INA as an alien who remained in the United States for a longer time period than permitted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">At the hearing, Ali admitted that he was removable as charged. However, he argued that the notice to appear was defective and, therefore, the proceeding should be terminated. The notice that was filed with the immigration court was signed by Robert Haldeman, Acting Assistant District Director for Investigations (\u201cADDI\u201d), a Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) official who was authorized to issue a notice to appear. The copy that was served upon Ali, however, was signed on behalf of Haldeman by Special Agent David Brown who is not authorized to issue the notice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The notice, identical to the one given to Ali, was then signed by Haldeman and filed with the immigration court. The immigration court gave Ali a copy of the second notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">At the hearing, DHS filed an affidavit prepared by Tina Tucker, an ADDI, who detailed INA procedures for issuing notices to appear. She stated that when a DHS Special Agent under the supervision of an ADDI issues a notice to appear to an alien, he must first attempt to make contact with the ADDI to obtain the ADDI\u2019s signature on the notice (either in person or by telephone). If the ADDI is unavailable, the Special Agent gives the alien copy of the notice without the ADDI\u2019s signature or a copy that he has signed for the ADDI. Either way, the ADDI\u2019s name is typewritten under the signature line of the notice on the copy given to the alien. A copy is then given to the ADDI, who signs it, and then filed with the Immigration Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1239.1(a) provides that, \u201cEvery removal proceeding conducted under section 240 of the Act (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a) to determine the deportability or inadmissibility of an alien is commenced by the filing of a notice to appear with the immigration court.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 239.1 then details which officers are authorized to \u201cissue\u201d the notice to appear. Included on the list are district directors. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 239.1(a)(1). The Petitioner argues that the term \u201cissue\u201d is synonymous with \u201csign\u201d and, therefore, a notice that is not signed directly by a listed officer is not valid. However, the INS interprets this regulation to permit special agents to sign the name of the issuing official, provided that the official specifically approves the issuance and authorizes the affixing of his signature on the notices. <em>Cf. Diaz-Soto v. INS, </em>797 F.2d 262, 263 (5th Cir.1986) (noting that the INS interprets 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.1, which governs issuance of orders to show cause, in a similar manner).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">We consider whether the INS correctly interpreted its own regulation. An agency\u2019s interpretation of the statutes and regulations it administers should be given great deference. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903-04 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)). When reviewing the construction and application of agency regulations, the Court must give \u201ccontrolling weight\u201d to the agency\u2019s interpretation unless it \u201c \u2018is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Larionoff, </em>431 U.S. 864, 872, 97 S.Ct. 2150, 53 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977) (quoting <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945)).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">In <em>Diaz-Soto, </em>we noted that \u201cissue\u201d is not the equivalent of \u201csign.\u201d 797 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>at 264. \u201cConceptually, \u2018issue\u2019 is, as suggested by the INS, more akin to \u2018authorize\u2019 than to the mechanics of signature-affixing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulation, providing for the special agent to initially sign the notice so long as he later obtains approval from an authorized official, comports with the language of the regulation. Ali\u2019s notice then did not violate 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 239.1 and the immigration court properly denied Ali\u2019s request to terminate his removal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Ali also challenges the notice on due process grounds. However, because Ali concedes deportability, he has not shown that any prejudice resulted from the ADDI\u2019s failure to personally sign the notice to appear. Therefore, there is no due process violation. <em>See id. </em>at 264; <em>Chike v. INS, </em>948 F.2d 961, 962 (stating that \u201c \u2018proof of a denial of due process ... requires a showing of substantial prejudice\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Ka Fung Chan v. INS, </em>634 F.2d 248 (5th Cir.1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\">.
