The Government asserts the sentence is unreasonable, and the district court should have sentenced within the United States Sentencing Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. We find Williams\u2019 90-month sentence reasonable, and affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-19\">Williams met with an undercover agent and two other individuals in December 2003, at which time Williams agreed to sell the agent half of a crack cocaine \u201ccookie\u201d for $350. The cookie was found to weigh five grams. Williams pled guilty to one count of possessing with intent to distribute and distributing five grams or more of a mixture containing crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B)(iii). The presentence investigation report (PSI) set an advisory base offense level under the Guidelines at 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c)(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Three levels were subtracted pursuant to an acceptance of responsibility adjustment under \u00a7 3E1.1. The calculation for the total offense level was 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-20\">Williams met the qualifications for a career offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>because he had two prior felony convictions for either crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses with a statutory penalty of 25 years or more, which raised Williams\u2019 total offense level to 34. The two prior felonies cited for this enhancement were (1) possession of cocaine with intent to sell or deliver, and (2) carrying a concealed firearm. The PSI then included the 3-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility and calculated the enhanced offense level to be 31. Williams\u2019 criminal history category was V, which automatically increased to VI because \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender status applied. The mandatory minimum term of imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) was 5 years and the maximum term was 40 years, but based on the total enhanced offense level of 31 and criminal history category of VI the Guidelines range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">Williams objected to the PSI\u2019s application of the \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement on the ground his prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon was not a crime of violence. Williams maintained his prior offense could not meet the requirements to apply the career offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1. At the sentencing hearing, Williams reiterated this argument and asserted <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.1998), should not apply to his situation. Williams urged the court to take a more individualized approach to his sentence, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">The Government asserted the district court should apply the \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement and sentence Williams within the' resulting Guidelines range because <em>Gilbert </em>was still good law in this circuit. The Government further contended the career offender enhancement was appropriate (1) given the numerous offenses Williams had committed previously, and (2) because controlled substance offenses and crimes of violence require more severe sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-10\">The district court first noted the PSI incorrectly set the base offense level at 32 when the offense only involved 5 grams of crack cocaine. The court found the correct base offense level was 26. The court applied <em>Gilbert, </em>and thus the career offender enhancement. The court found Williams\u2019 Guidelines range for a base offense level of 31 (34 career offender level minus 3 points for acceptance of responsibility) and a mandatory criminal history category of VI was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. After calculating the Guidelines range, the court turned to whether the circumstances of the particular case and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 required a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range or allowed a sentence outside that range. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-11\">I think, in light of <em>Booker, </em>... the Court is still required \u2014 and I give considerable deference and weight to the [Gjuidelines because a great deal of thought and research and time has gone into developing them, and I think it\u2019s a worthy goal to try to obtain some degree of consistency throughout the country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-12\">On the other hand, there are occasions when the [Gjuidelines simply produce an unjust result; and, in my view ... 188 months in prison for selling $350 worth of cocaine is akin to the life sentence for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>the guy that stole a loaf of bread in California. To me, that ... does not promote respect for the law and is way out of proportion to the seriousness of the offense and to [Williams\u2019] prior criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">The court also found a criminal history category of V sufficiently accounted for Williams\u2019 previous crimes. The court stated in this instance, \u201cthe [Guidelines ... do not produce a just and reasonable result.\u201d It found the difference between sentences within the Guidelines range with the enhancement and without the enhancement was too disparate to ignore. Specifically, a base offense level of 23 (26 minus 3 points for acceptance of responsibility) with a criminal history category of V resulted in a Guidelines range of 84 to 105 months\u2019 imprisonment without the enhancement, while a base offense level of 31 (34 minus 3 points for acceptance of responsibility) with a criminal history category of VI resulted in a Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment with the enhancement. The court pointed out its own sentencing record post <em>-Booker, </em>noting it rarely ventured to impose a sentence outside the Guidelines, but it could not \u201cin good conscience\u201d sentence Williams to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment because it was unreasonable. The court sentenced Williams to 90 months\u2019 imprisonment and 4 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-7\">\u201c \u2018The district court\u2019s interpretation of the [Sentencing [Gjuidelines is subject to de novo review on appeal, while its factual findings must be accepted unless clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). Under <em>Booker, </em>we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 765-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-10\">Before deciding whether a sentence is reasonable, we first determine whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied the Guidelines to calculate the appropriate advisory Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (noting \u201cthe district court remains obliged to \u2018consult\u2019 and \u2018take into account\u2019 the Guidelines in sentencing\u201d). \u201cAfter it has made this calculation, the district court may impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as the sentence is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-11\">We are required \u201cto determine whether the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable in the context of the factors outlined in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ].\u201d <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c \u2018Section 3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing. Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 766). \u201cThese factors include the available sentences, the applicable Guideline range, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, and provide the defendant with needed medical care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, a laundry list of \u00a7 3553(a) factors is not required because \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">A. <em>Application of Guidelines</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">The Government asserts the district court effectively ignored this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Gilbert </em>by declining to impose a career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The Government contends the refusal to follow <em>Gilbert </em>exceeded the district court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-6\">In <em>Gilbert, </em>we held \u201ccarrying a concealed weapon in violation of Florida law is a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(1),\u201d requiring application of the career offender enhancement. 138 F.3d at 1372. We extended the reasoning of <em>United States v. Hall, </em>77 F.3d 398, 401 (11th Cir.1996), which held carrying a concealed weapon creates a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury\u201d and qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the federal armed career criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d at 1372 (\u201cBecause the definitions of \u2018violent felony\u2019 and \u2018crime of violence\u2019 are in this respect identical, Hall\u2019s conclusion applies equally to the question at hand here.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-7\">The court correctly found the resulting Guidelines range for a base offense level of 31 (the 34 career offender level minus 3 points for acceptance of responsibility) and a mandatory criminal history category of VI is 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court specifically acknowledged that under our precedent in <em>Gilbert, </em>Williams qualified for the \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement and applied that enhancement. Having correctly calculated the advisory Guidelines range, including the career offender enhancement, the court was then able to sentence Williams outside the applicable range, if the final sentence was reasonable. <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1179. The Government\u2019s assertion the district court effectively ignored <em>Gilbert </em>by not applying the career offender enhancement is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-10\">B. <em>Reasonableness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-11\">The Government contends Williams\u2019 final sentence of 90 months\u2019 imprisonment is less than half the lowest sentence within the applicable Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment and is, therefore, unreasonable. The Government further asserts the district court merely \u201cin-canted\u201d the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and chose to ignore them, rather than allow the provisions to limit and inform its discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-12\">Determining whether a sentence is reasonable is not a new analysis for this Court. We have reviewed sentences for reasonableness in the context of departures from the Guidelines range before <em>Booker </em>was decided. <em>See e.g., United States v. Melvin, </em>187 F.3d 1316, 1322-23 (11th Cir.1999) (noting in determining whether the amount of the departure is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>reasonable we must review for reasonableness in light of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and the reasons given by the district court); <em>United States v. Nilsen, </em>967 F.2d 539, 546 (11th Cir.1992) (same); <em>United States v. Valle, </em>929 F.2d 629, 633 (11th Cir.1991) (same); <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>920 F.2d 1570, 1573 (11th Cir.1991) ( \u201c[T]he direction and degree of the departure must ... be measured by a standard of reasonableness. In this vein, we must be mindful of the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence, as set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ], and evaluate these in light of the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence as stated by the district court.\u201d) (internal quotations, footnote, and citations omitted). The principles established from these cases are that when reviewing for reasonableness we must consider both the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the reasons given by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">Applying these same principles here, the district court\u2019s statements over the course of the sentencing hearing show it weighed the factors in \u00a7 3553 and took into account Williams\u2019 individual history and the nature of the charge against him when it determined to sentence him to a lower term. The court concluded its final sentence of 90 months\u2019 imprisonment was \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to punish, deter, and rehabilitate Williams. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court repeatedly stated it thought a sentence of 188 months was unreasonable for a crime involving the sale of only $350 of crack cocaine. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (stating the court shall consider \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed \u2014 to reflect the seriousness of the offense ... and to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d). The court stated that normally sentencing would be within the Guidelines range because the advisory range usually reflected the policies encapsulated in \u00a7 3553(a). However, the court found the disparity of as much as 151 months between the low end of the unenhanced range and the high end of the enhanced range was problematic. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(3) (stating the court shall consider \u201cthe kinds of sentences available\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-9\">Section 3553(a)(1) states the court shall consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d Here, the court stated a criminal history category of V, which it characterized as a \u201cpretty high level,\u201d adequately accounted for Williams\u2019 past crimes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court disagreed with a \u201cmechanistic application\u201d of the Guidelines in Williams\u2019 case. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2), (3). Moreover, the court noted giving Williams a longer sentence would not promote respect for the law. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2). Additionally, Williams\u2019 final sentence is 2-1/2 years longer than the 5-year mandatory statutory minimum and nearly 1/5 of the 40-year statutory maximum. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246 (holding a sentence 1/10 the length of the 20-year statutory maximum sentence was reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-10\">This is not a case where the district court imposed a non-Guidelines sentence based solely on its disagreement with the Guidelines. In this case, the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range and gave specific, valid reasons for sentencing lower than the advisory range. Applying the principles of review in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the reasons given by the district court, the 90-month sentence imposed was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">The district court correctly calculated the advisory Guidelines range, including the enhancement. The district court also considered the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 and the specific facts surrounding the instant case, and then decided to impose a sentence lower than the advisory range. The district court did not act unreasonably when it sentenced Williams to a term lower than the advisory Guidelines range. We conclude Williams\u2019 sentence is reasonable and affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1375-12\">. This is the incorrect base offense level for five grams of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>\u00a7 2D 1.1 (c)(4) (citing a base offense level of 32 for at least <em>SO </em>grams of cocaine base). The correct base offense level for at least 5 grams should have been 26 according to \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1378-8\">. The Government also contends Williams' sentence cannot be justified as a downward departure on the ground the career offender enhancement overrepresented Williams\u2019 criminal history because Williams never moved for a downward departure on that basis, and that a departure for overrepresentation of criminal history is limited to one criminal history category. These contentions are without merit. The district court's sentence does not have to be justified as a downward departure. After <em>Booker, </em>the sentencing Guidelines are advisory, and the sentencing court, in its own discretion, can move below the advisory Guidelines range without a motion for downward departure as long as the resulting sentence is reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">. The uncontroverted evidence in the PSI is that Williams was convicted of carrying a concealed firearm when he was found with a handgun \"at his feet.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
