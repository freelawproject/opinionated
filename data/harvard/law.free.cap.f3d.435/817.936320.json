Belk decided that he could multiply his income through embezzlement. Over the years he siphoned more than $675,000 from Rogge\u2019s business, driving it into bankruptcy. Belk has been convicted of mail fraud, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, because several of the devices used to divert funds from Rogge\u2019s accounts to his own entailed mailings. Only the sentence \u2014 51 months\u2019 imprisonment plus $678,306.65 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>restitution to George C. Rogge Agency, Inc. \u2014 is contested on appeal.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b841-16\">Rehearing Denied Feb. 27, 2006.</p><p id=\"b842-21\">Before FLAUM, Chief Judge, and EASTERBROOK and MANION, Circuit Judges.</p><p id=\"b842-22\">EASTERBROOK, Circuit Judge.</p><p id=\"b843-5\">The eight counts of conviction stem from cheeks that diverted $60,600 from Rogge to Belk. He contends that the district court should have used this sum as both the loss, when performing the advisory Guidelines calculations, and the amount of restitution. The argument depends largely on the sixth amendment and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), but ignores the remedial portion of that decision, which concluded that judges may continue to make findings based on a preponderance of the evidence, provided that they do not treat the Sentencing Guidelines as \u201claws\u201d with binding effect. The district court, which sentenced Belk six months after <em>Booker, </em>applied that decision correctly. Belk does not deny that a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that the loss under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b) exceeds $400,000. His sentence of 51 months falls within a properly calculated range (51-63 months) for such a loss and so is presumptively appropriate. <em>United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606 (7th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725 (7th Cir. 2005). Belk does not offer us any reason to deem his sentence unreasonable, beyond his mistaken belief that the jury had to determine the loss.</p><p id=\"b843-6\">Belk\u2019s protest about the amount of restitution likewise fails to the extent it rests on <em>Booker, </em>for restitution lacks a \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d and the whole <em>Apprendi </em>framework (of which <em>Booker </em>is an instance) therefore is inapplicable. See, e.g., <em>United States v. George, </em>403 F.3d 470, 473 (7th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Behrman, </em>235 F.3d 1049, 1054 (7th Cir.2000). That the judge relied on hearsay is normal and appropriate in sentencing; Belk does not contend that this hearsay (which reflects the Rogge agency\u2019s financial records) was unreliable. The district judge was not obliged to explain why he ordered restitution while deeming Belk unable to pay a fine. Before 1996 such an explanation for apparently inconsistent conclusions was vital, see <em>United States v. Ahmad, </em>2 F.3d 245 (7th Cir.1993), but the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A, makes a judgment of restitution obligatory regardless of the defendant\u2019s current or anticipated ability to pay, so there is no inconsistency to explain.</p><p id=\"b843-8\">Restitution is limited to the loss caused by the crimes of which the defendant stands convicted, unless he agrees to pay more, which Belk did not. See \u00a7 3663A(a); <em>Hughey v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 411, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990); <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>268 F.3d 533 (7th Cir.2001). Belk contends that he has been convicted only of the eight mailings by which he extracted $60,600. That misunderstands the nature of a \u00a7 1341 conviction, however. The \u201ccrime\u201d covered by \u00a7 1341 is the <em>scheme </em>to defraud, not (just) the mailings that occur in the course of the scheme. This indictment laid out, and the jury convicted Belk of, a multi-year scheme to defraud Rogge\u2019s brokerage. The eight mailings were just overt acts. Restitution for the whole scheme is in order. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Mitrione, </em>357 F.3d 712, 721 (7th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>47 F.3d 198 (7th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Turino, </em>978 F.2d 315, 319 (7th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Brothers, </em>955 F.2d 493 (7th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>943 F.2d 738 (7th Cir.1991).</p><p id=\"b843-9\">We recognize that some decisions limited restitution orders to amounts entailed in those particular mailings that underlie particular counts. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Seligsohn, </em>981 F.2d 1418, 1421 (3d Cir. 1992). These decisions, however, did not consider the Crime Control Act of 1990, which vindicated our approach by defining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>as a \u201cvictim\u201d entitled to compensation \u201cany person directly harmed by the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\u201d 104 Stat. 483 (1990), amending 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663; see also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(2). Courts that have considered the 1990 amendments follow this circuit\u2019s approach, and the third circuit has abandoned <em>Seligsohn. </em>See <em>United States v. Hensley, </em>91 F.3d 274 (1st Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Kones, </em>77 F.3d 66, 68-70 (3d Cir.1996) (restitution is appropriate, notwithstanding <em>Seligsohn, </em>for losses \u201cdirectly\u201d caused by the entire scheme to defraud); <em>United States v. Stouffer, </em>986 F.2d 916 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>170 F.3d 617, 627 (6th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d 1264, 1276 n. 13 (11th Cir.2003). No decision that has taken account of the amendments made in 1990 and 1996 supports Belk\u2019s position.</p><p id=\"b844-4\">Even apart from the statutory definition of \u201cvictim,\u201d an approach that links restitution to the amount extracted by particular mailings is hard to reconcile with the fact that the fraud in a \u00a7 1341 offense need not be conducted through the mails. One who hatches a fraudulent scheme and uses the mails to carry truthful matter that is important to the scheme\u2019s success still violates the statute. A good example is the odometer-rollback scheme in <em>Schmuck v. United States, </em>489 U.S. 705, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989), in which the fraud was a false representation to the purchasers that led them to pay too much for used cars, while the mails were used to send documents that enabled the defendant to transfer titles to the cars\u2019 buyers. On the view for which Belk contends, there could be no restitution for such schemes, because none of the mailings diverted any funds. Yet the fraudulent scheme would remain, and a criminal scheme that imposes loss may (and after 1996 must) lead to an award that makes the victim whole.</p><p id=\"b844-6\">Affirmed</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
