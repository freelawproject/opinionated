After the conclusion of discovery, New South Federal Savings Bank (New South) moved for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of New South on all grounds on November 4, 2008. <em>See Johnson v. New S. Fed. Sav. Bank, </em>No. 3:07-cv-314, 2008 WL 4829879 (S.D.Miss. Nov. 4, 2008). Johnson appeals the denial of her claims, with the exclusion of the RESPA claim which she has dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-17\">We review the district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standard as the district court. <em>Wyatt v. Hunt Plywood Co., </em>297 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir.2002). Summary judgment should be granted when there is \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); <em>Wyatt, </em>297 F.3d at 408-09. Although we \u201creview the evidence and any inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\u201d <em>S.E.C. v. Recile, </em>10 F.3d 1093, 1097 (5th Cir.1993), \u201c[cjonclu-sional allegations and denials, speculation, improbable inferences, unsubstantiated assertions, and legalistic argumentation do not adequately substitute for specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>TIG Ins. Co. v. Sedgwick James of Washington, </em>276 F.3d 754, 759 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-18\">Appellant\u2019s brief on appeal contains a number of rhetorical questions and impassioned arguments, but it fails to cure the defect which proved fatal to Appellant\u2019s case in the district court: Appellant provides no competent summary judgment evidence sufficient to demonstrate that a genuine issue for trial exists regarding the amount she paid in April, 2007 to avoid foreclosure. All of Appellant\u2019s claims ultimately turn on this point. We agree with Appellant\u2019s contention that New South\u2019s initial affidavit contained errors regarding the amount of taxes Appellant paid in 2002. However, this error was corrected in a supplemental affidavit. Appellant also alleges that discrepancies concerning checks returned to Johnson create a \u201cdis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>puted material fact.\u201d New South does not dispute the fact that it accepted Appellant\u2019s checks from January and February of 2006. As to both of these arguments, Appellant has produced no evidence at all to prove that the total she paid to avoid foreclosure was anything other than the correct amount owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">Finally, Appellant baldly argues with no support that the property in question was never actually insured during the relevant time due to New South\u2019s failure to list the correct address in the insurance it placed on the property. She has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Because the record contains no evidence upon which Appellant can raise a genuine issue of material fact, we conclude that the district court properly granted New South\u2019s motion for summary judgment. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b978-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
