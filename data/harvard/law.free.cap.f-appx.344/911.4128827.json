Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and moves for the appointment of counsel. In his complaint, he alleged that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs and alleged claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-18\">The district court dismissed sua sponte Chamberlain\u2019s deliberate indifference claims for failure to exhaust based on Chamberlain\u2019s admission at the <em>Spears</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing that he did not file administrative grievances at the regional and central office level during his incarceration at the Federal Correctional Institute, Big Spring.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-19\">In <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 216, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007), the Supreme Court held that an inmate\u2019s failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the Prison Litigation Reform Act and that \u201cinmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d This court recognizes that under <em>Jones </em>it is error for a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>court to use screening procedures, such as a <em>Spears </em>hearing, to resolve the question of exhaustion before a responsive pleading is filed. <em>See Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2007). Thus, under <em>Jones </em>and <em>Carbe, </em>the district court erred in dismissing sua sponte Chamberlain\u2019s deliberate indifference claims for failure to exhaust, and we therefore vacate that portion of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">The district court dismissed as frivolous Chamberlain\u2019s claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. A complaint is frivolous \u201cif it lacks an arguable basis in fact or law.\u201d Berry <em>v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). This court\u2019s review is for abuse of discretion. <em>See Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The Bureau of Prisons is an agency of the Department of Justice, which is within the executive branch of the government. <em>See United States v. Bourgeois, </em>423 F.3d 501, 509 (5th Cir.2005). Consequently, the district court did not err in dismissing Chamberlain\u2019s ADA claims against the defendants on the basis that the ADA is not applicable to the federal government. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(5)(B); <em>Henrickson v. Potter, </em>327 F.3d 444, 447 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">With regard to Chamberlain\u2019s entitlement under the Rehabilitation Act, claims for monetary damages for alleged discrimination under any program or activity against the Bureau of Prisons or its director are shielded by sovereign immunity. <em>See Lane v. Pena, </em>518 U.S. 187, 192-93, 116 S.Ct. 2092, 135 L.Ed.2d 486 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Finally, Chamberlain has not shown \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d warranting the appointment of counsel. <em>See Cupit v. Jones, </em>835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). Although Chamberlain has alleged physical ailments bearing upon his ability to proceed <em>pro se, </em>Chamberlain has adequately presented his case thus far and the issues are not complex. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Chamberlain\u2019s deliberate indifference claims is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings in light of <em>Jones. </em>The district court\u2019s dismissal of Chamberlain\u2019s remaining claims is AFFIRMED. Chamberlain\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b934-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AOo\">. <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
