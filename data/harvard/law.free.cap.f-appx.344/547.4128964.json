Daniels challenges the admission of evidence that he failed to file tax returns; the validity of a prior conviction; and the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">During an investigation of the Black Mafia family, a national organization that distributed large quantities of cocaine from Atlanta, Detroit, Orlando, and Los Ange-les, federal agents learned that Daniels was a high-ranking member of the organization. Information provided by members and customers established that Daniels was often present at the Atlanta storehouse where drugs and money were exchanged and had sold kilogram bricks of cocaine to at least one third party. Daniels was indicted for two crimes: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(l)(A)(ii), 846, and possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture and substance containing cocaine, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(l)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">Before trial, the government filed an information requesting that the district court enhance Daniels\u2019s sentence with his 1990 conviction in a Georgia court for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a). The government attached to the notice certified copies of Daniels\u2019s indictment, an order of judgment, and a petition for revocation of probation. The indictment stated that, on June 30, 1990, Daniels possessed cocaine with intent to distribute the illegal substance. The judgment stated that Daniels pleaded guilty and he had entered a pretrial diversionary program in which he was adjudicated as a first offender and received a probated sentence. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. 42-8-60. The petition stated that Daniels violated his probation in 1993 when he was convicted for a violation of the Georgia Controlled Substance Act, but the petition did not state whether the state court revoked Daniels\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">At trial, the government introduced evidence about Daniels\u2019s role in the Black Mafia Family and the changes to his lifestyle during the conspiracy. Witnesses testified that Daniels used cash to purchase expensive luxury items and flaunted his wealth with flamboyant jewelry. Daniels countered with evidence that he provided security for an entertainment group named the Black Mafia Family, developed and cultivated relationships with individuals in the rap music industry, and acquired wealth as a music producer.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">To refute Daniels\u2019s argument that he had a legitimate source of income, the government moved to introduce evidence about Daniels\u2019s failure to file tax returns during the term of the conspiracy. Daniels objected on ground that the evidence was more prejudicial than probative. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>district court overruled Daniels\u2019s objection and admitted the evidence. Investigator Gloria Jackson of the Internal Revenue Service testified that Daniels failed to file tax returns between years 2000 and 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">The jury convicted Daniels of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(l)(A)(ii), 846. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charge of possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture and substance containing cocaine, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(l)(B)(ii), and the district court declared a mistrial on the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The presentence investigation report provided a base offense level of 36, United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2), and increased that level by two points because Daniels possessed a weapon, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The report stated that Daniels was 16 years old when he was adjudicated under Georgia law as a first offender. With a criminal history of IV, the report listed a sentencing range between 324 and 405 months of imprisonment. The report provided that Daniels faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Daniels objected to the report and challenged the enhancement of his sentence on two grounds. First, Daniels argued that the Georgia court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate him a first offender because he was a juvenile at the time of his offense. Second, Daniels argued that the notice provided by the government was invalid because it stated incorrectly that he was adjudicated guilty in 1990 when instead he proceeded under a pre-trial diversionary program.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The government responded that Daniels could not challenge the prior conviction because it was more than five years old, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(e), and the district court agreed with the government. The court found that \u201cthe language of section 851 is pretty clear[,]\u201d and the court ruled that \u201cthere was nothing [it] [could] do about [the] enhancement notice which does impose a 20-year mandatory minimum on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">The government requested the district court impose a sentence at the low end of the sentencing range, and Daniels asked the district court to impose the mandatory minimum sentence. Counsel for Daniels acknowledged that the \u201chands [of the district court] [were] tied to 20 years, at 20 years, ... guess[ed] that\u2019s as good as it can get for Mr. Daniels unfortunately at this point,\u201d and stated \u201cthat is what the court should consider is a reasonable sentence.\u201d The district court sentenced Daniels to 240 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">We review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1096 (11th Cir.2009). We review <em>de novo </em>the enhancement of a sentence. <em>United States v. McLean, </em>138 F.3d 1398, 1406 (11th Cir.1998). We will not review an alleged error invited by the complaining party. <em>United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">Daniels presents three arguments on appeal. First, Daniels argues that the evidence of his failure to file tax returns was not relevant and unduly prejudicial. Second, Daniels argues that his sentence was improperly enhanced with his prior state conviction. Third, Daniels argues that his sentence is unreasonable. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The district court did not abuse its broad discretion by admitting testimony about Daniels\u2019s failure to file tax returns. Evidence that Daniels had failed to file tax returns during the time of the conspiracy was relevant to determine whether his monies were derived from a legitimate or illegitimate source. Daniels argued that he became wealthy lawfully in the music industry, but his failure to file tax returns undermined the credibility of that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The district court did not err when it enhanced Daniels\u2019s sentence with his prior conviction. Daniels was barred from \u201cchallengfing] the validity of any prior conviction ... which occurred more than five years before the date of the information alleging such prior conviction.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(e). The government provided Daniels adequate notice of this enhancement by serving him with an information that mentioned facts relevant to the prior conviction accompanied by records about the prior judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Daniels is barred from challenging the reasonableness of his sentence. Daniels urged the district court to impose a sentence of twenty years and stated that the term was a \u201creasonable sentence.\u201d Any error was invited by Daniels. <em>Love, </em>449 F.3d at 1157. Alternatively, the district court did not err by sentencing Daniels to a mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Daniels\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
