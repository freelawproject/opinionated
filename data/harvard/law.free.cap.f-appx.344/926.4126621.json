He filed the instant petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 to challenge (1) his loss of good time credits upon revocation of parole and (2) the denial of time credit (a) for completion of his G.E.D, and (b) under the Prison Management Act (PMA). The district court construed Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition and denied it. The district court found that the petition was procedurally barred and that, even if it was not proeedurally barred, Jones could not prevail on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">Jones seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) but also argues that a COA is not required for this appeal. The latter assertion is correct. The district court did not err in construing Jones\u2019s petition as a \u00a7 2241 petition, <em>see United States v. Gabor, </em>905 F.2d 76, 77-78 (5th Cir.1990), and Jones is not required to obtain a COA to appeal the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition, <em>see Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">Jones does not contest the district court\u2019s procedural bar ruling. He has therefore abandoned the threshold issue in this appeal. <em>Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">Jones\u2019s complaint that he was not given an adequate opportunity to respond to the district court\u2019s ruling is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b949-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
