INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). The Board found that Bedoya failed to establish past persecution, a probability of future persecution if she returns to Colombia, or that she was eligible for withholding of removal. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-16\">Bedoya presents two arguments, and we lack jurisdiction to consider one of those arguments. Bedoya argues that she was eligible for asylum because she submitted evidence that paramilitaries persecuted her, in part, because they believed that she associated with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. Bedoya also argues that she was eligible for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention, but she failed to present those arguments to the Board. \u201c[Ajbsent a cognizable excuse or exception, we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the [Board].\u201d\u2019 <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-17\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Bedoya failed to establish that she suffered past persecution or faces future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004). The record- supports the finding of the Board that Bedoya was a victim of extortion. Bedoya testified that paramilitaries approached her and other persons in the neighborhood who had \u201cgood jobs or businesses to extort money from them,\u201d and she was attacked \u201cbecause [she] refused to give them what they wanted which was the money.\u201d Although Bedoya testified that the paramilitaries believed she had cooperated with the Revolutionary Armed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Forces, the record does not compel a finding that Bedoya was targeted for that cooperation. Bedoya testified that the paramilitaries asked her why, if she assisted the Revolutionary Armed Forces, would she \u201cnot give the money to [the paramilitaries] to[o].\u201d Bedoya also failed to establish she has a well-founded fear of future persecution because her family has remained in Colombia unharmed and her mother has returned to Bedoya\u2019s neighborhood. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Bedoya\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
