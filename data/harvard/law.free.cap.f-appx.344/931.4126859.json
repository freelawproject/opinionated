He argues that the district court\u2019s 60-month sentence was not reasonable and should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-28\">A defendant must object to a sentence as unreasonable in the district court in order to preserve a substantive reasonableness challenge. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). Rangel did not object to his sentence as unreasonable in the district court. Accordingly, his argument is reviewed for plain error. <em>Id. </em>To show plain error, the appellant must show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">When the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range and gives proper weight to the Guidelines and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, this court gives \u201cgreat deference to that sentence and will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines in light of the sentencing considerations set out in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">The district court was authorized to sentence Rangel to up to 120 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). The court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, placing emphasis on the seriousness of the offense, the need to protect the public, and the need for educational training and drug treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Rangel has shown neither that the district court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable nor that the sentence was plainly erroneous. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338; <em>Baker, </em>538 F.3d at 332. His sentence is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b953-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
