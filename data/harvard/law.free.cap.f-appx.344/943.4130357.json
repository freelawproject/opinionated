He was sentenced to 70 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">In his sole issue on appeal, Pulliro argues that the district court erred in finding that his 2005 Texas conviction for arson was a crime of violence for purposes of the 16-level enhancement provided for by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). He maintains that because the Texas statute (Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 28.02 (Vernon 2003)) does not require intended harm to a person for a conviction, it is broader than the common-law definition of arson. This court recently rejected this same argument in <em>United States v. Velez-Alderete, </em>569 F.3d 541, 544-46 (5th Cir.2009). In light of our holding in <em>Velez-Alderete, </em>the district court did not err in applying Section 2L1.2\u2019s 16-level enhancement based on Pulliro\u2019s prior Texas arson conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b966-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
