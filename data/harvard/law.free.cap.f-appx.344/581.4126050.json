Glassroth, Executive Director, Federal Defenders of MGA, Morad Fakhimi, Macon, GA, for Petitioner-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b604-10\">Before DUBINA, Chief Judge, BARKETT and FAY, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b604-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">Appellant Donyal Tarver, a federal prisoner, appeals through counsel the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel based on his counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the district court\u2019s use of his prior convictions to calculate his criminal-history score at sentencing. On appeal, Tarver argues that, pursuant to Rule 4(b) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, 28 U.S.C. foil. \u00a7 2255 (\u201cthe \u00a7 2255 Rules\u201d), the district court was required to order the government to file a response to his \u00a7 2255 motion, and because the government\u2019s response did not contain a denial of his allegations, the government effectively admitted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(b)(6). If this court does not accept his \u201cprocedural argument,\u201d Tarver argues that we should order the district court to conduct a second evi-dentiary hearing for additional development of the factual record.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">\u201cIn a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo.\u201d Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cIn a section 2255 motion, a petitioner has the burden of sustaining his contentions by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Wright v. United States, </em>624 F.2d 557, 558 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-15\">In <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>the Supreme Court set out a two-part inquiry for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-16\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><em>Id. </em>To succeed on an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, a habeas petitioner must satisfy both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Butcher v. United States, </em>368 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">A. Procedural Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of federal procedural rules <em>de novo. Vencor Hosps., Inc. v. Standard Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>279 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir.2002). We review <em>de novo </em>the applicability of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure in a habeas proceeding. <em>See McBride v. Sharpe, </em>25 F.3d 962, 967-68 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cThe applicability of the ten-day notice provision of Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) in a Habeas Rule 8(a) disposition is a question of law ... subject to de novo review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Rule 4(b) of the \u00a7 2255 Rules provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">(b) Initial Consideration by the Judge. The judge who receives the motion must promptly examine it. If it plainly appears from the motion, any attached exhibits, and the record of pri- or proceedings that the moving party is not entitled to relief, the judge must dismiss the motion and direct the clerk to notify the moving party. If the motion is not dismissed, the judge must order the United States attorney to file an answer, motion, or other response within a fixed time, or to take other action the judge may order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">28 U.S.C. foil. \u00a7 2255, Rule 4(b). Rule 5 of the \u00a7 2255 Rules addresses, <em>inter alia, </em>answers to \u00a7 2255 motions, and provides that a \u201crespondent is not required to answer the motion unless a judge so orders.\u201d 28 U.S.C. foil. \u00a7 2255, Rule 5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Rule 8(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that, in responding to a pleading, \u201c[a]n allegation ... is admitted if a responsive pleading is required and the allegation is not denied. If a responsive pleading is not required, an allegation is considered denied or avoided.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(b)(6); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. foil. \u00a7 2255, Rule 12 (\u201cThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ... to the extent that they are not inconsistent with any statutory provisions or these rules, may be applied to a proceeding under these rules.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">Because the plain language of Rule 4(b) of the \u00a7 2255 Rules did not require the district court to order the government to file a response to Tarver\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, we hold that pursuant to Rule 8(b)(6), the government was not deemed to have admitted Tarver\u2019s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to deny the allegation specifically in its response to his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">B. Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">In <em>Murray v. United States, </em>we affirmed the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion and held that the movant was not entitled to a second evidentiary hearing when he already had been given an opportunity to prove his allegations. 145 F.3d 1249, 1254 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">Because the record here demonstrates that Tarver had a full opportunity to develop his ineffective-assistance claim at an evidentiary hearing and the district court could determine that he failed to meet his burden, we hold that Tarver is not entitled to a second evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-16\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Tarver\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
