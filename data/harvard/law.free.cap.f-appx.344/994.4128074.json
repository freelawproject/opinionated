He argues that the district court erred in adjusting his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(10)(A)(ii), because the government failed to prove that anhydrous ammonia is a \u201chazardous waste\u201d or that his storage of the substance in propane tanks was \u201cunlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Strackbein did not argue, in the district court, that anhydrous ammonia is not a hazardous waste or that his method of storage was not unlawful. Accordingly, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 793 (5th Cir.1996) (plain error review where appellant advances theory in the district court different from that presented on appeal). To demonstrate plain error, he must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">Subsection (b)(10)(A) of \u00a7 2D1.1 applies if the conduct involved any storage covered by, <em>inter alia, </em>the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9603(b). \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.19). Ammonia is listed in the hazardous material table of substances regulated by CERC-LA. <em>United States v. Stepan, </em>66 Fed.Appx. 524, 524 (5th Cir.2003) (citing 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101, App. A (Table)). In addition, the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) provides that anhydrous ammonia is a \u201ctoxic substance\u201d and that Strackbein had stored it in an \u201cunapproved container.\u201d Because Strackbein adduced no evidence to rebut the PSR, the district court was free to adopt the PSR and to rely on the factual findings contained therein. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>367 F.3d 274, 277 (5th Cir.2004). The imposition of the adjustment thus was not plain error. <em>See U.S. v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-12\">Strackbein also contends that his sentence is substantively and procedurally unreasonable. Although he moved for a downward departure, he did not object to the sentence as unreasonable. Nor did he object to the court\u2019s failure to give reasons for imposing a within-guideline sentence. It is thus arguable that Strackbein\u2019s challenge to the sentence is subject to plain-error review. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). This court need not determine whether plain-error review is mandated, however, because Strackbein is not entitled to relief even assuming that he preserved his argument for review. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-17\">Although the Supreme Court has stated that a sentencing court \u201cwill normally\u201d explain why it has rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments, the Court did not mandate that the sentencing court give reasons for rejecting a defendant\u2019s specific arguments for a lower sentence. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The judge is required only to \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-18\">Where the district court imposes a sentence within a properly-calculated guideline range and gives proper weight to the guidelines and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, this court will give great deference to the sentence and will infer that the district court has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the guidelines. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number><em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). Additionally, a sentence within a properly-calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">The district court asked Strackbein and his counsel for comments regarding sentencing. The court also asked Strackbein about his addiction. After that exchange, the court imposed the minimum sentence recommended by the guidelines. The record thus reveals that the court considered the mitigating factors offered by Strackbein and chose its sentence with them in mind. The sentence is not substantively or procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">The judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1016-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th CrR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
