Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), this court is statutorily barred from reviewing the BIA\u2019s purely discretionary denial of cancellation of removal. <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). However, this court is not precluded from reviewing claims raising constitutional or purely legal questions. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 800 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Rivas-Banos challenges the BIA\u2019s decision on the grounds that: (1) the BIA failed to consider the hardship issue; (2) if an alien meets the petty offense exception, that alien may still qualify for cancellation of removal despite a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT); (3) a conviction for a CIMT that meets the petty offense exception does not stop the accrual of time for purposes of meeting the requirement for continuous physical presence; (4) the BIA should have granted him voluntary departure; and (5) the BIA violated his procedural due process rights by dismissing his appeal despite his plausible ground of relief from removal. Although Rivas-Banos cites to <em>In re Garcia-Hernandez, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 590 (BIA 2003), and <em>In re Deanda-Romo, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 597 (BIA 2003), in support of his arguments regarding the petty offense exception, those cases do not explicitly support his arguments. Moreover, this court must defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of ambiguous provisions of the INA, and the BIA held in this case that the petty offense exception was inapplicable to Rivas-Banos. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">As the petty offense exception was not applicable to Rivas-Banos, he was ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(f)(3), 1229b(b)(l)(B), 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). It is therefore not relevant whether Rivas-Banos met the other statutory requirements for cancellation of removal. Rivas-Banos\u2019s argument regarding voluntary departure is not cognizable because he did not exhaust that claim by raising it before the BIA. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004). Moreover, Rivas-Banos\u2019s due process claim lacks merit because he does not have a right to due process regarding \u201cthe failure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature.\u201d <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">Accordingly, Rivas-Banos\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b53-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
