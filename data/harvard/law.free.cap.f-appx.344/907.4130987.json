We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-29\">The businesses allege that \u2014 on November 15, 2007 \u2014 the defendants\u2019 oil well exploded near Interstate 10 in Iberville Parish. In response to the physical and environmental danger, the Louisiana State Police closed the surrounding 60-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>mile stretch of Interstate 10. The State Police did not open this portion of highway to vehicular traffic until November 25, 2007 \u2014 ten days after the explosion. According to the businesses, the defendants\u2019 negligence caused the oil well blowout.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The businesses suffered neither personal injury nor property damage as a result of the explosion. Indeed, the vast majority of the plaintiff businesses operate at locations twenty miles from the oil well. The businesses do claim, however, that the loss of traffic during the highway\u2019s closure caused them economic damages. In an effort to recoup these speculative profits, the businesses initiated a claim based on Louisiana tort and statutory law. In their complaint, the businesses sought primarily to recover for tort damages under Article 2315 of the Civil Code, which provides: \u201cEvery act whatever of man that causes damage to another obliges him by whose fault it happened to repair it.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The businesses attempted secondarily to recover statutory damages under Article 667 of the Civil Code, which requires a defendant to reimburse his \u201cneighbors\u201d for depriving them of the enjoyment of their property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Defendants moved to dismiss all claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), a motion the district court granted in full. Invoking <em>Erie,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the district court first asked: Under Louisiana law, may a plaintiff recover purely economic damages when it has suffered neither physical damage nor damage to property in which it has a proprietary interest and where there is no contractual relationship between the parties? Acknowledging that the Louisiana Supreme Court has never answered that specific question, the district court inferred from case law and common sense that the answer must be \u201cno\u201d \u2014 thus disposing of the plaintiffs\u2019 Article 2315 claim. The court next asked: Under Louisiana\u2019s Article 667, are the businesses here \u201cneighbors\u201d of the defendants\u2019 oil well? Again without specific guidance from the Louisiana Supreme Court, the district court reasoned that the businesses \u2014 many situated more than twenty miles from the blowout \u2014 were not the exploding oil well\u2019s \u201cneighbor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">On appeal, the businesses claim three errors: 1) the district court had insufficient guidance on the Article 2315 question, so we should certify the question to the Louisiana Supreme Court; 2) in the alternative, the district court incorrectly applied Louisiana law to the Article 2315 claim; and 3) the district court incorrectly applied Louisiana law to the Article 667 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">As to the first issue, the decision to certify a question lies within our sound discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The businesses\u2019 primary argument is that we should certify because the Louisiana Supreme Court has never squarely answered the particular Article 2315 question presented here. However, \u201cthe absence of a definitive answer from the state supreme court on a particular question is not sufficient to warrant certification.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the Louisiana law is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>not \u201cgenuinely unsettled,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we decline to certify the question whether a plaintiff can recover purely economic damages \u2014 without any other type of injury \u2014 under Louisiana tort law.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">As to the second and third issues, the businesses claim \u2014 essentially\u2014that the district court \u201cErie-guessed\u201d wrong in its application of both Article 2315 and Article 667. Though we review dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6) <em>de novo, </em>there is no merit to the businesses\u2019 suggestion that the district court incorrectly applied Louisiana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Regarding the Article 2315 tort claim for purely economic damages, we see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s considered analysis \u2014 which weighed both a Louisiana Supreme Court judgment on a question similar to the one here<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and a Louisiana appellate court decision on precisely the same question as the one here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The businesses\u2019 reliance on <em>Pharr</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 a 1905 Louisiana Supreme Court case that arguably allowed a tort claim for purely economic damages \u2014 is unavailing. Indeed\u2014 as explained by the district court \u2014 the obvious trend over the past century is for Louisiana and United States courts to prohibit the recovery in tort of indirect economic losses. And, more to the point, <em>Pharr </em>is factually inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Finally, the businesses make only a halfhearted attempt to reverse the Article 667 dismissal. The district court properly concluded that the businesses cannot in this case recover under Article 667 \u2014 notwithstanding the businesses\u2019 out-of-context citation to just one legal source.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b929-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
