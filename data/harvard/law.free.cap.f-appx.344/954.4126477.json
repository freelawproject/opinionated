Jennings contends that he was erroneously classified at a high security level.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">An inmate lacks any constitutional interest in custodial classification, and his disagreement with his classification is insufficient to state a constitutional violation. <em>Wilson v. Budney, </em>976 F.2d 957, 958 (5th Cir.1992). Absent an abuse of discretion, federal courts will not interfere with prison officials\u2019 custodial classifications. <em>Whitley v. Hunt, </em>158 F.3d 882, 889 (5th Cir.1998), <em>abrogated on other grounds by, Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 735, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). Jennings has not established that prison officials abused their discretion in the classification decision. <em>See Whitley, </em>158 F.3d at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-17\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Jennings\u2019s motion for court-ordered discovery is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
