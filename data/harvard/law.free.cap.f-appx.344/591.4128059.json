On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress because identity-related materials obtained after an unconstitutional search and seizure are suppressible. Vasquez-Garcia acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by our holding in <em>United States v. Farias-Gonzalez, </em>556 F.3d 1181 (11th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. May 4, 2009) (No. 08-10195), but wishes to preserve his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-23\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we review findings of fact for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo. Farias-Gonzalez, </em>556 F.3d at 1185. In <em>Farias-Gonzalez, </em>we addressed \u201cwhether evidence of who the defendant is (\u2018identity-related evidence\u2019), obtained after an unconstitutional search and seizure, is suppressible in a criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1182. There, law enforcement officials electronically fingerprinted the defendant in order to determine whether he had illegally entered the country. <em>Id. </em>at 1183. The fingerprint machine identified the defendant\u2019s real name and that he previously had been deported from the United States. <em>Id. </em>The defendant\u2019s fingerprints were used only as evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>dence of identity and not to connect him to any non-identity related crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 1185 n. 4. We held that identity-related evidence is not suppressible when offered in a criminal prosecution only to prove who the defendant is. <em>Id. </em>at 1182, 1189. Identity-related evidence includes fingerprints and photographs. <em>Id. </em>at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">We also held that an alien file, which contains fingerprints, photographs, and deportation history of an alien, is \u201cnot suppressible when the government already knows the identity of the illegal alien and has his alien file in its possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>512 F.2d 830, 832 (5th Cir.1975)). An alien file is \u201cnot the product of any unconstitutional activity\u201d when \u201cit already exist[s] and [is] located in the records of a government agency.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In this case, law enforcement officials used Vasquez-Garcia\u2019s fingerprints only to prove who Vasquez-Garcia was. As such, <em>Fanas-Gonzalez </em>controls the outcome of this case, and Vasquez-Garcia\u2019s identity-related evidence \u2014 his fingerprints and photographs \u2014 cannot be suppressed. Additionally, Vasquez-Garcia\u2019s alien file is not suppressible because it was located in the records of a government agency, the National Records Center, at the time of his arrest. Accordingly, we affirm Vasquez-Garcia\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
