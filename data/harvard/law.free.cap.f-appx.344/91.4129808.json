As a three-time felony drug offender, Fisher was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-22\">Fisher appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence based on Amendment 706 that modified the sentencing ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses. See United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>Supp. to Appendix C, Amendment 706, p. 226-31 (Nov. 1, 2007) (amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-24\">This court reviews for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997). Because Fisher\u2019s life sentence was based on his status as a three-time felony drug offender, and not the amount of drugs involved, he was not \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that ha[d] subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>der the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a sentence reduction was not authorized and not consistent with the applicable policy statement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), p.s. Moreover, the district court could not have reduced Fisher\u2019s sentence below the mandatory term of life in prison. <em>See Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">To the extent that Fisher challenges his status as a three-time felony drug offender on the basis that his prior state felony drug convictions used to enhance his sentence had been reclassified as misdemeanors, such a claim is not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it is not based on a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The district court\u2019s denial of Fisher\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence was not an abuse of discretion, and the judgment is affirmed. <em>See Boe, </em>117 F.3d at 831. Fisher\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b113-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
