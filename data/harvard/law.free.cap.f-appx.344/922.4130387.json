Guajardo, Texas prisoner # 170864, appeals the dismissal, as frivolous and for failure to state a claim, of his civil rights action. He first contends that the district court did not give liberal construction to his pro se complaint. Guajar-do\u2019s pleadings are entitled to the benefit of liberal construction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Guajardo has failed to show that the district court did not properly construe his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-17\">Guajardo argues that his rights under the Due Process Clause were violated by the actions of defendants Bayda and Dretke, which resulted in his being denied a Unit Parole Interview. Guajardo concedes that Texas statutes do not provide for a Unit Parole Interview, but he contends that such an interview, in practice, is an essential part of the parole process and that he therefore has a protected liberty interest in an interview. Texas law does not create a liberty interest in parole that is protected by the Due Process Clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, even if Texas law or policy was violated by the lack of a Unit Parole Interview, there was no violation of the federal Due Process Clause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-18\">Guajardo has failed to brief his claims that the lack of a Unit Parole Interview violated the Equal Protection Clause and the Sixth Amendment. Accordingly, he has waived these claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (And these claims had no merit from the start, for essentially the reasons provided by the district court.)</p>\n<p id=\"b945-19\">Guajardo also claims that his due process rights were violated in connection with a disciplinary conviction. He argues that Dretke made disciplinary charges against him based on an \u201cassumption\u201d that violations had occurred. Guajardo asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>that there was no evidence to support the disciplinary conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">The Due Process Clause \u201cdoes not protect every change in the conditions of confinement which has a substantial adverse effect upon a prisoner.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the punishments received by Guajardo as a result of his disciplinary conviction \u2014 demotion in trustee status, 15 days in solitary confinement, and 30 days of commissary and cell restrictions \u2014 \u201care penalties which do not represent the type of atypical, significant deprivation in which a state might create a liberty <em>interest.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Guajardo has failed to show that his due process rights were implicated by his disciplinary conviction. Moreover, Guajardo\u2019s claim for damages and for declaratory relief are barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>because they necessarily imply the invalidity of the punishment imposed in the disciplinary conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As Guajardo has failed to show error, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The dismissal by the district court of Guajardo\u2019s action as frivolous and for failure to state a claim counts as a strike for the purpose of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Gua-jardo has previously accumulated at least two strikes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Guajardo is therefore barred from again proceeding in forma pauperis pursuant to \u00a7 1915 while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">AFFIRMED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b945-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
