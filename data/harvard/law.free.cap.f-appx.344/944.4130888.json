It found him to be ineligible for cancellation of removal because his 2006 New York marijuana possession conviction constituted an aggravated felony for purposes of immigration law. Young contends solely that the BIA erred by treating his conviction as equivalent to the federal offense of \u201crecidivist possession.\u201d <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-18\">We conclude that the BIA correctly determined that Young\u2019s offense constituted an aggravated felony for immigration law purposes. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 266-68 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 15, 2009) (No. 09-60).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-19\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b967-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
