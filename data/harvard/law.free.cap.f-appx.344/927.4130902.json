She seeks review of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), which she filed on behalf of herself and her three minor children. This court will uphold the BIA\u2019s factual findings if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Silwany-Rodriguez v. INS, </em>975 F.2d 1157, 1160 (5th Cir.1992). Under the substantial evidence standard, this court will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe applicant has the burden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). This court reviews the BIA\u2019s resolution of questions of law de novo, giving \u201cconsiderable deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the legislative scheme it is entrusted to administer.\u201d <em>Zhu v. Gon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number><em>zales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Baquedano argues that she is entitled to asylum because she suffered past persecution at the hands of Victorian Centeno-Lopez, a police officer who was her neighbor, because she was a member of the human rights organization Xibalba. Baquedano stated in the complaint that she filed against Centeno-Lopez that he assaulted her son and threatened her daughter because they were playing ball in front of his house. She also stated in her complaint that Centeno-Lopez had a reputation among his neighbors for shooting his gun at nighttime in a state inebriation. This was coiToborated by the report that followed Baquedano\u2019s complaint. The record establishes that Centeno-Lopez had trouble getting along with his neighbors but does not establish that he threatened Baquedano\u2019s family because of her political opinion or membership in Xibalba. Therefore, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Baquedano failed to prove past persecution on a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Baquedano\u2019s argument that others beside Centeno-Lopez persecuted her is likewise unavailing. Threatening phone calls, knocks on her front door by \u201csuspicious\u201d men, the questioning of her husband, and assigning the same investigator to her complaint does not amount to the infliction of suffering or harm to Baquedano and her family under government sanction. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1135; <em>Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 109, 116 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Baquedano has not demonstrated a subjective fear of persecution that is objectively reasonable because she does not show that she would singled out for persecution upon her return to Honduras. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 307 (5th Cir.2005). Baquedano has not refuted the BIA\u2019s determination that she could safely relocate on her return to Honduras. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">Because Baquedano does not address in her brief her entitlement to withholding of removal, she has abandoned any argument relative to the same. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Notwithstanding this omission, Baqueda-no\u2019s failure to establish eligibility for asylum is dispositive of whether she is entitled to withholding of removal. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 186 n. 2 (5th Cir.2004). Last, Baquedano fails to meet her burden of showing that more likely than not she would be subjected to torture upon her return to Honduras such that she is entitled to relief under the CAT. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 354 (5th Cir.2002) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b950-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut.
