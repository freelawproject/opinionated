Following amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that lowered the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, the district court granted Worth\u2019s motion for sentence re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>duction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and reduced Worth\u2019s sentence to 151 months, the minimum sentence under the amended Guidelines. Worth appeals and challenges the limits on the district court\u2019s discretion set forth in U.S.S.G \u00a7 1B1.10 and argues the district court had the authority to impose an sentence below the minimum in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Government has moved for summary affirmance, asserting that the district court could not reduce Worth\u2019s sentence further. Alternatively, the Government moves for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Worth\u2019s arguments fail in light of our recent decision in <em>United States v. Doublin.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b36-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
