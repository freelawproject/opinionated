He argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)and specifically asserts that, in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his within-guidelines sentence because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is flawed in that it is not supported by empirical studies. Jaime further asserts that the 16-step offense level enhancement he received pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) for a prior drug offense conviction over represented the seriousness of his criminal history and his propensity to commit future crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">We have consistently rejected Jaime\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument, concluding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not question the presumption of reasonableness and does not require district or appellate courts to independently analyze the empirical grounding behind each individual guideline. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 24, 2009) (No. 08-11099). Accordingly, Jaime\u2019s correctly calculated within-guidelines sentence is afforded a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-30. Jaime has not rebutted that presumption. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">Jaime has not shown that the 50-month sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable. The record demonstrates that the district court properly made an individualized assessment to determine whether a sentence within the guidelines range was sufficient but not greater than necessary to achieve the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b115-9\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
