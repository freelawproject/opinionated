California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Jackson filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-19\">We previously ordered that counsel file a supplemental brief addressing whether there are any nonfrivolous issues regarding the district court\u2019s failure to rule on Jackson\u2019s pro se motions. Counsel has filed a supplemental brief addressing this issue and has concluded that Jackson\u2019s pro se motion qualifies as a motion for reconsideration and renders the district court\u2019s order nonfinal for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-20\">This court has held that a criminal defendant does not have the right to a \u201chybrid representation.\u201d <em>United States v. Ogbonna, </em>184 F.3d 447, 449 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.1999). Because the record reflects that Jackson was represented by counsel at the time he filed his pro se motion for rehearing, his pro se motion was an unauthorized motion, and the district court properly disregarded it. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the district court\u2019s failure to address the motion does not divest this court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-21\">Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Jackson\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Counsel\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b35-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
