The charges arose after a sergeant in the narcotics division of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), who had monitored Carmenate\u2019s flatbed tractor-trailer (truck) for three days and observed activity suggesting drug trafficking, requested that a DPS trooper initiate a traffic stop. A trooper subsequently initiated a stop after Carm\u00e9nate drove his truck onto the improved shoulder of a two-lane highway without signaling for the proper distance. Cocaine was found during a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">Carm\u00e9nate thereafter filed a motion to suppress. Following a five-day hearing, the district court denied the motion, and Carm\u00e9nate proceeded to trial. A jury convicted Carm\u00e9nate on both counts of his indictment. The district court sentenced Carm\u00e9nate to 160 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Car-m\u00e9nate filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-16\">Citing Tex. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 545.058(a)(5), Carm\u00e9nate first argues that the traffic stop was not justified at its inception because the reason given for the stop, driving on an improved shoulder, is not a violation of Texas law when the driver is permitting another vehicle to pass. Even in the absence of a traffic violation, however, the record reflects that the stop at issue herein was constitutionally permissible at its inception, based on the collective knowledge of all the officers involved, which gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity might be afoot. <em>See United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 506-07 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19-20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); see <em>United States v. Zavala, </em>541 F.3d 562, 574 (5th Cir.2008)) (\u201c[A]n investigative vehicle stop is permissible under <em>Terry </em>only when the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot.\u201d); see <em>United States v. Holloway, </em>962 F.2d 451, 459 n. 22 (5th Cir.1992) (stating that reasonable suspicion is based on the \u201ccollective knowledge and experience of the officers involved\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-17\">Carm\u00e9nate next argues that his continued detention after the stop was unreasonable because he and his passenger were questioned about issues totally unrelated to the reason given for the stop. The record reflects that the actions of the troopers were \u201creasonably related to the circumstances that justified the stop, or to dispelling [a] reasonable suspicion [that] developed during the stop.\u201d <em>See Brigham, </em>382 F.3d at 507 (citing <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 19-20, 88 S.Ct. 1868). Specifically, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>investigative methods following the stop \u201cwere reasonable, proceeded with deliberation in response to evolving conditions, and evince[d] no purposeful or even accidental unnecessary prolongation.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Carm\u00e9nate next argues that (1) his consent to the search was involuntary because his initial stop was in violation of the Fourth Amendment; (2) that his consent was not an independent act of free will because he was never free to leave after his initial detention; (3) that the district court erred by failing to make a finding regarding the voluntariness of his consent; and (4) that the troopers exceeded the scope of his consent by forcibly breaking apart the floor boards of his trailer bed. Contrary to Carmenate\u2019s argument, the initial stop was proper for the reasons discussed above. Moreover, this court need not analyze the voluntary nature of his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Specifically, the visual inspection under Carmenate\u2019s truck did not require his consent. <em>See United States v. Muniz-Melchor, </em>894 F.2d 1430, 1434 (5th Cir.1990). The subsequent discovery of suspicious markings created a reasonable belief that the truck contained a hidden compartment. <em>See United States v. Inocencio, </em>40 F.3d 716, 724 (5th Cir.1994). \u201c[Ejvidence of a hidden compartment supports \u2018probable cause\u2019 for a search/arrest.\u201d <em>United States v. Estrada, </em>459 F.3d 627, 633 (5th Cir.2006) (internal citation omitted). When probable cause for a search exists, consent is not required. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez, </em>318 F.3d 663, 666 (5th Cir.2003) (stating that a search is permissible without a warrant as long as there is \u201ceither the consent of the owner to conduct the search or probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband or other evidence of a crime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b964-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
