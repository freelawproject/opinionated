We held in <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>545 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2008), that a defendant whose guideline range was based on his status as an armed career criminal is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706. Tannehill\u2019s argument that he should not have been sentenced as a career offender to begin with is outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">As for Amendment 709, which modified the manner in which a defendant\u2019s criminal history points are calculated, Tannehill did not raise that issue until his reply brief. <em>See United States v. Magluta, </em>418 F.3d 1166, 1185 (11th Cir.2005) (issues not raised until the reply brief will not be considered). In any event, Amendment 709 is not included in the list of retroactive Guideline amendments set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 709; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
