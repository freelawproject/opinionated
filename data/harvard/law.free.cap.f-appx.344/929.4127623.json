Benford argues that his sentence, which was outside the guidelines advisory range, was unreasonable because it overstated the seriousness of his supervised release violations. Because Benford did not make this argument in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Benford fails to show any error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-18\">Although Benford\u2019s sentence was above the advisory guidelines range of three to nine months of imprisonment, it did not exceed the five-year statutory maximum sentence to which he was subject. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). We have routinely affirmed revocation sentences exceeding the advisory range, even where the sentence equals the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Neal, </em>212 Fed.Appx. 328, 330-31 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>182 Fed.Appx. 343, 344 (5th Cir.2006). Further, we have affirmed sentences representing greater deviations from the advisory range than the sentence here. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 491-92 (5th Cir.2005) (upholding departure from guidelines range maximum of 41 months to 120 months); <em>see also Neal, </em>212 Fed.Appx. at 330-31 (upholding departure from guidelines range maximum of 14 months to 60 months). Consequently, Benford\u2019s sentence is acceptable under both the former \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d and the <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201cunreasonableness\u201d standards. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>520 F.3d 425, 428 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-19\">Accordingly, Benford\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b952-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
