Shugart, </em>117 F.3d 838, 843 (5th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s factual findings ... for clear error, and its legal conclusions ... de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d 423, 427 (5th Cir.2001). As relevant here, an officer\u2019s reliance on the warrant is not objectively reasonable and, therefore, not entitled to the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule if the underlying affidavit is \u201cbare bones\u201d (\u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable\u201d) or the warrant is so \u201cfacially deficient\u201d in failing to particularize the place to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>searched or the things to be seized that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid. <em>See United States v. Mays, </em>466 F.3d 335, 343 (5th Cir.2006) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 1234, 127 S.Ct. 1313, 167 L.Ed.2d 124 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In the instant case, Rodriguez\u2019s challenge to the time frame of the Cl\u2019s information offers no more than a possible contrary interpretation of the phrasing of the affidavit, insufficient to show clear error in the district court\u2019s finding as to the meaning of the affidavit. <em>See United States v. Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d 701, 703-04 (5th Cir.2003). Rodriguez\u2019s argument that the information provided by the Cl was too vague to support the search similarly fails. The Cl indicated that he had been in the specific apartment for which the search warrant was sought, that he had seen a usable amount of a specific narcotic in the apartment, and that the apartment was controlled by an individual whom he described as follows: \u201ca medium complexion Hispanic male by the name of Felipe (AKA Kitty) approximately 25 to 30 years old and weighs approximately 200 lbs, approximately 5'8\" tall and b[a]l[d].\u201d Under the totality of the circumstances, the information provided by the Cl was credible and sufficiently specific for the officer\u2019s reliance on it as a basis for the warrant. <em>See United States v. Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d 317, 321 (5th Cir.1992). This information and the warrant were sufficiently specific to render the warrant facially valid. <em>See Mack v. City of Abilene, </em>461 F.3d 547, 551 (5th Cir.2006) (holding warrant facially valid where affiant set out facts indicating the veracity and reliability of the Cl, as well as a specific statement of the knowledge obtained from the Cl). As to the Cl\u2019s credibility, the officer\u2019s statement that he knew the Cl had \u201cprovided information to be truthful, reliable, and trustworthy\u201d indicated that the officer was familiar with the Cl and the Cl\u2019s prior information, and that he knew the Cl\u2019s information had been correct in the past. This is sufficient to establish the Cl\u2019s credibility. <em>See United States v. McKnight, </em>953 F.2d 898, 905 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Rodriguez has failed to show that the warrant was \u201cbare bones\u201d or facially invalid and, therefore, that the district court erred in concluding that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied and in denying Rodriguez\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See Shugart, </em>117 F.3d at 843-44. The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b116-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
