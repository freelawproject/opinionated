He argues the district court erred in failing to grant a mistrial or inquire into the jury\u2019s deliberations when comments made during polling of the verdict suggested one of the jurors had difficulty understanding English.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">\u201cIt is well established in this Circuit that to invite error is to preclude review of that error on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 1000 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2790, 174 L.Ed.2d 290 (2009). \u201c[A] criminal defendant may <em>not </em>make an affirmative, apparently strategic decision at trial and then complain on appeal that the result of that decision constitutes reversible error.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1290 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">Ortega successfully objected to the government\u2019s attempt to strike the juror in question for cause due to its concerns about her English-language comprehension. When confusion arose during polling, the district court spoke with the juror individually and she satisfied him that the verdict was her true verdict. Ortega suggested that the court also ask other jurors about her understanding of the deliberations, but when the court offered instead to ask the juror herself whether she had understood the trial testimony, Ortega said he \u201clike[d] that better\u201d and that her understanding of the testimony was \u201cthe ultimate issue.\u201d He did not raise any further objections or move for a mistrial. Because Ortega affirmatively sought or expressly consented to each of the district court\u2019s decisions, he invited any error the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>might have made and thereby waived appellate review. <em>See id. </em>at 1290; <em>Campa, </em>529 F.3d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Ortega\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
