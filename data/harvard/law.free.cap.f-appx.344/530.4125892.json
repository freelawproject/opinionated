At the time of Buddy\u2019s death, Fidelity Employer Services Company, LLG (Fidelity) had two beneficiary designation forms in Buddy\u2019s file. One designated Buddy\u2019s son, Dr. Thomas G. Cox, as the sole beneficiary and another listed as beneficiaries one of Buddy\u2019s daughters, Sharon L. Taylor, and Buddy\u2019s former girlfriend, Jerri L. Dunn. The latter form was received by Fidelity more than ten years after the form naming Dr. Cox as the beneficiary, but it was not signed or dated.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Dr. Cox and Dunn each claimed they were entitled to the 401(k) plan funds. After Harris\u2019s Employee Benefits Committee determined Dr. Cox was the sole beneficiary, Harris filed an interpleader action against Dr. Cox, Dunn, and Taylor to determine the proper beneficiary, pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3). The district court granted Harris\u2019s motion to be dismissed from that action and denied Dunn\u2019s repeated requests to re-add Harris as a party, so Dunn filed the instant suit against Harris and Fidelity. Dunn also brought her action pursuant to \u00a7 1132, alleging the second beneficiary designation form should be given effect or, alternatively, the defendants breached their fiduciary duty when they received the defective form and failed to notify Buddy or take corrective action.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">The district court ruled on both cases the same day. In the first case, the court held Dr. Cox was the proper beneficiary. In the instant case, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, concluding Dunn could not state a cause of action against Harris or Fidelity because (1) the enforcement mechanisms of ERISA do not allow for the relief Dunn sought, and (2) Dunn was procedurally barred because her claim was a compulsory counterclaim that should have been brought in the first case. Dunn appealed both cases and they were initially consolidated. On July 24, 2009, we summarily affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment in the first case because Dunn failed to present any arguments for overturning that judgment. Now, with her claim 401 (k) plan benefits abandoned, we conclude Dunn has no statutory standing to proceed with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">\u201cSection 1132 is essentially a standing provision [that] sets forth those parties who may bring civil actions under ERISA and specifies the types of actions each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>those parties may pursue.\u201d <em>Gulf Life Ins. Co. v. Arnold, </em>809 F.2d 1520, 1524 (11th Cir.1987). The only parties authorized to bring a lawsuit under \u00a7 1132 are participants, beneficiaries, fiduciaries, or the Secretary of Labor. ERISA defines a beneficiary as \u201ca person designated by a participant, or by the terms of an employee benefit plan, who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(8). \u201cStanding represents a jurisdictional requirement which remains open to review at all stages of the litigation.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Org. For Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, </em>510 U.S. 249, 114 S.Ct. 798, 802, 127 L.Ed.2d 99 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The only basis <em>for </em>Dunn to have standing to sue Harris and Fidelity in this case is if she is deemed a beneficiary. Dr. Cox has already been determined to be the proper beneficiary of Buddy\u2019s 401 (k) plan, and that determination has been affirmed by this Court. In light of that judgment, Dunn cannot become entitled to the 401(k) plan benefits, so she is not a beneficiary or potential beneficiary who has standing to bring a claim under \u00a7 1132. <em>See Arnold, </em>809 F.2d at 1524. Dunn does not have standing, so we dismiss this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-21\">. We do not address whether Dunn had standing to pursue her claims in district court. <em>See Wolff v. Cash 4 Titles, </em>351 F.3d 1348, 1353 (11th Cir.2003) (\"Litigants must establish their standing not only to bring claims, but also to appeal judgments.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
