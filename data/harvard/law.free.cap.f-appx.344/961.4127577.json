Perez appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>his sentence, arguing that the district court erred by increasing his sentencing guidelines offense level by two, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) because he was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of at least one participant in the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">We review factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard and accord great deference to the trial judge\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In determining a defendant\u2019s role in the offense, \u201ca district court may adopt the facts contained in a PSR without further inquiry if those facts have an adequate evidentiary basis with sufficient indi-cia of reliability and the defendant does not present rebuttal evidence or otherwise demonstrate that the information in the PSR is unreliable.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Perez did not introduce rebuttal evidence during the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">We cannot find that the district court clearly erred in enhancing Perez\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Perez concedes that he hired others to load and drive drugs in connection with three drag transactions, facts making it plausible that he had a role as a supervisor or manager in the transactions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b983-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
