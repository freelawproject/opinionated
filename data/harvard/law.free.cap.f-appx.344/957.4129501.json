The BIA dismissed Petitioner\u2019s appeal of an order of an immigration judge (IJ) which denied his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). The BIA concluded that Petitioner had not met his burden of showing eligibility because of major inconsistencies between Petitioner\u2019s testimony and that of his witness, as well as prior inconsistent statements made by Petitioner. In so ruling, the BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s finding that Petitioner was not credible, and vacated the IJ\u2019s finding that Petitioner\u2019s asylum claim was frivolous. Petitioner now contests the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and argues that the BIA\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">On a petition for review of a BIA decision, we review the order of the BIA, but we also consider the IJ\u2019s underlying decision if it influenced the BIA\u2019s determination. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). This court reviews factual findings for substantial evidence and questions of law <em>de novo. Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Because Petitioner filed his asylum claim after May 11, 2005, this case is governed by the standards set forth in the REAL ID Act for determining witness credibility in asylum and withholding of removal cases. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii), (iii); REAL ID Act \u00a7 101, Pub.L. 109-13,119 Stat. 231, 302-05 (May 11, 2005). An adverse credibility determination is a finding of fact that must be reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>See Vidal v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 250, 254 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cThe substantial evidence standard requires only that the BIA\u2019s decision be supported by record evidence and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Omagah v. Ashcroft, </em>288 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir.2002). This court must review the BIA\u2019s factual determination to determine \u201cnot only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 306 (5th Cir.2005)). The alien bears the \u201cburden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Petitioner has failed to meet this onerous standard. The IJ\u2019s findings regarding numerous discrepancies in Petitioner\u2019s testimony, including testimony regarding a key incident in which Petitioner\u2019s store was invaded by masked men, are sufficient to support the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations. Petitioner\u2019s testimony that he was personally threatened by the masked men diverged from his witness\u2019s testimony in key areas. Although Petitioner alleges that the witness\u2019s testimony nevertheless supports his overall claim of persecution, the discrepancies remain. \u201c[I]t is the fact-finder\u2019s duty to make determinations based on the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d and \u201c[w]e cannot substitute our judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to ... factual findings based on credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). Petitioner also disputes the IJ\u2019s determination that his story of persecution was implausible since Petitioner, while in Kosovo, had been a successful businessman who drove \u201cfancy cars.\u201d Although such a conclusion may be strained, the IJ\u2019s determination rested on numerous other inconsistencies in Petitioner\u2019s testimony which suffice to support the IJ\u2019s finding that Petitioner was not a credible witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">The evidence in the record does not compel us to reverse the IJ\u2019s adverse ered-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>ibility determination. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Therefore, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b979-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
