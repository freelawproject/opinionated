Arkadie contends that his Texas conviction of retaliation was not a conviction of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and, therefore, did not constitute a Grade A violation for the purpose of determining his advisory guideline sentencing range upon revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Because Arkadie did not raise this issue in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>454 F.3d 459, 464 (5th Cir.2006). To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">Our precedent and the relevant policy statement indicate that the issue whether a violator has committed a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of a supervised release revocation is based on the defendant\u2019s actual conduct. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 7B1.1, p.s., comment, (n. 1); <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>479 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Barber, </em>No. 92-7737, 1993 WL 241855 (5th Cir. June 24, 1993) (unpublished prece-dential opinion). The term includes any offense under state or federal law that is punishable by more than a year in prison and (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson ... or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. U.S. Sentenoing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l) &amp; (2). The facts underlying Arkadie\u2019s retaliation conviction reflect that he threatened to use physical force against another individual and to burn down that individual\u2019s place of business. Arkadie\u2019s conduct arguably satisfies the criteria to be considered a crime of violence under this court\u2019s caselaw addressing what constitutes a crime of violence in an initial sentencing proceeding. <em>See United States v. Mohr, </em>554 F.3d 604, 609-10 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2009) (No. 08-9578).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">We need not, however, decide whether Arkadie\u2019s conduct constituted a crime of violence. To show that an error affected his substantial rights, Arkadie must show \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d that, but for the error, he would have received a different sentence. <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 275 (5th Cir.2005). Arkadie does not argue that he would have received a lesser sentence absent the error. Nor does he point to anything in the record demonstrating that a reasonable probability exists that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence had it determined that the retaliation conviction was a Grade B violation. Rather, it is evident from the record that the court was aware of the statutory maximum imprisonment term of 24 months. Moreover, the district court rejected Arkadie\u2019s request to be sentenced to time served, commenting that Arkadie\u2019s criminal history included violent offenses and that the revocation proceeding itself arose due to violent conduct. Arkadie has not shown any reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence even if the applicable policy statement sentencing range recommended a lower sentence, and he thus has failed to show that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>error affected his substantial rights. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b988-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
