Rawles initially did not appeal the decision, but later was permitted to file an out-of-time appeal by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. The district court dismissed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application as time barred, and this court denied a COA. However, we granted Rawles\u2019s motion for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jimenez v. Quarterman</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 681, 172 L.Ed.2d 475 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-28\">A COA will issue only if Rawles has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Because his habeas application was dismissed on procedural grounds, Rawles must show \u201cthat jurists of reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\"><em>Jimenez </em>instructs that, in cases such as this, the one-year limitation period in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) begins when the out-of-time appeal becomes final. 129 S.Ct. at 685-87. We thus conclude that Rawles\u2019s application was filed timely. Accordingly, we turn to the question of whether Rawles has stated a valid claim for the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595; <em>Houser v. Dretke, </em>395 F.3d 560, 562 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Rawles asserts, inter alia, that his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to call any witnesses or to offer any evidence in support of Rawles\u2019s alibi claim or his defense that he could not have committed the crime because the victim had a venereal disease and he did not. Rawles also raised these claims in his out-of-time appeal in state court. The state appeals court declined to decide the issues because the record did not reflect facts necessary to support the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Because the district court did not consider the substance of Rawles\u2019s claims, the record remains insufficiently developed with respect to his claims that counsel was ineffective. We therefore grant Rawles a COA on the issue of the timeliness of his \u00a7 2254 application. <em>See Houser, </em>395 F.3d at 562. The judgment of the district court denying a COA on the timeliness issue is vacated, and we remand this case for consideration of the substance of Rawles\u2019s habeas claims. <em>See Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998). We express no sentiment on the ultimate outcome of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">COA GRANTED; VACATED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
