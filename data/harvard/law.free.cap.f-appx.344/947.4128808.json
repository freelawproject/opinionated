In his written plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>agreement, Brewer waived his right to appeal his sentence on all grounds, except he reserved the right to appeal (a) any punishment imposed in excess of the statutory maximum and (b) a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that affects the validity of the waiver itself. He argues that the appeal waiver is not enforceable because the Government breached the plea agreement when it recommended at sentencing that Brewer not be given a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">This court pretermits the issue whether the Government breached the plea agreement and finds that Brewer\u2019s challenge to his sentence is unavailing. Given Brewer\u2019s use of a cell phone in violation of jail rules, the district court did not clearly err when it denied him a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>19 F.3d 982, 983 (5th Cir.1994); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.l(b)). Nor has Brewer rebutted the presumption that his sentence, at the bottom of the guidelines range of imprisonment, is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b969-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
