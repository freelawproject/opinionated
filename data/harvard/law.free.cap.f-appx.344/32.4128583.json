Mitchell pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine and possession of counterfeit currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-26\">Mitchell argues that he is entitled to have his sentence reduced pursuant to Amendment 709, which addressed two areas of the Guidelines\u2019 criminal history rules. Mitchell concedes that the amendment went into effect after he was sentenced and that it is not listed by the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 as a guideline amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ment that applies retroactively. He argues, however, that the district court was not limited by the Guidelines\u2019 list of retroactively applicable amendments because, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Guidelines are advisory. Mitchell notes that Amendment 717 to the Guidelines recognizes that <em>Booker </em>rendered the Guidelines advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of Mitchell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994). Amendment 709, on which Mitchell relies for his \u00a7 3582(c) motion, is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c). Therefore, the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c) dictated that the district court was not authorized to reduce a sentence based on Amendment 709 because that would be inconsistent with Sentencing Commission policy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B.10, comment, (n. 1); \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Moreover, this court has held that <em>\u201cBooker </em>does not alter the mandatory character of \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions.\u201d <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Mitchell also asks this court to recall the mandate in appeal no. 05-50203 and to remand the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on his claim that counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance caused the dismissal of his direct appeal for want of prosecution. Mitchell\u2019s request for a recall of the mandate is beyond the scope of relief provided for under \u00a7 3582, and, in fact, Mitchell expressly states that he is not seeking a recall of the mandate pursuant to \u00a7 3582. While this court may recall a mandate to prevent injustice, <em>see </em>5th CiR. R. 41.2, Mitchell\u2019s request for such relief has not been properly presented in the form of a motion to this court. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 27. Accordingly, we do not entertain in this appeal Mitchell\u2019s request for a recall of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b54-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
