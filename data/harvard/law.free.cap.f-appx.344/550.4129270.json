He contends that he should have been eligible for a variance below the low end of his amended guidelines range. That argument is foreclosed by our holding in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Velez argues that <em>Melvin </em>was wrongly decided and violates his Sixth Amendment rights and the remedial purpose of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Regardless, we are bound by our prior panel precedent rule to follow <em>Melvin </em>until it is overruled by this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Jacqueline Brown, </em>342 F.3d 1245, 1246 (11th Cir.2003). The district court properly determined that under <em>Melvin </em>it was not authorized to sentence Velez below the low end of his amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
