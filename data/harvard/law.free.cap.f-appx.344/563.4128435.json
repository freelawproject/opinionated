On appeal, Repizo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>argues that the BIA erred in upholding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because the principal discrepancies and omissions described by the IJ lacked evi-dentiary support.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). As the BIA expressly adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we review both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Factual determinations, including credibility determinations, are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, which requires us to affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201chighly deferential\u201d and obligates us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>To reverse an administrative factual determination, \u201cwe must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Although an adverse credibility determination \u201calone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application,\u201d it is not sufficient for the IJ to solely rely on the determination if \u201cthe applicant produces other evidence of persecution.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Generally, \u201c[t]he weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). Nevertheless, once an adverse credibility determination is made, \u201cthe burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (quoting <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004)). \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, in <em>Forgue, </em>we held that substantial evidence supported an adverse credibility determination where the petitioner omitted relevant facts from his asylum application and failed to produce corroborating evidence for the IJ to consider. 401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Because Repizo omitted material facts from his asylum application and failed to proffer corroborative evidence to support his claim of persecution, the adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence in the record. Accordingly, the record neither compels, nor supports, a reversal of the IJ and BIA\u2019s decisions. Thus, we deny the petitioners\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">. Repizo also argues that the lack of corroborative evidence to support his allegations of persecution was due to ineffective assistance of counsel, and indicates that he recendy filed a motion to reopen removal proceedings with the BIA on said grounds. Since the BIA has yet to make a determination with regard to his motion to reopen, we lack jurisdiction to review Repizo's ineffective assistance of counsel claim because he has not yet exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that appellate jurisdiction over final orders of removal are limited to claims that have been exhausted before the BIA).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
