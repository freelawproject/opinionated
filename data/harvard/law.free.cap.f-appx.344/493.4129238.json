Barton contends that he is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, as required for an adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, because he is entitled to a waiver of the convictions in his criminal history that would otherwise make him inadmissible. Specifically, he argues that the BIA erred by finding him statutorily ineligible for a waiver of his two robbery convictions under former INA \u00a7 212(c) and his marijuana conviction under INA \u00a7 212(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-24\">Barton was admitted to the United States as a lawful immigrant in June 1971. In 1988 he pleaded guilty to two charges of first degree robbery. In July 2001 Barton was convicted of misdemeanor possession of up to one half ounce of marijuana. In April 2002 he was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. A 2004 Notice to Appear alleged that Barton was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>removable (1) under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) because of his conviction of an aggravated felony that was specifically a crime of violence under INA \u00a7 101(A)(43)(F), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F); (2) under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C) because of his conviction of unlawful possession of a firearm; and (3) under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), 8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) because of his conviction of two crimes of moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct. Barton conceded removability but applied for an adjustment of status under \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) and for waivers of inadmissibility under former INA \u00a7 212(c) and INA \u00a7 212(h). The IJ denied Barton\u2019s request for relief of removal, and the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Barton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Barton does not challenge the exercise of discretionary relief but instead the determination that he was ineligible for that relief. We have jurisdiction to review that legal question. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (\u201cNothing in sub-paragraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision of this chapter (other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.\u201d); <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 307-08, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2283, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (noting the distinction between eligibility for discretionary relief and the favorable exercise of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s judgment or reasoning. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s legal determinations, and that review is \u201cinformed by the principle of deference articulated in <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).\u201d <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">Barton contends that the BIA erred in finding he was ineligible for a waiver of his armed robbery convictions under former INA \u00a7 212(c). That provision allows the Attorney General to waive an alien\u2019s inadmissible status when an alien is a lawful permanent resident who has lived continuously in the United States for seven years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). Although \u00a7 212(c) originally provided for a waiver of exclusion for aliens who had gone abroad temporarily, the provision has been \u201cextended to provide relief from deportation orders as well.\u201d <em>Asencio v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 614, 616 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">A \u00a7 212(c) waiver is available to removable lawful permanent residents only to the extent that the grounds for removal are analogous to grounds for exclusion under INA \u00a7 212(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a). The BIA determined that although Barton\u2019s robbery convictions had an analogous ground for exclusion under INA \u00a7 212(a) to the extent that they were charged as crimes of moral turpitude, they did not to the extent that they were charged as aggravated felonies. For that reason, re-movability could not be waived under \u00a7 212(c) for the robbery convictions. Bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ton argues, however, that he should not be deprived of \u00a7 212(h) relief from the effect of his marijuana conviction just because the robbery convictions are both crimes of moral turpitude and aggravated felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">To adjust status, an alien must be legally admissible into the United States. INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). An alien who has been convicted of any controlled substance offense is inadmissible, although that conviction may be waived under \u00a7 212(h). INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), (a)(2)(F), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), (a)(2)(F). In particular, a marijuana conviction involving simple possession of thirty grams or less may be waived, at the discretion of the Attorney General, for an alien who is the spouse, parent, or child of an American citizen or lawful permanent resident if the denial of admission would \u201cresult in extreme hardship\u201d to the American citizen or permanent resident. INA \u00a7 212(h)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">However, an alien who has \u201cbeen convicted of an aggravated felony\u201d is not eligible for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver. INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). A theft offense is an aggravated felony. INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(G), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). Even if the BIA had waived Barton\u2019s robbery convictions, waiver of an alien\u2019s conviction under former INA \u00a7 212(c) does not operate as \u201ca pardon or expungement of the conviction itself\u201d and such a conviction can still serve as a basis for deportation. <em>See In re Balderas, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 389, 391 (1991); <em>cf. Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 809 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that \u201cstate convictions expunged under a rehabilitative statute are still convictions for immigration purposes\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Barton is not eligible for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver of his marijuana conviction because his robbery convictions are aggravated felonies. His unwaived marijuana conviction is sufficient to deny him relief of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). Thus, the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Barton\u2019s request for relief from removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\">. Although Congress repealed \u00a7 212(c) in 1996, Barton, who pleaded guilty before the repeal, can still seek \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>See Alexandre v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>452 F.3d 1204, 1207 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
