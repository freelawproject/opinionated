His advisory Guidelines\u2019 sentencing range was calculated to be 77 to 96 months; and he was sentenced, <em>inter alia, </em>to 77 months\u2019 imprisonment. Castillo does <em>not </em>challenge the calculation of his sentencing range; instead, he claims the 77-month sentence imposed is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">In that regard, Castillo urges his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court could not consider a claimed sentencing disparity resulting from the absence of a \u201cfast-track\u201d early-disposition program. Castillo correctly acknowledges that this issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">Castillo also urges his sentence is substantively unreasonable because: the district court did not adequately consider his motives for returning to the United States; the Guidelines give too much weight to his criminal history; and his within-Guidelines sentence overstates the seriousness of his offense conduct. Our court normally \u201cconsiders the \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard\u2019 \u201d. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Moreover, \u201c[i]f the sentence is within the Guideline range, the appellate court may ... apply a presumption of reasonableness\u201d. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. (We need not decide whether Castillo\u2019s requests, in district court, for a below-Guidelines sentence preserved review for reasonableness under the usual abuse-of-discretion, vice plain-error, standard, because his sentence is affirmed under either standard. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008).)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-19\">The district court explained that it determined the within-Guidelines, 77-month sentence to be \u201ca fair and reasonable sentence\u201d after considering the advisory Guidelines and their policy statements, the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Castillo\u2019s allo-cution, and the factual information contained in the presentence investigation report. The district court: acknowledged that the advisory sentence was \u201ca pretty healthy sentence\u201d; but stated that it was particularly troubled by the serious nature of Castillo\u2019s numerous prior offenses, including burglary of a habitation, attempted burglary of a habitation, forgery with intent to pass, aggravated robbery, robbery, and failure to appear. Castillo has not rebutted the presumption that his sentence is reasonable or otherwise established error.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b905-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
