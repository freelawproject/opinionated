California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Sanchez-Oveida has filed a response and has moved for appointment of new counsel and to proceed pro se on appeal. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Sanchez-Oveida\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Because Sanchez-Oveida did not raise claims of ineffective assistance of counsel below and the district court did not hear evidence regarding an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, the record is insufficient for this court to review Sanchez-Oveida\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, and counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein. Sanchez-Oveida\u2019s motions for appointment of new counsel and to proceed pro se on appeal are DENIED. The APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b75-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
