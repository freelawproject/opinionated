Gavar-rete argues, for the first time in this court, that her claim for asylum and withholding of removal is based on her membership in a particular social group: \u201cyoung females of Central America.\u201d Because Gavarrete did not raise this argument before the BIA, the issue is unexhausted, and this court lacks jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 317-19 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-25\">Gavarrete does not directly challenge in her petition for review or brief the BIA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>determination that she failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground. Rather, she concedes that she did not argue before the BIA or IJ that she was a member of the particular social group consisting of \u201cyoung females of Central America.\u201d She also does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that she had waived any claim for relief under the CAT. Gavarrete has abandoned these issues by failing to brief them. <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Accordingly, Gavarrete\u2019s petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b72-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
