Tran, Singh, and Roundtree conspired to deny Brumfield medical treatment for an infection and life-threatening bowel problems; and Assistant Warden Dodd responded evasively to Brumfield\u2019s administrative grievance. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Brumfield\u2019s claims against former Corrections Secretary Stalder and Dr. Tran for failure to prosecute and, over Brumfield\u2019s objection, dismissed his claims against the remaining defendants pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted). The dismissal was without prejudice to any state law claims raised by Brumfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">Brumfield has abandoned his claims against former Corrections Secretary Stalder and Dr. Tran and his claim concerning Assistant Warden Dodd\u2019s handling of his administrative grievance, by failing to challenge the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissal. <em>E.g., Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Brumfield has likewise abandoned his claim that Assistant Warden Stagg and Drs. Singh and Roundtree denied him treatment for an infection and bowel problems. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-2\">Dismissal of Brumfield\u2019s other claims is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1230, 1231, 170 L.Ed.2d 63 (2008); Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We hold Brumfield has failed to state facts adequate to support a claim of retaliation. <em>See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995). \u201cTo state a claim of retaliation an inmate must allege the violation of a specific constitutional right and be prepared to establish that but for the retaliatory motive the complained of incident ... would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Woods, </em>60 F.3d at 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">In this regard, Brumfield received medical treatment for his gastrointestinal and shoulder problems and was provided ankle braces in lieu of orthopedic shoes. His dissatisfaction with his treatment does not establish that defendants \u201c \u2018refused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for [his] serious medical needs\u2019 \u201d. <em>Domino v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b955-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
