Adame-Roman argues that the district court erred in imposing an upward variance from the advisory guidelines range of 15 to 21 months of imprisonment. He contends that the district court impermissibly re-characterized his prior state drug offense as a drug-trafficking offense and that the district court\u2019s \u201creliance on its own resistance to this Court\u2019s precedents\u201d constitutes plain error. He contends that the district court therefore erred by considering an improper factor under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. Essentially, he argues that his non-guidelines sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-16\">Because Adame-Roman did not ever object below to anything done or said at the sentencing hearing, to the September 10, 2008 PSR or to the reasonableness of the sentence imposed, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). A plain error is a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>When those elements are met, this court has the discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-17\">The prior conviction in question was an April 2005 Texas guilty plea conviction for delivery of a controlled substance for which the original sentence was three years\u2019 deferred adjudication probation; in January 2006 his probation was revoked and Adame-Roman was sentenced to six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>years\u2019 imprisonment. He was released on parole on April 2, 2007 (parole term to expire January 2012) and was deported to Mexico on April 28, 2007 (he thereafter reentered the United States without permission and was found therein in December 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The PSR reflects the Texas information to which Adame-Roman plead guilty alleged that on January 23, 2003, he did \u201c... intentionally or knowingly deliver, by constructive transfer, to Raul Luna, a controlled substance, namely, cocaine, in an amount of one gram or more but less than four grams; intentionally or knowingly deliver, by actual transfer, to Raul Luna, a controlled substance, namely, cocaine, in an amount of one gram or more but less than four grams; intentionally or knowingly deliver, by offer to sell, to Raul Luna, a controlled substance, namely, cocaine, in an amount of one gram or more but less than four grams.... \u201d The PSR goes on to state respecting this conviction: \u201cAccording to the stipulation of evidence and judicial confession section in defendant\u2019s plea agreement, Adame-Roman in open Court and under oath, judicially confesses to the offense(s) alleged in the indictment or complaint and information and admits that he/she committed each and every element alleged in the complaint and information and that he was guilty as charged. The defendant pleads true to enhancement allegations and special issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">At sentencing the district court expressly accepted the PSR\u2019s calculation of the adjusted offense level as 10, and criminal history category of IV, with resulting advisory guideline range of 15 to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment (the district court did correct the PSR\u2019s misstatement of the statutory maximum sentence). The court observed that under Texas law the offense of delivery of a controlled substance under Texas Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.112(a) could be committed by offering to sell as well as by actual or constructive transfer, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 481.002(8),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that this court had held that as a categorical matter a delivery conviction under section 481.112(a) could not be considered \u201ca drug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), as defined in Application Note l(B)(iv), <em>unless </em>the state record appropriately reflected that the conviction was <em>not </em>based merely on an offer to sell. The district court recognized that in <em>United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 481 (5th Cir.2008), this court held that a written judicial confession that expressly and specifically stated that the defendant did \u201cactually transfer, constructively transfer <em>and </em>offer to sell controlled substance\u201d (emphasis added), sufficed to show that the offense qualified as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), but distinguished that decision because there \u201cthe defendant actually in the written judicial confession confessed to actually transferring, constructively transferring and offering to sell drugs\u201d while \u201cin this case the defendant just admits to the allegations contained in the information.\u201d So, the district court said, that although that specific guidelines issue was \u201cresolved in the defendant\u2019s favor; but I can also take that into account in determining whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>guidelines are appropriate. So its kind of a little bit of both.\u201d At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the district court, just before pronouncing the sentence, observed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-5\">\u201cI look at your background; and it\u2019s very troubling and very troubling and very disturbing. I\u2019m also disturbed by the fact that unfortunately based on Fifth Circuit law your [Texas] delivery case doesn\u2019t count as a delivery case even though that\u2019s what it actually was. So based on the history and characteristics of the defendant, the true seriousness of the offense, based on the delivery charge that can\u2019t count as a drug trafficking offense, the need to promote respect for the law and the need to provide just punishment the Court finds that the advisory guidelines [15-21 months] are not adequate and that a fair and reasonable sentence can only be achieved by a sentence selected from outside of the advisory range.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The district court did not clearly or obviously err in saying that defendant\u2019s Texas conviction was a conviction for delivery under section 481.112 and that under Texas law it was actually a delivery case. Nor do we see anything clearly or obviously unreasonable in the district court\u2019s implicit conclusion that defendant\u2019s Texas offense though not quite \u201ca drug trafficking offense\u201d under section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), nevertheless had some substantial similarities thereto relevant to the seriousness of the offense. <em>See, e.g., U.S. v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 715, 717 (5th Cir.2007) (Texas offense of \u201cpossesses with intent to deliver a controlled substance\u201d under section 481.112(a) \u201cis indistinguishable from the offense of \u2018possession with intent to distribute,\u2019 one of the offenses listed in USSG\u2019s definition of a controlled substance offense;\u201d distinguishing case where the Texas conviction was for \u201cjust delivery\u201d). <em>See also Vasquez-Martinez v. Holder, </em>564 F.3d 712, 717-19 (5th Cir.2009). <em>And see </em>U.S.S.G. Amendment 722, effective November 1, 2008, which <em>\u201cclarifies </em>that an \u2018offer to sell\u2019 a controlled substance is a \u2018drug trafficking offense\u2019 for purposes of subsection (b)(1) of \u00a7 2L1.2 ...\u201d (emphasis added). And, it is neither plain nor obvious that the district court\u2019s 36 month sentence either amounts to essentially or practically the same thing as treating appellant\u2019s Texas \u00a7 481.112(a) conviction as being \u201ca drug trafficking offense\u201d under section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) <em>or </em>constitutes an unreasonably harsh sentence. As appellant correctly admits (brief, p. 14), the appropriate guideline range for him, considering his Texas section 481.112(a) conviction as \u201ca drug trafficking offense\u201d under section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) would have been 63 to 78 months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">The district court in this case properly calculated the sentencing guideline range but concluded that a sentence within that range would be insufficient to achieve specific sentencing objectives in light of \u00a7 3553(a). The district court provided specific reasons for varying upward from the guidelines range, including Adame-Ro-man\u2019s prior state court drug conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">In <em>U.S. v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522 (5th Cir.2006), we upheld an analogous approach to that taken by the district court here.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">We previously have noted that a district court may rely upon a factor already incorporated into the guidelines range to justify a non-guidelines sentence, <em>see United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 811 &amp; n. 55 (5th Cir.2008), and may impose a non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>guidelines sentence based upon its dissatisfaction with the guidelines sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2008). In this case, we defer to the district court\u2019s determination that its variance is justified by application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Williams, </em>517 F.3d at 808-13. Further, the extent of the variance at issue in this case is consistent with other sentences that this court has affirmed. <em>See, e.g., Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 348-50; <em>United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 530-32 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708-10 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b913-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-6\">. Texas Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.112(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-7\">\"Except as authorized by this chapter, a person commits an offense if the person knowingly manufactures, delivers, or possesses with intent to deliver a controlled substance listed in Penalty Group 1 [which includes cocaine].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Section 481.002(8) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-10\">\" 'Deliver' means to transfer, actually or constructively, to another a controlled substance, counterfeit substance, or drug paraphernalia, regardless of whether there is an agency relationship. The term includes offering to sell a controlled substance, counterfeit substance, or drug paraphernalia.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-7\">. See \u00a7 2L1.2, application note l(B)(vii). \u201cThe length of the sentence imposed includes any term of imprisonment given upon revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release.\u201d Here on revocation of probation or parole appellant was sentenced to six years by the Texas court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
