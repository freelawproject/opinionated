No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-18\">McLean was convicted of crack cocaine offenses and a firearms charge; he was sentenced in 1995 to 465 months\u2019 imprisonment (405 months\u2019 on the drug charges and 60 months\u2019 consecutive on the firearms charge). In 2008, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), McLean filed a motion to reduce his sentence based on a retroactive amendment of the guidelines for crack cocaine offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government agreed that Amendment 706 applied to McLean\u2019s sentence; if McLean\u2019s guideline offense level was lowered by the amendment, the resulting guideline range for the crack cocaine offenses would be 262-327 months\u2019 imprisonment. But the government argued that the district court should exercise its discretion to deny the motion based on McLean\u2019s history of prison disciplinary violations. McLean\u2019s prison disciplinary record chronicled 17 separate disciplinary reports filed between December 1995 and November 2003. The government argued that McLean posed a danger to public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The district court denied McLean\u2019s section 3582(c)(2) motion:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">Defendant seeks a reduction in the guidelines range based on Amendment 706. In assessing a potential reduction in the guidelines range, this Court looks to Defendant\u2019s numerous disciplinary violations while incarcerated in concluding that Defendant\u2019s sentence shall remain unchanged, pursuant to the discretion afforded by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, n. l(b)(ii) (stating that a court may consider post-sentencing conduct). Therefore, no adjustment is warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">If section 3582 applies, a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). And if a district court is authorized to reduce a sentence pursuant to section 3582(c)(2), it may do so \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A sentencing adjustment under section 3582(c)(2) allows no full <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3) (\u201cproceedings under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement do not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">As noted by the district court, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 comment., n. l.(B)(ii) directs the district court, when considering a sentence reduction as a result of an amended guideline, to \u201cconsider the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment.\u201d And U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 comment., n. l(B)(iii) expressly allows the district court to consider post-sentencing conduct when determining whether \u2014 and to what extent \u2014 a reduction is warranted. All original sentencing determinations are to remain unchanged with only the amended guideline range substituted for the unamended guideline range used at sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, n. 2; <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">The gravamen of McLean\u2019s argument is that the district court\u2019s reliance on the prison disciplinary records to deny McLean a sentence reduction constituted an abuse of discretion. McLean suggests that those records fail to include sufficient facts; and he argues further that none of the incidents resulted in further charges against the defendant. Although some of these incidents were minor (such as being insolent to a staff member), other incidents were not (assault with serious injury and possession of dangerous weapons). That no further charges were filed does not vitiate the bad behavior.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Pursuant to the retroactive guidelines amendment, the district court had authority \u2014 but was under no legal obligation \u2014 to resentence McLean. <em>See United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997). In the light of McLean\u2019s prison disciplinary record and criminal history and characteristics, we can not say the district court abused its discretion when it denied McLean a sentence reduction.'<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-12\">. Amendment 706 revised U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 by reducing by two levels the offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. Subject to technical changes effected by Amendment 711, Amendment 706 was made retroactive as of 3 March 2008 by Amendment 713.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\">. Before determining whether, and to what extent, a section 3582(c)(2) motion is due to be granted, the district court should first use the amended guidelines to recalculate a defendant's base offense level. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s order fails to show that the district court first recalculated McLean's amended offense level and guideline range in the light of the amendment, but McLean raises no challenge based on this failure. <em>See United States v. Britt, </em>437 F.3d 1103, 1104-05 (llth Cir.2006) (this Court will not consider issues not raised in a defendant's initial brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b529-12\">. McLean cites us to <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>540 F.Supp.2d 676 (W.D.Va.2008), wherein the district court opted to grant a reduction while noting that other means existed for punishing prison behavior. We do not accept that the potentiality of other penalties relieves the district court of the obligation \u2014 as set out in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 comment, n. l(B)(ii) and (iii) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 to consider the public safety and post-sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>behavior when ruling on a sentence-reduction motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b530-17\">. The district court failed to recite specifically its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but this supports no reversible error. <em>See Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1322. The district court judge had (i) presided over McLean's trial and sentencing, (ii) had received and considered McLean's PSI, (iii) had the benefit of the parties\u2019 submissions on the section 3582(c) motion, and (iv) indicated that McLean's disciplinary record especially influenced its decision. Sufficient reasons were stated for the denial of a reduced sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
