A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, unauthorized under section 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Amendment 706 \u2014 which became retroactive on 3 March 2008, U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. 1 May 2008) \u2014 reduced by two the base offense levels in crack cocaine sentences calculated pursuant to the drug quantity table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-17\">Here, the district court committed no error in denying Wilson a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706: because Wilson was designated a career offender at his original sentencing, his offense level was based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not on the drug quantity-table in section 2Dl.l(e). And we have concluded that a crack cocaine defendant, like Wilson, who was sentenced as a career offender under section 4B1.1 is ineligible for a section 8582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 706. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009) (concluding that, because defendants\u2019 final offense levels were not based on section 2D1.1, their sentences were not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that ha[d] subsequently been lowered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Wilson argues that <em>Moore </em>recognized an exception for defendants, like himself, who were designated as career offenders but received downward departures pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l) for overrepresented criminal history. But Wilson\u2019s section 4A1.3(b)(l) downward departure applied only to his criminal history category, not to his offense level. Nothing indicates that the court did not sentence Wilson as a career offender. Thus, any possible exception discussed in <em>Moore </em>would not apply. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1329-30.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">The district court concluded correctly that it lacked the authority to reduce Wilson\u2019s sentence under section 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-12\">. Wilson did not file a formal section 3582(c)(2) motion. Instead, on the promulgation of Amendment 706, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>appointed counsel for Wilson and ordered responses about his potential eligibility for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AfR\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's legal conclusions about the scope of its authority in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b583-12\">. We note our doubts about whether <em>Moore </em>created an exception to the general rule that defendants sentenced as career offenders are ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. <em>Moore </em>simply distinguished two out-of-circuit district court cases where defendants who qualified as career offenders and received section 4A1.3(b)(1) downward departures did receive sentence reductions under Amendment 706. But these defendants also had their offense levels reduced, unlike the defendants in <em>Moore. See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
