Defendant was found to be a career offender; his sentencing range calculated under the career offender provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 trumped the sentencing range that otherwise would have applied when calculated under the drug quantity tables of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. As a career offender, Defendant was sentenced to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 5 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">Defendant filed his section 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence based on Amendment 706 which amended the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to cocaine base offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant argues that his sentencing as a career offender is no bar to the section 3582 relief he seeks. Defendant\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">The district court had no authority to modify Defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment. Section 3582(c)(2) authorizes a comb to modify a term of imprisonment once imposed only \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (a reduction under \u00a7 3582 is not authorized where \u201can amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-17\">In <em>Moore, </em>we held that a defendant whose final sentence was based on the career offender provisions of section 4B1.1 was not sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. <em>Moore </em>noted that the base offense levels under section 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of the sentencing guideline range for the defendant sentenced as a career offender. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>contention that the offense levels set out in section 4B1.1 are dependant on the drug quantity table in section 2D1.1 is mistaken; the section 4B1.1 offense levels are dependent on the statutory maximum applicable to the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Even though Amendment 706 amended retroactively base offense levels under section 2D1.1, it effected no change to Defendant\u2019s guidelines range as a career offender; the district court was not authorized to reduce the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-11\">. In response to Defendant's appeal, the government moved for summary affirmance or, if the motion was denied, for its motion to be treated as its brief. We DENY the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance; we GRANT its motion for its motion to be treated as its brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Agk\">. Amendment 706 became effective November 1, 2007. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The Amendment was made retroactive as of March 3, 2008, by incorporation into \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b585-16\">.
