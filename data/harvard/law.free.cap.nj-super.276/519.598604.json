Plaintiffs argue that: (1) under the County Planning Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:27-1 to -8, the County Planning Board had no authority to assess the impact fees; (2) the New Jersey Transportation Development District Act (TDDA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:1C-1 to -18, is the exclusive means by which traffic impact fees can be assessed against developers; and (8) the assessment against plaintiffs fails to meet \u201cestablished standards of constitutionality for the imposition and allocation of impact fees\u201d as defined by our Supreme Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Plaintiffs own a 40.4 acre tract of land in Warren Township. Along its southerly boarder, the tract abuts Mountain Boulevard, a county road. In the 1980\u2019s, the property was subdivided into two separate tracts. On the parcel fronting Mountain Boulevard plaintiffs proposed an office condominium complex. On the rear portion, known as the Windermere Development, plaintiffs proposed a subdivision of 117 single-family homes and 60 \u201cMount Laurel\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rental units. The subdivision provided for two access roads from the residential development to Mountain Boulevard.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">On June 13, 1988, defendant Township of Warren Planning Board granted preliminary major subdivision approval for the Windermere development. The approving resolution \u201cspecifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>reserved\u201d several issues, including the \u201cnecessity for off tract traffic improvements\u201d as well as the computation of plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cfair share contribution for future traffic improvements on Mountain Boulevard[.]\u201d The approval was also conditioned upon plaintiffs obtaining approval from the County Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">On June 28, 1988, plaintiffs, together with other developers having proposed developments, met with representatives of the Township and County Planning Boards to discuss the traffic and storm water implications of their proposed developments. The applicants, including plaintiffs, agreed to pay for a \u201cjoint traffic study.\u201d Garmen Associates was hired to conduct the study.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The Garmen study recommended that the Township of Warren establish a Transportation Improvement District (TID) in order to fund roadway improvements on a unified basis. The study also devised a formula for calculating each development\u2019s pro-rata share of the cost of the improvements; the formula was based on the number of \u201ctrips\u201d generated by that development.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The Garmen study was adopted by the Warren Township Planning Board as part of the Township\u2019s Master Plan. Also, in October 1990, Warren Township enacted an ordinance creating the recommended TID. The TID ordinance set forth a formula for computing each developer\u2019s \u201cpro rata share of [development] impact fees,\u201d and required developers to enter into fee agreements with the Township (and with Somerset County to the extent that egress from or ingress upon a county road is implicated).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In February 1991, plaintiffs, the County and Township of Warren entered into an agreement under which the County Planning Board determined that plaintiffs\u2019 pro-rata contribution for off-tract improvements associated with the Windermere development was $244,774, less Mount Laurel credits. Pursuant to the agreement, but under protest, plaintiffs posted, by cash or letter of credit, approximately $137,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Plaintiff's also received site plan approval from the Township Planning Board for the construction of the office complex on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>tract fronting on Mountain Boulevard. The approving resolution provides that plaintiffs shall enter into an agreement with the County regarding \u201cimprovements to be made on ... Mountain Boulevard.\u201d The County Planning Board approved the site plan on April 6, 1992, and determined, in accordance with the Township\u2019s TID ordinance, that the project\u2019s contribution to the Mountain Boulevard corridor study totalled $63,480. Plaintiffs also paid this assessment under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Plaintiffs argue that under the County Planning Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:27-1 to -8, the County Planning Board had no jurisdiction to impose the traffic impact fees. Plaintiffs point out, and correctly so, that there is no express authority under the Act for the County Planning Board to impose assessments for off-tract improvements. The County defendants counter this point by noting that in <em>Squires </em>Gate, <em>Inc. v. County of Monmouth, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 588 A.2d 824 (App.Div.1991), the court held that despite the absence of express authority under the Act, the County Planning Board had the implied authority to assess for off-tract improvements for the reasons expressed in <em>Divan Builders, Inc. v. Planning Bd., </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>582, 334 A.2d 30 (1975), namely that it is \u201cmore fair for the developer to bear the expense of an improvement which benefits it directly rather than placing the burden on the community at large.\u201d <em>Squires Gate, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 7, 334 A.2d 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">We need not address the issue concerning the County Planning Board\u2019s statutory jurisdiction under the County Planning Act, nor do we express our agreement or disagreement with the <em>Squires Gate </em>holding that county planning boards have an inherent power to impose off-tract improvement assessments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>fact that the County Planning Board computed the assessment against plaintiffs, the assessment was made in accordance with the <em>municipal </em>TID ordinance. Further, the Warren Township Planning Board\u2019s subdivision approval was conditioned upon plaintiffs\u2019 payment of their \u201cfair share contribution for future traffic' improvements on Mountain Boulevard[.]\u201d Moreover, the Township was a party to the joint agreement which fixed plaintiffs\u2019 pro-rata share based on its TID ordinance and the Garmen study. Therefore, the Township and its Planning Board had the independent power to impose the traffic fees in accordance with the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-1 to -136. That power is derived from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-42, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">The governing body may by ordinance adopt regulations requiring a developer, as a condition for approval of a subdivision or site plan, to pay its pro-rata share of the cost of providing only reasonable and necessary street improvements and water, sewerage and drainage facilities, and easements therefor, located outside the property limits of the subdivision or development but necessitated or required by construction or improvements within such subdivision or development.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Warren Township\u2019s TID ordinance provides the requisite regulatory standards to impose the assessment as a condition to plaintiffs\u2019 approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Alternatively, plaintiffs argue that, notwithstanding the Township\u2019s statutory power to assess for off-tract improvements under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-42, it may not do so by imposing traffic impact fees because the New Jersey Transportation Development District Act (TDDA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27.TC-1 to -18, is the exclusive statutory authority for imposing such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The TDDA permits counties to establish \u201ctransportation development districts\u201d designed to assess fees against developers in order to pay for transportation improvements necessitated by increased development. <em>N.J.S.A </em>27:lC-2c; <em>N.J.SA </em>27:lC-3. The Act provides a mechanism by which the county obtains approval from the Commissioner of the Department of Transportation to create a transportation development district. <em>N.J.S.A </em>27:1CM and -5. Upon the Commissioner\u2019s approval and the drafting of plans for the operation and financing of the district, the countj may adopt a district transportation improvement plan, and assess and collect development fees on developments within the district. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:2C-7a. The fees are to be \u201creasonably related to the added traffic growth attributable to the development,\u201d and the maximum fee \u201cshall not exceed the property owner\u2019s \u2018fair share\u2019 of such improvement costs.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:1C-7h. Finally, the governing body of a municipality may petition the county to initiate an application for the designation of a transportation development district under the Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27-1C-15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Plaintiffs argued before Judge Coleman in the Law Division that the TDDA \u201cpreempt[s] the municipalities\u201d from imposing such fees, because \u201cyou can\u2019t have all the municipalities in the State of New Jersey enacting their own small TID districts within the municipality to circumvent the [TDDA] law enacted by the State. That would be utter chaos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Judge Coleman properly rejected plaintiffs\u2019 exclusivity argument. The TDDA must be read sensibly and, since the Act and the MLUL share a common purpose (control of traffic), they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>should be harmonized, not read in conflict. <em>Miller v. Passaic Valley Water Comm\u2019n, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 12, 611 A.2d 128 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>601, 617 A.2d 1222 (1992); <em>D.I.AL., Inc. v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 439, 603 A.2d 967 (App.Div.1992). The TDDA\u2019s statutory scheme is not so pervasive that it precludes coexistent municipal power to assess traffic impact fees. The TDDA focuses on the \u201cexplosive growth in certain regions, often along State highway routes____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:lC-2a. Thus, the Act is a unique response to special conditions not necessarily present in all areas of the State; it does not pretend to encompass every pocket of traffic generated, for example, by a modest subdivision development or site plan placed before a local planning board. In such cases, the off-tract assessment mechanism, in the form of a traffic impact fee or otherwise, authorized by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-42 and implemented by municipal ordinance, provides the municipal board with the appropriate means to address local conditions and special vehicular problems associated with the particular development before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Also, as Judge Coleman properly noted, the TDDA does not speak in mandatory terms. The Act provides that the county <em>\u201cmay ... </em>apply to the commissioner for the designation ... of a transportation development district within the boundaries of the county.\u201d N.J.S.A, 27:lC-4a (emphasis added). <em>See also N.J.S.A, </em>27:lC-6a; N.J.S.A, 27:lC-7a. \u201c \u2018May' is a permissive and not an imperative verb which is to be given its natural and ordinary meaning, barring a clear contextual indication of a different usage.\u201d <em>Leeds v. Harrison, </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>202, 213, 87 A.2d 713 (1952). <em>See also Diodato v. Camden Cty. Park Comm\u2019n, </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>324, 327, 346 A.2d 100 (App.Div.1975). Nothing in the TDDA compels a county to adopt a transportation development district. It is illogical to conclude that if the county does not, a municipality is left without the power to devise such an assessment-fee scheme pursuant to its express power under the MLUL. Indeed, the provisions of the TDDA suggest a contrary view. The Act expressly states that \u201c[t]he provisions of this act shall not be construed as affecting municipal reviews and approvals of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>posed developments under the provisions of the \u201cMunicipal Land Use Law[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:lC-16c. This legislative declaration makes it abundantly clear that the Act was not intended to provide the exclusive means by which traffic impact fees may be assessed against developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Plaintiffs also argue that the Township\u2019s TID ordinance and the assessment are \u201cultra vires\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional\u201d because: (1) the district encompassed within the ordinance is not a \u201crelated and common area,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-42, and thus the \u201cbut for\u201d nexus required by the statute cannot be established on a \u201cper development basis\u201d; (2) the need for the off-tract improvements \u201ccannot be laid at the door\u201d of individual developments because existing and future growths throughout the Township will have an equal if not greater impact on major roads, including Mountain Boulevard; (3) the ordinance unlawfully allocates the cost of future public projects based on their anticipated impact; and (4) the ordinance generally fails to consider road users outside the district or proposed improvements paid for by the general public. We reject the arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The MLUL does not expressly preclude the use of a \u201ctrip generation\u201d methodology as employed by the Garmen study and adopted by the Township\u2019s TID ordinance. Indeed, the Act is silent as to how a municipality, by ordinance, may devise \u201creasonable standards\u201d by which a developer\u2019s pro-rata share of off-tract costs is to be computed. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-42. Thus, the Legislature reposed in the governing body discretion in tailoring a methodology which is most sensitive to local conditions peculiar to the community in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">The municipality\u2019s discretion, however, is circumscribed. The developer\u2019s pro-rata share must be \u201cnecessitated or required by construction or improvements within such subdivision or development.\u201d N.J.<em>S.A. </em>40:55D-42. The statute is a codification of preMLUL cases which focused on the \u201crational nexus\u201d between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>needs created by, and benefits conferred upon, the subdivision and the cost of the off-tract improvements. <em>Longridge Builders, Inc. v. Planning Bd., </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>348, 350, 245 A.2d 336 (1968); <em>Divan Builders, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>at 598, 334 A.2d 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Post-MLUL cases have embraced this \u201crational nexus\u201d requirement. <em>See New Jersey Builders Ass\u2019n v. Mayor &amp; Tp. Comm., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>223, 237, 528 A.2d 555 (1987) (a municipality\u2019s authority to charge developers is limited to \u201cimprovements the need for which arose as a direct consequence of the particular subdivision or development under review\u201d); <em>Baltica Constr. Co. v. Planning Bd., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>428, 434, 537 A.2d 319 (App.Div. 1988) (\u201cin determining a developer\u2019s pro-rata share, the [planning] board may consider the fact that but for the subdivision, the improvement may not have been installed at all\u201d). The \u201cnexus\u201d requirement \u2018.\u2018is grounded on considerations of fundamental fairness and constitutional doctrine,\u201d mandating \u201cequality of treatment.\u201d <em>Vrabel v. Mayor &amp; Council, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>109, 118, 601 A.2d 229 (App.Div.1992). The requirement achieves two ends. It ensures that a developer pays for improvements that are a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of the development, and protects a developer from \u201cpaying a disproportionate share of the cost of improvements that also benefit other persons.\u201d <em>Holmdel Builders Ass\u2019n v. Township of Holmdel, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>550, 571, 583 A.2d 277 (1990). Thus, whatever methodology is applied by a municipality, it must satisfy the \u201crational nexus\u201d and \u201cequality of treatment\u201d criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The problem with plaintiffs\u2019 multi-prong challenge to the Township\u2019s ordinance and assessment is that it assumes that a causal nexus between the necessity for off-tract improvements and the development must be measured with precision. It is true that our Supreme Court in <em>New Jersey Builders Ass\u2019n, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 237, 528 A.2d 555, required a showing that the necessity for the improvement is a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of the development. However, land-use principles cannot be applied with exactitude. It cannot be seriously argued that a municipality must compute with precision to what extent improvements to an off-tract road network are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of a residential or office development. What must be demonstrated is a \u201crational\u201d nexus, not mathematical certainty. For example, the assessment should not be invalidated simply because there may be a residual benefit conferred to the general publie in its use of the off-tract road improvement. An assessment is subject to challenge only if the developer is required to pay a <em>\u201cdisproportionate </em>share of the cost of improvements that also benefit other persons.\u201d <em>Holmdel, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 571, 583 A.2d 277 (emphasis added). The methodology employed by the ordinance and the actual computation of the assessment against the developer are subject to the arbitrary and capricious standard. <em>See 515 Assocs. v. City of Newark, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>180, 185-86, 623 A.2d 1366 (1993). The question therefore is whether the TID ordinance and assessment before us fall short of that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">We agree with Judge Coleman that the Township\u2019s ordinance satisfies the \u201crational nexus\u201d requirement and that the assessment against plaintiffs is fully sustainable. The ordinance was adopted only after a comprehensive study (the Garmen study) of such factors as existing road facilities, current zoning, projected population growth, and existing commercial uses in the area. The study devised a volume/capacity ratio, measuring the demand volume and Mountain Boulevard\u2019s capacity. Based on projected full development of potential residential, retail and office use, the study adopted a vehicle \u201ctrip generation\u201d methodology and from this model, predicted incremental traffic impact resulting from future development of land. The study estimated how much extra traffic would be generated by each development in the target area (Mountain Boulevard and surrounding roadways). The estimates were grounded on industrial standards, observations and empirical data obtained from traffic counts. The study then suggested what roadway improvements would be needed to accommodate the increased demands, and estimated the cost of those improvements. Plaintiffs challenge none of this methodology used in the Garmen study.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The Township\u2019s TID ordinance adopts the results of the exacting Garmen study and incorporates Garmen\u2019s formula for calculating each developer\u2019s share of the cost of the needed off-tract improvements. The ordinance authorizes traffic impact fees according to the formula included in the Township\u2019s Master Plan and developed by the Garmen study. The express purpose of the fees is to \u201csatisfy the developer\u2019s proportionate and pro-rat[a] contribution to the cost of reasonable and necessary off-tract roadway improvements necessitated by new development ... within ... an established\u201d district. The \u201cdata\u201d upon which the fees are calculated would be \u201cadjusted\u201d as conditions changed. The ordinance exempts a developer from the fee if the development\u2019s off-tract 'impact is \u201cnegligible\u201d or that the development would not benefit from the highway improvements. It is undisputed that the assessment against plaintiffs was computed in accordance with the Garmen study and standards of the Township ordinance. In short, the Township engaged in a rigorous process designed to achieve a fair allocation of increased traffic costs. Plaintiffs\u2019 eonclusory objections to the assessment are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\"><em>New Jersey Builders Ass\u2019n, </em>on which plaintiffs rely, is clearly distinguishable. There, the Township adopted an extensive roadway improvement program involving improvements to twenty-two township roads, seven county roads, bridges, intersections and parking facilities. It devised a mechanism for allocating the cost of the program between the Township, its residents and developers. 108 <em>N.J. </em>at 225, 528 A.2d 555. Following the premise that all new development contributes to the need of township-wide road improvements, the ordinance required developers to contribute their pro-rata share of the cost of the plan, calculating the share according to \u201ctrip generation\u201d forecasts designed to predict how much extra traffic would be generated by new developments collectively. <em>Id. </em>at 225, 528 A.2d 555. The Court invalidated the ordinance because the formula made no attempt to calculate the traffic impact attributable to each individual development. <em>Id. </em>at 237, 528 A.2d 555. Notably, however, it added the following footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>We add one important qualification. By our decision we do not purport to determine the limits of specific applications of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D~42, nor do we exclude its possible application to a street, water, sewerage, or drainage facility affecting all or substantially all of a municipality if the direct causal relationship between the development and the need for the improvement is demonstrated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">[Id at 237, n. 5, 528 A.2d 555.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Here, unlike <em>New Jersey Builders Ass\u2019n, </em>the TID ordinance focuses on a discrete area of Warren Township, not the projected traffic needs of the entire municipality.
