Each LMA constitutes the \u201ccounties and municipalities in the State that are grouped in accordance with similar labor costs,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-1.1, and impacts on the rate adjustment for such costs. Specifically, appellants challenge the validity of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-5.14(d)(2) and (3), and contend that the use of a separate \u201cNewton-Phillipsburg\u201d LMA, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-5.14(d)(3)(iii), is arbitrary, capricious and unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">We need not detail the background regarding appellants\u2019 challenge to prior regulations and the amendments they now attack. Suffice it to say that in 1992 the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey ruled that the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1002 <em>et seq. </em>(ERISA), preempted certain aspects of New Jersey\u2019s legislative \u201cscheme for regulating hospital rates and the regulations promulgated thereunder\u201d and declared \u201cthat New Jersey\u2019s hospital rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>setting scheme is unenforceable.\u201d <em>United Wire, Health &amp; Welfare Fund v. Morristown, </em>793 <em>F.Supp. </em>524, 526 (D.N.J.1992). Although a divided Third Circuit ultimately reversed the determination under ERISA, 995 F.2d 1179 (3d Cir.1993), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>382, 126 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>332 (1993), our Legislature had in the interim enacted the \u201cHealth Care Reform Act of 1992,\u201d <em>L. </em>1992, c. 160 (\u201cChapter 160\u201d) (repealing and amending portions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H, and adopting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-18.5 <em>et seq. </em>and 43:21-7a <em>et seq.) </em>in response to the District Court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Chapter 160 was enacted on November 30,1992, and essentially eliminated the former rate setting methodology and permitted hospitals to set their own rates for patients other than Medicare patients (whose rates are set by the federal government) and Medicaid recipients (whose rates are set by the State if the State\u2019s Medicaid Assistance Plan complies with federal regulation). As a result of the new legislation, on March 11, 1993, the Division adopted emergency regulations \u201cto establish a rate setting methodology for those Medicaid categorically and optional categorically eligible individuals that require instate inpatient acute care (general) and special (Classification A) hospital care.\u201d 25 <em>N.J.R. </em>1582 (April 5, 1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the period for review and comment, the regulations were formally adopted, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, with some amendments on May 10, 1993, the date on which the emergency amendments expired, and with some further amendments, on June 7,1993. <em>See </em>25 <em>N.J.R. </em>2560 (June 7, 1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>The new regulations specifically provided that \u201c[t]he Labor Market areas recognized in 1990 rate setting at N.J.A.C. 8:31B-3.22(d)3 will be used for rate setting in subsequent years.\u201d <em>N.JAC. </em>10:52-5.14(d)(2). Eleven areas were so designated, including \u201cNewton-Phillipsburg\u201d comprised of Sussex and Warren Counties, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52 \u2014 5.14(d)(3)(iii), and \u201cNewark, Suburban,\u201d comprised of Union, Essex, Somerset and Morris Counties except for certain large urban cities including Newark itself which were placed in the \u201cNewark, Central City\u201d LMA. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-5.14(d)(3)(v) and (xi).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Rates are now established by a \u201ccost base\u201d which includes the \u201creasonable\u201d \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d \u201cpatient care costs,\u201d \u201creasonable physician costs,\u201d \u201cnet income from other sources,\u201d \u201can economic factor adjustment,\u201d a \u201ccapital component,\u201d and a \u201ctechnology factor,\u201d as developed in the regulations. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-5.1. The \u201cdirect and indirect care costs\u201d are \u201callocated to the Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs) and ambulatory services to determine cost per visit for each hospital, and for each patient within the hospital.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-5.3. The Division\u2019s Director develops \u201cstandard reimbursement amounts\u201d for each DRG \u201cbased on the average cost per case for Medicaid recipients.\u201d The standards are adjusted according to different criteria for \u201csignificant differences\u201d in LMAs. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-5.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Thus, to account for differing costs in the calculation of rates for Medicaid patients, an adjustment to \u201cstandard costs\u201d is made for \u201ceconomic factors,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-5.13(a)(l), (b), including \u201cthe labor market differentials.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-5.14(a). Specifically, an \u201cequalization factor\u201d is used \u201cto calculate Statewide standard costs per case\u201d in order to determine the reimbursement rate. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-5.14(d)(l), (e). The \u201cequalization factor\u201d is defined as \u201cthe factor that is calculated based on defined Labor Market Areas and multiplied by hospital costs to permit comparability between differing regional salary costs in setting Statewide standard costs per case.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-1.1. To determine the \u201clabor equalization factor to calculate Statewide standard costs per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>case,\u201d an \u201cequalization factor\u201d is calculated \u201cto account for differing hospital pay scales,\u201d and \u201ceach hospital\u2019s equalization factor is determined as non-physician direct patient care costs ... at average pay scales for all New Jersey hospitals\u201d divided by LMA \u201cnon-physician direct patient care costs.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-5.14(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The labor reimbursement factor is more beneficial to hospitals in the \u201cNewark, Suburban\u201d LMA than in the \u201cNewton-Phillips-burg\u201d LMA, and appellants contend that as their costs are comparable with those in the former area, they have been wrongly placed in their own LMA<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Their appeal to us follows several unsuccessful challenges in the rule making process.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">As appellants recognize, our \u201cscope of judicial review of an administrative rule, regulation, or policy is generally limited to a determination whether that rule is arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or beyond the agency\u2019s delegated powers.\u201d <em>In re the Amendment of N.J.A.C. 8:31B-3.31, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>531, 543-44, 575 A.2d 481 (1990). Regulations are accorded a \u201cpresumption of reasonableness,\u201d and the party challenging them has the burden of overcoming the presumption. <em>Bergen Pines County Hosp. v. N.J. Dept. of Human Services, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>456, 477, 476 A.2d 784 (1984). <em>See also Medical Society of New Jersey v.

State Department of Health, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>297, 312, 639 A.2d 1129 (App.Div.1994) (\u201c[t]o overcome th[e] presumption, a party challenging a regulation must show that it is unreasonable\u201d). Moreover, administrative agencies have \u201cwide discretion in selecting the means to fulfill the duties that the Legislature delegated to them\u201d and \u201c[c]ourts normally defer to that choice so long as the selection is responsive to the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>and function of the agency.\u201d <em>Texter v. Department of Human Services, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>376, 383, 385-86, 443 A.2d 178 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Appellants have not met their burden. They contend that the Division acted arbitrarily and capriciously because it made no record justifying the decision to utilize the then-existing LMAs when adopting the new regulations, and did not adequately react to their objections. However \u201cffjacts sufficient to justify the regulation must be presumed. The burden is not upon the Commissioner to establish that the requisite facts exist. Rather, the burden is on the petitioners to establish that they do not.\u201d <em>Consolidation Coal Co. v. Kandle, </em>105 <em>N.J.Super. </em>104, 114, 251 A.2d 295 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., 54 N.J. </em>11, 252 A.2d 403 (1969). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">an administrative agency is not obligated to hold a hearing on proposed regulations before adopting them. The Administrative Procedures Act does provide for timely opportunity to submit data and argument (here provided), but does not require a formal public evidentiary hearing as part of the rule-making process____ Nor are findings, sufficient to justify the regulations, a required part of the same process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\"><em>[Heir v. Degnan, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>109, 119, 411 A.2d 194 (1980).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">In addition, there is no evidence in the record before us reflecting the impact on hospitals in other LMAs, and particularly the \u201cNewark, Suburban\u201d area, if appellants\u2019 contentions are accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">Appellants contend that the hospitals should have used the Medicare regional designations for Medicaid purposes. However, unlike the Medicare program, which is solely a federal program whose regions cross state lines, Medicaid is a plan voluntarily undertaken by the States which must comply with federal regulations in order to obtain federal funding to provide medical assistance for needy persons. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-1 <em>et seq. See also Monmouth Medical Center v. State of New Jersey, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 247-48, 385 A.2d 1244 (App.Div.1978), aff<em>'d, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>299, 403 A.2d 487 (1979). \u201cThe program is primarily administered by the State, subject to federal guidelines and constraints,\u201d and \u201c[ejach participating State is required to adopt a plan,\u201d subject to federal approval. <em>Id., </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 302-3, 403 A.2d 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Under New Jersey law, the Division is expressly authorized to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to maximize federal assistance and, among other things, to establish Medicaid reimbursement rates consistent with federal law, rules and regulations, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-7(b), and we can find no obligation on the part of the Division to utilize any component of the Medicare rate methodology with respect to the Medicaid program. Rather, the States must adopt regulations to establish State Medical Assistance (Medicaid) rates based on \u201creasonable and adequate\u201d costs for \u201cefficiently and economically operated facilities\u201d in conformity with applicable state and federal law and standards. 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Significantly, the regulations under attack essentially permit appellants to challenge the impact of their LMA designation as part of the rate adjudication process. The packages containing the emergency regulations and subsequent formal promulgation include a procedure for the \u201creview and appeal of rates.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-9.1. On this appeal, appellants have made no showing that they have actually sustained \u201ca marginal loss in providing inpatient services to Medicaid recipients\u201d at the existing rates, or that they have \u201ctaken all reasonable steps to contain or reduce the costs of providing inpatient hospital services,\u201d factors which might entitle them to relief in the adjudicatory process. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-9.1(b)(2). In any event, the regulations expressly permit the hospitals to make such a showing in an adjudicatory context in order to seek a rate increase, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-9.1(b)(2), and the impact of a particular hospital\u2019s LMA may be relevant to such a showing. Thus, the adjudicatory process is available if the rates become confiscatory or do not permit a fair rate of return. <em>Cf. State Farm v. State, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>32, 63, 590 A.2d 191 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">An administrative agency has broad discretion to exercise its statutory authority \u201ceither by adjudication or rulemaking,\u201d and enjoys \u201ca great deal of flexibility in selecting the proceedings most likely to achieve their regulatory aims.\u201d <em>State of New Jersey, Department of Environmental Protection v. Stavola, </em>103 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>N.J. </em>425, 436-37, 511 A.2d 622 (1986). <em>See also Monmouth Medical Center, supra, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 312, 639 A.2d 1129 (\u201can administrative agency ordinarily possesses extremely broad authority in determining whether to act through rule-making or adjudication\u201d).

Particularly, given the emergent nature of the situation affecting the rate system at the time the amended regulations were promulgated in response to the federal District Court decision, and the fact that issues addressed to the fairness of the specific reimbursement rates for each hospital can be addressed in the adjudicatory context, we cannot conclude that the Division acted arbitrarily or unlawfully in using the then-existing LMAs when promulgating the amended regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-10\"> Appellants are Hackettstown Community Hospital, Newton Memorial Hospital, Wallkill Valley Hospital and Warren Hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\"> There were various effective dates for the different provisions.
