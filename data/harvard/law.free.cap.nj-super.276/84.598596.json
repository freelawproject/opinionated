Notwithstanding the earlier decision of this court in <em>Wausau Ins. Cos. v. Fuentes, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 522 A.2d 440 (App.Div.1986), we hold that the legal malpractice recovery in question is subject to the workers\u2019 compensation lien of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">On March 4, 1987, Christopher Frazier was injured at work while employed by Autotron Electric, Inc. (\u201cAutotron\u201d). On July 11, 1987, Frazier\u2019s then attorney filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim on Frazier\u2019s behalf against New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company (\u201cNJM\u201d), the workers\u2019 compensation insurer of Autotron.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>In January 1992, Frazier, through new counsel, asserted a legal malpractice claim against his former attorney for failure to file suit against a general contractor, as an alleged third-party tortfea-sor, within the period of the statute of limitations. On June 3, 1992, NJM\u2019s attorney gave notice to Frazier\u2019s attorney in the malpractice action that NJM would assert a compensation lien against the'proceeds of any recovery. On September 5, 1992, Frazier settled the malpractice claim for $675,000, an amount less than the policy limit of the malpractice insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">On February 18, 1993, Frazier filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the Chancery Division, Middlesex County, asserting that NJM did not hold a valid workers\u2019 compensation lien against the proceeds of the malpractice settlement. NJM counterclaimed for judgment enforcing a workers\u2019 compensation lien against the malpractice settlement proceeds and seeking to assert the lien against future payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">NJM and Frazier each moved for summary judgment. Frazier also moved to amend his complaint to seek damages and an accounting, alleging that NJM breached a \u201cduty to review, compromise when appropriate, or otherwise manage the payment of medical bills charged directly to Plaintiff,\u201d and failed to \u201cproperly administer plaintiffs benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">On January 7,1994, after oral argument, the Chancery Division judge granted summary judgment in Frazier\u2019s favor on the lien issue, relying on this .court\u2019s opinion in <em>Wausau Ins. Cos. v. Fuentes, supra. </em>The judge also granted Frazier\u2019s motion to amend the complaint, noting that \u201cthe issues of what\u2019s raised by the proposed complaint [are not] ripe for a court to evaluate until they\u2019re put into issue.\u201d Frazier filed his amended complaint on January 21, 1994. We thereafter granted NJM\u2019s motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal of the Chancery Division order.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">On March 24, 1994, a Workers\u2019 Compensation judge entered a judgment declaring Frazier totally and permanently disabled. The judge also held that NJM \u201cis precluded from exerting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>statutory lien pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-40 against the settlement proceeds of the legal malpractice lawsuit previously pursued by petitioner.\u201d NJM paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Frazier that totalled $149,977.64 as of April 21, 1994. NJM also appealed from the workers\u2019 compensation judgment and we granted NJM\u2019s motion to consolidate the two appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">Where a third person is liable to the employee or his dependents for an injury or death, the existence of a right of compensation from the employer or insurance carrier under this statute shall not operate as a bar to the action of the employee or his dependents, nor be regarded as establishing a measure of damage therein. <em>In the event that the employee or his dependents shall recover and be paid from the said third person or his insurance carrier, any sum in release or in judgment on account of his or its liability to the injured, employee or his dependents, the liability of the employer under this statute shall be only such as is hereinafter in this section provided.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">(a) The obligation of the employer or his insurance carrier under this statute to make compensation payments shall continue until the payment, if any, by such third person or his insurance carrier is made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">(b) If the sum recovered by the employee or his dependents from the third person or his insurance carrier is equivalent to or greater than the liability of the employer or his insurance carrier under this statute, the employer or his insurance carrier shall be released from such liability and shall bo entitled to be reimbursed, as hereinafter provided, for the medical expenses incurred and compensation payments theretofore paid to the injured employee or his dependents less employee\u2019s expenses of suit and attorney\u2019s fees as hereinafter defined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">[Id (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">Since our decision in <em>Wausau Ins. Cos. v. Fuentes, </em>our Supreme Court has held that the Legislature\u2019s intent in adopting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40 was that a workers\u2019 compensation lien should attach against an employee\u2019s recovery when the recovery is predicated or premised on the tortious conduct of a third-party. <em>Midland Ins. Co. v. Colatrella, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>612, 617, 510 A.2d 30 (1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Midland, </em>the workers\u2019 compensation provider was granted a lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>against settlement proceeds from the employee\u2019s uninsured motorist insurance policy. The employee had argued that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40 only applies to recoveries obtained directly from a third-party tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In holding that a compensation lien attaches against the proceeds from an uninsured motorist policy, the <em>Midland </em>court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">[i]n effect, an uninsured motorist provision is a contractual substitute for a tort action against an uninsured motorist. By comparison, the acts of the third-party tortfeasor produce the recovery to which the compensation lien attaches. Thus, the tortious act of a third-party is the predicate for both recovery of uninsured motorist proceeds and the assertion of a workers\u2019 compensation lien. Because recovery under uninsured motorist insurance is premised on the tortious conduct of another, the proceeds of that recovery, like the proceeds of an injured employee\u2019s third-party action, should be subject to a compensation lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\"><em>[Midland, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 617, 510 A.2d 30 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">This holding was in accord with the reasoning of our earlier decision in <em>Montedoro v. City of Asbury Park, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>305, 416 A.2d 433 (App.Div.1980). We concluded in <em>Montedoro </em>that proceeds from the employer\u2019s uninsured motorist policy are subject to a workers\u2019 compensation lien. We focused on the predicate of the recovery, the negligence of the third-party tortfeasor, and held that the essence of a recovery under an uninsured motorist policy \u201cis as compensation for the uninsured driver\u2019s common law liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308, 416 A.2d 433. We also noted that \u201c[t]he insured\u2019s legal entitlement to damages for the uninsured driver\u2019s negligence imports into the ,UM policy all of the normal rules governing tort liability and damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308-09, 416 A.2d 433 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">The <em>Midland </em>court addressed the statutory construction issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">Arguably, as the <em>Montedoro </em>court found, the term \u2018third person\u2019 in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40 could be construed to include an uninsured motorist. Nonetheless, the statute does not define \u2018third person\u2019 to include an uninsured motorist or its carrier. Consequently, we base our decision on the belief that the primary concern of the Legislature here, as in other work-related injuries caused by third-party tortfeasors, is to integrate the sources of recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\"><em>[Midland, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 618, 510 A.2d 30 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The Supreme Court reserved judgment on the question of whether a compensation lien attaches if the uninsured motorist coverage is less than the full amount of the employee\u2019s damages. <em>Id. </em>at 615-16, 510 A.2d 30; <em>see Charnecky v. American Reliance Ins. Co., </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>91, 592 A.2d 17 (App.Div.1991), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>188, 603 A.2d 512 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Appellant urges that our 1986 holding in <em>Wausau Ins. Cos. v. Fuentes, supra, </em>that a workers\u2019 compensation lien does not attach against legal malpractice proceeds related to third-party claims has been undermined by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Midland. </em>In <em>Wausau, </em>we reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">[applying the rule that statutes in derogation of common law must be strictly construed, we hold that plaintiffs right of recovery goes no further than to payments actually made by the \u2018third person\u2019 whose tortious conduct contributed to the happening of the industrial accident. The lawyer whose delinquency deprived the employee of a possible recovery from the machine manufacturer does not take on the identity of the statutory \u2018third person.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\"><em>[Wausau Ins. Cos. v. Fuentes, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 478, 522 A.2d 440 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">However, in <em>Midland, </em>the Supreme Court rejected such a narrow interpretation of \u2018third party,\u2019 and focused on the nature of the underlying act that produces the ultimate recovery. <em>Midland, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 617, 510 A.2d 30. Unquestionably, the <em>Midland </em>court\u2019s interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40, when applied to an employee\u2019s recovery on a legal malpractice claim against an attorney for failure to prosecute a negligence claim against a third-party tortfeasor, compels a result contrary to our holding in <em>Wausau Ins. Cos. v. Fuentes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">In <em>Montedoro, </em>we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">[t]he fundamental policy expressed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40 is to limit an injured employee to that which the common law entitles him as long as that amount is greater than workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the same injury; it assumes such recovery to represent the most to which he is entitled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-12\"><em>[Montedoro, supra, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 310, 416 A.2d 433.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">There appears to us no reason why an injured employee who receives an award for injuries pursuant to a legal malpractice action should be placed in a better position than an injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>employee who recovers directly from the tortfeasor. Similarly, in <em>Montedoro </em>we observed that an employee should not be in a better position if he or she recovers under an uninsured motorist policy, rather than from an insured third-party tortfeasor. <em>Id. </em>at 308, 416 A.2d 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In 1987, when the Legislature enacted <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-97, the collateral source rule, it specifically protected the funds necessary to satisfy the lien of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40 by excepting workers\u2019 compensation benefits from those benefits received from other sources that must be disclosed and offset, as a duplicate benefit, from any award recovered by a plaintiff in a personal injury action. If repayment is not made to the workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, this exclusion for workers\u2019 compensation benefits would result in a recovery to the plaintiff that would contravene the clear legislative policy against duplication of awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Frazier also argues that since NJM failed to pursue its own action against the third-party tortfeasor, as permitted under <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-40(f), NJM should not be allowed to assert a lien against the malpractice proceeds. We find no foundation for the premise that the employer or its insurer is obligated to timely pursue an action under 34:15 \u2014 40(f) or lose its lien. Rather, the existence of such a right under the statute merely underscores the harm suffered by the workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier as a result of the same attorney\u2019s malpractice in failing to take the required legal action on behalf of the injured worker. We are offered no sound reason for this court to create a bar to obtaining a compensation lien based on the insurance carrier\u2019s failure to pursue an action under 34:15-40(f). We conclude that because the legal malpractice settlement was predicated on the liability of a third-party tortfeasor, NJM\u2019s lien must attach to its proceeds. <em>See Midland, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 617, 510 A.2d 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">We have mentioned that the Chancery order also granted Frazier\u2019s motion to amend his complaint to allege the breach of certain obligations by NJM to Frazier and his employer. \u201c[Ljeave to amend a pleading before trial \u2018should be freely given in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>interest of justice\u2019 without considering the merits of the amendment.\u201d <em>City Check Cashing v. Nat\u2019l State Bank, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 308, 582 A.2d 809 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>R. </em>4:9-1), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>389, 585 A.2d 391 (1990). We do not disturb this portion of the order as we are confident that on remand the Chancery judge will consider the merits of the amendments, if any, at the appropriate time.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We reverse those portions of the orders and judgments of the Chancery Division and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division that failed to honor the lien of the workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. In all other respects the orders and judgments are affirmed. We remand to the respective tribunals for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-12\"> Our opinion in <em>Wausau Ins. Cos. v. Fuentes, </em>is dated June 13, 1986, two days after the June 11, 1986 decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Midland Ins. Co. v. Colatrella. </em>It is apparent, however, that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion was not available to this court or counsel before the handing down of the <em>Wausau Ins. Cos. v.
