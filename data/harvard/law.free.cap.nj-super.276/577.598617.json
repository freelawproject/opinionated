Rather, it argues that Rate Counsel is not entitled to assess legal fees and expenses against it under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19a because its March 1991 petition \u201csought <em>no change in services </em>whatsoever, and was expressly limited to approval of its proposed rate <em>reduction.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">The Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders created the BCUA on March 23, 1978, to provide Bergen County certain water, sewer, and solid waste services. The BCUA has provided solid waste services and facilities since January 2, 1981. Its operations are subject to the New Jersey Solid Waste Manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ment Act <em>(N.J.S.A </em>13:1E-1 to -207) and certain solid waste management plans adopted for the county\u2019s district.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">On February 11,1991, the BCUA filed (as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:13A-6 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:13A-6.2) an application with the Board of Public Utilities (the BPU) for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate a solid waste transfer station in North Arlington, New Jersey.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the same time, the BCUA also filed its initial tariff or solid waste rate structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Thereafter, on May 7, 1991, an Assistant Deputy Public Advocate sent a letter to the BPU with a copy to the BCUA, to inform it that Rate Counsel planned to participate fully in the proceedings regarding the BCUA\u2019s application for a certificate of public convenience and permanent rate structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The BPU granted the BCUA\u2019s request for a certificate on August 16, 1991, and accepted its initial tariff or rate structure on an interim basis, subject to refund based upon further review. On December 24, 1991, the Director of Rate Counsel wrote the Executive Director of the BCUA concerning the same matter and requested him to add another Rate. Counsel attorney to the service list.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">According to the BCUA, the rate structure accepted by the BPU had been promulgated in January 1990 in accordance with the then applicable rate-setting protocol established by the Municipal and County Utilities Authorities Law, particularly <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:14B-23. The \u201cinterim\u201d rate structure accepted had already been in effect for nearly nineteen months and remained in effect until May 15, 1993, according to the BCUA. The BCUA points out that during that period \u201cno taxpayer, system user or governmental agency\u201d challenged or contested the reasonableness of its rate structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>On March 10, 1993, the BCUA petitioned the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy (DEPE) under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:13A-6.2b,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to decrease its solid waste service rate for municipal waste from $124 to $122 per ton. The BCUA asserts that, at the time, \u201c[n]o change in services were contemplated.\u201d As of that time, according to Rate Counsel, neither the BPU nor DEPE had granted final approval of the BCUA\u2019s initial rate structure or services.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">According to the BCUA, Rate Counsel moved, without objection, on March 29, 1993 to intervene (as of right) in the proceedings relating to BCUA\u2019s initial rate scheme and subsequent modification thereto. Rate Counsel states, however, that it \u201cintervened on behalf of the public interest in all the proceedings subsequent to the BCUA\u2019s February 11, 1991, application.\u201d On May 4, 1993, Rate Counsel again notified the BCUA that it intended to participate in the application and petition process \u201cinsofar as changes in rates and/or services of the [BCUA] are at issue.\u201d Rate Counsel also advised the BCUA that it would be sending bills for its expenses pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19a.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">On May 14,1993, the DEPE ordered the Office of Legal Affairs to transmit the BCUA\u2019s application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, and petition for a decrease in rates, to the Office of Administrative Law (the OAL) for consolidation and a full hearing, as a contested case, on the setting of final rates and tariff design.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The DEPE also ordered the BCUA to submit by December 1, 1993, a copy of its 1994 solid waste budget and petition for solid waste disposal rates for solid waste generated in Bergen County to be effective March 1,1994. In addition, the DEPE temporarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>adjusted the BCUA\u2019s initial rates and tariff design for solid waste disposal for the period between May 14, 1993 and February 28, 1994; and directed the OAL to address a $31 million accounting adjustment, which the BCUA had made of unappropriated retained earnings, relating to accounting for municipal solid waste landfill closure/post closure care costs. This entire matter is apparently still pending before the OAL.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">On June 3, 1993, the BCUA\u2019s attorney wrote the Director of Rate Counsel, disputing Rate Counsel\u2019s authority to assess legal expenses under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19a against the BCUA. The BCUA took the position that because the proceedings presented \u201cneither an <em>increase </em>in the rate, toll or fare, or charge of the BCUA, or discontinuance or change of any required service,\u201d the statute was not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">On September 14, 1993, Rate Counsel issued a \u201cFinal Agency Determination\u201d assessing legal fees and expenses (totaling $17,-516.75) against the BCUA for its representation of the public interest, from March to June 1993, in the rate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">After the BCUA filed its notice of appeal challenging the final determination assessing costs against it, Rate Counsel issued bills on December 14, 1993 (totaling $4,720 for legal services provided in June, July, and August 1993) and on January 28, 1994 (totaling $12,240.50 for legal services between August and November 1993), respectively.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The total amount assessed against the BCUA was $34,477.25. This amount does not exceed the maximum statutory assessment allowed ($72,699) pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19a.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The Department of the Public Advocate Act of 1974, (the Act) <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-1 to -47, established the Department of the Public Advocate. The enabling legislation gave the Public Advo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>cate broad authority and discretion in determining whether to represent or refrain from representing the public interest in any proceeding. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-17, -18, -29, -31.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Rate Counsel was charged with representing and protecting \u201cthe public interest ... in proceedings before and appeals from any State ... agency ... charged with regulation or control of any business, industry or utility regarding a requirement that the business, industry or utility provide a service or regarding the fixing of a rate, toll, fare or charge for a product or service.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The Act \u201cprovides for the payment of the fees and expenses incurred by Rate Counsel for such representation.\u201d <em>State Farm, Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. State, Dept. of Public Advocate, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>99, 117, 545 A.2d 823 (App.Div.1988), <em>aff'd, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>336, 571 A.2d 957 (1990). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19a states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">Whenever the Division of Rate Counsel represents the public interest in a proceeding initiated by application of a business, industry or utility ... for authority to increase the rate, toll, fare or charge charged by it for any product or service or in a <em>proceeding initiated by application of a business, industry or utility to discontinue or change any required service, </em>the Director of the Division of Rate Counsel may, except as otherwise provided herein, assess the business, industry or utility____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">[emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Case law interpreting and applying the quoted section is sparce. Both sides rely upon an unpublished opinion<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of this court. That opinion is not precedential and we do not discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">The legislative history is also scant. The Senate Statement to S. 1533, the statute\u2019s 1981 amendment, merely restates the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>tory language. A conditional veto message from the Governor stated that the \u201cexpressed purpose of [the amendment] was to allow the Division of Rate Counsel in the Public Advocate to assess utilities ... for each rate change application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Hence, resort may be had to rules of statutory construction. We must consider not only the particular statute in question but also the entire legislative scheme of which it is a part. <em>Kimmelman v. Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>123, 129, 527 A.2d 1368 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">A reading of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:27E-19a in conjunction with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-18 might well lead us to conclude that Rate Counsel\u2019s right to reimbursement should be co-extensive with the right to intervene. However, in <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. State, Dept. of Public Advocate, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>336, 571 A.2d 957 (1990), our Supreme Court said in interpreting <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:27E-19b dealing with insurance rates: \u201cObviously, this authority under <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:27E-18 is not co-extensive with the Public Advocate\u2019s right to be reimbursed under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19b (because not every proceeding is initiated by an insurer to change charges).\u201d <em>State Farm, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 355, 571 A.2d 957. Although <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19b differs from <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:27E-19a, <em>State Farm </em>arguably forecloses a conclusion that the right to intervene under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-18 is co-extensive with the right to be reimbursed under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19a. The language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19b is similar to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19a, but not identical. In fact, the second phrase contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19a dealing with \u201can application to \u2018change any required service\u2019 has no similar counterpart in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19(b).\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>State Farm, supra, </em>that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-18 is not co-extensive with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19b does not resolve the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We are satisfied that the BCUA should reimburse Rate Counsel for its participation and involvement in the interim rate-setting proceedings because it can fairly be said here that the proposed rate schedule, irrespective of whether the rates are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>supposed to be increased or decreased, results in \u201ca proceeding initiated by application of a business, industry or utility to ... change any required service____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27E-19a.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Notwithstanding the fact that the BCUA\u2019s application to the BPU for its transfer station was not technically for an \u201cincrease\u201d in its rates, nor a \u201cchange\u201d of any required services, we conclude that as a \u201cpublic utility\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:13A-6.2, its initial application was subject to scrutiny by Rate Counsel. Here, the BCUA was changing from disposing of solid waste at various landfills to a transfer station methodology. As such, it was a \u201cchange in required services\u201d that Rate Counsel was properly allowed to examine in connection with its intervention to test the validity of the BCUA\u2019s operating expenses and charges which were the basis of the proposed tariffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">We reject the BCUA\u2019s argument that absent a proposed rate increase or discontinuation or change in a required service Rate Counsel lacked authority to assess legal fees and expenses against it as a public utility for Rate Counsel\u2019s participation in the rate-setting proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The proper disposal of solid waste is a matter of public concern and the efficient disposal of solid waste at reasonable rates is a governmental function thoroughly imbued with the public interest. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-136.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-13\"> Although the Office of the Public Advocate was abolished by the Public Advocate Restructuring Act of 1994, L.1994, <em>c. </em>58, effective June 29, 1994, the Division of Ratepayer Advocate was established within the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 001-1994 (dated May 5, 1994), effective on July 4, 1994.
