Plaintiff Candy Rendine recovered a compensatory and punitive damage judgment of $460,-000; plaintiff Bernadette Lorestani recovered compensatory and punitive awards of $475,000. Both plaintiffs also recovered prejudgment interest, counsel fees, and costs, in addition to their compensatory and punitive damage awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">On this appeal, the defendant employer makes these claims of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">1. The plaintiffs\u2019 claims should have been tried separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">2. The jury instructions on the issues of discrimination and burden of proof were incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">3. The punitive and emotional distress damage awards were not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">4. The reasonable attorneys fee lodestar sum should not have been doubled to compensate for the contingency of success or failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">On the cross-appeal, plaintiffs contend that the trial judge improperly dismissed Rendine\u2019s breach of contract claim and Lorestani\u2019s wage discrimination claim. We find no merit on either the appeal or the cross-appeal and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Plaintiff Rendine earned a degree in accounting in 1979 and then worked as an auditor and financial analyst with a bank for four years. In 1983 she accepted a position with defendant as assistant controller. Defendant Edward Pantzer was the president and owner of the company and Michael Pantzer (Michael), his brother, was the executive vice-president. In 1985 they hired Steve Weinerman as controller; he was Rendine\u2019s immediate superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">When defendant first interviewed Rendine, he asked her if she had plans to marry and have children \u201cwithin five years of being married.\u201d Rendine answered that she \u201choped to be married,\u201d but had no plans for children. As assistant controller of residential properties, Rendine supervised \u201ca staff of accountants for accounts receivable, accounts payable, security refund ... [and] payroll.\u201d There were about twenty employees at the central office in Tenafly, plus others who worked at the various properties. Ren-dine was a member of the executive committee, which met weekly and made \u201call the major decisions of the company.\u201d The other members of the committee were the defendant Edward Pantzer, Michael Pantzer, Weinerman, who was Michael\u2019s assistant, and Bill Bodger, head of acquisitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">When Rendine began work, her first assignment was to revamp a six-month old computer system, verifying information about thousands of tenants at numerous properties. She spent some three months visiting the properties in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware, collecting the information, and then entering it into the computer. She worked every evening until six or seven and sometimes until nine. Rendine also prepared a manual explaining the procedure for entering information into the computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">In 1984, after Rendine announced her engagement to marry, she said that defendant called her into his office and asked her to polish some silver for him. \u201c[H]e said that since I was getting married and probably going to have silver once I was married, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>that it would be good practice for me to polish his silver.\u201d Rendine politely declined. Defendant denied that this occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">With her November annual performance reviews, Rendine received a fourteen-percent salary increase in 1984, fourteen percent in 1985, and eleven percent in 1986. She also received Christmas bonuses for these years of $2500, $1500, and $2500. In January 1986 Michael wrote Rendine a letter, thanking her for doing a good job. Suzanne Rivera, one of the employees whom Rendine supervised, corroborated her competence and ability, and her patience and fairness in dealing with those who worked under her.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Lorestani was hired as a staff accountant to assist Rendine in June 1984. She had five years\u2019 experience in bookkeeping or accounting and she earned an accounting degree in 1985. In her job interview, defendant asked her whether she was married, and she said she was engaged. He also asked if she planned to have children. She answered that she \u201cwasn\u2019t really thinking at that point about children.\u201d Rivera, who was hired in June 1987, was also asked in her job interview about plans to have children.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Lorestani monitored the apartments occupied by defendant\u2019s employees, met with Michael each month to review them, and assisted Rendine with the preparation of financial reports. Ren-dine, who trained Lorestani, thought she was \u201ca very good em-ployee____ She executed all her functions well.\u201d Rivera corroborated Lorestani\u2019s competence and excellent job performance. Weinerman was also very happy with Lorestani\u2019s job performance. Five months after she was hired, Lorestani, whose starting salary was $19,000 a year, received an eleven-percent increment. The following year, 1986, she again received an eleven-percent increment, and in 1987 she received a twelve-percent increment. She also received Christmas bonuses in the amounts of $500 in 1984, and $1000 in 1985 and 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Lorestani\u2019s responsibilities increased during the time she worked for defendant. She assumed responsibility for dealing with the managers in the field and took over the cash reconciliations and money-market account activity on about twenty proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>ties. She worked long hours, arriving early in the morning, frequently staying until 7 p.m., and also working on weekends when needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Plaintiffs were \u201cinundated\u201d with work, including new properties, and Rendine decided that a bookkeeper should be hired. After consultations with Weinerman and defendant, the bookkeeper position was created. Pam Gaetano was hired in 1987; she worked under Lorestani, who trained her. Rendine evaluated Gaetano, and found her to be \u201can okay employee.\u201d With no math or accounting background, Gaetano \u201ccontinually had problems understanding ... a bank reconciliation, doing anything that really had to do with math.\u201d Although both Rendine and Loresta-ni \u201ckept on trying to train her extensively,\u201d Rendine felt that Gaetano was unable \u201cto take on staff accountant responsibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Another staff accountant, Dominic Battista, was hired in 1985 or 1986 but he left after about a year. When Lorestani began working with defendant, she was assigned to clean the kitchen. However, when Battista was hired, she \u201cnoticed that he did not have kitchen duty. So, I talked to Mr. Michael Pantzer and I asked why that was, and he took me off of the kitchen duty instead of putting Dominic on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Before Battista was hired, Weinerman told Rendine that \u201che wanted to hire a male for that position, that they really would not consider a female at that time.\u201d He told her that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">[I]t would be in the best interests of the company to look for a male because Bernadette and I had recently been married and we were of child bearing age and our, what do they call it, our biological clock was ticking to have children, our time was running out because we were getting older.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">The issue of the gender of the new accountant was discussed at an executive committee meeting, where everyone except Rendine agreed with Weinerman\u2019s theory. Weinerman denied making this comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Rendine was married in December 1984 and purchased a home with a substantial mortgage in October 1985. Her husband\u2019s salary was about the same as hers. Both salaries were needed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>carry the home. Lorestani was married in May 1985, and purchased a home, with a mortgage, in November 1985. Both Lorestani and her husband had substantial student loans to repay and were supporting her husband\u2019s younger sister. Lorestani and her husband were both earning the same salary; both incomes were needed for their support.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In late December 1986 or early January 1987 Lorestani told Michael Pantzer that she was pregnant. She told him that she planned to return to work, and that her sister would take care of her child. \u201cHe was very happy for me. He congratulated me.\u201d When asked when she would return, Lorestani answered in four or five weeks with a regular delivery, or six to eight weeks if she needed a Caesarean. Lorestani discussed her maternity leave many times with defendant, his brother, Michael, and Weinerman. She repeatedly told each that she planned to return to work when she was physically able. They each assured her that her job would be available on return. Rendine also announced her pregnancy in January 1987 and defendant, Michael and Weinerman all \u201cappeared to be happy for me.\u201d She advised them from the outset that she planned to take at least three months\u2019 maternity leave, and then return to work. On several occasions, she was assured that \u201cyour job will be waiting for you.\u201d Rendine testified about an executive committee meeting while she was pregnant, at which her colleagues said that she looked like a \u201cbeached salmon.\u201d However, defendant and Michael denied that they or anyone else made any jokes or comments about pregnancy in general or about Rendine in particular. Defendant said that he would not tolerate any such remarks, or discrimination in his company.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Dean Delianites, a CPA as of 1985, with four years\u2019 experience in public accounting, was hired as commercial accounting manager in November 1986. Rendine saw him leave work early, at 4 p.m. every day, to attend law school. Rivera corroborated that Delian-ites left work early, adding that Delianites told the staff that he would make up the time \u201cby working through his lunch hour,\u201d but Rivera saw him studying law while eating at his desk.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Rendine\u2019s duties were divided between Delianites and Weiner-man while she was on maternity leave. She had attempted to train Delianites but he was \u201ctoo busy\u201d and uninterested. Rendine worked with residential buildings, an area in which Delianites had no experience or training. Lorestani and Rendine trained Gaeta-no to take over Lorestani\u2019s duties but Gaetano had difficulty learning the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Lorestani started her maternity leave on June 15, 1987, on the advice of her doctor. This was two weeks earlier than planned because she developed toxemia. On her last day of work, she talked to defendant \u201cand he wished me luck, he said he hoped everything worked out fine and he gave me a hug and he told me my job would be waiting for me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Lorestani delivered by Caesarean on July 13, 1987. Her husband called her office that day, and she called a few days later. Weinerman congratulated her and told her to take as much time off as she needed and said her job would be waiting. Michael also congratulated her, told her that a return to work in six to eight weeks would not be a problem, and also said her job was waiting for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Weinerman called her at home the day she was discharged from the hospital, and asked her for a date of return. She told him it would be six to eight weeks, and \u201c[h]e said fine and when I was ready, my job was there for me.\u201d Lorestani talked to someone in the office at least once a week during her maternity leave. Weinerman always asked her when she would return, and she always told him six to eight weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">In August, when eight weeks passed, Lorestani arranged an appointment with. Weinerman to discuss her return. She had made her child-care arrangements, was excited about returning, and brought her baby with her for the appointment with Weiner-man. Weinerman \u201ctold me that things were running very smoothly and that there was no longer a place for me and he was firing me.\u201d Weinerman denied terminating Lorestani on this particular day; rather, when she called in early September to say she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ready to return, he told her on the telephone that he had no job for her. However, Rivera saw Lorestani that day at the office, arriving happy and showing off her new baby. When she left Weinerman\u2019s office, she approached Rivera; she was upset and crying, and \u201cshe told me she had just been fired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Meanwhile, Rendine\u2019s last day of work was July 24, 1987, and she gave birth early, on July 26. About a week later, Weinerman called and told her that they were promoting Gaetano from bookkeeper to staff accountant. In August 1987 Rendine received a memo from Michael, dated August 19, to all defendant\u2019s personnel, advising that as of August 12 Delianites was promoted to the position of assistant controller, and Gaetano was promoted to the position of staff accountant. The memo also announced that Rendine had given birth to a baby girl, and Lorestani to a baby boy. \u201cAs soon as their maternity leaves are over, we enthusiastically welcome the return of both Candy and Bernadette to the accounting department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Rendine was shocked. In her conversation with Weinerman a week before, he had not mentioned Delianites\u2019s promotion. She felt that her position with the company was endangered, since there was no need for two assistant controllers. \u201cI was being replaced and I had only been out of work for three weeks.\u201d She immediately called Weinerman, who \u201csaid that they felt the need to promote these two people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">About a week later Rendine called the office \u201cjust to see how everything was going, if anybody needed me.\u201d She discovered that \u201cDean had taken over my desk,\u201d including \u201caccess to all my personal belongings.\u201d She then called Michael, who was \u201cvery cold.\u201d She was upset because she had always had a fine relationship with Michael, who attended her wedding with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">In October 1987 Rendine met with Michael and Weinerman to discuss her return; she was given a memo entitled \u201cCandy\u2019s Responsibilities.\u201d She was told that she would retain her title but would no longer have the responsibilities and authority she had before. Her new job was to work on special projects. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>she had already worked on the special projects listed, and they required very little time. Rendine\u2019s new job duties were \u201cpractically nothing\u201d compared to \u201cthe responsibilities I had before I went on maternity leave\u201d and would have taken her about three days a month to complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Rendine returned to work on November 11, 1987, after an absence of thirteen or fourteen weeks. Her desk was \u201cisolated from the other employees.\u201d It was \u201cright next to the men\u2019s bathroom,\u201d noisy and filthy dirty. She spent the first day cleaning it. There were no office supplies and no access to the computer. Her \u201cpersonal belongings were scattered all over the office.\u201d No work was assigned to her the first day.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Defendant, who had expressed appreciation for her work just a month before she left, was now very cold toward her, \u201cand I felt like a stranger.\u201d Michael, with whom she had worked closely and had a \u201cwonderful working relationship,\u201d was also cold. Weiner-man, with whom she had had \u201ca friendly, amicable working relationship,\u201d was now \u201cvery short,\u201d talking to her only when necessary. The people in the office whom Rendine had supervised, and whose questions she spent most of her day answering, \u201cwouldn\u2019t even talk to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Rivera corroborated Rendine\u2019s account of her return to work. According to Rivera, Rendine had more knowledge about the residential accounting functions, but Weinerman and Delianites told the staff that Delianites would be handling their questions. Delianites admitted that in November 1987, when Rendine returned from maternity leave, he was still learning her job. Nevertheless, Weinerman reprimanded Rivera and two others for taking their questions to Rendine rather than Delianites.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">According to Weinerman, Delianites complained about Ren-dine\u2019s socializing and her job performance. Once, Rendine went onto the computer without checking first, \u201cand it caused a minor problem.\u201d On another occasion, when Delianites asked her to correct some journal entries that she had worked on, \u201cshe told him she was too busy.\u201d Rendine explained that routine office proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>dure, to return journal entries to the person who wrote them, to review for accuracy, had not been followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Early the following week, Weinerman called Rendine into his office. He told her that he had complaints about her, that she had a bad attitude, and that she had better change. He told her that \u201cthings ran smoothly when I wasn\u2019t there\u201d and that \u201cpeople were complaining that I was socializing.\u201d He talked for five minutes, refusing to listen to anything Rendine had to say. Rendine became angry, because \u201cpeople had a bad attitude toward me.\u201d Weinerman \u201ckept on yelling.\u201d Rendine said \u201cI can\u2019t take this any more,\u201d and \u201cthis is not fair.\u201d She got up and walked out. Weinerman \u201ctold me that if I left, that would be it.\u201d When Rendine asked, \u201cdoes this mean you\u2019re firing me?\u201d Weinerman answered \u201cyes,\u201d and discharged her.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Weinerman basically corroborated Rendine\u2019s account of their verbal encounter, and asserted that he terminated her because she was insubordinate. Defendant, Michael and Weinerman denied any prior discussion, plans or intent to terminate Rendine. Wein-erman and Michael denied that their attitude toward Rendine was cold when she returned from her leave, and denied telling staff not to speak with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Defendant, Michael and Weinerman all considered Rendine a valuable employee. However, they said she lacked supervisory experience; her interpersonal skills were mediocre; she had difficulty dealing with people; she was unnecessarily \u201cdemanding and short with her people,\u201d and had conflicts with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">According to Weinerman, when Delianites took over Rendine\u2019s job, the situation in the office improved. Delianites was capable of handling Rendine\u2019s responsibilities and did so effectively. \u201cPeople started working more closely together without problems____ [A] very good working rapport developed in the office. Everybody' respected Dean\u2019.\u2019 Delianites.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">However, on cross-examination Weinerman admitted that in his last evaluation of Rendine, in 1986, he rated her above average in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>effectiveness in dealing with others, and in all of the other specific review factors. In contrast, Delianites was not rated any higher than Rendine, and was rated lower than her in leadership. Rivera, who worked under Delianites for four months, thought that \u201che did not have enough knowledge to run the department well,\u201d and she \u201chad to train him\u201d in her field, security deposit refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Weinerman admitted that he agreed to keep Rendine\u2019s job open for her, but never \u201cdiscussed a time frame,\u201d and never promised her that her responsibilities would be the same. According to Weinerman, Rendine told him that she was having difficulty finding child care.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Defendant and Michael Pantzer said that the company had a maternity leave policy providing twenty-eight days with pay. The policy was \u201cflexible enough\u201d to allow for a longer leave, but it would be without pay. A maternity leave \u201cwould never be open-ended.\u201d The employee must advise the company of the date of her return. Defendant was \u201ccertain that either Michael Pantzer and Steve Weinerman and or myself made it clear to Candy that she was going to get a paid four weeks maternity leave and we expected her to be back at the end of that.\u201d Rendine denied that she was ever told about this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">According to Weinerman, if both Rendine and Lorestani had returned to work within thirty days, they would have been given their prior jobs. However, Weinerman did not intend to demote Delianites and Gaetano. Weinerman explained that since defendant acquired four commercial properties in 1987 and wanted \u201cto bring all of our accounting and management in-house,\u201d he determined to create a second assistant controller position, with one assistant responsible for commercial and the other for residential. Rendine and Delianites would be the two assistants. However, Weinerman admitted that he never told Rendine about this plan; he only told her that she would be working on \u201cspecial projects.\u201d Weinerman originally testified that his plan was never implemented because Rendine was terminated. On cross-examination, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>said that he abandoned this plan before his meeting with her in October.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Weinerman admitted that he had supervised Delianites elsewhere before coming to work for defendant, that they had stayed in touch, that he brought Delianites into the company, and wanted a chance to promote him. He also admitted that he kept Delian-ites\u2019s promotion a secret from Rendine, that Delianites and Gaeta-no were the only two people who worked for defendant who were promoted before their annual performance reviews, and that Ren-dine\u2019s job functions were so small when she returned from leave that \u201cit was not a hardship\u201d for the company to discharge her.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">As to Lorestani, Weinerman admitted promising her that her job would be kept open but never mentioned any particular period of time, and never promised that it would be kept open indefinitely. Weinerman complained that Lorestani would not give a definite date for her return to work, since she was \u201cstill working on\u201d child care.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Weinerman explained that Gaetano was doing both Lorestani\u2019s accounting job and her own bookkeeping job, so that there was no need for Lorestani to return. However, he admitted that he hired a new bookkeeper, Lynn Rochford, just days after he discharged Lorestani. Weinerman rated Lorestani higher than Gaetano in their performance reviews, explaining that this was only because Lorestani had more experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">However, Rivera, who helped train Gaetano, found that she had difficulty with simple bookkeeping and accounting concepts. Gae-tano \u201cconstantly needed assistance ... to do her job.\u201d Gaetano had difficulty dealing with the property managers, and Rivera frequently took their calls and corrected Gaetano\u2019s mistakes. Rochford also criticized Gaetano\u2019s job performance. Weinerman nevertheless concluded that Gaetano \u201cwas as good or better as the staff accountant\u201d than Lorestani.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Defendant claimed Rendine was an insubordinate and unsuitable employee. Defendant claimed that Lorestani was not reinstat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ed because her services were not needed, failed to inform defendant of the time of her planned return, delayed coming back to work, and the operation ran more smoothly without her because of \u201cbad relations with her coworkers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The defense contended, through defendant Edward Pantzer and Weinerman, that its unwritten policy fixed the length of paid maternity leave at four weeks (plus sick and vacation days) but that it did not limit the allowable length of unpaid leave. In contrast, defendant gave no paid leave for disability beyond sick and vacation days. Weinerman testified that exceptions for unpaid maternity leave were \u201cinvariably granted,\u201d if an employee provided defendant with a return date and kept him advised of developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Defendant produced as witnesses four of his resident managers and three of his leasing agents who took maternity leaves of absence and successfully returned to their positions with defendant. Although three took their maternity leaves after defendant was served with the summons and complaint in July 1989, the other four took their leaves earlier. All seven of these women took no more than six weeks leave, consisting of thirty days with pay plus accrued vacation or personal leave, and all seven worked at the sites of defendant\u2019s properties; none worked in the central office. Jeanette Croce, an assistant controller, who did not work in the central office, was allowed to take a maternity leave of eleven weeks in 1991, which included five weeks of unpaid leave. In contrast, plaintiffs\u2019 witness, Rivera, took a five-month maternity leave in 1988. Upon her return she found she had much less responsibility than before, and she resigned after two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Defendant also admitted that he terminated his personal secretary, Kathy Rega, in part because she was unable to work after 5 p.m. Defendant explained that Rega could not work later because she had a part-time job in the evenings. However, at a prior deposition, defendant testified that Rega was unable to work after 5 p.m. because of her family obligations. Defendant\u2019s current personal secretary, Mary Beth Chvisuk, had one child when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>hired her, and discovered she was pregnant some sixty days later. Nevertheless, he wanted her to return to work after a maternity leave. On cross-examination, he admitted that this occurred after he was served with the summons and complaint in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The defendant company had four employees in the past few years who were injured or ill; defendant held their jobs open for them, one as long as six months, and did not require them to specify their dates of return. Michael admitted that the difference between defendant\u2019s policies for maternity leave and sick leave was that those out on sick leave were not required to come back at a specific time but those on maternity leave were. Also, the employees who were allowed extended sick leave were treated differently from Rendine, in that they were allowed to return to their same positions, with their same responsibilities and authority-</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Rendine applied for unemployment compensation benefits. Defendant contested her application. Unrepresented by counsel, she attended a short hearing on her claim. She did not raise her discrimination claim at that hearing because \u201cI didn\u2019t think that that was the place to discuss it.\u201d The hearing dealt only with her dispute with Weinerman resulting in her termination. The decision was adverse to Rendine, and she took an administrative appeal but lost. She did not appeal further because it would have cost her more than the value of the six weeks of benefits at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Michael refused to give Rendine a reference because she was terminated. Nevertheless, she began looking for a new accounting position immediately after her discharge. She described an extensive job search, consisting of contacting employment agencies, sending out thirty resumes in 1987 and one hundred in 1988, making telephone calls, responding to want ads, and using personal contacts. She was looking for any reasonable salary, including one lower than her earnings from defendant. In 1988 she became pregnant again and stopped looking for work in October of that year. She resumed her job search in January 1989 sending out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>sixty or seventy resumes, contacting employment agencies, and reviewing want ads. She would have accepted around $25,000 per year, down from the $38,000 she had earned with defendant. Finally, in February 1991, she stopped looking for work, frustrated that she could not find anything. The employment agencies \u201csaid the economy was bad, there weren\u2019t jobs.\u201d Rendine could not afford to accept the minimum wage, because of her child care and other expenses. She intended to resume her job search when her children, ages four-and-a-half and three at the time of trial, went to school.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Rendine described the hardship of losing fifty percent of her family\u2019s income. She and her husband had to refinance their mortgage with an adjustable rate. They could no longer pay their bills. Their social life, entertainment, vacations and clothing purchases were adversely affected. They depleted their savings, and borrowed money from Rendine\u2019s parents. Rendine said that she changed from \u201claid back\u201d and \u201crelaxed\u201d to \u201cuptight.\u201d She was always worried about paying bills. She and her husband constantly had fights about money. She was sometimes unable to sleep, and had nightmares about her employment experience. She was frustrated, angry and depressed. Rendine lost her self-confidence and self-esteem, and was unable to face her friends. Even at the time of trial, she was still \u201chaving a very difficult time just coping with the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Weinerman provided Lorestani with an \u201cokay\u201d but not \u201cgreat\u201d letter of recommendation and she immediately began looking for work after her termination. She registered with employment agencies, sent out about twelve resumes each month, and looked at the want ads every day. In 1987 she had three or four interviews, but was not offered any work. She became pregnant again in late 1987, but continued to look for work until May 1988. She resumed her job search about two months after her delivery; she again had a Caesarean, and gave birth to twins. Later in 1988 she was hospitalized and unable to look for work. She did not claim lost earnings in this case for her periods of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>In 1990 she turned down a job offer for $7 per hour. Later in 1990 she accepted a position as a part-time bookkeeper with a law firm, for $13,000 a year. However, she encountered difficulties there with a hostile co-worker and was forced to resign. In late 1991 Lorestani began working thirty hours per week for $4.50 an hour, and continued at that job through trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Lorestani\u2019s husband took a second job as a waiter, Monday through Friday nights, and Saturday and Sunday. He went directly from his full-time job, as an engineer, to the second job, arriving home after midnight. Lorestani \u201cfelt like I was a single mother\u201d but \u201cwas very thankful that he was willing to work that hard.\u201d Lorestani\u2019s family members purchased clothes and shoes for the children. She was embarrassed and humiliated, \u201cbut we needed it.\u201d She gained a lot of weight and lost her self-confidence. Before she lost her job, she and her husband frequently entertained in their home. She explained: \u201cAfter I was fired ... I was just very bitter and very angry and I resented our friends. They all worked and they had kids and they weren\u2019t fired---- I became ... not a nice person to be around \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The jury obviously resolved the conflicting evidence, about whether defendant\u2019s sick and maternity leave and employment policy was discriminatorily administered, in plaintiffs\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">Plaintiffs filed their complaint on June 27, 1989. In count one, Rendine alleged that defendant hired her as an assistant controller in November 1983. She claimed that defendant conditioned her employment on not having children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As noted, in 1987 when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Rendine became pregnant and took a leave of absence due to disability; she advised defendant that she intended to return to work. She alleged that, nevertheless, some two weeks later, defendant replaced her with a less-qualified male. When she returned to work, she was \u201cdemoted to an inferior position\u201d and despite attempts to perform in her new position, was terminated. Rendine alleged that defendant\u2019s actions constituted discrimination on the basis of sex, in violation of the Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -42. In count two, Rendine alleged that defendant retaliated against her for becoming pregnant and giving birth, in violation of the LAD.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In count three, Lorestani alleged that she began employment with defendant in June 1984 as a staff accountant, was transferred to the position of residential accounting manager, and performed her duties in a satisfactory manner. She alleged that her employment also was conditioned on her representation that she would not have children. Nevertheless, Lorestani also became pregnant, took a maternity leave, and notified defendant of her intent to return to work. Defendant placed a less qualified woman in Lorestani\u2019s position within seven weeks, and terminated Loresta-ni. She alleged that this constituted discrimination on the basis of sex, in violation of the LAD. In count four, she also asserted that defendant retaliated against Lorestani for becoming pregnant and giving birth, in violation of the LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">In count five, both plaintiffs claimed that defendant wrongfully discharged them, in violation of the public policy of the State of New Jersey, which prohibits adverse employment action because of pregnancy and child birth. In count six, plaintiffs alleged that defendant breached oral agreements made to both plaintiffs \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>their positions would be held open for them pending their return\u201d to work after maternity leave. In count seven, plaintiffs claimed that they were entitled to two weeks\u2019 severance pay. In counts eight and nine, plaintiffs alleged that defendant paid Lorestani less compensation than comparably situated male staff accountants, in violation of the LAD, and in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56.2. Plaintiffs demanded back pay, damages, punitive damages, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and other appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The assignment judge denied defendant\u2019s motion for separate trials. Before trial, plaintiffs moved to strike the affirmative defense of collateral estoppel and res judicata as to the decision of the Department of Labor, Division of Unemployment and Disability Insurance, Appeal Tribunal, disqualifying Rendine for benefits because \u201cshe was discharged for misconduct connected with the work.\u201d Judge Meehan determined that res judicata precluded Rendine from bringing her claims that her discharge was without cause, in'violation of company policy, and that it constituted a breach of contract. However, the judge ruled that Rendine could still bring her claim for discrimination, a claim not addressed in the Appeal Tribunal decision. Plaintiffs later withdrew their claims for retaliation, wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, and severance pay, before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">A trial was held before Judge Meehan and a jury on March 9 through March 24,1992. At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case, defendant moved to dismiss Lorestani\u2019s equal wage claim, because of insufficient evidence of the qualifications of the male accountants. The judge reserved decision. Defendant also moved to dismiss Ren-dine\u2019s discrimination claim, arguing that she should have raised it before the Appeal Tribunal. The judge again denied the motion, on the basis of his prior ruling. Finally, defendant moved to dismiss the discrimination claim as to Lorestani, arguing that she had failed to make out a prima facie case because she was replaced by a woman. The judge rejected defense counsel\u2019s argument that young mothers and pregnant women are not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>protected class and ruled that plaintiffs were entitled to the same treatment as other disabled employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">At the close of all the evidence, defendant moved for a directed verdict as to punitive damages, arguing that his conduct was not sufficiently egregious to support an award. The judge denied the motion without discussion. However, the judge granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Lorestani\u2019s unequal pay claim, because no reasonable person could find discrimination on the basis of a comparison of her wages to those of the male staff accountant, Dean Delianites.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The jury found that unlawful discrimination was a substantial contributing factor in the termination of Rendine, and awarded her $210,000 in compensatory damages for lost earnings and personal suffering. The jury also found that unlawful discrimination was a substantial contributing factor in the termination of Lorestani, and awarded her $225,000 in compensatory damages for lost earnings and personal suffering. The jury found that defendant breached his promise to Lorestani that she would be allowed to come back to work, and awarded her $45,000 for damages she sustained as a result of that breach. Finally, the jury determined that both plaintiffs were entitled to punitive damages and awarded $250,000 to each on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">On April 8, 1992 Judge Meehan entered a judgment in favor of Rendine in the amount of $460,000, and in favor of Lorestani in the amount of $475,000, (the $45,000 for breach of contract was deemed included in the compensatory damage award of $225,000) plus prejudgment interest, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for future determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Defendant moved for a new trial as to all issues, for remittitur, or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Plaintiffs moved for calculation of prejudgment and post-judgment interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, and injunctive relief concerning the content of defendant\u2019s or his company\u2019s communication to plaintiffs\u2019 potential or actual future employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The judge heard oral argument on both parties\u2019 motions and rejected defendant\u2019s contention that the trials'of the two plaintiffs should have been severed, finding that there was no prejudice to defendant, that the jury understood it was to consider their two cases separately, and that \u201cjudicial economy\u201d called for the combined trial. As to Lorestani, the judge felt that the evidence was \u201coverwhelming\u201d in support of her claim and that she was \u201ca very impressive witness.\u201d He found that the $225,000 compensatory award in favor of Lorestani was neither \u201cexcessive\u201d nor \u201cshocking,\u201d in view of the financial and emotional distress she suffered. As to Rendine, the judge felt that there were \u201cserious factual disputes,\u201d which the jury resolved in her favor. He found that her damage award of $210,000 was not excessive, in view of her lost wages and emotional suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The judge upheld the punitive damage awards, on the basis of credible evidence that defendant \u201cknowingly permitted and authorized discrimination against women.\u201d The judge denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief because he was concerned about future enforcement and noted that the parties had been disassociated for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The judge accepted plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 lodestar sum for prejudgment counsel fees, $114,334.25, as reasonable, and for prejudgment disbursements in the amount of $11,861.25. The judge also accepted plaintiffs\u2019 counsel fee claim for post-judgment work, $28,634, plus $9,928.07 in post-judgment disbursements as reasonable. He chose a contingent fee multiplier of two, which he applied only to the actual pretrial and trial aspects of the fee but not to the post-judgment aspect. He also awarded both prejudgment and post-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Defendant moved for reconsideration of the attorneys\u2019 fee award. In a written opinion the judge rejected defendant\u2019s argument that a contingency fee enhancement was prohibited under the federal Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>City of Burlington v. Dague, </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2638, 120 L.Ed.2d 449 (1992). Rather, the judge chose to \u201capply the dissent in <em>Bague,\" </em>since it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>was \u201cquite probable\u201d that the New Jersey Supreme Court would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">On September 3, 1992 a supplemental final judgment was entered in favor of Rendine in the amounts of $460,000, plus $46,041.40 in prejudgment interest, plus costs to be taxed, and in favor of Lorestani in the amounts of $475,000, plus $49,751.75 in prejudgment interest, plus costs to be taxed. The judgment also provided for total pre- and post-judgment attorneys\u2019 fees of $279,-091.82, which included disbursements of $21,789.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Defendant contends that his pretrial motions to sever the claims of the two plaintiffs should have been granted. In his post-trial motions, defendant raised the issue again. The judge noted that each witness, except for two, whose testimony was brief, could have been called to testify in both trials, saying \u201cFrom the standpoint of judicial economy, there was no sound reason to sever the two cases.\u201d The judge found that defendant was not prejudiced by the joint trial. Both before any witnesses were called and in the final charge, he told the jury \u201cthat each plaintiff had a separate complaint,\u201d which had to be considered \u201con its own merits.\u201d The jury charge and interrogatories both treated the two eases separately. \u201cIt was a clear message and I believe the jury fully understood,\u201d the judge said.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\"><em>R. </em>4:29-1, \u201cPermissive Joinder,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">[A]U persons may join in one action as plaintiffs or be joined as defendants jointly, severally, in the alternative, or otherwise, if the right to relief asserted by the plaintiffs or against the defendants arises out of or in respect of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and involves any question of law or fact common to all of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">Defendant does not seem to contest that the requirements of this rule were satisfied. Rather he argues that the trials nevertheless should have been separate to avoid \u201cthe likelihood of jury confusion or prejudice.\u201d In support of his argument, defendant cites <em>R. </em>4:29-2 and <em>R. </em>4:38-2(a). <em>R. </em>4:29-2 provides: \u201cThe court may ... order separate trials ... to prevent delay or prej\u00fadice.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>R. </em>4:38-2(a) provides: \u201cThe court, for the convenience of the parties or to avoid prejudice, may order a separate trial of any claim____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Defendant infers prejudice only by the joinder of the two claims for trial. There is nothing specific in the record to indicate that the judge\u2019s conclusion was incorrect. Defendant points to unnecessary complexity of the joint trial, claiming that it was \u201clikely\u201d that the two claims \u201cwere not each evaluated on their own merits.\u201d According to defendant, the jury had a \u201cnatural tendency\u201d to \u201cuse all the evidence on both cases together,\u201d with a resulting improper, \u201ccorroborative effect.\u201d This is entirely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Defendant\u2019s only factual support for his claim of prejudice is an alleged \u201cimage of a tearful embrace by the plaintiffs.\u201d As plaintiffs stress, no such \u201ctearful embrace\u201d made its way into the record. Defendant cites to Lorestani\u2019s direct testimony, where she apparently started crying and asked for a tissue, upon which the judge ordered a recess. There was no mention in the record of any embrace at this time and no motion for a mistrial was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Defendant contends that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 own trial attorney described such scenes for the court,\u201d citing plaintiffs\u2019 brief in opposition to defendant\u2019s post-trial motion. That plaintiff's\u2019 brief states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">The Defendant also argues that the Plaintiffs\u2019 mutual expressions of support were prejudicial, even though such support appears only once on the trial record; and on that one occasion, the Court merely cautioned counsel to restrain the Plaintiffs in the future since the display of support was of no major consequence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">However, there is no cite to the record by defendant on when this occurred and we find none in our review of the transcripts. In addition, as plaintiffs\u2019 brief adds, the severance of the two claims, with the plaintiffs as witnesses at each other\u2019s trial, would not have avoided any spontaneous display of emotion or mutual support.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Defendant claims that under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) (formerly <em>Evid.R. </em>55) evidence of other instances of discrimination are not admissible to prove discrimination in a particular case. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>to defendant, \u201cthe corroborative effect of each plaintiffs claim on the other\u2019s\u201d was improper and prejudicial. Defendant relies on two age discrimination cases, <em>Haskell v. Kaman Corp., </em>743 <em>F.</em>2d 113 (2d Cir.1984), and <em>Moorhouse v. Boeing Co., </em>501 <em>F.Supp. </em>390 (E.D.Pa.), <em>aff'd, </em>639 <em>F.2d </em>774 (3d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In <em>Haskell, supra, </em>the Second Circuit ruled that the district court erred in allowing six former company officers to testify about their own terminations and the terminations of other officers. The statistical sample of ten terminations in eleven years was deemed too small \u201cto permit an inference that age was a determinative factor in the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d 743 <em>F.2d </em>at 121. The court pointed out that five of the terminated officers were replaced with older persons, one was replaced by a person only eight months younger, and two were not replaced at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In <em>Moorhouse, supra, </em>the trial court disallowed the testimony of five former employees of defendant, who were plaintiffs in separate cases, regarding their own terminations. 501 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 392-93. The court reasoned that each proposed witness \u201cin essence, would have presented a prima facie case of age discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393. In order to rebut this testimony, defendant would have had to justify each layoff, which would result in a trial of \u201call six cases together with the intendant [sic] confusion and prejudice inherent in that situation.\u201d <em>Ibid. Fed.R.Evid. </em>403, like our <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403 (formerly <em>Evid.R. </em>4), allows the exclusion of relevant evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of prejudice or confusion, or of undue delay or waste of time. 501 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 393. The Third Circuit affirmed this exercise of discretion. <em>See also Schrand v. Federal Pacific Elec. Co., </em>851 <em>F.2d </em>152, 3155-56 (6th Cir.1988) (age discrimination case, in which testimony of two other employees of defendant, who were also terminated, was inadmissible since they worked remotely from plaintiff, and under different managers).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">However, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) by exception does allow evidence of other civil wrongs \u201cto prove, for example, motive, intent, plan, knowledge, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Most federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>courts which have considered the issue have concluded that evidence of other acts of discrimination is admissible to prove an employer\u2019s motive or intent to discriminate. In <em>Spulak v. K Mart Corp., </em>894 F.2d 1150 (10th Cir.1990), an age discrimination case, two former employees were allowed to testify about age discrimination against them. In <em>Hunter v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., 797 F.</em>2d 1417 (7th Cir.1986), a race discrimination case, evidence of harassment against other African-American workers was admissible to prove motive and intent. Despite the time-consuming and prejudicial nature of the evidence, it was highly relevant to rebut the defense that plaintiff was fired for cause. <em>Id. </em>at 1423-24. In <em>Estes v. Dick Smith Ford, Inc., </em>856 F.2d 1097 (8th Cir.1988), a race discrimination case, evidence that defendant excluded African-Americans from its work force, discriminated against African American customers, and referred to African-Americans as \u201cniggers,\u201d although highly prejudicial, was admissible to prove unlawful motive, and to disprove defendant\u2019s explanation for plaintiffs discharge. <em>Id. </em>at 1102-05. In <em>Conway v. Electro Switch Corp., </em>825 F.2d 593 (1st Cir.1987), a sex and age discrimination case, evidence that plaintiff and another supervisor were denied salary raises because of their sex was admissible as \u201ccircumstantial evidence of a discriminatory atmosphere\u201d and \u201cevidence of a corporate state-of-mind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Here, there was considerable evidence at trial, regarding discriminatory or fair treatment of other employees. Defendant Edward Pantzer complains, citing <em>Moorhouse, supra, </em>501 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 393 n. 4, about the prejudicial effect of a \u201cparade of witnesses each recounting his contention that defendant had laid him off because\u201d of age discrimination; but he himself produced a literal parade of no less than eight employees who were permitted to return after short maternity leaves. Evidence of other acts of discrimination, or fair treatment, was properly admitted on the issue of defendant\u2019s motive and intent. This type of evidence would have been admissible even if the two cases had been severed for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Moreover, on the propriety of joinder, we explained <em>R. </em>4:29-l(a) in <em>MacNeil v. Klein, </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>394, 358 A.2d 488 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>455, 371 A.2d 60 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">The aim of permissive joinder is to allow all parties to obtain the largest efficient unit of litigation. The power of the court to sever is a discretionary one, but its guide is the joint policy of avoiding a multiplicity of suits and expediting the determination of legal controversies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\"><em>[Id., </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 408, 358 A.2d 488 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The phrase \u201cthe same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions,\u201d means \u201csuccessive transactions or at least those of a similar nature.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>They should be \u201cso causally connected or closely allied or related in character or purpose as to constitute components or links in the same evolving complex of events.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting 2 <em>Schnitzer &amp; Wildstein, New Jersey Rules Service </em>1040, 1046 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Federal courts have determined that more than one plaintiff, alleging the same type of discrimination against the same employer, satisfied the requirement that their causes of action arise out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences, and involved common questions of law or fact. In <em>Mosley v. General Motors Corp., </em>497 F.2d 1330 (8th Cir.1974), the Court of Appeals reversed an order of the district court severing ten different plaintiffs, bringing an action individually and as class representatives, for race discrimination against their employer and union. <em>Id. </em>at 1334. The Eighth Circuit determined that \u201ca company-wide policy purportedly designed to discriminate against [B]laeks in employment ... arises out of the same series of transactions or occurrences.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court found that the existence of such a policy is a fact question common <em>to </em>all members of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">On the basis of <em>Mosley, supra, </em>the district court judge in <em>Blesedell v. Mobil Oil Co., </em>708 <em>F.Supp. </em>1408 (S.D.N.Y.1989), denied defendant\u2019s motion to sever the trials of three plaintiffs alleging unequal pay and sexual harassment by the same employer. The district court judge again determined that a \u201ccompany-wide policy purportedly designed to discriminate against females <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>in employment arises out of the same series of transactions or occurrences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1422. The district court judge also found that plaintiffs \u201calleged multiple common questions of law and fact,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and distinguished <em>Moorhouse, supra, </em>involving five former employees, on the ground that <em>Moorhouse </em>was a jury trial, so that \u201cthe confusing nature of multiple claims and multiple demands for relief\u2019 was relevant. <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Duke v. Uniroyal, Inc., </em>928 F.2d 1413 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>429, 116 L.Ed.2d 449 (1991), also a jury trial, the Fourth Circuit determined that the district court had not abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to sever two plaintiffs who alleged that their discharge from employment was discriminatory. <em>Id. </em>928 <em>F.2d </em>at 1420-21. Both plaintiffs were terminated on the same day \u201cas part of the same reduction in force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1420. Thus, the Fourth Circuit concluded that their \u201cclaims arise out of the same transaction ... raising common questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1421. The instructions, like those given here, charged the jury to consider each plaintiff separately. <em>Ibid. </em>Further, the court rejected defendant\u2019s argument, identical to defendant\u2019s argument here, that the joint trial was prejudicial because evidence of discrimination as to one plaintiff should not be admissible against the other. <em>Id. </em>at 1420.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Defendant cites only one case involving a severance of parties favorable to him. In <em>Hammons v. Adams, </em>786 F.2d 1253 (5th Cir.1986), the Fifth Circuit ruled that there was no abuse of discretion in severing the claims of three discrimination plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 1253. The incidents of discrimination as well as the alleged pretexts for discharge were different. The Fifth Circuit said: \u201cThe district court decided that the substantial overlap in character and events between these distinct claims presented the possibility of juror confusion, and the appellants have not brought to our attention any serious adverse consequences that resulted from the court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 right to relief, in the case before us, arises out of the same series of transactions or occurrences. The claims are based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><em>on </em>the same company policy which allegedly discriminated against employees who became pregnant and had children. Plaintiffs\u2019 maternity leaves here overlapped, and they both were terminated within a period of two to three months. Their terminations were both successive and similar, related in time, in character and in purpose. Since they both alleged discrimination on account of pregnancy, their claims involved common questions of law, as well as fact. We find no abuse of discretion under <em>R. </em>4:29-l(a) in denial of severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Defendant objects to portions of the jury charge as plain error, <em>R. </em>2:10-2. Defendant complains that the \u201cstandard of illegality is far too broad,\u201d and failed to require a determination that defendant would have treated plaintiffs differently if they had been disabled for a reason other than pregnancy. Defendant contends that the judge improperly shifted the burden of proof to him and incorrectly charged the jury that it should consider defendant\u2019s mixed motives in terminating Lorestani only if it found no pretext in the non-discriminatory reasons defendant advanced for his action. Defendant also contends that the charge explaining the mixed motives analysis was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Defendant admits that he failed to raise any of these objections to the charge at trial, but contends that the errors were plain error, clearly capable of producing an unjust result. <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>R. </em>1:7-2. \u201cA jury is entitled to an explanation of the applicable legal principles and how they are to be applied in light of the parties\u2019 contentions and the evidence produced in the case.\u201d <em>Navarro v. George Koch &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>558, 574-75, 512 A.2d 507 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>48, 526 A.2d 138 (1986) (citations omitted). The charge as a whole should state the law \u201ccorrectly and intelligently,\u201d so that ordinary jurors can understand it. <em>Gaido v. Weiser, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 199, 545 A.2d 1350 (App.Div.1988), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>310, 558 A.2d 845 (1989). But a party is \u201cnot entitled to have the jury charged in words of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>her own choosing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 200, 545 A.2d 1350 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Here, defendant first complains about the judge\u2019s repeated use of the term \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in his explanation that each plaintiff must prove that her maternity leave and child birth were a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in her treatment by defendant. Our <em>Model Jury Charges, Civil </em>2.21A(1) at 4 (May 1991) uses the term \u201ca determinative factor.\u201d The judge here used the terms \u201ca determinative factor\u201d and \u201ca substantial contributing factor.\u201d In view of the judge\u2019s use of these terms interchangeably, we think that no difference was conveyed in meaning between \u201cdeterminative\u201d and \u201csubstantial.\u201d Defendant himself requested the use of the word \u201csubstantial\u201d in the jury interrogatories and should not complain about its use in the charge. Moreover, the absence of a contemporaneous objection by manifestly competent trial counsel belies the now-alleged significance of this claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Defendant also objects to the following portion of the charge: \u201cIt is unlawful for an employer to refuse to continue the employment of a woman because of pregnancy, delivery of a child or the complications that arise from pregnancy and delivery.\u201d. Defendant argues that the judge failed to require a comparison between maternity and other disability leaves. Plaintiffs cite <em>Slohoda v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>145, 504 A.2d 53 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>400, 517 A.2d 403 (1986). There, plaintiff alleged that he was terminated from his employment because of marital status; \u201calthough he was married to someone else, [he] was cohabiting with ... another UPS employee.\u201d <em>Id., </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 148, 504 A.2d 53 (footnote omitted). The trial judge entered an involuntary dismissal because plaintiff failed to \u201cprove that other male and female unmarried UPS employees were permitted to cohabit without interference.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We reversed, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">The question presented, therefore, is whether the firing was materially grounded in an invidious reason, that is, the fact of his marriage to someone else while maintaining a relationship with Arnett. Plaintiff was free to prove this claim by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>whatever evidence was available to him. While a showing of differential treatment accorded other employees who were single might be one way of proving such discrimination, it is not exclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 148.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Similarly here, the showing of differential treatment accorded to other employees who were not pregnant was just one, nonexclusive way of proving discrimination. Plaintiffs were not required to make this particularized showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Defendant points out that the judge charged the jury with regard to Lorestani, that she \u201cwas entitled under New Jersey law to be afforded the same rights and privileges as other sick and disabled people employed by Pantzer Management enjoyed.\u201d The judge told the jury to consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">Were those out on disability leave for other reasons other than pregnancy required to return to work by a set period of time? ... Was their position held for them to return when their disability period ended? ... Were the rules imposed upon Bernadette Lorestani different than those imposed upon other disabled persons? Were other disabled employees required to put in writing the nature and extent of their disability leave?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">According to defendant, this portion of the charge \u201cstops short\u201d of what the jury should have been required to consider: \u201cWas any difference in Lorestani\u2019s treatment because her leave was maternity leave, or would she have been treated the same way had she been on leave for some other disability?\u201d However, the judge did charge that pregnant women are entitled to \u201cthe same rights and disability leave\u201d as employees disabled for other reasons. Further, the judge\u2019s questions specifically dealt with a comparison of Lorestani to \u201cthose out on disability leave for ... reasons other than pregnancy.\u201d Thus, he did require the jury to consider if Lorestani\u2019s treatment was because of her maternity leave, or whether she would have been treated the same way if something other than maternity had disabled her.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">Defendant next complains that it was improper to compare his treatment of Lorestani with his treatment of other disabled employees, since the absences of other employees \u201cdid not present to defendant the same staffing and organizational considerations presented by the absences of Rendine and Lorestani \u2014 an assistant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>controller and a supervising accountant at the small head office.\u201d Defendant freely argued this in summation. Whether he was entitled to treat plaintiffs less favorably than other disabled employees for legitimate business reasons, defendants major defense, was a fact question for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Defendant next complains about the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury not to consider as a valid defense that defendant was enforcing a \u201cPantzer management policy that required Bernadette Lorestani to return to work in 28 days plus accrued vacation and sick days.\u201d Defendant submits that there was evidence that its policy \u201cwas not so restricted.\u201d However, the judge clearly charged the jury as to defendant\u2019s maternity leave policy: \u201cYou have to determine what it was and what areas it covered.\u201d Thus, the charge did allow for the possibility that the policy was not restricted to the twenty-eight days plus accrued vacation and sick leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Defendant next contends that the judge erred in shifting the burden of proof to him. As defendant concedes, once a plaintiff has proven a prima facie case, the burden of going forward or the burden of persuasion shifts to the employer, who must articulate or come forward with a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its rejection or termination of plaintiff. <em>Texas Dep\u2019t. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>248, 254, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1089, 1094, 67 L.Ed.2d 207, 216 (1981); <em>Goodman v. London Metals Exck, Inc., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>19, 31, 429 A.2d 341 (1981). \u201cThe plaintiff must then have the opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate nondiscriminatory reason articulated by the defendant was not the true reason for the employment decision but was merely a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Goodman v. London Metals Exch., Inc., supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 32, 429 A.2d 341. However, \u201cdefendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. It is sufficient if the defendant\u2019s evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Burdine, supra, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>at 254, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1094, 67 L.Ed.2d at 216 (citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>omitted) (footnote omitted). The ultimate burden of persuasion \u201cremains at all times with the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1093, 67 L.Ed.2d at 215; <em>Goodman, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 32, 429 A.2d 341. Defendant\u2019s allegation that it had mixed motives, \u201cthat it would have made the same decision even if it had not allowed gender to play [a motivating] role,\u201d is an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof shifts to defendant to prove this contention. <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>228, 244-45, 246-48, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1775, 1787-88, 1790, 104 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>268, 284, 285-86 (1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Defendant point outs that the judge charged, with regard to Lorestani, that if she proved her prima facie case \u201cthe burden of then going forward shifts to the defendant and in certain instances the burden of proof in fact in regard to the defense being offered may shift to the defendant.\u201d However, the judge did not mean to imply that defendant had the burden to prove, rather than to articulate, legitimate, non-diseriminatory reasons for terminating Lorestani. Rather, the judge clearly meant that the burden of proof shifted to defendant to prove its affirmative defense of mixed motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The judge did make it clear in his next paragraph that only the burden to articulate its legitimate reasons shifted to defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">If you do answer in your deliberations that plaintiffs leave for pregnancy and delivery were a factor in her termination, you must determine whether plaintiff has satisfied her ultimate burden of proving discrimination by the defendant, that is, that they used her pregnancy leave in determining whether or not she could continue employment. If she has met that burden, it is the burden of the defendant to articulate, that is, to set forth to you the legitimate and nondiserimina-tory reason for the failure to permit Mrs. Lorestani to resume her former position. The defendant maintains they promoted Pam Gaetano to the plaintiffs former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>position and did not need the plaintiff any longer. You will have to evaluate that contention and deal with whether or not you consider that to be truthful or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Defendant argues that the last-quoted sentence reinforces the impression that defendant had the burden of proof. However, the judge made it clear that at this point defendant had only the burden to articulate his reason. The judge later repeated that the burden of proof was on plaintiff to prove discrimination. \u201cTo prove pretext the plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\u2019s reason is not worthy of belief.\u201d The judge repeated: \u201c[P]laintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that her protected status, that is, a woman out on maternity leave, was a substantial factor in the treatment that she is challenging here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Defendant\u2019s final appellate objection to the charge involves the mixed motive charge; defendant claims that he was required to prove the absence of pretext twice, and that the charge effectively directed a verdict against him. Defendant objects to the following portion of the charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">So, if you find that the reason being advanced is a pretext, you should then answer the question yes in favor of plaintiff and against the defendant. [Jury interrogatory four: \u201cWas unlawful discrimination a substantial contributing factor in the termination of the plaintiff, Bernadette Lorestani?\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">If you find that the reason being offered, the non-discriminatory reason being offered is not a pretext, then you must proceed further because if in your deliberations you determine that the defendant\u2019s actions were a product of a mixture of legitimate and wrongful reasons, then the burden is placed upon the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had proceeded to not take into account the plaintiff\u2019s protected status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Defendant argues that Lorestani was provided with a second opportunity to prove that defendant\u2019s reason was pretext. Defendant claims the mixed motive analysis applies, and the burden of proof shifts to defendant, \u201conly after a plaintiff has proven intentional discrimination.\u201d However, if defendant\u2019s reason is not a pretext, it is still entirely possible that defendant had both proper and improper reasons for its action. Thus, the mixed motive analysis is applicable. On the other hand, if defendant\u2019s reason is pretext, then there is no proper motive to serve as part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>mixed motive analysis. In this situation, there is nothing to which to apply the mixed motive affirmative defense. The jury was charged, in accordance with <em>Model Jury Charges, Civil </em>2.21A(2) at 5 (February 1992), that it was to consider defendant\u2019s defense of mixed motives only if it determined \u201cthat the defendant\u2019s actions were a product of a mixture of legitimate and wrongful reasons.\u201d Thus, if it found the absence of \u201cwrongful reasons,\u201d it was not to proceed with that portion of the charge. The judge had previously charged the jury: \u201cIf you were to find that Bernadette Loresta-ni\u2019s being on maternity leave had no role in her termination, you should answer question number three no, proceed no further and return your verdict.\u201d (Clearly, the judge here meant question four.) Thus, the jury knew that it was not to continue with its deliberations and reach the issue of the mixed motive defense, unless Lorestani had shown a discriminatory motive. The mixed motive charge, as given, which was in accord with the <em>Model Jury Charges, Civil </em>2.21A(2) at 5, did not give plaintiff a second chance to prove her ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Defendant objects to the sentence following the portion of the charge above-quoted: \u201cThat is, if they had taken that [plaintiffs protected status] into account, they still would have terminated Bernadette Lorestani\u2019s employment.\u201d We agree that this statement was incorrect. The judge, seemingly and inadvertently, omitted a negative. The defense is whether if defendant had not taken plaintiffs protected status into account, he still would have terminated Lorestani. However, this error does not necessarily taint the entire charge, because immediately after this the judge corrected himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">The burden of proof on that is upon the defendant to prove that, in assessing whether Mrs. Lorestani\u2019s protected status played a motivating factor in the decision to not permit her to resume her former position, if you had asked the employer at the moment of the decision what were the reasons and if you have received a truthful reply, would one of those reasons have been that plaintiff was in that protected class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Thus, reading the charge as a whole, it contained a correct statement of the law. <em>Gaido v. Weiser, supra, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 199, 545 A.2d 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>In conclusion, the jury received a correct and understandable \u201cexplanation of the applicable legal principles,\u201d as required by <em>Navarro v. George Koch &amp; Sons, Inc., supra, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 474r-75, 512 A.2d 507. We see nothing in the charge clearly capable of producing an unjust result. The absence of any contemporaneous objection by able trial counsel fortifies our conviction. We are satisfied that the jury instructions, considered as a whole, were quite adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">V-</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Defendant contends that plaintiffs\u2019 claims for emotional distress should not have been submitted to the jury. Even conceding there was some evidence to support these claims, defendant asserts that only nominal recoveries for this element were justified. The judge found that the compensatory damage awards were not excessive (Rendine $210,000; Lorestani, $225,-000). He observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">This Court is no better qualified than the jury to put a value on another\u2019s pain and suffering, emotional distress and harm that she endured. It certainly was substantial and serious. The economic suffering she has endured was devastating to her and to her family. Her husband had to work two jobs just to keep the bill collectors off the doorstep.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Lorestani\u2019s earnings after her termination decreased substantially, and four years later she was able to earn only about one-quarter of her prior wages. The judge said: \u201c[T]his is just the type of damages that the Law Against Discrimination permits recovery for.\u201d He was not \u201cshocked by the award,\u201d but rather agreed that it compensated Lorestani for the harm defendant caused, stating \u201c[d]efendant\u2019s conduct has, for all practical purposes, removed the plaintiff from that portion of the employment market for which she worked hard to train herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">The judge observed that Rendine claimed $90,000 in lost wages. Again, he felt that \u201cthe jury is as well qualified as the Court to determine what is fair and adequate compensation.\u2019\u2019 The judge noted her emotional suffering and distress, and the financial hardships for her and her family. \u201cAlso, Rendine was on a fast. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>track and clearly had plans to move ahead in the business world. All of this has been dashed____\u201d The judge concluded that her compensatory damage award was \u201cfair, just and adequate,\u201d and supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">According to defendant\u2019s analysis, Lorestani\u2019s award of $225,000 included $180,000 for emotional distress. Defendant assumes that the jury awarded Lorestani $45,000 on her breach of contract claim. The jury was instructed that her claim for loss of wages was identical under both her breach of contract and discrimination actions, and that there would be no double recovery. Defendant thus deduces that the jury would not have awarded her more than $45,000 for her lost wages under her discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">In summation, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney requested $99,000 for lost wages for Lorestani, projecting her earnings from the time of her dismissal until she obtained her new job in 1991, but also deducting amounts for her actual earnings in that time, for the times that she was disabled and not looking for work, and for the taxes she would have paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">As to Rendine, defendant speculates that her award of $210,000 included \u201ca minimum of $105,000 for emotional distress,\u201d noting that she requested $105,000 in economic damages. Plaintiffs attorney calculated $105,000 by projecting her wages from the time of dismissal until 1991, when she stopped looking for work, deducting the three months that she was disabled when she had her second child and what she would have paid in taxes. The sum of $2,000 for lost medical coverage also was included. Defendant candidly admits that the \u201cactual allocation by the jury is impossible to determine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The Legislature has specifically authorized recovery for the type of emotional distress plaintiffs claimed. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\">The Legislature further finds that because of discrimination, people suffer personal hardships, and the State suffers a grievous harm. The personal hardships include: economic loss; time loss; physical and emotional stress; and in some eases severe emotional trauma, illness, homelessness or other irreparable harm resulting from the strain of employment controversies; relocation, search and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>moving difficulties; anxiety caused by lack of information, uncertainty, and resultant planning difficulty; career, education, family and social disruption; and adjustment problems, which particularly impact on those protected by this act. Such harms have, under the common law, given rise to legal remedies, including compensatory and punitive damages. The Legislature intends that such damages be available to all persons protected by this act and that this act shall be liberally construed in combination with other protections available under the laws of this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">This provision was effective on April 16, 1990, but \u201cshall apply to any action pending on that date.\u201d <em>L. </em>1990, c. 12, \u00a7 5. Plaintiffs\u2019 action was filed in 1989 and was pending in April 1990. The Statement of the Assembly Judiciary, Law and Public Safety Committee on c. 12 of <em>L. </em>1990 cogently expressed the purpose of the amendment: \u201cThis bill would also add language to the findings section of the LAD listing the hardships <em>{i.e., </em>economic loss, emotional trauma) which victims of discrimination might suffer and language indicating that the LAD is to be liberally construed so that all common law remedies, including compensatory and punitive damages, are available to persons protected by the LAD.\u201d (Assembly, Nos. 2872, 2118 and 2228, <em>L. </em>1990, c. 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Although defendant\u2019s discriminatory treatment did not cause plaintiffs to relocate or suffer illness or homelessness, both plaintiffs described in detail their inconvenience and economic loss, physical and emotional stress, anxiety in searching for reemployment, uncertainty, career and family disruption and other adjustment problems. Plaintiffs\u2019 problems seem precisely the type for which the Legislature intended compensation. <em>See Catalane v. Gilian Instrument Corp., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 499-501, 638 A.2d 1341, 1353-54 (App.Div.1994); <em>Bolden v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, </em>21 F.3d 29, - (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">As to the amount of the award, the Supreme Court in <em>Baxter v. Fairmont Food Co., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>588, 596-97, 379 A.2d 225 (1977) (citations omitted), explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">[A] trial judge should not interfere with the quantum of damages assessed by a jury unless it is so disproportionate to the injury and resulting disability shown as to shock his conscience and to convince him that to sustain the award would be manifestly unjust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The judgment of the initial factfinder ... is entitled to very considerable respect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC_\">The standard for appellate review is the same, except that the trial judge\u2019s \u201cfeel of the case\u201d is entitled to deference. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 379 A.2d 225. The trial judge here was not shocked by the compensatory awards; he did not consider them excessive in view of the evidence. His determination, as well as that of the jury, are entitled to considerable appellate deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Defendant relies mainly on <em>Jackson v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>223 <em>N. J.Super. </em>467, 538 A.2d 1310 (App.Div.1988). There, plaintiff was discharged from his employment because of \u201cegregious racial prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474, 538 A.2d 1310. The judge felt that punitive damages were unwarranted, but agreed to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury after its verdicts on liability and compensatory damages, to avoid a retrial after appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 470-73, 538 A.2d 1310. During deliberations, the jury asked whether, if it awarded plaintiff damages for mental suffering, \u201cwould we then additionally have to determine punitive damages,\u201d to which the judge answered in the affirmative. <em>Id. </em>at 473, 538 A.2d 1310. The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff for $600,000 in compensatory and $1,000,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">This court agreed with the trial judge that the compensatory damage award was \u201cso disproportionate to the injuries described by the plaintiff as to constitute a manifest injustice and shock the conscience.\u201d <em>Ibid. A </em>psychologist testified for plaintiff that he suffered from a personality or mood disorder caused by depression over his discharge, and that he suffered permanent psychological damages. <em>Id. </em>at 476-77, 538 A.2d 1310. However, plaintiff had seen the psychologist only twice, five years after his discharge. <em>Id. </em>at 476, 538 A.2d 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">In the case before us, defendant complains that neither Rendine nor Lorestani sought any treatment or counseling. However, they both explained that they did not because they could not afford treatment. In <em>Jackson, supra, </em>plaintiff lost only $16,500 in wages, and was reinstated to his position after approximately eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>months. 223 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 476, 538 A.2d 1310. In the case before ns, in contrast, neither plaintiff was ever reinstated, and both were unable to obtain jobs that were at all comparable, up to the time of trial. Thus, not only were their lost wages claims significantly higher than Jackson\u2019s but the damage to their careers and personal lives was extensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Moreover, in <em>Jackson, supra, </em>unlike' here, one of the principle reasons for overturning the award was that because of the jury\u2019s question during deliberations, the court was concerned \u201cthat the jury may well have \u2018penalized\u2019 defendant when considering compensatory damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481, 538 A.2d 1310. Here, in contrast, there is neither any indication nor does defendant contend that the compensatory damage award of either plaintiff might have been tainted with punitive considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Defendant also complains that there was no expert testimony or objective corroboration of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Defendant has submitted no authority to us that requires either expert testimony or objective corroboration for a pain and suffering award in a discrimination case. Defendant cites <em>Decker v. Princeton Packet, Inc., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>418, 561 A.2d 1122 (1989) (false obituary), an action at common law for defamation and negligent infliction of emotional harm, and <em>Buckley v. Trenton Saving Fund Soc\u2019y, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>355, 544 A.2d 857 (1988) (wrongful dishonor of check), also an action at common law for intentional infliction of emotional harm, both relatively unfavored causes of action and very different from the statutory discrimination claims here. In <em>Buckley, supra, </em>the Court explained that the compensable emotional stress must be \u201cso severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.\u201d 111 <em>N.J. </em>at 366, 544 A.2d 857 (citations omitted). In a discrimination case, in contrast, the Legislature has set forth a far more lenient or generous standard for compensation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Defendant next contends that the judge erred in submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury, because there was \u201cno evidence of malicious or egregious wrongdoing by defendant.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Before the charge to the jury, defendant moved for a directed verdict as to punitive damages, which the judge denied without discussion. However, the judge gave reasons for denying defendant\u2019s post-trial motion on this issue. He determined that there was credible evidence in the record that defendant \u201cknowingly permitted and authorized discrimination against women.\u201d The judge pointed out that defendant discharged his secretary because she had to leave at 5 p.m. to take care of her children, while he allowed Delianites, \u201cwho had a much more responsible position than the secretary,\u201d to leave early to go to law school. The judge pointed out that there was evidence that defendant personally assured both plaintiffs that their positions would be open for them when they returned from maternity leave. There was evidence that defendant had very substantial control over his company, even down to his attention to a dirty refrigerator in the lunchroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">As to Rendine, the judge felt that the jury \u201chad a right to find ... that she was set up to cause a confrontation in order to fire her,\u201d and further that defendant \u201cknew of the scheme, approved of it, and let certain rules be made in order that the event could take place.\u201d The evidence permitted the jury to make such an inference. The judge added that if the jury \u201cfound the other way I wouldn\u2019t upset it either.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">More than negligence is required for an award of punitive damages. In <em>Nappe v. Anschelewitz, Barr, Ansell &amp; Bonello, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>37, 49-50, 477 A.2d 1224 (1984), the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">To warrant a punitive award, the defendant\u2019s conduct must have been wantonly reckless or malicious. There must be an intentional wrongdoing in the sense of an \u201cevil-minded act\u201d or an act accompanied by a wanton and wilful disregard of the rights of another____ The key to the right to punitive damages is the wrongfulness of the intentional act____ Moreover, it is especially fitting to allow punitive damages for actions such as legal fraud, since intent rather than mere negligence is the requisite state of mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">As plaintiffs point out, intent is the generally requisite state of mind for an employment discrimination action under the LAD. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Actionable sex discrimination is rarely simply careless or inadvertent. In <em>Goodman v. London Metals Exch., Inc., supra, </em>the Court stated that \u201cdiscriminatory motive or intent\u201d is \u201ca crucial element in a discrimination case.\u201d 86 <em>N.J. </em>at 30, 429 A.2d 341. The judge\u2019s charge was in accordance with these requirements. He used the terms \u201cactual malice ... intentional wrongdoing, and evil minded act ... wanton and wilful disregard of the rights of others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The judge carefully charged the jury that punitive damages could not be assessed against defendant for the acts of his employees, unless defendant himself authorized or directed them, or at least agreed with and acquiesced to them. This is in accord with the explanation recently rendered in <em>Lehmann v. Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, Inc., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>587, 625, 626 A.2d 445 (1993): \u201cHence, the employer should be liable for punitive damages only in the event of actual participation by upper management or willful indifference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">We agree with plaintiffs and the judge that there was sufficient evidence of both defendant\u2019s personal involvement and intentional, malicious actions. As to his personal involvement, Rendine testified that defendant \u201cwas involved with everything that went on in the office, the day-to-day operations, everything.\u201d He was not only concerned about moldy food in the refrigerator, but was involved in the office renovations, and the personal supplies of individual employees. Rendine also testified from her personal knowledge that defendant had to approve all personnel hirings and terminations.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Lorestani also testified that defendant \u201cwas involved in every aspect of the company.\u201d For example, after Lorestani was terminated, defendant wrote her a personal letter asking her to return her office key. Defendant\u2019s involvement in personnel matters is also indicated in Rendine\u2019s testimony that whenever she interviewed a job applicant, defendant would ask her if the applicant had small children. When Rendine needed a bookkeeper and created the new position, she had to discuss this matter first with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>defendant as well as Weinerman. When Rendine discharged an employee she had supervised, she discussed this with defendant first. Finally, both plaintiffs testified that defendant personally promised them that they would be allowed to take maternity leaves. Defendant\u2019s personal immersion in the details of management was pervasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">There was also considerable evidence of malice and intentional wrongdoing by defendant. When Weinerman announced at an executive committee meeting that the new accountant should be a male because plaintiffs were of child-bearing age and their \u201cbiological clock was ticking to have children,\u201d defendant allegedly agreed. Rivera heard defendant comment that women with children were unreliable. Defendant once demeaningly asked Ren-dine to polish the silver in his office. When Rendine returned to work, defendant was very cold toward her, in contrast to his expressed appreciation of her shortly before she left.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">There was ample evidence for the jury to conclude that the dismissal of Rendine for insubordination was intentionally and maliciously contrived. Rendine\u2019s assigned desk on return was isolated, filthy and in a noisy location; she had no supplies, no computer access, and her personal belongings were gone. Michael, Weinerman, and Delianites, as well as defendant, were cold toward her. She felt \u201clike I had a social disease.\u201d Employees whom Rendine had previously supervised were directed to take their questions to Delianites, although Rendine had more experience in residential accounting. Rivera and others were reprimanded for taking their questions to Rendine.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Weinerman\u2019s explanation for his stripping Rendine of her responsibilities could well have struck the jury as inherently incredible. Weinerman said that he intended to have two assistant controllers, Rendine and Delianites, one responsible for commercial accounting and the other for residential. However, these were not the job duties he gave her upon her return; rather, he assigned her to develop methods to utilize the computer system. Weinerman was unclear as to who then was to supervise residen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>tial and who was to supervise commercial accounting. He never told Rendine about this plan nor did he ever actually implement it. At one point he testified that he abandoned this plan before Rendine returned to work. Weinerman also admitted that he kept Delianites\u2019s promotion a secret from Rendine, and that Rendine\u2019s job functions were so minor when she returned that \u201cit was not a hardship\u201d ultimately for the company to dispense with her. In the end, as to the confrontation between Weinerman and Rendine, Weinerman admitted that he did not allow her to state her side of the story or her explanation, because he was not interested. Weinerman \u201cexpected her to react that way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The jury clearly found unlawful discrimination a contributing factor in the termination of Rendine and Lorestani. The jury could reasonably have found this discrimination was intentional, inspired because they became pregnant and gave birth. \u201cOur cases indicate that the requirement [for willfulness or wantonness] may be satisfied upon a showing that there has been a deliberate act or omission with knowledge of a high degree of probability of harm and reckless indifference to consequences.\u201d <em>Berg v. Reaction Motors Div., </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>396, 414, 181 A.2d 487 (1962); <em>Potter v. Village Bank of New Jersey, 225 N.J.Super. </em>547, 563, 543 A.2d 80 (App.Div.) ($100,000 punitive award for retaliatory discharge), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>352, 550 A.2d 462 (1988); <em>see Levinson v. Prentice-Hall, Inc., </em>868 <em>F.</em>2d 558 (3d Cir.1989) (punitive damages allowable for employment discrimination under New Jersey\u2019s LAD). The jury had ample evidence to support its determination that the discrimination against both plaintiffs was not only intentional wrongdoing but also malicious or \u201cevil-minded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">vn</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The final point on defendant\u2019s appeal involves the assessment of counsel fees under the fee-shifting mechanism of the LAD, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant first objects to the use of a contingency multiplier, doubling plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fee claim. Defendant also contends that even if the two-times multiplier was proper, it should not have been used here because plaintiffs\u2019 retainer agreement was not fully contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1 provides that in any action brought under the LAD, \u201cthe prevailing party may be awarded a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the cost.\u201d The judge accepted counsel\u2019s \u201clodestar\u201d calculations as reasonable. The \u201clodestar\u201d is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. <em>Silva v. Autos of Amboy, Inc., </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 556, 632 A.2d 291 (App.Div.1993). A total of 646.65 attorneys\u2019 hours were expended, at rates of $225 and $175 for partners, $165 for senior associates, including Ira Weiner, who tried the case, and $150 to $115 for junior associates; the total came to $114,334.25, plus $11,861.25 in disbursements. Certifications of several experienced employment and labor relations attorneys justified both the amount of time spent and the hourly rates. The judge also awarded post-judgment counsel fees of $28,634, and post-judgment disbursements of $9,928.07, which included the fee for an expert on attorneys\u2019 fees, Peter Van Shaick. Defendant did not contest the reasonableness of these amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">On February 24, 1988 plaintiffs entered into a partial contingent-fee agreement with their attorney, Elliot Baumgart. The fee would be the greater of (1) half of the then-current billing rate for himself, or $75 per hour, and for his associate, Ira Weiner, $62.50 per hour, plus twenty-five percent of plaintiffs\u2019 recovery, or (2) attorney\u2019s fees awarded by the court pursuant to the statute, \u201cif we should prevail at trial.\u201d Later that year Baumgart merged with Rabner, Allcorn and Widmark, P.C., which later became Rabner, Allcorn and Meislik, P.C., the firm representing plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>at trial. Plaintiffs were also to pay and did pay a retainer in the amount of $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 retainer eventually was \u201cexhausted on disbursements,\u201d and later plaintiffs were able to pay their attorneys only $2,750 more. According to trial counsel Ira Weiner, plaintiffs\u2019 individual and marital assets were meager, and if they had lost at trial, they probably \u201cwould have taken advantage of their rights under the Bankruptcy Act to avoid additional payments to the firm.\u201d Nevertheless, his firm decided to continue to represent them \u201con what had in reality become a completely contingent basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The judge agreed, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">If plaintiffs had lost at trial, it is unlikely that counsel would have been able to collect the reduced hourly fees and the balance of costs____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">This Court is satisfied that plaintiffs\u2019 arrangement with counsel was, if not by design but certainly by the practicality, on a contingent fee basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">We also agree. Realistically, this was a contingent fee case with the client advancing a portion of the expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">Defendant points out that plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys \u201cdid not waive their right to pursue collection based on their hourly rates\u201d and further alleged that \u201cthe relevant inquiry\u201d is the initial agreement, not what occurred later. Defendant cites <em>Casino v. Mahopac Cent. School Dist., </em>741 <em>F.Supp. </em>1028, 1036 (S.D.N.Y.1989), a handicap discrimination case, in which the court refused to enhance the counsel fee because \u201cenhancement is inappropriate where the client retains and pays the attorney on a quantum meruit or hourly charge basis and then runs out of money.\u201d In <em>Casino, </em>however, the fee agreement was entirely on an hourly basis. <em>Id. </em>at 1033-34. Unlike here, there was no reduced hourly rate or partial contingency. In addition, Casino had paid his attorney\u2019s bills regularly until March 1989 (suit was filed in June 1988). Even in March 1989 Casino paid $15,000 toward a $30,-309.20 bill, even though he was unemployed. <em>Id. </em>at 1036. Here, in contrast, plaintiffs made only one payment towards expenses after their original, modest retainer was exhausted on expenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Unlike in <em>Casino, </em>here, quite early in the case the original, mostly-contingent, fee agreement had become completely contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The issues of the effect of a contingency agreement and the enhancement of the lodestar have been consistently controversial. In <em>Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air (Delaware Valley II), </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>711, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>3078, 97 L.Ed.2d 585 (1987),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the federal Supreme Court reversed an enhancement for contingency of success to an award of counsel fees under the Clean Air Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 7604d. 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 713-15, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3080-82, 97 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 590-91. The Court noted that the \u00a7 304d provision for reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees was analogous to the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1988, and said that the same principles and case law govern both. 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 713 n. 1, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3080 n. 1, 97 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 590 n. 1. In a four-one-four split, the plurality opinion of the Court, written by Justice White, generally disapproved enhanced compensation under fee-shifting statutes which recognized the risk of loss and thus possible nonpayment of counsel fees in these cases, but the Court concluded that \u201cif the trial court specifically finds that there was a real risk-of-not-prevailing issue in the case, an upward adjustment of the lodestar may be made,\u201d but not more than one-third of the lodestar. 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 730, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3089, 97 L.Ed.2d at 601. The four-judge dissent, citing the amicus curiae brief for the American Bar Association, offered some guidance regarding the effect of an attorney-client agreement on a possible contingency enhancement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">A court first must determine whether an attorney has taken a case on a contingent basis____ The court also must determine if an attorney has been able to mitigate the risk of nonpayment in any way. For example, if a client has agreed to pay some portion of the lodestar amount, regardless of the outcome of the case, the attorney has mitigated the risk of loss to some extent, although the percentage of total expenses paid by the client will indicate how much of a mitigating factor this contribution should be considered to be. Or, for example, if the attorney has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>entered into a contingent-fee contract in a suit seeking substantial damages, the attorney again has mitigated the risk of nonpayment to some extent by exchanging the risk for the prospect of compensation greater than the prospective lodestar amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">[483 <em>U.S. </em>at 748-49, 107 <em>S.Ct </em>at 3098-99, 97 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 612-13 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In the case before us, plaintiffs agreed to pay a portion of the lodestar amount, regardless of the outcome of the case, in addition to the $5,000 retainer. Because the amounts they actually could pay did not even cover disbursements, that hourly agreement cannot realistically be considered a mitigating factor. The judge was correct that \u201cif not by design but certainly by the practicality\u201d this was a contingent fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The judge in the case before us did not consider whether plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys mitigated their risk of nonpayment by entering into a partial contingent-fee agreement. Justice White in <em>Delaware Valley II </em>observed that when plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys exchanged the \u201crisk of non-payment for the prospect of compensation greater than the prospective lodestar amount,\u201d 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 749, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3099, 97 L.Ed.2d at 613, this must be considered a mitigation of the risk of nonpayment \u201cto some extent.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>On the propriety of fee enhancement for contingency of success, Judge Meehan here actually followed the concurring opinion of Justice O\u2019Connor in <em>Delaware Valley II, supra, </em>which several courts of appeal had recognized as the holding of the case, <em>see, e.g., Blum v. Witco Chemical Corp., </em>829 <em>F.2d </em>367, 379 (3d Cir.1987). Justice O\u2019Connor agreed with the dissent that contingency of outcome itself could be considered in determination of a reasonable fee under the fee-shifting statutes. 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 731, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3089, 97 L.Ed.2d at 601. She also agreed that \u201ccompensation for contingency must be based on the difference in market treatment of contingent fee cases <em>as a class, </em>rather than on an assessment of the \u2018riskiness\u2019 of any particular case.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>She explained that this would avoid \u201c[Haphazard and widely divergent compensation for risk.\u201d 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 733, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3090, 97 L.Ed.2d at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Justice O\u2019Connor required that the fee applicant prove \u201cthe degree to which the relevant market compensates for contingency.\u201d 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 733, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3090-91, 97 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 602 (citations omitted). The fee award should be enhanced only as much as \u201cnecessary to bring the fee within the range that would attract competent counsel,\u201d and the applicant must prove that she \u201cwould have faced substantial difficulties in finding counsel in the local or other relevant market.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted) (quoting the opinion of the Court, 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 731, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3089, 97 L.Ed.2d at 601). In accordance with these guidelines expressed by Justice O\u2019Connor, Judge Meehan found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">This Court is satisfied with the proofs submitted by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in support of the fee application. Plaintiffs demonstrated that they went to 12 different attorneys before Mr. Weiner\u2019s firm agreed to take the case. Counsel submitted several certifications from attorneys which established the risks involved in contingent fee litigation. Due to these risks, firms generally will not accept contingent fee cases. Certifications from several attorneys reveal[ ] that firms will only take contingent cases upon belief that they will recover the hourly rate plus a premium, a substantial premium, to compensate for the risk of a nonpayment or underpayment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The judge rejected plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s request for a multiplier of 2.5, choosing instead 2.0 which reflected \u201cthe appropriate differences in the market treatment,\u201d and was \u201cconsistent with the evidence presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Defendant does not contest the judge\u2019s factual findings, based on unrefuted evidence in the form of affidavits. According to plaintiff Lorestani, both \u201cGloria Allred, the well-known women\u2019s rights attorney out of California, and Nadine Taub, head of the Rutgers Law School Women\u2019s Rights Clinic\u201d declined to take their case. Other attorneys demanded hourly rates or retainers which plaintiffs could not afford. Plaintiffs \u201cfirst learned about Mr. Weiner when we paid the Bergen Record to search its archives and it found another pregnancy discrimination case Mr. Weiner had won.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Glen Savits, a senior associate at Wilentz, Goldman &amp; Spitzer, P.C., responsible for presenting new employment matters to the firm\u2019s screening committee, recommended contingent cases to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>\u25a0firm only when the expected damages are at least $100,000, and the specials are at least $50,000. His firm requires a contingent fee agreement for two times the current hourly fee or a percentage of the recovery, whichever is greater. Savits considers two and one-half times his hourly rate on successful cases as \u201cthe minimum necessary to remain in the business of litigating contingent employment law cases,\u201d without which competent counsel would not accept them. Nevertheless, his firm \u201cis not yet convinced that contingent employment cases are economically viable in the long run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Wayne Positan, managing partner of Lum, Hones, Conant, Danzis &amp; Kleinberg, and head of the firm\u2019s labor and employment group, receives \u201ca constant stream of requests to review prospective plaintiffs\u2019 cases.\u201d His firm no longer accepts plaintiffs on a contingency basis, \u201c[biased upon our experiences in the area, coupled with our overall philosophy of representing management.\u201d Positan notes that many employers will vigorously defend, and the time commitment and risk of loss are substantial. Colleagues to whom he has referred cases are also \u201cexceedingly reluctant to take pure contingency cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Martin Aron, a member of Budd, Larner, Gross, Roseman, Greenberg &amp; Sade, P.C., who specializes in employment and labor relations law, is also \u201cextremely conservative in choosing contingent employment eases,\u201d and takes them only if he believes \u201cour firm will recover its hourly rate plus a substantial premium for risk of nonpayment or underpayment.\u201d To attract Aron as counsel, prospective plaintiffs must have \u201cexcellent proofs on the merits,\u201d and substantial damages, as well as be willing to sign an agreement providing for an hourly fee or a percentage of the recovery, whichever is greater, after successful litigation or settlement. According to. Aron, \u201cuntil substantial contingent multipliers are routinely granted as part of fee awards by the courts in statutory employment cases, the rights established by those laws will remain unenforced, particularly when it comes to small damage cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Finally, Peter Van Schaick, whose practice is limited to equal employment and wrongful discharge cases, and as plaintiffs\u2019 expert on reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, opined that prospective plaintiffs in employment cases, even with claims for substantial damages, have extreme difficulty in finding competent counsel in the New Jersey legal market. In his opinion, \u201cto a reasonable degree of professional certainty, a multiplier of 2.5 is the minimum necessary to attract competent counsel in New Jersey to take contingent employment cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">We recognize that there is substantial support for defendant\u2019s argument that any fee enhancement for contingency may be inappropriate. In <em>Chattin v. Cape May Greene, Inc., </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>590, 581 A.2d 91 (App.Div.1990) (Judge Brody dissenting in part), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>520, 591 A.2d 943 (1991), a consumer fraud case, we disapproved an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, including a twenty-five percent enhancement, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19 which, like <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1 and the federal fee-shifting statutes, provides for reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees for claimants. Id. at 610-17, 591 A.2d 943. <em>Chattin </em>is in no sense binding authority on us on the issue of multipliers for counsel fees despite the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance on the opinion of this court. In <em>Chattin, </em>neither plaintiffs\u2019 brief in support of their appeal as of right, nor defendants\u2019 cross-petition for certification raised the issue of counsel fees. There was a concurrence and a dissent in the Supreme Court; neither opinion raised or discussed the issue of counsel fees in the Court. The issue of fee enhancement clearly was not before the Supreme Court in <em>Chattin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The award of attorneys\u2019 fees in <em>Chattin </em>was found improper by a Panel of this court, first, because counsel\u2019s allocation of the time spent on claims against the defendant and a co-defendant, against whom no fee could be awarded, was \u201cconclusionary, lacking in any supporting detail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614, 591 A.2d 943. In addition, the attorney\u2019s time charge included hours spent on other claims, for which there was no entitlement to any award of fees. <em>Ibid. </em>Second, the trial judge erred in awarding counsel fees for a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>appeal. <em>Ibid. </em>Third, the hours billed were excessive on their face. <em>Id. </em>at 614-15, 591 A.2d 943. Fourth, the judge failed to consider \u201cthe amount genuinely in dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616, 591 A.2d 943. Fifth, and finally, the judge considered the award of a twenty-five percent enhancement of the lodestar. <em>Id. </em>at 613, 616, 591 A.2d 943. The contingency of success was only one of several reasons why the trial judge made an upward adjustment; the other reasons, the quality and quantity of legal services provided, were clearly improper. <em>Id. </em>at 616, 591 A.2d 943. We did say in <em>Chattin:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">Moreover, the uncertainty as to the ultimate result was not a basis for any adjustment in the fee. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council [Delaware Valley II], supra, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>at 727, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3087, 97 L.Ed.2d at 599 (\u201cmultipliers or other enhancement of a reasonable lodestar fee to compensate for assuming the risk of loss is impermissible under the usual fee-shifting statutes.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\n<em>[Ibid]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">However, in <em>Chattin, supra, </em>citing <em>Delaware Valley I, supra, </em>this court recognized that the lodestar amount may be increased in \u201crare\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d cases. 243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 616, 591 A.2d 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Judge Meehan determined that the present case was \u201cexceptional,\u201d justifying the fee enhancement. We observe also that none of the other reasons for disapproving the fee award in <em>Chattin, supra, </em>are present here. Nor was the fee enhancement here based improperly on the \u201cquality or quantity\u201d of legal services, as in <em>Chattin, supra. </em>Moreover, Judge Meehan had an ample record before him tending to justify fee enhancement. <em>Chattin </em>presented no such record.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">In <em>Chattin, supra, </em>we did cite the opinion of the Court in <em>Delaware Valley II, supra, </em>and seemingly did leave a safety valve for considering fee enhancement. We now find without conflict with the <em>Chattin </em>opinion, that the fee enhancement here was proper. The Court in <em>Delaware Valley II, supra, </em>determined that the fee enhancement there was incorrect in part because it was for work done after the entry of a consent decree, whereas \u201c[t]he risk of nonpayment should be determined at the beginning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>litigation.\u201d 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 729, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3089, 97 L.Ed.2d at 600 (citation omitted). Here, unlike the district judge in <em>Delaware Valley II, supra, </em>the judge only applied the multiplier to the prejudgment fees. He specifically declined to apply it to the post-judgment fees because \u201cthere were no longer any risks involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The Court in <em>Delaware Valley II, supra, </em>also espoused a requirement for a finding, based on evidence in the record, \u201cthat without risk enhancement plaintiff would have faced substantial difficulties in finding counsel in the local or other relevant market.\u201d 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 731, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3089, 97 L.Ed.2d at 601 (footnote omitted). This is exactly what the judge found here, based on a sound record of uncontradicted evidence. Thus, a fee enhancement would have been justified even under <em>Delaware Valley II, supra, </em>although the Court there did determine that a doubling of the lodestar was excessive, and that any fee enhancement should not exceed one-third of the lodestar. 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 730, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3089, 97 L.Ed.2d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">More recently, indeed on the day before the judge in the present case rendered his initial determination on attorneys\u2019 fees, and two months before his written opinion on reconsideration, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>City of Burlington v. Dague, </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2638, 120 L.Ed.2d 449 (1992). Between <em>Delaware Valley II, supra, </em>and <em>Dague, supra, </em>Justices Brennan and Marshall were succeeded by Justices Souter and Thomas. In a six to three decision, the Court absolutely abolished any enhancement of lodestar attorneys\u2019 fees for contingency under fee-shifting statutes. 505 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2643-44, 120 L.Ed.2d at 459. The Court was concerned that contingency enhancement would encourage attorneys \u201cto bring relatively meritless claims.\u201d 505 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 2641, 120 L.Ed.2d at 457. Rejecting Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Delaware Valley II, supra, </em>Justice Scalia, writing for the majority in <em>Dague, supra, </em>explained that Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s two propositions, proof of the difficulty of finding counsel, and disallowing enhancement based on the riskiness of a particular case, \u201cas a practical matter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>collide.\u201d 505 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2642, 120 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 457. As to Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s theory that enhancement should be based on the market treatment of contingent cases as a class, the Court said that there is no market treatment for non-monetary damages. Further, the majority determined that fee enhancement \u201cwould in effect pay for the attorney\u2019s time (or anticipated time) in cases where his client does <em>not </em>prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2643, 120 L.Ed.2d at 458. This, the Court said, would violate the statutory requirement of awarding fees only to prevailing parties. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Noting that lodestar model fee awards were often higher than contingent-fee model awards, the Court felt that grafting a contingency enhancer \u201conto the lodestar model would be to concoct a hybrid scheme that resorts to the contingent-fee model to increase a fee award but not to reduce it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2643, 120 L.Ed.2d at 459. Finally, the Court was concerned with the \u201cadministrability\u201d of the contingency enhancement. <em>Ibid. </em>It would \u201cmake the setting of fees more complex and arbitrary, hence more unpredictable, and hence more litigable,\u201d resulting in \u201csatellite litigation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">The dissenters in <em>Dague </em>(Blackmun, Stevens, and O\u2019Connor) determined that a \u201creasonable\u201d fee must be \u201cfully compensatory,\u201d \u201ccalculated on the basis of rates and practices prevailing in the relevant market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2644, 120 L.Ed.2d at 459-60 (citations omitted). They recognized that a reasonable appreciation of the economics of law practice contemplates that a contingent fee must always be higher than a fee established and paid regardless of outcome. <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2644, 120 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 460. The dissent denied that contingency enhancement constituted an award to non-prevailing parties, accusing the majority of objecting to the amount of the award, rather than to who was receiving it. <em>Id. </em>at -, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2645-47, 120 L.Ed.2d at 462-63. As to the Court\u2019s concern about \u201cburdensome satellite litigation,\u201d the dissent said that under Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s standard, \u201cthe matter of the amount by which fees should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>increased would quickly become settled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at--, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2647, 120 L.Ed.2d at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">As to the majority\u2019s complaint that there is no market treatment for cases with non-monetary damages, the dissent pointed out that the district court must nevertheless find \u201ca relevant private market\u201d from which to select a lodestar fee. <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2647-48, 120 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 464. There is no reason \u201cwhy this market disappears only when the inquiry turns to enhancement.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The dissent also faulted the majority for assuming that attorneys respond only to the possibility of losing particular cases. <em>Ibid. </em>Rather, attorneys prefer to avoid any contingency case, even the most meritorious, in favor of any case, regardless of merit, which guarantees payment. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, according to the dissent, \u201c[t]he strategy of the fee-shifting provisions is to attract competent counsel to selected federal cases by insuring that if they prevail, counsel will receive fees commensurable with what they could obtain in other litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2644, 120 L.Ed.2d at 460. The dissent in <em>Dague </em>concluded that the Court\u2019s decision \u201cwill seriously weaken the enforcement of those statutes for which Congress has authorized fee awards\u2014 notably, many of our Nation\u2019s civil rights laws and environmental laws.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">Judge Meehan, upon reconsidering his original ruling, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-13\">New Jersey\u2019s Supreme Court has been among the leaders in furthering the rights of employees. [S]ee <em>Shebar v. Sanyo Business Systems Corp., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>276 [544 A.2d 377] (1988); <em>Woolley v. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>284 [491 A.2d 1257] (1985); <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58 [417 A.2d 505] (1980). Therefore, it seems quite probable that when confronted with the enhancement issue, our Supreme Court will adopt the analysis of the dissent in <em>Dague. </em>This Court chooses to apply the dissent in <em>Dague </em>in order to achieve a fair and just result in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">The judge recognized that \u201cNew Jersey courts look to cases interpreting the federal civil rights law in construing the LAD,\u201d but correctly noted that \u201cour courts are not bound by federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ahx\">The judge further found support for the contingency enhancement in <em>R. </em>4:42-9. Section (a)(8) of that rule allows fees for legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>services \u201c[i]n all cases where counsel fees are permitted by statute.\u201d Section (b) requires applications for counsel fees to be \u201csupported by an affidavit of services addressing the factors enumerated by <em>R.P.C. </em>1.5(a).\u201d <em>R.P.C. </em>1.5(a)(8) sets forth \u201cwhether the fee is fixed or contingent\u201d as a factor for consideration in determining reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We agree with the trial judge here. In view of the unrefuted attorneys\u2019 affidavits submitted, together with the difficulties plaintiffs had in obtaining counsel in this very case, a fee enhancement based on contingency considerations appears essential to the enforcement of the LAD. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-3 sets forth a legislative finding and declaration that discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of sex, \u201cthreatens not only the rights and proper privileges of the inhabitants of the State but menaces the institutions and foundation of a free Democratic State,\u201d and \u201c[t]he Legislature intends ... that this act shall be liberally construed.\u201d The New Jersey Supreme Court has recently reiterated its strong commitment \u201cto end gender discrimination.\u201d <em>In re Seaman, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>67, 98, 627 A.2d 106 (1993); <em>Lehmann v. Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, Inc., supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 600, 626 A.2d 445. We conclude that a liberal construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1, to promote the goal of ending discrimination, includes contingency fee enhancement in appropriate eases. In <em>Balsley by Balsley v. North Hunterdon, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>434, 449, 568 A.2d 895 (1990), the Supreme Court clearly implied that its analysis in <em>State v. Singer, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>487, 494, 472 A.2d 138, <em>cert, denied, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>832, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>121, 83 L.Ed.2d 64 (1984), applied to the LAD\u2019s provisions on attorneys\u2019 fees as well as to federal civil rights cases. In <em>Singer, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 499, 472 A.2d 138, the Court said that the lodestar \u201cmay then be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any of those factors articulated in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 <em>F.2d </em>714 (5th Cir.1974) [which parallel the requirements of <em>R.P.C. </em>1.5(a) ] and any other considerations that are deemed relevant by the court in the exercise of its sound discretion.\u201d Thus, our Court has implicitly, at least, adopted the multiplier approach to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>mine reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1. This is consistent with the Court\u2019s view that \u201cthe LAD\u2019s special procedural provisions are designed to encourage the initiation of grievances based on [unlawful] discrimination.\u201d <em>Shaner v. Horizon Bancorp, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>433, 437, 561 A.2d 1130 (1989). Attorneys\u2019 fees are one remedy recognized in <em>Shaner </em>as \u201ca special form of relief designed to encourage those who seek to vindicate the individual as well as societal interests of overcoming discrimination in the exercise of civil rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439, 561 A.2d 1130. The <em>Dague </em>6-3 majority rule of no multiplier is at odds with this purpose and conflicts with the record before us on the impact of refusal to recognize contingency of success as a fee factor where an honestly calculated lodestar is based on fair hourly compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Plaintiffs point out that one of the major concerns of the Court in <em>Dague, supra, </em>was that a contingency risk enhancement would encourage bringing non-meritorious claims as well as meritorious ones. 505 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2642, 120 L.Ed.2d at 457. As plaintiffs persuasively observe, \u201cit is almost impossible to give a thorough risk analysis assessment at the beginning of a case, before discovery has even commenced.\u201d Depositions and other discovery are often crucial to proving the case. The plaintiffs contend that the Court in <em>Dague, supra, </em>\u201cconsiders it almost a social evil that civil rights attorneys be allowed to subsidize those cases that do not succeed through awards of contingency multipliers for those cases that do prevail.\u201d In contrast, defense attorneys in civil rights actions \u201care paid whether they win or lose.\u201d As the dissent in <em>Delaware Valley II, supra, </em>expressed, enhancement for risk \u201cis designed simply to place contingent employment <em>as a whole </em>on roughly the same economic footing as noncontingent practice, in order that such cases receive the equal representation intended by Congress.\u201d 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 745-46, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3097, 97 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 611. Even with a contingent fee enhancement, an attorney obtains a fee only when the client prevails. 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 752, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3101, 97 <em>L.Ed.2A </em>at 615. \u201cAs in the private market, what a successful attorney does with earned fees is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>attorney\u2019s own business.\u201d 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 753, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3101, 97 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Justice Scalia in <em>Dague, </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2641, 120 L.Ed.2d at 456, expressed that \u201can enhancement for contingency would likely duplicate in substantial part factors already subsumed in the lodestar.\u201d He cynically said that \u201clodestar enhancement amounts to double counting.\u201d We very much doubt the accuracy of this theory when the lodestar is an honest, sum based on the prevailing hourly rates charged by efficient attorneys for noneon-tingent matters, as the lodestar before us obviously is. Of course, if the lodestar is designedly \u201cpadded\u201d to reflect contingency risks, this represents self-enhancement and that is another problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In . our view, the reasoning of the dissent in <em>Dague, supra, </em>is more in accord with the express purpose of the New Jersey LAD than the view of the majority. Judge Meehan was correct in applying it \u201cin order to achieve a fair and just result in this matter.\u201d We also conclude that the trial judge was correct in this particular case in concluding that the risk of nonpayment was not partially or substantially mitigated by the contingent fee portion of the agreement between plaintiffs and their attorneys so as to eliminate the need for a multiplier, a position taken by the dissent in <em>Delaware Valley II, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>at 749, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3099, 97 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 613. In the present case, the doubled lodestar equals $228,668.50. We have calculated that the partially contingent fee agreement executed by plaintiffs in this case provided for compensation of about $278,207 for the services rendered by counsel before judgment. (This is 25% of the recovery of $935,000 plus an hourly-rate calculation based on 50% of the median rate, or $68.75 per hour for partners and associates, times 646.65 hours.) A relatively standard one-third contingent fee would have yielded about $300,000 after expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">In <em>Blanchard v. Bergeron, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>87, 95-96, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>939, 945, 103 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>67, 76-77 (1989), the Court did not allow the sum due under a contingency agreement to constitute a limit or cap on the amount a court may award under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1988 when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>amount of damages is low. <em>See Specialized Med. Sys. v. Lemmerling, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>180, 599 A.2d 578 (App.Div.1991) (contingent fee agreement did not cap counsel fee award provided by contract in a commercial case). In <em>Venegas v. Mitchell, </em>495 <em>U.S. </em>82, 90, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>1679, 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 74, 84 (1990), also a 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1988 claim, the Court determined that the prevailing plaintiff could be required to pay his attorney the difference between the amount due under their contingency agreement and the amount the judge awarded under the statute. The Court reasoned that the statutory award of fees does not abrogate the attorney-client agreement; it \u201ccontrols what the losing defendant must pay, not what the prevailing plaintiff must pay his lawyer.\u201d 495 <em>U.S. </em>at 90, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1683, 109 L.Ed.2d at 84. Therefore, statutory awards of fees can coexist with private fee agreements. The scheme of \u00a7 1988 controls what the losing defendant must pay the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, not necessarily what the prevailing plaintiff must pay her attorney. Of course, fidelity to the client required the successful plaintiffs\u2019 attorney here first to attempt to collect her fee from the defendant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In the case before us, plaintiffs proved that a multiplier was necessary to obtain competent representation, even when the attorneys, whose affidavits plaintiffs submitted, were also free to negotiate contingency agreements with prospective clients. Further, even with the multiplier of 2.0 which the judge awarded, the fee under the agreement, half the hourly rate of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys plus twenty-five percent of the recovery, was still a larger sum by about $50,000 than the fee actually awarded by the judge. Thus, the use of the multiplier here clearly served the statutory purpose of enabling plaintiffs to obtain counsel, where plaintiffs may still be called upon to bear part of the bargained-for reasonable expense of representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in enhancing the fee in view of the evidence plaintiffs presented. Four attorneys, including an expert on attorneys\u2019 fees, certified that they and other attorneys either refused plaintiffs\u2019 employment cases on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>contingent basis altogether, or were extremely reluctant to take them. The market treats hourly fee cases far better than contingency cases. There is little meaningful compensation for contingency, so that counsel can not likely be obtained without a multiplier. <em>Delaware Valley II, supra, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>at 731-33, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3089-91, 97 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 601-03 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). Plaintiffs here proved that they had substantial difficulty finding counsel and that adjustment for risk was necessary indeed to attract competent counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The use of the multiplier also was justified in this particular case by the record when considered in light of the total fee and in relationship to the result. The statutory objective is to compel defendants who lose at trial to pay \u201creasonable attorneys fees\u201d as damages. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1. We conclude that the lodestar multiplied by two or $228,668.50 is \u201creasonable\u201d in this case. The fact that the defendant and not the plaintiffs must pay, has been determined by the Legislature as a matter of public policy. That is not our concern. Our only concern is the amount of a reasonable fee, a conclusion that ultimately is discretion-bound and fact-sensitive and not particularly suitable of reduction to a few black-letter rules. In setting an appropriate counsel fee in a fee-shifting context, Justice Handler has said: \u201c[Tjhe court must, ... exercise a fine discretion dominated by equitable considerations, understanding that \u2018[t]here is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Singer v. State, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 501, 472 A.2d 138. In fact, many of the arguments advanced against' use of fee multipliers and enhancement seem to us veiled attacks on the policy of any fee-shifting at all in discrimination cases. That policy judgment is not before us. The Legislature has decided that nonprevailing defendants must pay \u201creasonable\u201d fees to prevailing plaintiffs. We must follow its mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In their cross-appeal plaintiffs claim that the judge erred in declining to apply a multiplier for counsel\u2019s post-judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>work. The judge reasoned that \u201cplaintiffs already had their judgment and there were no longer any risks involved.\u201d Plaintiffs argue that the judge erred in looking at the risks involved in this particular case, rather than contingent fee cases as a class, pursuant to <em>Delaware Valley II, supra </em>(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring), 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 731, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3089, 97 L.Ed.2d at 601. Plaintiffs also urge that there are risks in post-trial work. <em>Delaware Valley II, supra, </em>involved only work for time spent enforcing a consent decree; the substantially reduced risk of loss at that time, as opposed to the beginning of the litigation, was a major reason why the Court held that the fee multiplier was improper. 483 <em>U.S. </em>at 730, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3089, 97 L.Ed.2d at 600. Similarly, here, although plaintiffs conceivably might have lost post-trial motions, that risk of loss was much smaller than at the outset of the case. We find no abuse of discretion in denial of the fee-multiplier at the post-verdict stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Plaintiffs also contend that the judge erred in dismissing Ren-dine\u2019s breach of contract claim and Lorestani\u2019s wage discrimination claim.

Gilian Instrument, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 500-01, 638 A.2d 1341 (App.Div.1994). The LAD does not substantially alter the common law requirements for this type of award. <em>Id. </em>at 500, 638 A.2d 1341. Thus, \u201cin order for punitive damages to be awarded [under the LAD], the defendant\u2019s conduct must have been wantonly reckless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>or malicious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501, 638 A.2d 1341 (quoting <em>Weiss v. Parker Hannifan Corp., </em>747 <em>F.Supp. </em>1118, 1135 (D.N.J.1990)). Furthermore, while the question of what conduct is wantonly reckless or malicious is one for the trier of fact, there must first be a legal foundation in the record to support a punitive damages award. <em>Catalane, supra, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 501, 638 A.2d 1341. Moreover, it is fundamental that the legal basis of a punitive damages award lies not in the particular tort committed but in defendant\u2019s motives and conduct when committing it. W. Page Keeton, <em>Prosser and Keeton, et al. on The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 2, at- p. 9-10 (5th Ed.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The conduct of defendant Pantzer was both reprehensible and actionable under the LAD. The jury so found and awarded adequate compensatory damages to plaintiffs. However, there was no evidence of malicious conduct, <em>ie., </em>that defendant\u2019s motives were to harm Rendine and Lorestani for harm\u2019s sake. The plaintiffs\u2019 proofs indicated that Pantzer\u2019s motivation was self-interest, <em>ie., </em>to save his business from what he perceived to be the cost and inconvenience of employing women of child-bearing age. Neither was there evidence of wantonly reckless conduct. The foreseeable damage to plaintiffs was the loss of employment. That injury with its financial and emotional consequences was fully redressed by the jury\u2019s compensatory damage award. Absent evidence of evil motive or defendant\u2019s reckless disregard for the consequences of his actions to others, the judge should have directed a verdict on plaintiffs\u2019 claim for punitive damages. <em>Dotson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. 2, </em>5-6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
