Hotel Keepers\u2014Loss of Baggage Presumptive Evidence of Negligence.\u2014The loss of the goods of a guest while at an inn, is presumptive evidence of negligence on the part of the inn keeper, and in case of such loss, the inn keeper can alone absolve himself from liability by showing that the loss occurred without any fault whatever on his part,, or by the fault of the guest.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b102-8\" pgmap=\"102\">2. Same\u2014Failure of Quest to Ask for Baggage Not Negligence.\u2014The mere fact that a guest does not ask for his baggage or inquire as to its safety for a period of several days after its reception by his host, the inn keeper, can not be said under such circumstances as appear in this case, to constitute negligence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b102-9\" pgmap=\"102\">3. Same\u2014When Liability for Baggage Commences.\u2014When baggage is received by an inn keeper, and the owner delivers it for the purpose of becoming a guest and soon afterward does become a guest of the hotel, the responsibility of the inn keeper for the safe keeping of the baggage will be held to have begun at its reception, even though such reception was prior to the time when the owner arrived.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b102-10\" pgmap=\"102\">4. Same\u2014Liability for Baggage Extends to Merchandise Carried by a Quest.\u2014The responsibility of an inn keeper is nos necessarily limited to such baggage as is carried for convenience of travel, but extends as well to merchandise carried by a'guest when received by the inn keeper as shown in this case.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b102-11\" pgmap=\"102\">5. Trials \u2014Instructions to Find for the Plaintiff\u2014When Proper.\u2014 Where a plaintiff makes out a clear case, and there is no defense, the trial court is warranted in instructing the jury to find for the plaintiff.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-12\" pgmap=\"102\">Transcript, from a justice of the peace. Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook County; the Hon. Richard W.

In spite of the disclaimer of Lillis, the porter persisted that they must be his boxes, and opened them in Lillis\u2019 room. Lillis disposed of part of the merchandise contained in the boxes, whereby the same was lost to appellee.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-4\" pgmap=\"103\">Appellee testified that when the boxes were delivered at the hotel he was present, and directed the porter as to caring for them. This can hardly be said to have been disputed, although the effect of Eden\u2019s testimony would be that appellee was not at the hotel and did not register until two or three hours later. It does not appear that Eden could have had knowledge as to any interview between appellee and a porter.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\" pgmap=\"103\">In this suit, brought to recover the value of the goods so lost, the trial court held that there was no evidence to establish a defense, and instructed the jury to find for appellee, the plaintiff.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-6\" pgmap=\"103\">Buruham &amp; Baldwin-, attorneys for appellants.</attorneys><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-7\" pgmap=\"103\">In Illinois, inn keepers are not insurers of their guest\u2019s property, but are excused by showing that they were in no wise negligent or that their guest was guilty of contributory negligence.

Metcalf v. Hess, 14 Ill. 129; Story on Bailments, 472.</p> <p id=\"b105-9\" pgmap=\"105\">And in case of such loss \u201c the inn keeper can alone absolve himself from liability by showing that the loss * * * occurred without any fault whatever on his part, or by the fault of the guest,\u201d etc. Johnson v. Richardson, 17 Ill. 302; Kelsey v. Berry, 42 Ill. 469.</p> <p id=\"b106-5\" pgmap=\"106\">There is no evidence in this case tending to show that the loss was either without fault of appellants, or through fault of appellee. On the contrary, it is undisputed that appellants\u2019 negligence in insisting upon a misdelivery was the cause of loss. The mere fact that a guest does not ask for his baggage or inquire as to its safety for a period of several days after its reception by his host, the inn keeper, can not be said, under such circumstances as appear here, to constitute negligence. If there was no defense the trial court was warranted in instructing the jury to find for the plaintiff. Williams v. Moore, 69 Ill. App. 618.</p> <p id=\"b106-6\" pgmap=\"106\">The relation of inn keeper and guest was established by the reception of the baggage. When the baggage was received, as here, by the inn keeper, and the owner delivered it for the purpose of becoming a guest and soon afterward did become an inmate of the hotel, the responsibility of the inn keeper for the safe keeping of the baggage will be held to have begun at its reception, even though such reception was prior to the time when the owner came personally infra hospitium. Dickinson v. Winchester, 4 Cush. 114; Sasseen v. Clark, 37 Ga. 242.</p> <p id=\"b106-7\" pgmap=\"106\">The responsibility of an inn keeper is not necessarily limited to such baggage as is carried for convenience of travel but extends as well to merchandise carried by a guest, when received by the inn keeper as here shown. Calye\u2019s Case, 8 Coke, 32; Berkshire Woolen Co. v. Proctor, 7 Cush. 428; Wilkins v. Earle, 44 N. Y. 179.</p> <p id=\"b106-8\" pgmap=\"106\">It would appear from this record that no other result could have properly obtained than that which was directed by the trial court.</p> <p id=\"b106-9\" pgmap=\"106\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
