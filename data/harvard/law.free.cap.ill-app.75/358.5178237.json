Verdict and judgment resulted in favor of appellee for the sum of $2,500.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-3\" pgmap=\"359\">At the time of the injury appellant was engaged in manufacturing upon the third, fourth and fifth stories of a building in Chicago. Appellant rented of-George 0.\" Mages, and, together with Mages, used a freight elevator in the rear of the building. It was an ordinary freight elevator, and had attached under its floor a safety apparatus, controlled by a governor, with dogs on each end of a rod, so adjusted that, whenever the elevator should be overloaded or should fall, these dogs would be thrown out, and, catching in the guide strips on either side, stop the elevator. To this rod, on the ends of which the dogs were fixed, was attached a shank which was connected at the end by a swivel movement with a rod which ran up through the floor of the elevator. By pressing down with the foot on the end of this rod the dogs were released, thus enabling the operator to release the dogs when they became set. There was no one regularly employed to run the elevator. It was used by the employes of appellant and employes of Mages whenever they had occasion to use it in the discharge of their respective duties.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-4\" pgmap=\"359(200) 360(52)\">At the time of the-injury, and for some time before, the elevator was out of repair, in that the dogs, which operated to stop the downward movement, frequently became set of their own action and without any pressure upon the lever by the operator, and in that when the car was released, if the cable was slack, the governor sometimes failed to operate to again stop its descent. This defective condition was known to appellant. Appellee was aware that at times the dogs became thus set. There was evidence to establish that appellant was made aware that as a result of the stopping of the elevator by such irregular action of the dogs, the drum upon which the cable ran sometimes kept on revolving, thus loosening some amount of the cable and leaving it slack (unless attended to and taken up); and that when the elevator was started with the cable thus slack, the governor did not always operate, as it should if in proper condition, to again set the dogs. The danger arising from starting the elevator downward with an amount of the cable thus loose and slack, while known to appellant is not shown to have been known to appellee. Appellee testified that the president of appellant, Hechinger, instructed him when the dogs became set to pound down the rod and release them. Hechinger did not \"deny this, but' testified that he also instructed appellee to first see that the cable was taut, which appellee denied.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\" pgmap=\"360\">At the time of the injury appellant had employed John Blondet, a laborer, to take up to the fourth floor certain lumber, etc. Blondet had taken a load up in the elevator and unloaded at the fourth floor. While there the dogs became set, and when Blondet attempted to start the elevator it did not move. Appellee was working near the elevator. He saw the difficulty which Blondet was having in starting the elevator and went to his assistance. There was a considerable amount of slack cable, and when appellee put his foot upon the rod and released the dogs the car started downward, the governor failed to act so as to again stop its descent, and the car fell to the basement. Blondet was killed, and appellee was injured. The drum upon which the cable turned could not be seen from the place on the fourth floor where appellee started the elevator.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-6\" pgmap=\"360\">From October 14, 1890, the date of the injury, until some time in the following December, appellee was confined to his home. There was a fracture of the right ankle and injury to the left leg. There were slight injuries to the head. The most serious injury, and the only one permanent in character, was an injury to the back. As to this, the physicians testified that the symptoms were entirely subjective, and two of them testified that from such symptoms there seemed to be an injury to the spine which was incurable.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-7\" pgmap=\"360\">The declaration alleged that at the time of the injury, appellee \u201c had occasion to use said elevator for the purpose of carrying freight,\u201d etc.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b360-8\" pgmap=\"360\">Bulklet, Gray &amp; More, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-9\" pgmap=\"360\">It is an elementary rule of law that the1 allegations and proofs must correspond in order to entitle a party suing to recover.

The operator of an elevator is a common carrier in the law, and therefore, so far as strangers are concerned, at least, he is bound to exercise the highest degree of care known to the law in its maintenance and operation. Treadwell v. Whittier, 80 Cal. 574, and cases there cited.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-4\" pgmap=\"363\">While it is possible that the same degree of care is not required in reference to the maintenance and operation of an elevator used by employes, yet a high degree of care, relatively, is required. The degree of care required of a master in furnishing tools, appliances and premises to his employes is comparative, and depends upon the character of the same and their uses in each case. The more dangerous they are, and the more certain to result in injury or loss of life in the event of a failure to provide such as are suitable and safe, the greater the degree of care exacted. Chicago A. P. B. Co. v. Sobkowiak, 38 Ill. App. 539.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-5\" pgmap=\"363\">While it is true that the defendant was required to exercise only ordinary care, yet, ordinary care implies such watchfulness and precaution as are proportioned to the dangers to be avoided, measured by the' standard of common prudence and experience.

That the danger which caused the injury was an assumed hazard.</p> <p id=\"b365-9\" pgmap=\"365\">Third. That there is a variance fatal to the judgment, in that the declaration avers that appellee was injured when he had occasion to use the elevator to carry freight, while the proof shows that he was not at the time so using it, but was merely assisting another employe of appellant in starting the empty elevator downward.</p> <p id=\"b365-10\" pgmap=\"365\">Fourth. That the trial court erred in admitting incompetent testimony, and in refusing to give the fifth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth instructions tendered by appellant.</p> <p id=\"b365-11\" pgmap=\"365\">Fifth. That the verdict is excessive.</p> <p id=\"b365-12\" pgmap=\"365(165) 366(173)\">It is uncontroverted that Hechinger, the president of appellant, instructed appellee to force down the rod to release the dogs which held the elevator whenever they became set. The fact that they did frequently become set, without direction of the operator and through the defective condition of the machinery, was known alike to appellee and appellant. There is no evidence that either of them was specially skilled in mechanism of this sort. Neither is there any evidence that appellee was informed as to the danger attending this defective condition of the machinery. There is, however, evidence that Hechinger was informed specifically .of such, danger. A witness, Duffy, testified that the elevator had fallen once before and injured a man, of which fact Hechinger knew, and that on another occasion, three or four weeks before the accident, \u201c I was on the third floor attending to my duties as shipping clerk, when a packer, shouted up the shaft for me to come down. I went down and found twenty to twenty-five feet of cable unwound from the drum, and the drum was still revolving and throwing it off. I ran to the elevator and pulled the rope and stopped it, and shouted up the shaft if there was any one on the elevator to get off, for they were liable to be killed. I made lots of noise doing so. \u00a1Next morning I had a conversation with Mr. Hechinger in reference to that. Mr. Hechinger wanted to know what I was making all that noise about yesterday afternoon, and I said I had good reason to make a noise. I said if they pounded back that dog some one surely would have been killed. He asked me how it was and I told him about the cable becoming unwound from the drum, and he kind of shook his head and said that was bad. There was nothing done after that in the way of fixing up or repairing the elevator up to the time of the accident.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b366-5\" pgmap=\"366(243) 367(26)\">Hechinger did not directly deny this statement as to the conversation. He did testify, \u201c at no time prior to the time of the accident did I know or learn of anything the matter with the elevator.\u201d The jury were warranted in discrediting this statement of Hechinger, for his previous testimony contradicted it by establishing that he did know that the safety device became set irregularly. He testified: \u201c \u00cd didn\u2019t tell him (appellee) if the dog was out to drive it in, not until he had started the elevator up to see if there was any slack of the cable, and then he could drive the dog in.\u201d Appellee testified : \u201cAll I was told was to drive in the dog when it is out. I was not told to pull the elevator upwards or downwards. I did not receive any other instructions at all. Mr. Hechinger told me, \u2018 Pound the dog in, in case it is out.\u2019 \u201d Kecheisen, the superintendent, testified : \u201c I told him (appellee) if the dogs came out or the elevator would not work, not to touch it; to notify the parties below, Mr. Mages.\u201d The jury were justified, however, in discrediting this testimony, for all the evidence showed that the irregular setting of the dogs was of so common and frequent occurrence that it would have been very strange had appellee been instructed upon each of such occasions to go to the landlord for aid. On the contrary it is undisputed that Hechinger, the president, instructed him to act\" in the matter by releasing the set dogs.</p> <p id=\"b367-4\" pgmap=\"367\">Appellee, though having knowledge of the defective condition of the machinery, yet had the right to assume, in the absence of chargeable notice to the contrary, that it was reasonably safe for him to follow the command of the master and release,the car in the manner directed. His knowledge of the defective condition did not necessarily operate to charge him with knowledge of the. dangers therefrom arising. Illinois Steel Co. v. Schymanowski, 162 Ill. 456; Bailey on Master and Servant, 184.</p> <p id=\"b367-5\" pgmap=\"367\">Hor is there any evidence in this case which necessarily operates to charge appellee with notice of the dangers which would follow the carrying out of the master\u2019s directions.</p> <p id=\"b367-6\" pgmap=\"367\">But the facts which do not necessarily operate to charge appellee, the servant, with notice of the danger, may operate to charge appellant, the master, with such notice. The obligation upon each arising from the mere knowledge of the defective condition is not alike. Illinois Steel Co. v. Schymanowski, supra.</p> <p id=\"b367-7\" pgmap=\"367\">\u201c If the machinery or premises are obviously defective, but not apparently dangerous, the master may be liable for not having taken the necessary steps to ascertain whether they were or were not in fact safe.\u201d Wood on Master and Servant, Sec. 336.</p> <p id=\"b367-8\" pgmap=\"367\">It can not, therefore, be said that the conduct of appellee was such as to establish, as a matter of law, contributory negligence upon his part. On the contrary, it was a question for the jury, with ample evidence to sustain the conclusion reached by them.</p> <p id=\"b367-9\" pgmap=\"367\">The foregoing consideration disposes also of the second point urged, viz., that the danger in question was an assumed hazard.</p> <p id=\"b367-10\" pgmap=\"367(42) 368(49)\">It surely could not be held that the defective condition of this elevator was an ordinary risk incident to the employment. Heither, if the doctrine of assumed hazard may be so applied, could it be said that the' dangers arising from this unusual defect were known or should have been known to appellee, and hence they were assumed by .him. Moreover, in conducting himself in relation to the defective apparatus, appellee followed the specific directions of the master, upon the reasonable safety of which he might properly rely:- \u2022</p> <p id=\"b368-5\" pgmap=\"368\">The' contention that the variance between declaration and proof as to what particular duty appellee was discharging when injured may be now availed of, can not be maintained. It was the-duty of appellant to call the attention of the trial court to this variance. It is not a matter which goes to appellee\u2019s right of action but merely to the particular pleadings here. Appellee might equally recover whether he was engaged in carrying freight when injured, as alleged, or engaged in aiding another in starting the elevator for the purpose of carrying freight, as proved. In either case he was in the discharge of duty and following the master\u2019s instructions. The superintendent, Kicheisen, testified: \u201c I told him (appellee) to look after the elevator, to see that there was no stranger that handled it.\u201d .This variance can not be for the first time availed of in this court; for it could have been.obviated by amendment in the trial court. Wabash, St. L. &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Coble, 113 Ill. 115; Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Clough, 134 Ill. 586; McCormick H. M. Co. v. Burandt, 136 Ill. 170.</p> <p id=\"b368-6\" pgmap=\"368\">The fifth instruction, which tells the jury, in effect, that if appellee knew that something was wrong ivith the elevator, and did not promptly cease using it, he can not recover, was properly refused. It makes no distinction between knowledge that the safety appliance worked defectively and knowledge of the dangers therefrom arising.</p> <p id=\"b368-7\" pgmap=\"368\">The tenth instruction is as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b368-8\" pgmap=\"368(62) 369(17)\">- \u201c The court' instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that plaintiff voluntarily went upon the elevator in question, without his duty calling him there, or being directed to go there by his employers, for the purpose of assisting John Blondet to handle the same, knowing that there was something wrong with the elevator, then and in that case he can not recover in this action, and your verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b369-4\" pgmap=\"369\">A jury might question, upon receiving this instruction, whether it were the going upon the elevator voluntarily, \u201c without his duty calling him,\u201d or the going with knowledge \u201c that there was something wrong with the elevator,\u201d which would bar a recovery. There being no conflict in the evidence as to the circumstances under which appellee assisted Blondet, and it being undisputed that he was acting within the line of his duty, the instruction was misleading and improper in its charge as to the former, viz., acting beyond the line of his duty, and it was erroneous in law as to the latter, viz., the effect of his knowledge of some defect. The court did not err in refusing to give it.</p> <p id=\"b369-5\" pgmap=\"369\">The eleventh instruction is as follows :</p> <blockquote id=\"b369-6\" pgmap=\"369\">\u201cIf the jury believe from the evidence in this case that the accident in question was occasioned by the carelessness or negligence of the plaintiff or of John Blondet in handling or managing the elevator in question, and not from any defect in the construction of the elevator, or in its being out of repair, of which defect or Avant of repair the defendant\u2019s officers or agents had notice or knowledge, then your A?er-dict must be for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b369-7\" pgmap=\"369\">The jury had been sufficiently charged as to the effect of appellee\u2019s negligence, if any, upon his right of recovery, by the eighth instruction. The fault of this instruction is, that it charges in effect, that if the accident was the result of the joint operation of negligence of Blondet and a defective condition of the machinery, of which appellant had no actual notice or knowledge, although perhaps chargeable with notice, yet no recovery could be had. It ivas not error to refuse to so instruct.</p> <p id=\"b369-8\" pgmap=\"369\">The tAvelfth instruction is, in part, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b369-9\" pgmap=\"369\">\u201cIf the plaintiff had the same notice or knowledge of defects in said elevator that the officers or agents of the Union Show Case Company did, and continued to use the same without objection, then he can not recover in this ease, and your verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b370-4\" pgmap=\"370\">As applied to the facts here, this is not the law, and the instruction was- properly refused. Illinois Steel Co. v. Schymanowski, supra.</p> <p id=\"b370-5\" pgmap=\"370\">It is complained that the trial court erred in admitting, over objection, certain opinion evidence.</p> <p id=\"b370-6\" pgmap=\"370\">A witness, Jollings, an elevator builder, was examined as to what the' operation of the governor would be if the elevator was dropped.by releasing the dogs when there was slack cable. No specific objection is made to any hypothetical questions put as to the facts assumed; the only objection now urged being that it was a matter readily determinable by the jury, and not calling for opinion evidence.</p> <p id=\"b370-7\" pgmap=\"370\">We think that the evidence was properly admitted. Whether the governor would in such case, if in good working order, operate to stop the oar, and within what distance it would so operate, were matters which could not be determined merely from a recital of the mechanical structure, without some special skill and knowledge of the workings of such machinery. The decisions cited by appellant are in oases where it was sought to obtain the opinion of witnesses as to the safety or danger of certain conduct or conditions, and are not in point.</p> <p id=\"b370-8\" pgmap=\"370(174) 371(92)\">Finally, it is contended that the verdict is excessive. If it could be said that the evidence did not warrant a finding that appellee bad sustained a permanent injury to the spine, it might he well urged that the sum here awarded was in excess of the loss bv reason of temporary inability to labor. But there is the testimony of appellee that he still suffers from what he describes as pain \u201c in the small of the back.\u201d He testified : \u201c I have it to-day yet; it has continued during all that time. It is not as severe now as it was then. If O I do some heavy lifting I find out afterwards it was too heavy, and I couldn\u2019t go to work the next morning, and often two or three days I have stayed home that I wasn\u2019t able to go down.\u201d His physician, Dr. Wetherle, testified : \u201c From my examination of the patient and my treatment and diagnosis, I should say that the matter with his back was a concussion of the spine. I have treated him off and on since that time. I think it is permanent. I don\u2019t think there is any cure for it,\u201d etc. Dr. Downey testified: \u201c On several occasions I tested in different ways, and satisfied myself that there was a tenderness in that particular part of the spine, etc. From my examination, I should say that the man was suffering from an injury to the spinal cord, at least he is suffering from an injury to the spine in some form,\u201d etc.</p> <p id=\"b371-4\" pgmap=\"371\">Dr. Sherwood, called by appellant, was of opinion that the facts indicated no spinal injury. We can not say that the jury were not warranted, from a fair consideration of all the evidence, in finding that there was a permanent injury; and upon such a finding the verdict would not be excessive.</p> <p id=\"b371-5\" pgmap=\"371\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
