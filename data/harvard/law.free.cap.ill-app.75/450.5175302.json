Equity Practice\u2014Where BUI Fails to Show Grounds for Equitable Interference.\u2014Whenever a court of equity is called upon to pass upon a bill, and it appears to it that on the face of the bill there is no equity in it, and no sufficient grounds disclosed in it why a court of equity should interfere, the bill will be dismissed.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b450-9\" pgmap=\"450\">S.

data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-10\" pgmap=\"451(47) 452(46)\">That as such canal commissioners they are legally vested with control and general management of the Illinois and Michigan canal, the property thereto belonging, the locks, dams and other improvements for the navigation of the Illinois and Little Wabash rivers in said State, and that such control extends upon the Illinois river from Peru, Illinois, to a point 1,000 feet below the Copperas Creek lock, and it is made their duty to cause the said canal, locks, river and appurtenances to be kept in good and sufficient repair for navigation by water.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-5\" pgmap=\"452\">That the said Illinois river, between the points aforesaid, is a navigable stream, and is appurtenant to the said canal, locks and dams composing the improvement of the Illinois and Michigan canal, and that such river between the points aforesaid is kept and maintained in a navigable condition by the said canal commissioners, who have expended, and who do now annually expend, large sums of money in keeping the channel of said river in an unobstructed condition.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-6\" pgmap=\"452\">That the receipts of the Illinois and Michigan canal for navigation thereon depend very largely upon a free and unobstructed use of the said Illinois river for navigation, between the said points, and that whatever would impede navigation between the said points would thus result in-irreparable injury to complainants.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-7\" pgmap=\"452\">That in the vicinity of the village of East Peoria, Tazewell county, Illinois, on the said Illinois river, about two miles therefrom, and between Peru and 1,000 feet below the said lock and dam at Copperas creek, the defendant, for the purpose of changing the course of Farm creek and for enlarging certain other creeks, constructing drains, ditches and levees, for the purpose of providing drainage for certain real estate in said county, is constructing and about to complete a certain artificial channel, 10,000 feet long and from 70 to 100 feet in width and of great depth, into which artificial channel it is proposed to turn the course of the said Farm creek and its tributaries, and the surface water of the surrounding country, and thereby to discharge the same into the said Illinois river, opposite the city of Peoria, at a point different and other than the natural place of discharge of the waters of said Farm creek.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-8\" pgmap=\"452(43) 453(13)\">That the said work is being performed by the said

so in process of construction, when completed will extend into the navigable channel of the river at right angles, and will discharge a vast amount of sand, soil, silt, sediment, debris and other alluvial matter into the same, and that the direct result of such discharge will be to create in the navigable channel of said stream a bank, bar or barrier, composed thereof, that will extend across the said navigable channel, and prove to be an obstruction that will prevent, retard and hinder the use of said river for the purpose of navigation, and will constitute an absolute impediment to the carrying trade of this State, for the conveyance and carrying of passengers and freight.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-6\" pgmap=\"453\">That as a result of the completion of said channel, and the discharge of the waters of said Farm creek and its tributaries, and the waters of the surrounding country, through the same into said river, as a necessary result in the time of heavy rains, in and upon the country so drained, by reason of the nature of the soil of said country, there would be conveyed through said channel and into the navigable channel of said river, in a very short time, so great a quantity of sand, soil, sediment, debris and other alluvial matter, as to prove a most serious obstruction, hindrance and impediment to the use of said river by the carrying trade of the State and to navigation thereon.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-7\" pgmap=\"453\">That as a result of the opening of said artificial channel and the discharge of the said waters therefrom into the said river, navigation, carrying trade and commerce will be obstructed, prevented and hindered by reason of a bar that will be produced in the navigable channel of said river, as above set forth.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-8\" pgmap=\"453(41) 454(49)\">That by reason of the formation of the

the complainants, by affecting the use of the Illinois and Michigan canal in connection therewith, and the additional expense that will be entailed upon them, in maintaining a navigable channel at the point aforesaid, and that said irreparable injury would be permanent in its character.</summary><summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\" pgmap=\"454\">That in the event of said

Justice Burroughs</author> <p id=\"AYU\" pgmap=\"463\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b463-10\" pgmap=\"463(89) 464(30)\">The appellant presented to the court below its bill of complaint praying among other things for a temporary injunction against the appellee, and upon that court denying the temporary injunction and dismissing the bill for want of equity appearing on the face thereof, the appellant brings the cause to this court, and urges as grounds for reversal that the court below erred in dismissing the bill without a hearing on the merits, and that as the bill with its amendment and affidavits disclosed a good cause for an injunction as prayed for, and the cross-motion to dismiss same, like a demurrer, admitted all the facts well pleaded in the bill, the court ought not to have dismissed it.</p> <p id=\"b464-5\" pgmap=\"464\">The claim made in the bill, With its amendment, is that the appellee was making and about to complete, a new channel for a stream known as \u201c Farm Creek,\u201d so as to carry the waters thereof and of its tributaries and the surrounding country through said new channel into the Illinois river, instead of allowing it to go through the natural channel as heretofore, the new point of discharge being near the appellee village; and that the effect of this change, if not prevented by injunction, would be that said waters, discharging through the new channel, would bring with it a large quantity of debris, sediment, silt, sand, soil and other alluvial mattei\u2019, and thereby create a bar in the navigable channel of said river at the said point of discharge, preventing the navigation of said river and creating a public nuisance.</p> <p id=\"b464-6\" pgmap=\"464\">There is no allegation in the bill or its amendment, that a larger quantity of water with its accompanying sand, soil, sediment, debris, or other alluvial matter, would be discharged through the new, than before flowed through the natural channel, nor any facts averred that show the obstruction to\" navigation would be any greater by reason of the discharge of the same throught the new, than was formerly occasioned by the flow through the natural channel.</p> <p id=\"b464-7\" pgmap=\"464\">The appellee, although it had answered the bill, closed the same as follows :</p> <blockquote id=\"b464-8\" pgmap=\"464\">\u201cAnd forasmuch as the said complainants have not by their said bill set out such a state of facts as in a court of equity entitles them to any relief, * * * this respondent prays that it may have the same advantage as to said bill as it might have had or taken by way of demurrer, plea or exception to the same for the many errors, uncertainties, and other imperfections therein contained.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b464-10\" pgmap=\"464(41) 465(67)\">The question of practice raised, we think, has, in this State, in the case of Winkler v. Winkler, 40 Ill. 179, and cases subsequently decided by our Supreme Court, been settled to be, that whenever the court is called upon to adjudicate upon the bill, and it appears to it that on the face of the bill there is no equity in it, and no sufficient grounds disclosed in it why a court of equity should interfere, the bill will be dismissed. Edwards v. Beaird, Breese, 70; State Bank v. Stanton, 2 Gilman, 352; Puterbaugh v. Elliott, 22 Ill. 157; March v. Mayers et al., 85 Ill. 177.</p> <p id=\"b465-4\" pgmap=\"465\">We think the main question upon which the correctness or incorrectness of the decree entered by the court below in this cause turns, is, does the bill rvith its amendment show a state of facts from which the court could see that the acts of the appellee sought to be enjoined would most likely produce the nuisance claimed ?</p> <p id=\"b465-5\" pgmap=\"465\">The admission of the facts well pleaded in the bill, by the cross-motion of the appellee, does not carry with it the admission of the inferences of those facts, or of the law as set forth in the bill by the pleader, but this court must be able to say from the law as it is, when applied to the facts well pleaded in the bill, that the effect of those facts will most likely be such that it Avould be inequitable for the court not to give the complainant equitable relief. And in considering such facts well pleaded, the court must construe the pleading most strongly against the pleader; and also consider all matters of fact which the court must take judicial notice of.</p> <p id=\"b465-6\" pgmap=\"465\">In this cause the court must take judicial notice that \u201c Farm Creek,\u201d in its natural channel, emptied its waters, and those of its tributaries and of the country drained by it, Avith all its accompanying sand, silt, and other alluvial matter, into the Illinois river at a point not very far from the point of discharge by the proposed new channel; that the actual effect thereof, while tending to form bars that disturb navigation on the river at the point of discharge, yet never totally prevented such navigation, since the river would, in times of high water especially, clean out and Avash aAAray such bars; also that the appellee is a village incorporated under the general laAV of the State, and is clothed with all the powers and authority given such municipalities by our law, under which it is thus incorporated.</p> <p id=\"b466-4\" pgmap=\"466\">We think the true rule that ought to govern courts in determining when to enjoin municipal authorities from making changes in the flow of water, so as to cause it to empty into the same natural watercourse as before, but at a different point, is that, when such authorities are, in so doing, acting in their best judgment for the benefit of their municipality, and so acting that if the work they are doing will be, when fairly considered, beneficial to such municipality, then such change of the flow of water will not be enjoined unless it will most likely produce a nuisance to those injuriously affected thereby. Hotz v. Hoyt, 135 Ill. 388, and the authorities cited therein.</p> <p id=\"b466-5\" pgmap=\"466\">Other questions are raised by counsel in their briefs and oral argument in this court, but we think that inasmuch as the bill does not aver such facts as compel the court to conclude that most likely the proposed change of the channel of Farm creek by the appellee, as set out in the bill, will cause it to carry into the Illinois river more water, sand, silt, etc., than before, we do not think the effect will most likely be as claimed, and for that reason alone, the court below was justified in dismissing the bill for want of equity appearing on its face. We therefore will not discuss or determine the other questions raised by counsel. The decree of the court below is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
