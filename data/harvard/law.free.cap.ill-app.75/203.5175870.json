At the trial a deed was introduced, made by James H. and Rachel C. Fortner, dated April 2, 1890, conveying to Robert Robinson &amp; Son certain real estate therein described, situated in the State of Kansas. The deed contains covenants of warranty, \u201c except a mortgage for six hundred dollars, and fifty-seven dollars interest on said mortgage, and the tax for 1889, which the parties of the second part assume and agree to pay.\u201d A mortgage dated October 1, 1887, conveying the same land, was then introduced, which was made by John O. F. Blachly and Jennie T. Blachlv, of Kansas, to the Anthony Loan &amp; Trust Company, securing a principal note of even date therewith for $600, payable in five years, with coupon interest notes for that period at a rate of seven per cent, but all the notes drawing interest after maturity at the rate of twelve per cent; which notes were also introduced in evidence.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\" pgmap=\"204\">The mortgage bore an assignment by the Anthony Loan &amp; Trust Company to appellee, transferring \u201c the note by the foregoing mortgage secured,\u201d and also all right, title and interest to the lands in the mortgage described. The notes bore an additional assignment executed in the company\u2019s name and under its- seal, which was signed by its secretary. The interest was computed according to the terms of the notes, at the rate of twelve per cent per annum after maturity, and judgment rendered accordingly upon the verdict. Appellants did not offer any evidence.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-7\" pgmap=\"204\">Ashcraft &amp; Gordon, attorneys for appellants.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-8\" pgmap=\"204\">James A.

Interest in excess'of the rate fixed by the statute of Illinois can not be recovered upon contracts made and to be executed in this State. It can be recovered in this State upon proper pleadings on contracts made elsewhere, where it appears that the agreement to pay such rate of interest was valid according to the law of the place where the contract was made. \u201c Where the rate of interest sought to be recovered is greater than that provided by statute where the remedy is sought to be enforced, and the law of the place of pay-meat is pleaded and proved allowing a greater interest than that where the remedy is sought, then the lex loci may be invoked to show the contract is legal, and the true interpretation of the parties framing it.\u201d Morris v. Wibaux, 159 Ill. 651; citing Sherman v. Gassett, 4 Gilm. 521.</p> <p id=\"b206-5\" pgmap=\"206\">The action in this case was assumpsit upon the common counts, to which the general issue was pleaded. \u201c The rule as laid down in the decisions is, that he who relies upon a foreign law, either to recover or to defend, must plead and prove such law as any other fact.\u201d Dearlove v. Edwards, 166 Ill. 621.</p> <p id=\"b206-6\" pgmap=\"206\">And the reason is that our courts can not judicially know what such foreign law may be. In this case the plaintiff did not seek to recover upon a contract, but for money had and received as a part of the purchase price of the real estate conveyed by the deed introduced in evidence. She sought to recover interest thereon at a rate illegal under the laws of this State, which she could only do by virtue of the laws of the State of Kansas. In order to do this she must aver and prove the foreign law upon which she relies to establish her right. Chumasero v. Gilbert, 24 Ill. 293 and 651; Morris v. Wibaux, 159 Ill. 651; Dearlove v. Edwards, 166 Ill. 621, and cases therein cited.</p> <p id=\"b206-7\" pgmap=\"206\">This she did not do, and it was error, therefore, to compute interest at the rate of twelve per cent, and instruct the jury to assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages at an amount including the excessive interest.</p> <p id=\"b206-8\" pgmap=\"206(125) 207(11)\">Objection is made that the declaration in no way informed the defendants of the character of the claim against them. After the commencement of the suit and service of summons a rule was entered upon the plaintiff to file a bill of particulars. We are not advised by the bill of exceptions that this was done. It is stated in appellee\u2019s brief to have been done, and what purports to be a copy of plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars is there set out in full, with the statement that it will be found in an additional record filed by appellee. As the bill of particulars is not a part of the record, and was not incorporated in the bill of exceptions, we can not know what information, it contained. Hess Co. v. Dawson, 149 Ill. 138.</p> <p id=\"b207-5\" pgmap=\"207\">But see Baldwin v. McClelland, 152 Ill. 54, which, except upon careful consideration, might appear to hold otherwise.</p> <p id=\"b207-6\" pgmap=\"207\">It is insisted by appellants\u2019 counsel that appellee can not maintain her action in her own name upon the clause of the deed wherein appellants \u201c assume and agree to pay\u201d the indebtedness in question. We regard the law as settled in this State to the effect that where one person makes a promise to another, based upon a valid consideration, for the benefit of a third person, such third person may maintain an action upon it in his own name, and that it is now immaterial, for the purpose of bringing the suit, whether the contract is under seal or not, by reason of the provisions of Sec. 19, Chap. 110, Rev. Stat., relating to the form of action on sealed instruments. Dean v. Walker, 107 Ill. 540; Bay v. Williams, 112 Ill. 91.</p> <p id=\"b207-7\" pgmap=\"207\">It is insisted by appellants\u2019 counsel that inasmuch as appellee seeks to recover upon a collateral contract embodied in the deed introduced in evidence, by which she alleges appellant agreed to pay the debt of another, she can not maintain her action at all upon this declaration, but must declare specially upon the contract.</p> <p id=\"b207-8\" pgmap=\"207\">The rule is that \u201c if the promise is to be considered a collateral undertaking, then the declaration should be special; but if it may be regarded as an original undertaking, then the declaration may be general.\u201d Runde v. Runde, 59 Ill. 102.</p> <p id=\"b207-9\" pgmap=\"207\">Inasmuch as there must be a new trial, we do not deem it necessary to further discuss the application of the rule in this case.</p> <p id=\"b207-10\" pgmap=\"207\">For the reasons indicated the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
