Therefore the agent of one who intends a gift inter vivos, must have performed what is incumbent on him to make the transfer complete during the donor\u2019s lifetime, otherwise the gift fails as though the donor himself had failed to make a reasonable delivery. Nor can a gift inter vivos be sustained which contemplates a postponement of delivery by the agent or trustee until the donor\u2019s decease. For a gift of personalty made after this fashion must stand, if at all, as a gift causa, nwrtis, or else on the footing of a testamentary disposition with all the formalities of a will. 2 Schouler\u2019s Personal Property, 82.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-5\" pgmap=\"505\">If delivery to a third party is simply for the purpose of delivering it to the donee as agent or messenger of the donor, the gift is not completed until actual delivery is made; until the gift is so completed the donor can revoke the agent\u2019s authority and resume possession of the gift. In such case death revokes the agency and the gift fails. 8 Am. and Eng.

If anything remains to be done to complete the gift, what so remains to be done can not be enforced, as it is based upon no consideration, and when the gift is thus incomplete there is a locus poenitentiae and the gift may be revoked.

T. Hamilton, who had been the attorney of Joseph Jennings in his lifetime; whereupon he was made a party defendant to the proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b509-11\" pgmap=\"509(56) 510(10)\">After an extended examination, the court found that a promissory note for $2,737.50, executed by J. B. Morseman to Josephine Murphy and by Josephine Murphy indorsed to Joseph Jennings, in the hands of Hamilton, with an indorsement from Joseph Jennings to Wilford Jennings, was part of the estate of Joseph Jennings, and ordered Hamilton to turn it, with $172.62 interest collected thereon, over to appellant.</p> <p id=\"b510-6\" pgmap=\"510\">It found that two notes in the possession of Hamilton, dated October 2, 1894, one for $3,310 and the other for $3,309.20, both signed by Wilford Jennings and payable to Joseph Jennings, did not belong to Joseph Jennings at the time of his death, and refused to order them to be turned over to appellant. An appeal was prosecuted to the Circuit Court of McLean County,' where the case was heard by agreement upon the same evidence, furnished by the shorthand reporter who reported the evidence in the County Court. After the hearing in the County Court the judge of that court was elected circuit judge, and was the presiding judge upon the second trial. He adhered to the views entertained by him on the first trial and pronounced the same judgment.</p> <p id=\"b510-7\" pgmap=\"510\">Appellant assigns for error the holding of the Circuit Court that the two notes executed by Wilford Jennings to Joseph Jennings were not part of the estate, and its refusal to hold that Wilford should turn over to the administrator as part of the estate, the proceeds of certain stock which Joseph Jennings held in his lifetime in Shinkle\u2019s Loan Association, and which was collected by Wilford in 1894.</p> <p id=\"b510-8\" pgmap=\"510\">Appellees assign as cross-errors the holding of the court that the note executed by J. B. Morseman was part of the estate, and ordering it to be turned over to the administrator.</p> <p id=\"b510-9\" pgmap=\"510\">We could dismiss the contention that the court erred in refusing to hold that the proceeds of the stock in Shinkle\u2019s Loan Association were part of the estate, by simply saying that this point is now made for the first time. It was not raised by any proposition for holding or otherwise.</p> <p id=\"b510-10\" pgmap=\"510\">While appellant filed a motion for a new trial in which he specified the grounds of his motion, he did not make this one of them. Where a party in a written motion in the trial court specifies the grounds for a new trial, he will, in the Appellate Court, be confined to the reasons so specified, and will be held to-have waived all causes for a new trial not so specified. Ottawa, O. &amp; F. R. V. R. R. Co. v. McMath, 91 Ill. 104.</p> <p id=\"b511-3\" pgmap=\"511\">But we prefer to approve the action of the court on this branch of the case by saying that there was no evidence offered to justify a conclusion that the proceeds of the stock belonged to the estate. The stock was given and assigned to Wilford by his father, and collected by him. long before his father\u2019s death.</p> <p id=\"b511-4\" pgmap=\"511\">We think that the court correctly held that the Horseman note belonged to Joseph Jennings at the time of his death. There is evidence showing that he intended to make a present of it to his son, but the gift was never made complete. True, he indorsed it and delivered it to his attorney, Hamilton; but it has never been delivered to Wilford. It remained in the possession of Hamilton up to the time of his death, just as we are led to conclude from the evidence that he intended it should. His death revoked the authority of Hamilton to deliver it to Wilford. To constitute a valid gift inter vimos it is essential that the thing given be actually delivered. It must take effect at once and completely. If there is not a manual delivery to the donee there must be to his agent or trustee. The donor must relinquish all present and future dominion over the subject-matter of the gift. If delivered to his agent to be subsequently delivered to the donee he may at any time before the agent acts, revoke his authority. His death before delivery revokes it. Telford v. Patton, 144 Ill. 611; McCartney v. Ridgway, 160 Ill. 129; Williams v. Chamberlain, 165 Ill. 210.</p> <p id=\"b511-5\" pgmap=\"511(110) 512(69)\">We have not experienced -much difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that the action of the Circuit Court with reference to the proceeds of the stock in Shinkle\u2019s Loan Association and the J. B. Horseman note was right. To arrive at a conclusion satisfactory to ourselves upon the contention that the court erred in holding that the two notes executed by Wilford Jennings did not belong to the estate has been fraught with some perplexity, however. It is insisted by appellees that those notes are but part of a contract between Joseph Jennings and his son for the sale of a tract of land embracing 82.74 acres which belonged to Joseph. The purchase price, they contend, was $3,200, to be paid to Emeline Larue and the children of Lucinda Janes as provided by a certain contract executed by the parties on the 2d of October, 1892, and left with Hamilton. At the same time a deed to the land was executed and delivered to Wilford. The consideration mentioned in the deed is $6,619.20, the amount of the two notes.</p> <p id=\"b512-5\" pgmap=\"512\">The contract and notes left with Hamilton are as follows :</p> <p id=\"b512-6\" pgmap=\"512\">\u201c October 2, 1894.</p> <p id=\"b512-7\" pgmap=\"512\">It is hereby agreed by and between Joseph Jennings and Wilford M.

As opposed to it are the facts that the land at the time of the conveyance was worth $80 per acre, that the consideration of $6,619.20 mentioned in the deed represented its actual value, and that the notes given in payment thereof aggregate that sum to a cent.</p> <p id=\"b513-8\" pgmap=\"513\">While it is always admissible to show that the consideration for a conveyance was different from that mentioned in the deed, yet, where notes have been executed and delivered that fixed the amount of the consideration, it would be exceedingly dangerous to allow them to be overcome by parol proof, especially when coming from the mouth of a grantee sued by the administrator of his deceased grantor. When Wilford secured the deed he paid .no cash. The purpose of executing notes was to secure the purchase money. If, at the time, Joseph Jennings intended to sell the land for less than half its value, $3,200, it is difficult for us to see why he should require his son to execute his notes for the amount of its real value.</p> <p id=\"b513-9\" pgmap=\"513\">The will mentioned in the so-called' escrow, contract was destroyed, and Joseph Jennings died intestate. There were no such bequests \u00e1s those mentioned in the will. If the construction contended for by appellees be placed on the transaction, who can bring suit against Wilford ? Certainly not the beneficiaries in contemplation.</p> <p id=\"b513-10\" pgmap=\"513(22) 514(66)\">It is contended there was no delivery of the notes. The contract speaks of the. note\u00ae as having been given by Wilford Jennings to Joseph Jennings. The fact is prominent that Hamilton had been the attorney of . Joseph Jennings for years. He was his legal adviser at that time and in this transaction. He never had been the attorney of Wilford. The papers were left with him and held by him as the attorney and agent of Joseph Jennings. We think there was a sufficient delivery.</p> <p id=\"b514-5\" pgmap=\"514\">A consideration of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction and the closing years of Joseph Jennings\u2019 life lead us to the conclusion that he sold this tract of-land to Wilford for $6,619.20; that the notes were executed and delivered to secure the purchase money and that he then attempted to make a testamentary disposition of $3,200 of them to Emeline Larue and the children of Lucinda Janes, and $3,419.20 of them to Wilford. If we are correct in that conclusion of fact, then, under the authorities already cited, the attempted disposition has failed in legal accomplishment, and the court should have ordered the notes turned over to the administrator.</p> <p id=\"b514-6\" pgmap=\"514\">The decree of the Circuit Court so far as it relates to the Horseman note is affirmed, but is reversed so far as it relates to the two notes executed by Wilford Jennings; and the case is remanded, with directions to decree that the two last mentioned notes are part of the estate of Joseph Jennings, and order them turned over to the administrator.</p> <p id=\"b514-7\" pgmap=\"514\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded with directions.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
