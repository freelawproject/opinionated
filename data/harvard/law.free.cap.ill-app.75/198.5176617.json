Evidence\u2014Additional Precautions Not Evidence of Prior Negligence.\u2014It is entirely proper for city authorities, when they learn that an accident has occurred, to take additional precautions to insure the safety of persons passing over a sidewalk, and such action can not be accepted as evidence of prior negligence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b198-7\" pgmap=\"198\">2. Cities and Villages\u2014Duty as to Sidewalls.\u2014A city is not bound to construct its sidewalks so that, when rendered slippery with snow and ice, it will be impossible for one passing over them to slip and fall; it is only bound to exercise reasonable care, so that such sidewalks shall be reasonably safe at all times to one in the exercise of reasonable care and caution thereon.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b198-8\" pgmap=\"198\">3.

Same\u2014Walking on Sidewalk Known to be in a Dangerous Condition.\u2014If a person knows a sidewalk to be in a dangerous condition when he enters upon it, he can not, in the exercise of ordinary prudence, proceed-and take his chance, and, if he shall actually sustain damage, look to the town for indemnity.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b198-10\" pgmap=\"198\">5. Same\u2014When a Question for the Jury.\u2014Ordinary care is a question for the jury when there is evidence for the jury to consider upon that point; but if there is no evidence of the exercise of ordinary care by the plaintiff, in a suit based on the negligence of the defendant, a verdict for the-plaintiff should not be allowed to stand.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-11\" pgmap=\"198\">Trespass on the Case, for personal injuries.

Plaintiff claims that these alleged defects in construction rendered the walk in question unsafe. The evidence tends to show that the slanting portion of the sidewalk upon which the accident occurred was six feet in width, with a slope fifteen feet in length, declining about two feet four inches from the upper to the lower level of the walk, and the upper level two feet ten inches above the ground. According to the testimony of the city superintendent of sidewalks, these were the actual measurements at the time of the trial, and the plaintiff testified that the incline was then the same as at the 'time of the accident, except that cleats had since been placed upon the walk.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\" pgmap=\"199\">The plaintiff had been in the habit of going over this sidewalk \u201c very often,\u201d and always went to market that way. The accident occurred about half after ten o\u2019clock in the forenoon of November 11,1894. It was a bright morning. The weather was clear and \u201c very cold.\u201d The sidewalk was covered with snow and sleet, which had fallen the night before, and which \u201c was hard, crusty-like and slippery.\u201d The plaintiff states that she was apprehensive that the walk was dangerous, and that it looked so. Her daughter preceded her down the incline, and when the plaintiff was about half way down, she slipped and fell. Throwing back her right hand as she fell, her wrist was fractured. She complains also that she was hurt internally, causing weakness. The jury found a verdict in her favor, upon which the trial court entered judgment, and the city appeals.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-6\" pgmap=\"199\">Miles J.

Where the sidewalk is properly constructed and the injuries are caused by the slippery condition produced by the prevailing storms of . the season, there should be no liability on the municipality. Village of Gibson v. Johnson, 4 Brad. 288; City of Macomb v. Smithers, 6 Brad. 470; City of Chicago v. Bixby, 84 Ill. 82. The slipperiness of a sidewalk, occasioned by ice or snow, not being accumulated so as to cause an obstruction, is not such a defect as will make the city liable for damages occasioned thereby. City of Chicago v. McGiven, 78 Ill. 347; City of Aurora v. Parks, 21 Ill. App. 459; Stanton v. City of Springfield, 12 Allen, 566; Cook v. City of Milwaukee, 24 Wis. 270.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-4\" pgmap=\"200\">Plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in attempting to pass over a sidewalk with which she was familiar, and which she saw and knew to be in a dangerous condition, from ice, snow and other causes.

Village of Carterville v. Cook, 129 Ill. 152, 29 Ill. App. 495; City of Chicago v. Gallagher, 44 Ill. 295.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-7\" pgmap=\"200(113) 201(14)\">Even if a traveler knows of a defect or danger in the sidewalk, he is not compelled to take to the center of the street, or to the opposite side of the street, or to go around by way of some other street. He has a right to travel over any and all streets, provided, however, if he knows of a dangerous spot or place, if he undertakes to pass over it, he must exercise ordinary care and care commensurate with the known danger. Failing to exercise such care, he is barred from a recovery; if he exercises such care he may recover. City of Aurora v. Hillman, 90 Ill. 61; Village of Clayton v. Brooks, 150 Ill. 97; City of Bloomington v.

Appellee and her daughter, who was with her when the accident' occurred, had gone OArer this same sidewalk in safety very often prior to that time. They always went to market that way. There is no evidence tending to show that the incline was of such grade or so constructed as to be unsafe under ordinary conditions. One witness testifies, on redirect examination by appellee\u2019s counsel, that she saw a lady fall there the summer before', at a time when it was muddy and after a rain. But there is no evidence tending to show that the grade of the incline was such as to be unsafe, unless we should be prepared to hold that any inclination whatever in a sidewalk is in itself evidence of negligent construction. Appellee\u2019s counsel suggest that it is a significant fact that after this accident the city caused cleats to be placed upon this walk. It was certainly proper, when the city authorities learned that an accident had occurred, to take additional precautions to insure safety under any conditions; but such action is no evidence of prior negligence, unless, as before stated, we are prepared to hold that any inclination in a sideivalk is necessarily unsafe, and is of itself sufficient proof of negligence. In the absence of proof of negligence in the construction or grade of the incline, or of evidence tending to show that a railing was reasonably necessary by reason of anything dangerous in the character or gradation of the incline, there is not sufficient evidence to sustain the declaration. Appellant was not bound to construct its sidewalk so that when rendered slippery with snow and ice it would be impossible for one passing over it to slip and fall. It must exercise reasonable care, so that such sidewalk shall be reasonably safe at all times to one in the exercise of reasonable care and caution thereon. City of Chicago v. Bixby, 84 Ill. 82; City of Macomb v. Sraithers, 6 Brad. 470; City of Aurora v. Parks, 21 Ill. App. 459; City of Chicago v. McGiven, 78 Ill. 347.</p> <p id=\"b202-5\" pgmap=\"202\">There .is no evidence that in this case the city has failed to exercise such care.</p> <p id=\"b202-6\" pgmap=\"202\">Appellant had passed over this incline frequently before the accident. She says she had been apprehensive of danger to herself in passing over it at other times when there was no snow there. She saw that the snow was \u201c hard, crusty-like and slippery,\u201d when about to pass over it the day the accident occurred. Under these circumstances and with full knowledge of the situation, she chose to take the chances of a fall. A party has no right to knowingly expose himself to danger, and then recover damages for an injury which he might have avoided by the use of reasonable precaution. Lovenguth v. City of Bloomington, 71 Ill. 238.</p> <p id=\"b202-7\" pgmap=\"202\">There is no evidence of any special precaution haying been taken by appellee, such as her knowledge of the danger would reasonably require. \u201c It is settled that if a person knows a way to be dangerous when he enters upon it, he can not, in the exercise of ordinary prudence, proceed and take his chance, and if he shall actually sustain damage, look to the town for indemnity.\u201d Wilson v. City of Charleston, 8 Allen, 137; cited in City of Sandwich v. Dolan, 133 Ill. 181.</p> <p id=\"b202-8\" pgmap=\"202\">Ordinary care is a question of fact for the jury when there is evidence for the jury to consider upon that point. There is no such evidence in this case.</p> <p id=\"b202-9\" pgmap=\"202\">For the reasons indicated the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
