Having considered the motion for summary judgment, response, reply, exhibits, and applicable law, the court is of the opinion that Centauri's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 12) should be GRANTED with regard to the duty to defend and DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE with regard to the duty to indemnify. The motion for leave to file a supplemental reply (Dkt. 17) should be GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a dispute regarding insurance coverage. Centauri is seeking a declaration that it does not have a duty to defend or indemnify Zachary Hansen, Christine Hansen, or Daniel Hansen (collectively, \"the Hansens\") in an underlying state lawsuit (\"underlying suit\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 12-1. The Hansens have a homeowners insurance policy (\"policy\") through Centauri. Dkt. 12-3. The relevant part of the policy provides that Centauri will defend the Hansens in suits brought against them for damages as a result of \"bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the underlying suit, Caleb Del Real claims that the Hansens, among others, are responsible for his mental anguish, emotional pain, humiliation, and need for medical care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Del Real alleges that members of his swim team,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   including Zachary Hansen, created chat groups with the sole purpose of bullying Del Real due to his disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Del Real contends that members of his swim team used the chat rooms to send \"vulgar, harassing, racist, sexual and obscene messages\" as well as obscene memes using Del Real's image.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Del Real alleges that his coach, at the behest of Del Real's mother, spoke to the parents of all of the swimmers involved.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. These parents included Daniel Hansen and Christine Hansen, the parents of Zachary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Del Real states a number of claims in his complaint, but he only names the Hansens in his negligence, gross negligence, defamation, and libel claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49-50. The Hansens generally deny all allegations made against them in the underlying suit. Dkt. 12-3 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Hansens demanded that Centauri provide a defense and indemnify them against the claims made in the underlying suit. Dkt. 1 \u00b6 10; Dkt. 2 \u00b6 10. Centauri, while reserving all rights pending a judicial determination with respect to coverage, has agreed to provide a defense in the underlying suit. Dkt. 1 \u00b6 11; Dkt. 2 \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the instant suit, Centauri is seeking a declaration that it does not have a duty to defend or indemnify the Hansens in the underlying suit. Dkt. 1 at 6-7. Centauri filed a motion for summary judgment seeking a determination that the alleged conduct is not covered under the liability coverage portion of the Hansen's homeowners policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The relevant section of the Hansens' Homeowners Form B policy from Centauri is Section II-Liability Coverage. Dkt. 12-3 at 9. Within that section is the following description of Coverage C (Personal Liability): \"If a claim is made or a suit is brought against an\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     insured\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   for damages because of\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     bodily injury\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     property damage\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   caused by an\n   <strong>\n    occurrence\n   </strong>\n   to which this coverage applies, we will\" indemnify the insured against damages and provide a defense to the suit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Section II-Exclusions states, however, that Coverage C (Personal Liability) \"does not apply to: b.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     bodily injury\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     property damage\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   which is caused intentionally by or at the direction of the\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     insured\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The policy provides definitions for the bolded and underlined terms. The term \"insured\" means the \"[policyholder] and residents of [the policyholder's] household who are: a. [policyholder's] relatives; or b. other persons under the age of 21 and in the care of any person named above.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. \"Bodily injury\" is defined as \"bodily harm, sickness or disease. This includes required care, loss of services and death that results.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, an \"occurrence\" is \"an accident, including exposure to conditions, which results in\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     bodily injury\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     property damage\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   during the policy period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The rule does not allow the court to infer a physical manifestation where none has been pled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In that context, the court finds it impossible to agree with the Hansens' contention that Del Real's request for damages for medical care \"naturally leads\" to the conclusion that there is an unpleaded physical manifestation of his emotional injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, as the Hansens themselves point out, it is just as likely that the medical care was for solely mental injuries absent any physical manifestation. Dkt. 14 at 6. Additionally, considering the policy only covers \"required care ...\n   <em>\n    that results\n   </em>\n   \" from bodily\n   injury, the court finds it difficult to accept that medical care implies a bodily injury. Dkt. 12-3 at 3 (emphasis added). If all medical care necessarily implied bodily injury, then the qualification that it must \"result\" from bodily injury to be covered would be meaningless. Therefore, the fact that Del Real sought damages for medical care \"naturally leads\" to nothing in particular. The court concludes that Del Real's claims for damages for medical care are insufficient to constitute a claim for bodily injury as described in the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While the Hansens only argued that Del Real pleaded bodily injury by seeking damages for medical care, Centauri has a duty to defend if \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   claim asserted in the pleading is potentially within the policy's coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Federated Mut.

DP Eng'g, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923839\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/423/#p431\">\n    827 F.3d 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 431 (5th Cir. 2016) ). If the jury finds that there were unpleaded physical manifestations of mental anguish, for example, that may change the duty to indemnify calculus. Because facts not alleged in Del Real's complaint may develop at trial, the court finds that the duty to indemnify issue is not yet ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Centauri contends that because Del Real's claims arose from the Hansens' intentional acts, they were not, therefore,\n   caused by a covered \"occurrence,\" as defined by the policy. Dkt. 12-1 at 7. In response, the Hansens argue that Del Real also alleges conduct that was negligent, grossly negligent, and reckless. Dkt. 14 at 9. The Hansens contend that this conduct is inherently not intentional, and thus constitutes an \"occurrence\" under the policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The court finds it unnecessary to decide whether Del Real's claims constitute an \"occurrence.\" The duty to defend was negated because Del Real failed to plead bodily injury in the underlying suit. This fact does not negate any possibility that Centauri will have a duty to indemnify the Hansens because additional facts may develop at trial. Therefore, the court finds that the issue is not justiciable until the underlying suit has been resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Upon resolution of the underlying suit, the parties can move this court for a final determination on the issue of indemnity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Motion for Leave to File a Supplemental Reply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Centauri moves for leave to file a supplemental reply, which includes Del Real's answers to interrogatories regarding Christine and Daniel Hansen. Dkt. 17-2. The Hansens failed to file a response. Pursuant to the Local Rules of the Southern District of Texas, \"failure to respond is taken as a representation of no opposition.\" S.D. Tex. L.R. 7.4. Therefore, the motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   However, Del Real's answers do not negate the duty to indemnify. The interrogatory requested that Del Real identify damages sustained as a result of Daniel and Christine Hansen's actions. Dkt. 17-2 at 2. Del Real's answers indicate that he suffered \"intense mental and emotional pain and anguish\" as a result of their conduct. Dkt. 17-2 at 2. Del Real does not mention bodily injury. These responses do not foreclose all possibility that facts will develop at trial showing that Del Real indeed suffered from a physical manifestation of his emotional injuries. Moreover, Del Real may supplement the responses prior to trial. In addition, Del Real's answers do not address his injuries stemming from Zachary's conduct. For these reasons, the court still finds it prudent to wait until the conclusion of the underlying suit to rule on indemnity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Centauri has no duty to defend the underlying suit. Centauri's duty to indemnify is not yet justiciable. Thus, Centauri's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 12) is GRANTED with regard to the duty to defend and DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE with regard to the duty to indemnify. The motion for leave to file a supplemental reply (Dkt. 17) is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The case,\n    <em>\n     Caleb del Real v.
