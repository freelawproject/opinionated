No. 35\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   PHYLLIS J. HAMILTON, United States District Judge\n   Defendant Facebook, Inc.'s (\"Facebook\") motion to dismiss came on for hearing before this court on February 13, 2019. Plaintiffs Raymond Long and his corporation, Bandha Yoga Publications, LLC (\"Bandha LLC,\" together with Long, \"plaintiff\") appeared through their counsel, Barry Coburn and Ross Libenson. Facebook appeared through its counsel, Joseph Gratz. Having read the papers filed by the parties and carefully considered their arguments and the relevant legal authority, and good cause appearing, the court hereby GRANTS defendant's motion, for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a copyright infringement action brought by plaintiff against defendants Facebook and \"Tammy Dorset,\" who is a computer hacker and whose true identity remains unknown. Dkt. 27, First Amended Complaint (the \"FAC\"), \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is an expert on yoga and the effects of yoga poses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. He owns copyrights to Bandha Yoga and \"directly, or through Bandha LLC, holds exclusive rights to its related publications, including books[,]\" articles, videos, and other interactive media.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. The infringing material at issue in this case comes from his copyrighted books and anatomical illustrations (the \"Scientific Keys Illustrations\"). FAC \u00b6\u00b6 15-18. Plaintiff also operates an online blog, the Daily Bandha, that contains some of his protected material.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Facebook allows individual and business users to create pages on Facebook's online platform.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Plaintiff established and runs a Facebook business page called \"Bandha Yoga-The Scientific Keys (the \"Bandha Yoga page\" or the \"page\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24. Like all Facebook business pages, the Bandha Yoga page has password-protected administrative access.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff does not dispute that he agreed to Facebook's Terms of Service (the \"ToS\"). In fact, the FAC relies on the ToS's statement that it \"employ[s] dedicated teams around the world ... to detect misuse of [Facebook's] Products [and] harmful conduct[.] ... If [Facebook] learn[s] of content or conduct like this, [Facebook] will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing content, blocking access to certain features, [or] disabling an account[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32; FAC, Ex. 1 (Facebook's ToS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about May 24, 2015, Dorset accessed the Bandha Yoga page and changed the administrative passwords, establishing him or herself as the administrator and locking out plaintiff. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 38, 40. Dorset used the page to misuse plaintiff's copyrighted material, including the Scientific Key Illustrations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. Dorset posted plaintiff's copyrighted images to the Bandha Yoga page and configured those posts so that \"when a user clicked on the copyrighted material, [the user] would be redirected to a website that closely resembled Dr. Long's blog.\" FAC \u00b6 36. The fake blog contained pornographic advertisements and attempted to install malicious malware on the user's device.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Between May 24 and June 1, 2015, Dorset continued to post copyrighted material with embedded links on the Bandha Yoga page. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Between May 24, 2015, and June 1, 2015, plaintiff sent a series of emails to Facebook, stating that the Bandha Yoga page had been hacked, that plaintiff was the rightful owner of the page, and that the hacker was posting copyright-infringing materials. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 42, 44-46, 51-53, 57, 65-76. Some of plaintiff's emails to Facebook stated that the email constituted \"official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ('DMCA').\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 45-46; Dkt. 35-1, Ex. 1. At least two other emails, sent on May 26th and May 28th, invoked the same section and attached over 100 screenshots of copyrighted material Dorset had posted on the Bandha Yoga page. Dkt. 35-2, Ex. 2; Dkt. 35-3 Ex. 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 24, 2015, Facebook responded to plaintiff's initial emails, stating, inter alia, that \"if your submission contains a report of alleged infringement/violation of your legal rights, no further action is necessary. We will look into your matter shortly.\" Ex. 4 at 6. The next business day, May 26, 2015, Facebook sent another email that sought to clarify whether plaintiff was making an intellectual property claim or writing about a page administration issue. Ex. 2 at 2; FAC \u00b6 69. Over the next several days, plaintiff and Facebook continued to exchange emails about those issues. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 68-85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 1, 2015, five business days after Dorset hacked plaintiff's Facebook page, Facebook restored plaintiff's administrator status to the page. Ex. 4. Though plaintiff is now suing Facebook for its conduct during that five-business-day period, plaintiff does not dispute that that solution resolved the alleged infringement occurring on Facebook's platform. FAC \u00b6 89; FAC Ex. 2 (plaintiff stating \"This issue can be quickly resolved by restoring me as administrator of page.\"); Ex. 4 at 5 (similar).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on the above conduct, plaintiff asserts fourteen causes of action. Facebook moves to dismiss the seven causes of action asserted against it: (i) Copyright infringement under the Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501 ; (ii) contributory copyright infringement under the Copyright Act; (iii) vicarious copyright infringement under the Copyright Act; (iv) negligence; (v) aiding and abetting; (vi) breach of contract; and (vii) violation of California's Unfair Competition Law (the \"UCL\"), \u00a7 17200 et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The DMCA's Safe Harbors Shield Facebook From Copyright Infringement Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   There are two principal features of the DMCA. First, the DMCA created a \"notice and takedown protocol,\" through which a copyright owner who suspects that his or her copyright is being infringed may notify the service provider of potential infringing activity occurring on its network.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rossi v.

Facebook responds that plaintiff's notices were not compliant-thus obviating the need for Facebook to act at all-and that, in any event, Facebook acted expeditiously in response to the notices.

Plaintiff has also failed to (and cannot) state a breach of contract claim,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    FAC \u00b6\u00b6 175-180 (cause of action 13), because Facebook's ToS does not specify the time period within which Facebook was required to act and plaintiff alleges Facebook acted within five business days, a \"reasonable time\" under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201657\">\n     Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1657\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because the court finds that further amendment of those causes of action against Facebook would be futile, they are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. Plaintiff has also failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim under California's Unfair Competition Law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    FAC \u00b6\u00b6 181-184 (cause of action 14). That cause of action is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Any amended complaint shall be filed no later than March 22, 2019. No new parties or claims may be added without leave of court. By the same date, plaintiff shall file a statement that indicates how he intends to proceed against the Dorset defendant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <strong>\n     IT IS SO ORDERED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-69\">\n     Plaintiff also fails to state a direct, contributory, or vicarious copyright claim against Facebook because plaintiff only alleges that Facebook failed to remove the content as fast as plaintiff would have liked.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Perfect 10, Inc. v.
