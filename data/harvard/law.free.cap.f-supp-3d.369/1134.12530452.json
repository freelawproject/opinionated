ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The facts of this case are well known to the parties and need not be repeated at length here. In this class action, plaintiffs claim defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   , by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , allegedly paying excessive recordkeeping fees to Fidelity Management Trust Company (\"Fidelity\"), the designated recordkeeper and trustee for defendant Oracle Corporation's 401(k) plan (\"the Plan\"). To buttress that contention, plaintiffs proffer the expert opinion of Michael Geist, formerly with T. Rowe Price's Retirement Plan Services division, who presently runs his own consulting business specializing in the retirement plan, recordkeeping, and asset management industries. While employed by T. Rowe Price in a series of senior level roles over ten years, Mr. Geist purports to have gained experience with,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , pricing and bidding proposals for recordkeeping services for large defined contribution plans. (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def. Motion App.\n   </strong>\n   , Exh. B \u00b6\u00b6 5-10 at 6-9 &amp; Exh. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Based on this experience, Mr. Geist opines defendants failed adequately and appropriately to monitor the compensation paid to Fidelity for its recordkeeping and administrative services and thus paid excessive fees during the class period. More specifically, he suggests a reasonable range of fees for such services during various years of the class period between $ 17 and $ 29 an hour. In addition, he concludes defendants' failure to put its recordkeeping services out to bid constitutes a breach of the Plan's fiduciary duties under ERISA. Defendants seek to exclude these opinions. While I agree as to Mr. Geist's opinion as to what constitutes a reasonable\n   fee, I find the second, regarding whether the Plan breached its fiduciary duty, admissible within appropriate boundaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   There is no question but that Mr. Geist possesses impressive credentials and extensive experience in a relevant field. It may be that he could provide cogent testimony which would inform the court's understanding of whether defendants breached their ERISA duties with regard to the per-participant fees paid to Fidelity. Nevertheless, his opinion in this regard falters because the relevant methodology by which he reached his conclusions remains undisclosed, making it impossible to conclude whether this opinion is reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its role as gatekeeper, the court must \"assess the reasoning and methodology underlying the expert's opinion, and determine whether it is both ... valid and applicable to a particular set of facts.\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Dodge v.

In support, counsel forwarded a \"summary spreadsheet\" allegedly based on these forms which Mr. Geist purportedly used to refresh his recollection in an unrelated case and which counsel averred was \"consistent with [Mr. Geist's] opinions in this case[.]\" (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Conspicuously absent from this production and its provenance, however, is any\n   indication that Mr. Geist\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   relied on such information in arriving at his opinion in this case. More than that - Mr. Geist testified at his deposition that he\n   <em>\n    disagreed\n   </em>\n   with defendants' expert's opinion to the extent it relied on these same forms, characterizing such an approach \"a completely unreliable way to determine what the recordkeeping fee for a particular plan is.\" (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , Exh.

Mr. Geist defines his relevant field of expertise as being in the areas of \"revenue sharing, retirement plan pricing structures, recordkeeping fees, and recordkeeping fee equalization solutions as well as comprehensive business process optimization and governance in the sales, service, marketing, and finance functions of the distribution of asset management services through retirement plans.\" (\n   <strong>\n    Def. Motion App.\n   </strong>\n   , Exh. B \u00b6 4 at 5.) Nothing in that recitation necessarily or obviously evinces any special familiarity with how ERISA is interpreted or applied, either generally or in context. Because his qualifications to offer such an opinion have not been adequately established, they are properly excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Nevertheless, Mr. Geist avers also that his testimony as to the \"best practices a prudent fiduciary would follow in establishing, monitoring and overseeing the recordkeeping and administrative fees charged to a 401(k) plan\" is based in part on his experience in the industry. (\n   <strong>\n    Def. Motion App.\n   </strong>\n   , Exh. C \u00b6 52 at 17-18.) To the extent his opinions regarding prudent practices are based on his familiarity with industry standards and practices, those opinions do not offend the rule of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sprecht\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and are admissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This distinction is more than merely semantic. An opinion that defendants breached their duties under ERISA leaves no room for the factfinder to do its job but essentially directs judgment in plaintiffs' favor. By contrast, testimony that defendants' actions were not prudent by the standards of the industry and in the more prosaic usage of that term allows room for argument and proof\n   that the duty of prudence under ERISA may be informed by other considerations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nor can there be any doubt that Mr. Geist is qualified to offer such opinions. Defendants challenge Mr. Geist's qualifications because his experience is as a vendor of retirement plan recordkeeping services, not as a plan fiduciary or advisor to a plan fiduciary. This argument construes the permissible bounds of the relevant inquiry too narrowly. Although an expert's qualifications must be specific to the topic as to which he would offer testimony,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lippe v.
