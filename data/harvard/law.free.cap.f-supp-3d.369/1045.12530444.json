(Doc. 216 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   TransCanada asks that the Court exclude preparatory activities defined in Paragraph 18 of the Ramsay Declaration. (Doc. 216-1.) Paragraph 18 sets forth activities including the following: cultural, biological, civil and other surveys; preparation of off-right-of-way pipe storage and contractor yards; transportation, receipt and off-loading of pipe at off-right-of-way storage yards; preparation of sites for off-right-of-way worker camps; and mowing and patrolling areas of the right-of-way to discourage migratory bird nesting. The activities also include maintaining security at project sites to ensure public safety and maintaining environmental protections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. Plaintiffs do not argue that cultural, biological, civil and other surveys should be enjoined. Plaintiff Indigenous Environmental Network further does not contest maintain security at project sites.

Plaintiffs argue that irreparable harm will occur in the form of environmental harm, and a \"biased NEPA process.\" (Doc. 229 at 19.) Plaintiffs argue that allowing the Paragraph 18 preconstruction activities to proceed would perpetuate \"bureaucratic momentum\" that would discourage other federal agencies from rejecting the project or altering its route to account for revised environmental review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court in\n   <em>\n    Colorado Wild Inc. v.

The district court later granted a preliminary injunction to halt the construction activity. The district court reasoned that the injury threatened did not involve merely ground-breaking disturbance. The district court recognized also the risk that the \"bureaucratic momentum\" created by the activities would bias the agencies NEPA analysis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5584575\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/523/1213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5584575\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/523/1213/\">\n    at 1220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Fourth Circuit agreed that the Department of Navy (\"Navy\") had had failed to comply with NEPA in its decision to construct a landing field in North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n    at 180-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit continued its review, however, to include an analysis of the scope of the injunction ordered by the district court. The district court had issued a sweeping injunction that prohibited the Navy \"from taking\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   further activity associated with the planning, development, or construction\" of an air field without first complying with its obligations under NEPA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n    at 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Navy asserted five areas of activities that should not have been enjoined.

The studies would take over a year to complete and admittedly would go beyond the requirements of NEPA to include more intensive studies of the Navy's preferred site.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Navy next sought to undertake activities preliminary to land acquisition.

These purchases would include existing purchase agreements that had been held in abeyance and some new agreements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The fourth area of activity involved architectural and engineering work necessary for the planning and design of the air field.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the Navy requested permission to apply for permits that would be necessary before breaking ground on the project.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Fourth Circuit narrowed the injunction on appeal. The Fourth Circuit concluded that neither the site-specific activities, nor a \"bureaucratic steamroller\" would irreparably harm the plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n    at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit reasoned that the five activities identified by Navy \"do not include cutting even a single blade of grass in preparation for construction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n    at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The activities approved in\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Audubon Soc'y\n   </em>\n   sound similar to the activities in Paragraphs 16 and 17 of the Ramsay Declaration and previously authorized by this Court. (Doc. 222.) For example, Paragraph 16 discusses \"detailed project engineering and conducting the extensive planning and related office work.\" (Doc. 216-1 at 6.) Paragraph 16 also includes \"submitting reports and other administrative actions required to maintain compliance with valid state and local permits.\" None of these activities fall within the scope of the Court's previous Summary Judgment Order. (Doc. 211.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The same reasoning applies to the activities proposed in Paragraph 17 (Doc. 216-1 at 6-7.) TransCanada seeks to \"engag[e]\" with external parties to pursue shipping contracts, pursue needed permits, \"interfac[e]\" with landowners and acquiring necessary land rights, \"acquir[e]\" pipe and materials, \"inspect[ ] and refurbish[ ]\" work camp modules and pipe, \"engag[e]\" with communities and various governmental entities, and \"hir[e]\" project staff and contractors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These non-construction activities comport with the activities authorized by the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Audubon Soc'y\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n    422 F.3d at 205-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and previously approved by this Court. (Doc. 222.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This same reasoning applies to efforts identified by TransCanada in Paragraph 18 to conduct \"cultural, biological, civil and other surveys.\" (Doc. 216-1 at 7.) The Fourth Circuit approved efforts to undertake site specific wildlife assessments that went beyond the requirements of NEPA to include more intensive studies of the Navy's preferred site.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Audubon Soc'y\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/\">\n    422 F.3d at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . TransCanada may proceed with these type of preconstruction surveys. Nothing in the Court's original order on Summary Judgment (Doc. 211) or this Order, limits the ability of TransCanada to engage in \"design, planning, and permit application[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The remaining preconstruction activities proposed by TransCanada in Paragraph 18 generally differ, however, from those authorized by the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Audubon Soc'y\n   </em>\n   .

TransCanada cites jobs related to preconstruction activities, the potential of missing the 2019 construction season, and financial injury. TransCanada argues that preconstruction activities represent almost 700 American jobs. TransCanada further argues that delay in the project construction would result in lost earnings of approximately $ 949 million. Finally, TransCanada argues that delay in the construction schedule will impact contracts it has with third parties. (Doc. 216-1.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Plaintiffs point to the temporary and self-inflicted nature of TransCanada's hardships. Plaintiffs argue further that environmental concerns outweigh TransCanada's alleged economic harms.
