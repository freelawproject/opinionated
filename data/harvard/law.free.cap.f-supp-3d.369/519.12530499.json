Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Wallenius argues that the helicopter should be considered a \"package\" under COGSA or, in the alternative, if the helicopter were viewed as a \"good[ ] not shipped in [a] package[ ],\" a single CFU. Either way, Wallenius contends that COGSA limits Bristow's recovery from Wallenius for the damage sustained to the entire helicopter to $ 500. Bristow counters that the helicopter should be regarded not as a package or a single CFU but as a bundle of CFUs. Specifically, Bristow argues, the relevant CFU is the revenue ton, the unit used to calculate the helicopter's freight. Thus, Bristow argues, COGSA sets a liability limit measured by the number of revenue tons of the helicopter, multiplied by $ 500. Bristow represents, based on the bill of lading, that the helicopter is 196.657 revenue tons. Pl. Mem. at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court concludes, with Wallenius, that regardless whether the helicopter is measured by package or by CFU, COGSA limits the damages sustained to it during loading to $ 500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The initial question is whether the helicopter here qualifies a \"package\" under COGSA. On the facts at hand, this is not a conclusive call. Although \"package\" has an intuitive vernacular meaning, the Second Circuit has held that, under COGSA, \"package\" is a term of art. As used in COGSA, the term \"package\" can \"be said to define a class of cargo, irrespective of size, shape, or weight, to which some packaging preparation for transportation has been made which facilitates handling, but which does not necessarily conceal or completely enclose the goods.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Aluminios Pozuelo Ltd. v.

Illimani S.A. v. M/V POPI P\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541739\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/929/89/#p94\">\n    929 F.2d 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94 (2d Cir. 1991). In\n   <em>\n    Seguros\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that a bill of lading column listing \"NO. OF PKGS.\" unambiguously contemplated the shipped items (bundles of 600 steel ingots) as packages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541739\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/929/89/#p94\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, where the text of a bill of lading leaves unstated or ambiguous whether a shipped item is a \"package,\" a court must \"look elsewhere in the bill of lading and to other evidence of the parties' intentions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541739\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/929/89/#p94\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the relevant bill of lading column lists \"No. of units\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   packages.\" JSF Ex. B (emphasis added). In other words, it does not commit between the two. It is therefore facially ambiguous as to whether the appropriate measure is a \"unit,\" presumably a CFU, or a \"package.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Some insight is yielded elsewhere in the bill of lading, which defines \"[p]ackage.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JSF Ex. C. As used there, \" '[p]ackage' means the largest means used to prepare cargo for transportation, including but not limited to, a skid, pallet, Container, trailer or carton.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541739\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/929/89/#p94\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Wallenius argues that the tow bar used to load the helicopter here is analogous to one of the listed means, namely a trailer, and that the helicopter should therefore be treated as a package.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 12-13. Bristow counters that the tow bar is not an \"integral part of the cargo unit.\" Pl. Mem. at 14. Rather, Bristow argues, it is distinguishable from the listed means and more analogous to \"a cargo hook or a forklift.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541739\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/929/89/#p94\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As to the application of the term \"package\" here, Wallenius relies on\n   <em>\n    Insurance Company of North America v. M/V XIANG HE\n   </em>\n   , 89 Civ. 184 (MJL),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1990%20WL%20121587\">\n    1990 WL 121587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, 1990). It held that a helicopter attached to an open flat rack container constituted a \"package\" under COGSA. But that case is readily distinguishable. The court there placed interpretive weight on the fact that the bill of lading listed the flat container to which the helicopter was secured as the \"Kind of Package( ).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The bill of lading here, in contrast, does not contain such language as to the tow bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   More convincing is Wallenius' analogy to yachts on cradles. The phenomenon of the \"dropped yacht\"-in which a yacht, while being loaded or unloaded from a vessel, is dropped from its cradle and damaged-appears to present a recurrent COGSA problem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SNC S.L.B. v.

Reply at 4. Bristow counters that a yacht in a cradle is distinguishable from the helicopter with the tow bar here because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [W]hen a yacht is shipped in a cradle, the cradle becomes an integral part of the cargo unit, it is used to fasten the yacht to a device so as to allow it to be loaded and placed aboard the vessel without the yacht tipping over on it's [sic] keel. The tow bar clearly does not serve the same purpose in this case, for the helicopter sits upon its landing gear, not the tow bar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Pl. Mem. at 14. As between these arguments, the Court finds Wallenius's stronger. The Court is unpersuaded by the distinction that Bristow urges between what the vehicle (yacht or helicopter) sits upon. To the extent that both cradle and tow bar are specialized pieces of equipment used to carefully maneuver an awkwardly shaped vehicle onto a vessel, the cradle analogy is apt. This supports viewing the helicopter here as a \"package\" rather than as a good or set of goods not shipped in packages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court's assessment that the helicopter is best viewed as a \"package\" is not, however, decisive here. That is because, even if the Court had found, with Bristow, that the proper measure was a CFU, the Court would have found that the helicopter constitutes only one CFU. That outcome is clear from the face of the bill of lading. Under \"No. of units or packages,\" and alongside the goods described as \"AW139 CIVIL HELICOPTER, USED,\" it recites \"1.\" JSF Ex. B. It then separately lists three other units or packages, two of which consist of a \"MAIN ROTOR BLADE BOX,\" and the last of which consists of a \"HORIZONTAL STABILIZER CRATE.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160325\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/494/1005/#p1015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Below, summing up, it recites, following a line reading \"Total no. of containers or packages received by the Carrier in words,\" the response: \"Four Unit(s).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160325\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/494/1005/#p1015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This makes clear that the helicopter is a single unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Importantly, a provision in the bill of lading discusses the $ 500 per \"package,\" or per CFU, limitation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   If U.S. COGSA applies to the contract evidenced by this bill of lading, the Carrier's liability is limited to U.S. $ 500 per package, or for Goods not shipped in packages, per customary freight unit, unless a higher value is declared in the Declared Value box on the face of the bill of lading and a higher freight is paid.\n   <em>\n    Each unpackaged vehicle or other piece of unpackaged cargo on which freight is calculated, constitutes one customary freight unit.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   JSF Ex. C (emphasis added). Bristow, notably, acknowledges that it had a fair and reasonable opportunity to declare a higher value and pay a higher freight in order to opt out of the COGSA limitation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 12. Bristow further acknowledges that it did not do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160325\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/494/1005/#p1015\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The \"Declared value\" box on the bill of lading, which references the above clause, is blank.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JSF Ex.

That argument cannot be squared with the plain language of the bill of lading that a CFU is the piece of cargo\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   which freight is calculated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In a 2010 case, Judge Koeltl addressed the same contractual provisions at issue here in the context of a dropped yacht case. His reasoning aptly captures this Court's analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The bill of lading defines a \"package\" as \"the largest means used to prepare cargo for transportation, including but not limited to, a skid, pallet, Container, trailer, or carton.\" Immediately after the incorporation of COGSA in the bill of\n   lading, it states that \"[e]ach unpackaged vehicle or other piece of unpackaged cargo on which freight is calculated, constitutes one customary freight unit.\" The bill of lading lists the number of units o[r] packages as 1, and keys the number of units to clause 10, the liability limitation clause of the bill of lading. This language, on its face, limits the defendants' liability to $ 500 for the yacht in a cradle. Either the yacht is considered one package, or it is unpackaged but nevertheless constitutes one customary freight unit. Under either scenario, liability is no more than $ 500.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Travelers Ins. Co. v. M/V MADAME BUTTERFLY\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4006891\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/700/496/#p508\">\n    700 F.Supp.2d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 508-09 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   So, too, here. Regardless whether the helicopter with tow bar is viewed as a \"package\" or as a CFU, the Court holds, the bill of lading limits Wallenius' liability under COGSA to $ 500. Future shippers seeking to avoid such a limitation for a singular, valuable item such as a helicopter or yacht would do well to consider opting out of the limitation, declaring a higher value, and paying a correspondingly higher freight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Wallenius' motion for partial summary judgment. The Clerk of Court is respectfully requested to terminate the motion pending at Dkt. 27.
