BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ashley is a home furniture store with a number of locations throughout Alabama. During the time in question, Plaintiffs and Defendants Swinney and Seavers worked at Ashley in Tuscaloosa. Swinney was the Store's General Manager, and Seavers was Ashley's Director of Stores. Poague, Holley, Coleman, and Acker worked as product specialists at Ashley in Tuscaloosa. Product specialists at Ashley were paid an hourly rate plus commissions. In addition to their regular duties, product specialists are regularly required to hand out flyers, but they are not allowed to clock in while they hand out flyers. (Doc. 18 \u00b6 79.) Additionally, Acker was once asked to come in and complete a sale, but was told she\n   would not be allowed to clock in while she completed the sale. Bishop worked as a cashier at Ashley, but she was employed through Express Temp Agency (\"Express\"). Bishop was paid a flat rate of ten dollars an hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Swinney and other male supervisors and co-workers at Ashley created a hostile work environment by consistently making sexually charged remarks and explicit statements towards employees and customers at Ashley. Swinney is alleged to have called attractive women, including customers, \"Omahas\" or \"IHOPs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32, 136.) Swinney is also alleged to have called the Store's Assistant Manager James Rigsby (\"Rigsby\") \"raw-dog\" or \"raw-jaw\" because Rigsby did not use condoms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) On one occasion Swinney called Bishop his work wife, and on another he threw money at Bishop and told her he was going to \"make it rain.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 162, 165.) On another occasion, Swinney grabbed his crotch in front of Bishop and asked her if she wanted \"deez nuts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 174, 178-79.) Swinney once held Bishop's hand in front of customers and on another occasion leaned over Bishop in order to press his genitals into her back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 158, 162.) Acker was also subject to physical advances by Swinney. Swinney is alleged to have touched Ackers breasts as he walked by her on two separate occasions and to have once touched Acker's buttocks as he walked by her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) In response to a complaint about his behavior, Swinney stated that \"if [plaintiff] can't take the heat, then get out of the room.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rigsby and product specialist Sam Gibson (\"Gibson\") are also alleged to have engaged in harassing activity. Rigsby is alleged to have spoken openly about having sex with two girls at one time, showed his co-workers texts with nude pictures he received from a customer that described sex acts, discussed his love for pregnant female's breasts and his desire to feed from them, talked about his use of condoms, and relayed other graphic sexual stories to other employees at Ashley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-44.) Gibson is alleged to have openly discussed his love for amateur porn with co-workers, said he \"want[ed] those customers\" who were trying out the mattresses, told Poague she \"blows,\" and talked about \"how disgusting it is to 'f***k white chicks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-51.) Additionally, male co-workers are alleged to have played a video of a man talking about \"licking girls' booties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Swinney is also alleged to have shown favoritism to male employees at Ashley. For example, Swinney did not follow store policy of sending walk-in customers to different product specialists. Instead, Swinney sent all walk-in customers to male product specialists. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.) Swinney also approved sales by male product specialists at much lower sales margins than female product specialists at Ashley were allowed to offer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.) Additionally, Swinney checked only female product specialists' sales margins, assigned female's sales to male product specialists, and refused to give female employee their \"Sales by Salesperson\" details, which would have allowed Plaintiffs to track their earnings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-63, 65.) Swinney also required female employees at Ashley to sign in and out of breaks, and disciplined female employees more harshly than male employees who missed work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 71, 73-74.) For example, Swinney suspended Coleman for three days after she was five minutes late to work, but did not suspend a male employee who failed to show up for an entire day of work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) Swinney is also alleged to have spoken only to female employees about violations of Ashley's dress code. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Poague and Holley specifically allege that they were also subject to discrimination due to their pregnancies. In October 2015, Poague had a child and requested FMLA leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) Poague was not eligible for FMLA leave, so she took vacation for the birth of her child. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.) Poague returned to work at Ashley in January 2016. Although Poague's previous manager had promised to provide her with a private place to express breast milk, Swinney told Poague she could express milk in the community room. The community room has a number of cameras because it contains clearance merchandise that customers at Ashley could purchase. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85-86.) As a result of not having a private place to express milk, Poague had to travel between home and work to express milk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) This travel caused Poague to have to hand over sales she initiated to co-workers and lose wages because she was not able to be on the sales floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-92.) Poague tried to take FMLA leave so that she could care for her son, who was having problems developing because Poague could not feed him as often as needed. Even though Poague had in fact become eligible for FMLA leave, Swinney and Seavers told Poague that she was ineligible for FMLA leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 103-05.) Swinney then told Poague she needed to work more hours, and that he did not care that her hours were reduced because she lacked a private place to express milk. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 97-98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In February 2016, all product specialists received a one dollar per hour raise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.) Holley was excluded from this raise. Holley was then told she was not given this raise because she was on maternity leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 96, 113.) In July 2016, Poague was granted FMLA leave to care for her child. When Poague went on FMLA leave her pending sales and deliveries were assigned to male colleagues, and Swinney told her she would be placed on a disciplinary performance plan upon her return from leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 107-09.) In August 2016, Danny Pastor was hired at a rate one dollar per hour higher than Holley's pay rate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 110-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Poague returned from FMLA leave on October 1, 2016, and was immediately placed on a disciplinary performance plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 124-25.) Additionally, Poague discovered that her finger print no longer worked on the time clock, she no longer had an inbox, and that she would not be given a tablet or leather binder for her sales as other employees had been given. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.) Poague was then written up for not meeting the terms of her disciplinary performance plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129.) Although Poague was written up, her sales were among the top ten in the nation for Ashley during one of the weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November 2016, Poague complained about Swinney's behavior to HR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132.) In December 2016, Poague filed an EEOC charge about Swinney's behavior. (Id. \u00b6 134.) After Poague filed her charge, Swinney called her into his office and confronted her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134.) Swinney then took Poague's target cards, told other managers that he had to approve any sales Poague made, interfered with Poague's sales orders and deliveries, and changed Poague's commission plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 141-43, 146, 149.) Swinney told a male colleague that he wanted \" 'to get rid of' Poague.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149.) Later in December 2016, HR interviewed Coleman about Swinney's behavior. In the interview, Coleman told HR about Swinney's behavior and his treatment of female employees at Ashley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In January 2017, Holley and Coleman filed EEOC charges against Ashley for Swinney's actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 152, 154.) Swinney then stated he would get rid of Coleman after he got rid of Poague. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 155.) In that same month, Bishop complained to\n   Ashley's Office Manager Mia Washington (\"Washington\") about Swinney, stating that he made her uncomfortable because he would touch her and invade her personal space. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156.) In February 2017, due to the ongoing nature of Swinney's conduct, Poague supplemented her EEOC charge and emailed staff and managers at Ashley about the conditions there. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 160.) In March 2017, Bishop again complained about Swinney to Washington. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 163.) Bishop's hours were then cut from fifty to forty hours a week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168.) In that same month, Acker filed an EEOC charge concerning Swinney's behavior. After Acker filed her charge, Swinney refused to assist her with sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 172.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In April 2017, Bishop complained to Express about Swinney's behavior because Ashley had not addressed her complaints and Swinney continued to make advances towards her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 173, 176.) The day after she lodged her complaint with Express, Bishop recorded Swinney making comments to her about his genitals and asking her if she wanted \"deez nutz.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 178-80.) Bishop played this recording for Express. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 184.) Ashley terminated Swinney shortly thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 182)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After Swinney was terminated, Acker interviewed for another position at Ashley in Tuscaloosa. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 185.) At this time, Counsel for Plaintiffs had been obtained and Ashley's Attorney Hannan had received notice that Plaintiffs were represented. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 183.) During her interview, Acker met with Seavers and Hannan, who claimed to represent HR for Ashley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 187-88.) In the interview, Hannan asked Acker about Poague's claims and Swinney's actions, including whether Swinney had done anything to her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 190-95.) After the interview, Hannan told Acker she could only have the job if she signed the paperwork he presented to her at the very moment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 196.)This paperwork included waivers of Acker's claims, a statement against Poague, and a document retracting her EEOC charge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 275.) Acker signed the paperwork and was rehired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 200.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Although Plaintiffs' amended complaint is often disorderly and vague, it does not rise to the level of an impermissible shotgun pleading. Plaintiffs' amended complaint does incorporate all prior paragraphs into each claim. However, these references are also accompanied by a specific incorporation of facts tailored to the specific claims. While Plaintiffs' amended complaint may bear some resemblance to a shotgun pleading, \"this is not a situation where a failure to more precisely parcel out and identify the facts relevant to each claim materially increased the burden of understanding the\n   factual allegations underlying each count.\"\n   <em>\n    Weiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054943\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1313/#p1323\">\n    792 F.3d at 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To the extent Defendants' argue they are impermissibly \"lumped\" together in each count, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' amended complaint is sufficiently plead to provide notice to Defendants as to what claims are being asserted against each defendant. Plaintiffs' amended complaint does, in several instances, refer to \"Defendant\" or \"Defendants\" generally without specifying which Defendant is being referred to in each count. However, Plaintiffs identify which Defendants they are asserting their claims against in the caption of each count. Although the captions of the counts in the complaint are not part of the statement of claim under Rule 8, the Court will not require Plaintiffs to re-plead their complaint simply because Defendants seek to have the same information provided by the caption repeated within the numbered paragraphs of the amended complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs' amended complaint is shotgun pleading because its factual allegations are too conclusory and vague. However, Defendants' argument in this regard is unavailing because it appears that Defendants are asking this Court to require Plaintiffs to provide more factual allegations about their allegations. Defendants' argument would be convincing were this case at the summary judgment stage. Plaintiffs are required at the motion to dismiss stage to give defendants sufficient notice of the grounds for plausible claims against them, no more and no less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   If Plaintiffs' amended complaint was a shotgun pleading, it would be \"difficult to understand what the Defendants 'were alleged to have done and why they were liable for doing it.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Downing v.

Plaintiffs have brought a number of claims against Ashley for both its own actions and Swinney's actions. These claims include a sexual harassment and retaliation claims. The allegations Swinney challenge relate to Plaintiffs' claims as they demonstrate possible knowledge by Ashley about inappropriate Swinney's conduct, and a possible work environment where retaliation occurred. Swinney may be correct that these facts will not bear out in discovery or ultimately be produced in an admissible form. Yet, the Court is not tasked with predetermining such issues based on the face of Plaintiffs' amended complaint. Therefore, Swinney's implied motion to strike these allegations is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Plaintiffs have also alleged facts indicating that Ashley was aware of Swinney's actions, but that it did not take action until Bishop played a recording of Swinney's comments for Express. Although Ashley alleges that many of these factual allegations are too conclusory and vague to state a claim, the facts are alleged with sufficient\n   particularity to meet the pleading standard in Rule 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   To the extent Ashley seeks to have this claim dismissed on the basis that the conduct alleged is not sufficiently severe or pervasive, the determination of whether this conduct rises to the level of severe or pervasive is, in this Court's view, a finding that is more appropriately made at the summary judgment stage when discovery has been completed. Thus, Ashley's motion to dismiss is due to be denied as to Plaintiffs' sexual harassment-hostile work environment claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

The law does not require Plaintiffs to make a formal complaint to engage in statutorily protected activity as an informal complaint that \"explicitly or implicitly\n   communicate[s] a belief that [the conduct suffered by the plaintiff] constitutes unlawful employment discrimination\" may be considered protected activity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174455\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/1295/#p1310\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174455\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/1295/#p1310\">\n    at 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Ashley asserts that it is entitled to dismissal of Plaintiffs' retaliation claims because Plaintiffs do not allege when they complained and to whom they complained. (Doc. 30 at 26.) Upon review, the amended complaint contains factual allegations concerning how and when all of the Plaintiffs did in fact complain or engage in what could be considered statutorily protected activity, which includes filing an EEOC charge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18 \u00b6\u00b6 112, 132, 150, 163, 169, 176.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Ashley also argues that Plaintiffs' claims are due to be dismissed because there is no evidence or factual allegations indicating that these actions were adverse or that there is any causal connection. The Court's review of the amended complaint finds that the facts as alleged plausibly indicate that Acker, Bishop, Coleman, Holley and Poague engaged in protected activity and were subject to adverse actions. Plaintiffs have also alleged sufficient facts to indicate a plausible causal link as these adverse actions occurred close in time to their complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although Ashley argues that Bishop's claim is subject to dismissal because she did not engaged in protected activity until after she left Ashley, the Court notes that the facts alleged indicate that Bishop complained about Swinney to Ashley, in what could be considered protected activity, in March 2017 and that her hours were cut shortly thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 163, 168.)

In regard to Holley's PDA claim, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to state a claim. Plaintiffs allege facts indicating that Holley was pregnant, denied a pay raise while on maternity leave, and told that she was denied this raise specifically because she was on maternity leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs have also alleged sufficient facts to bring a plausible PDA claim on Poague's behalf.

Poague alleges that Swinney told her she needed to work more hours and that he \"did not care\" that she was on a reduced schedule because she had to return home to express milk.

An employer will be liable for the intentional torts of its employee if \"(1) that the agent's wrongful acts were committed in the line and scope of the agent's employment; or (2) that the acts were committed in furtherance of the business of the employer; or (3) that the employer participated in, authorized, or ratified the wrongful acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Potts v.

To show that an employer ratified an employee's act, the plaintiff must show that the employer (1) \"had actual knowledge\" of the employee's tortious conduct towards the plaintiff; (2) that \"the employer knew, or should have known, that such conduct constituted ... a tort; and (3) that the employer failed to take adequate steps to remedy the situation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7442907\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/669/885/#p889\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Potts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7478710\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/604/398/#p400\">\n    604 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   400 ). Therefore, the Court will analyze Plaintiffs' tort claims against Swinney before discussing Ashley's potential liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    I. SWINNEY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    1. ASSAULT AND BATTERY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Acker and Bishop bring assault and battery claims against both Swinney and Ashley. To state a claim for assault and battery under Alabama law, a plaintiff must prove that \"(1) the defendant touched the plaintiff; (2) the defendant intended to touch the plaintiff; and (3) that the touching was conducted in a harmful or offensive manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Harper v. Winston Cty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9026688\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/892/346/#p353\">\n    892 So.2d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 353 (Ala. 2004) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Atmore Cmty. Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11701670\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/719/1190/#p1193\">\n    719 So.2d 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1193 (Ala. 1998) ) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Swinney argues that this Court should dismiss Acker and Bishop's claims because they have not provided substantial enough evidence to plead a claim of assault and battery. Neither Alabama law nor the motion to dismiss standard warrants the Court reach such a conclusion if Plaintiffs have met the Rule 8 standard. In arguing for dismissal, Swinney asks this Court to disregard many of Plaintiffs' factual allegations because they contain \"pejorative\" and \"color\" words. However, the Court is not entitled to disregard Plaintiffs' use of specific nouns to describe Swinney's conduct and alleged touching. Moreover, to the extent Swinney argues that this Court should ignore Plaintiffs' \"summary allegations\" as mere conclusions, the Court notes that it is only tasked with disregarding legal conclusions at the motion to dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Swinney himself admits that his behavior as alleged, if taken as true, is \"consistent with behavior which\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   constitute assault.\" (Doc. 28 at 10.) (emphasis in the original). Based on the facts as alleged, the Court agrees. Swinney is alleged to have touched Acker's breasts twice and buttocks once. Further, Bishop alleges that Swinney leaned against her and touched her back with his genitals. These factual allegations in the amended complaint plausibly\n   suggest unwanted contact that was intentional rather than inadvertent and done in an offensive manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Swinney nevertheless argues that Plaintiffs' claim must fail because they do not present enough evidence to prove that this touching was intentional instead of inadvertent. (Doc. 28 at 10.) However, the plaintiff is not required to prove the intent of the defendant in her complaint to survive a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Surrency v. Harbison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7597673\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/489/1097/#p1104\">\n    489 So.2d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1104 (Ala. 1986) (\"[j]ust as it is a jury question as to whether an assault and battery in fact occurred, it is a jury question as to what defendant['s] intent consisted of\"). A reasonable jury may later find that the assault and battery allegations more consistent with incidental touching as Swinney suggests. However, the standard at the motion to dismiss stage is that a plaintiff states a plausible claim. Plaintiffs have done so. Thus, Swinney's motion to dismiss is due to be denied as to Bishop and Acker's assault and battery claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    2. OUTRAGE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Alabama Supreme Court describes the tort of outrage as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   The emotional distress caused by the defendant's conduct must be so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.... By extreme, we refer to conduct so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized society.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    Potts v. Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11154194\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/771/462/#p465\">\n    771 So.2d 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 465 (2000) (internal citations and quotations omitted). To succeed on their outrage claim, Plaintiffs must prove that (1) the defendant intended to inflict emotional distress, or knew or should have known that emotional distress would likely result from their conduct; (2) the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) the defendant's actions caused her distress; and (4) the distress was severe.\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Hodges Chapel, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7014094\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/756/#p763\">\n    89 So.3d 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763 (Ala. Civ. App. 2011). \"[T]he tort of outrage is an extremely limited cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Potts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11154194\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/771/462/#p465\">\n    771 So.2d at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"It is so limited that [the Alabama Supreme Court] has recognized it in regard to only three kinds of conduct: (1) wrongful conduct in the family-burial context; (2) barbaric methods employed to coerce an insurance settlement; and (3) egregious sexual harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11154194\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/771/462/#p465\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Plaintiffs allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim of sexual harassment that created a hostile work environment, which included not only lurid comments and gestures by Swinney and a number of male employees at Ashley but also several incidences of unwanted physical contact by Swinney. At this stage, it is not necessary for the Court to determine whether or not Plaintiffs' allegations against Swinney constitute egregious sexual harassment or simple garden variety sexual harassment, when either way Plaintiffs have provided sufficient factual support to plausibly state a claim for relief. Therefore, Swinney's motion to dismiss as to Plaintiffs' outrage claim is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. ASHLEY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    1. ASSAULT, BATTERY, AND OUTRAGE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Ashley contends Plaintiffs' assault and battery, and outrage claims against it are due to be dismissed because \"[t]here is no evidence that Swinney acted in the line and scope of his employment or in furtherance of [Ashley]'s business ... [and there is] no evidence or allegation that [Ashley] knew of [his] conduct.\" (Doc. 30 at 40-41.) However, Plaintiffs have included sufficient factual allegations to plausibly suggest\n   that Ashley knew of and ratified Swinney's conduct. Plaintiffs' factual allegations indicate that Plaintiffs lodged complaints, both formal and informal, about Swinney's actions, including his alleged physical contacts and sexually charged comments, to Ashley and the EEOC on a number of occasions before he was terminated. Acker's EEOC charge, which was one of the last EEOC charges filed concerning Swinney's behavior, predated Swinney's termination by almost two months. These facts plausibly suggest that Ashley had an awareness of Swinney's conduct for months before it took action to terminate him for his conduct. Therefore, Ashley's motion to dismiss is due to be denied as to Plaintiffs' claims for assault and battery, and outrage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    2. NEGLIGENT/ WANTON HIRING, TRAINING, AND SUPERVISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiffs assert claims against Ashley based upon its alleged negligence or wantonness associated with its hiring, training, supervision, and retention of Swinney. To establish a claim for negligent or wanton supervision under Alabama law a plaintiff must show that \"(1) the employee committed a tort recognized under Alabama law, (2) the employer had actual notice of this conduct or would have gained such notice if it exercised due and proper diligence, and (3) the employer failed to respond to this notice adequately.\"\n   <em>\n    Shuler v. Ingram &amp; Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734160\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/710/1213/#p1228\">\n    710 F.Supp.2d 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1228 (N.D. Ala. 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Voyager Ins. Cos. v. Whitson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9276945\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/867/1065/#p1071\">\n    867 So.2d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1071-73 (Ala. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   As discussed above Plaintiffs' amended complaint states a plausible claim for relief on the torts of assault and battery, and outrage. Therefore, the first requirement is met. Further, Plaintiffs have alleged facts indicating that they reported Swinney's behavior several times, but that Ashley did not take action until Bishop played her recording of Swinney for Express. These facts suggest that Ashley had actual knowledge in regard to Swinney's tortious or that at the very least Swinney's behavior was of such frequency that it should have been discoverable by Ashley \"in the exercise of due care.\"\n   <em>\n    Lane v. Cent. Bank of Ala., N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9551241\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/425/1098/#p1100\">\n    425 So.2d 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1100 (Ala. 1983) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. Havard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2579190\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ala/285/718/\">\n    285 Ala. 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2579190\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ala/285/718/\">\n    235 So.2d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 858 (1970) ). Although wantonness requires a higher degree of consciousness that injury is likely to result, the Court finds that the facts as alleged also state a plausible claim as Plaintiffs have alleged facts indicating that Ashley knew of Swinney's behavior, but did not take action. Therefore, Ashley's motion to dismiss is due to be denied as to Plaintiffs' claims' for wanton/ negligent training and supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
