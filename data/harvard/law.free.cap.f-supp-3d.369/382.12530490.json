Last year I dismissed the initial complaint without prejudice on the ground that its state law causes of action were all preempted by the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patane v.

Conn. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs have now re-framed their claims and filed an amended complaint that seeks class action relief for consumers under the laws of nine different States. Nestl\u00e9 in turn has moved to dismiss the amended complaint on multiple grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I will grant in part and deny in part Nestl\u00e9's motion to dismiss. First, I decline to abstain on grounds of\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   abstention or under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. Second, I conclude that plaintiffs' state law claims are not preempted except for their Vermont law claims. Third, I decline to rule at this time on Nestl\u00e9's \"safe harbor\" defense against the statutory claims because the record is not yet sufficient to determine the facts necessary to resolve this claim. Lastly, I decline on similar grounds to dismiss the common law fraud and contract claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The amended complaint (Doc. # 160) alleges state law claims on behalf of consumers in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. It alleges common law causes of action for fraud and for breach of contract as well as statutory causes of action for consumer fraud and unfair trade practices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It seeks damages for alleged misconduct dating back to 2003 as well as prospective injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   All of plaintiffs' claims are based on a core of allegations that Nestl\u00e9 has fraudulently labeled its Poland Spring water products as \"100% Natural Spring Water\" while knowing that the product is not \"spring water\" as that term is defined by law. Doc. # 160 at 39 (\u00b6 101). According to plaintiffs, the multiple sites in Maine where Nestl\u00e9 obtains Poland Spring water and that are identified by name on Poland Spring labels are not natural springs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525596\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/314/375/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\u00b6 102).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege that Nestl\u00e9 has unlawfully profited from its misleading marketing of Poland Spring water because consumers are willing to pay a premium price for \"spring water\" over other forms of bottled water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As I discussed at length in my prior ruling granting Nestl\u00e9's motion to dismiss, the FDCA establishes basic definitions (known as \"standards of identity\") for food products and prohibits the false labeling of such food products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promulgated a detailed regulatory definition of \"spring water\" that distinguishes it from other kinds of bottled water that may be marketed for public sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20165.110\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 165.110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(vi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the FDA's regulation, if a water product is to be labeled and sold as \"spring water,\" the water must be \"derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth,\" and there must be a \"natural force causing the water to flow to the surface through a natural orifice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20165.110\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The FDA's regulation further provides that \"spring water\" can be \"collected only at the spring or through a bore hole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring,\" and that if it is collected \"with the use of an external force,\" the water must be \"from the same underground stratum as the spring, as shown by a measurable hydraulic connection using a hydrogeologically valid method between the bore hole and the natural spring, and shall have all the physical properties, before treatment, and be of the same composition and quality, as the water that flows naturally to the surface of the earth.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20165.110\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the filing of the amended complaint, Nestl\u00e9 has again moved to dismiss on multiple grounds pursuant to Fed.

A complaint may not survive unless it alleges facts that, taken as true, give rise to plausible grounds to sustain the Court's subject matter jurisdiction and to sustain plaintiffs' claims for relief.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

To begin with,\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   abstention is most appropriate when a plaintiff seeks injunctive or prospective relief that would interfere with the ongoing authority of the state to apply and enforce its laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tribune Co. v. Abiola\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307743\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/66/12/#p13\">\n    66 F.3d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13, 17 (2d Cir. 1995) (\"[W]e hold that it is generally appropriate for a district court to abstain on\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   grounds only when asked to provide equitable relief,\" and \"the plaintiffs in this case have brought garden-variety claims for money damages ... that present no danger of interfering with any proceeding or order of the New York State Workers' Compensation Board\"). Although it is true that plaintiffs here seek injunctive relief, the bulk of this action is for money damages from many years of past alleged violations of their rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   So far as I can tell from the present record, even though plaintiffs challenge the integrity of prior regulatory actions in Maine (Doc. # 160 at 273-76 (\u00b6\u00b6 796-808) ), the litigation of plaintiffs' claim for money damages poses no danger of interfering with any\n   <em>\n    ongoing\n   </em>\n   regulatory functions of the State of Maine or any of the other States at issue in this case. If such concerns arise in the future, I would be prepared to consider whether appropriate action should be taken on the basis of a substantiated record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nor does this case present difficult questions of state law where adjudication in a federal forum would disrupt state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern. For the most part, the state laws at issue merely incorporate the federal \"spring water\" standard in order to avoid being subject to preemption. \"Congress and the FDA appear to have made a conscious choice to allow the several states to regulate bottled water so long as the state standards employed are identical to those adopted by the FDA. The requirement of identity promotes uniformity in that courts in every state look to the same standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Vt. Pure Holdings, Ltd. v. Nestl\u00e9 Waters N.

Mass. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, I decline to dismiss or stay this case on\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   abstention grounds. This ruling is without prejudice to renewal of Nestl\u00e9's motion in the event that plaintiffs seek to effectuate any judgment for injunctive relief or to otherwise take action that would obstruct or impede any state authority's ongoing administration of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Primary jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Nestl\u00e9 argues that \"the Court should dismiss this action in deference to the primary jurisdiction of the FDA to exercise its expertise and authority to determine in the first instance whether Poland Spring Water meets the FDA Identity Standard.\" Doc. # 164 at 3. The doctrine of primary jurisdiction seeks to \"promot[e] proper relationships between the courts and administrative agencies charged with particular regulatory duties,\" and it applies when \"enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body.\"\n   <em>\n    Ellis v.

While there is \"[n]o fixed formula\" for deciding when to invoke the doctrine, courts generally examine whether the case involves \"technical or policy considerations within the agency's particular field of expertise,\" and \"whether the question at issue is particularly within the agency's discretion,\" among other factors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046229\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/71/#p81\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046229\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/71/#p81\">\n    at 82-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Second Circuit has cautioned that the primary jurisdiction doctrine has a \"relatively narrow scope,\" and does not apply when the claim involves matters within the \"traditional realm of judicial competence.\"\n   <em>\n    Goya Foods, Inc. v.

This letter suggests that the FDA leaves it to the States to decide if particular water products meet the federal \"spring water\" standard. Although Nestl\u00e9 now urges me to allow the FDA to determine whether Poland Spring Water meets the federal standard, Doc. # 164 at 3, the letter from the FDA that Nestl\u00e9 has submitted raises significant doubt in my mind about whether the FDA stands ready and willing to make some kind of case-specific determination that might advance the litigation here. It does not appear that Nestl\u00e9 has yet invited a team of expert FDA investigators to come inspect its properties and issue a ruling on whether all of its sites comply with federal \"spring water\" requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moreover, the federal definition of \"spring water\" is now well established, and Nestl\u00e9 does not suggest that this definition is under active federal review. This is not a case where there are reasons to conclude that the FDA is in the throes of rulemaking or poised anytime soon to refine definitional aspects of its \"spring water\" rule.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re KIND LLC \"Healthy &amp; All Nat.\" Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272417\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/209/689/#p697\">\n    209 F.Supp.3d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (staying case in light of FDA announcement of ongoing rulemaking regarding the use of the term \"natural\" on food labels),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re KIND LLC \"Healthy &amp; All Nat.\" Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20542834\">\n    2019 WL 542834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (lifting same stay in light of years-long delay by FDA action to promulgate rule).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, I decline to dismiss or stay this case on primary jurisdiction grounds.

Plaintiffs identify only a general consumer protection statute, which does not mention spring water, along with two statutory provisions authorizing the Secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources to establish rules or requirements for drinking water quality and public water systems and requiring sellers of bottled water to provide various certifications. Doc. # 160 at 28, 305-306 (citing VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 9, \u00a7 2451,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; tit. 10, ch. 56, \u00a7\u00a7 1672(b) and 1673(f) ). Though the latter two provisions involve water, and \u00a7 1673(f) requires that importers of bottled drinking water identify \"the name, source and the location of the bottler of spring, artesian, or municipal water,\" neither provision expressly defines spring water or affirmatively adopts the federal standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Similarly, Vermont law provides that \"[a] bottler of spring or artesian water may apply to the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets for a specially designated identification label to indicate that the water originated and was bottled in Vermont and that it complies with any quality requirements adopted by the Agency.\" 6 V.S.A. \u00a7 2964a. Plaintiffs do not cite any regulatory standards promulgated for spring water pursuant to this statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that, because Vermont requires out-of-state bottled water sellers to be certified by the regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the sellers, VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 10, \u00a7\u00a7 1672(b) and 1673(f), which in this case is Maine, and because Maine regulators apply the Maine identity standard, which in turn is the same as the federal standard, Vermont law by extrapolation requires compliance with the federal identity standard. But this basis and connection is too tenuous. Just because Vermont law requires Poland Spring water to be certified by a regulator in another State does not mean that Vermont has independently and affirmatively adopted the federal identity standard as its own law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   None of this means that the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act is\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   preempted; there is no indication that it rests on an underlying state law standard that actually departs from the federal spring water standard. On the other hand, the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act claim is\n   <em>\n    impliedly\n   </em>\n   preempted, because it does not rest on any independent state law of Vermont that defines a state standard for spring water. Absent such an underlying standard, plaintiffs' Vermont claim is, in reality, just an attempt to sue for a violation of federal law, which is the type of claim that is subject to implied preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Nestl\u00e9 argues that some of the state law \"spring water\" standards do not give rise to a private cause of action. This is not an argument about federal preemption but about whether a particular statute or regulation gives rise to a cause of action under state law. It is common, moreover, for consumer protection and unfair trade practices statutes to serve as a vehicle for a cause of action based on conduct that violates an independent state law standard that is not itself otherwise actionable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nick's Garage, Inc. v.

Therefore, the fact that any particular state law standard is not independently actionable or directly enforceable is neither grounds to reach a\n   <em>\n    non sequitur\n   </em>\n   conclusion that the standard must be preempted by federal law, nor to conclude that the standard has no legal weight as a state law duty that is independent of federal law.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Engine Mfrs.

The fraud claim alleges in relevant part that there was fraud in each of the alleged States because Nestl\u00e9 \"intentionally concealed that its Poland Spring Water does not comply with the standard of identity for spring water\n   <em>\n    under state law\n   </em>\n   \" and \"affirmatively misrepresented to Plaintiffs on Poland Spring Water labels that Poland Spring Water is '100% Natural Spring Water' sourced from naturally occurring springs in Maine when, in fact, Poland Spring Water is not '100% Natural Spring Water' because [it] does not contain genuine natural spring water\n   <em>\n    as defined by state law\n   </em>\n   .\" Doc. # 160 at 283 (\u00b6\u00b6 838-39) (emphasis added). Similarly, the contract claim alleges that Nestl\u00e9 promised to deliver \"100% Natural Spring Water\" when in fact \"it did not at any time deliver genuine spring water\n   <em>\n    as defined under state law\n   </em>\n   to Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877502\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/246/#p252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877502\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/246/#p252\">\n    at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 851-52) (emphasis added). Because these common law claims are predicated on a violation of a state law standard for \"spring water\" and because (as I have discussed above) each one of the nine States except Vermont has state law standards for \"spring water\" that are equivalent to the federal standard, these common law claims under the laws of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island are not preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Nestl\u00e9 next argues that plaintiffs seek to enforce a definition of \"spring water\" that, in hydrogeological terms, goes well beyond what is required by the federal identity standard and cognate state law standards. Doc. # 164-1 at 64-70 (citing multiple examples). But I am convinced by plaintiffs' response that they do not seek to proceed\n   on a theory of relief that would depart from any \"spring water\" requirement that differs from the federal \"spring water\" identity standard and that the specific evidentiary details they cite in the complaint are solely in the nature of evidence they expect to support their claim that Nestl\u00e9's product did not meet the \"spring water\" standards that have been adopted by multiple States and that mirror the federal \"spring water\" standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   There is no cause for me at this pleading stage to evaluate the strength or relevance of particular items of plaintiffs' evidence, and any surplusage of evidentiary detail in the allegations of the complaint does not furnish a basis for dismissal. This is without prejudice to Nestl\u00e9's opportunity to show at a later evidentiary stage of this action that plaintiffs' \"evidence\" is not merely evidence of a violation of the existing \"spring water\" standard but actually represents an effort to enforce a different standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Nestl\u00e9 further argues that plaintiffs' claims are subject to \"conflict\" preemption pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Marentette v.

Conflict preemption is just \"one form of implied preemption\" and applies \"where compliance with both state and federal law is a physical impossibility, or, as relevant here, where the state law at issue stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516382\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/112/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516382\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/112/\">\n    at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As an initial matter, Nestl\u00e9 makes no showing that it is impossible for it to comply with both the federal and state law standards-and it cannot do so, because these standards are the same as one another as I have discussed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Nor has Nestl\u00e9 shown how the allowance of state causes of action to enforce any of the state law standards will pose an obstacle to Congress's purposes. Although the FDCA itself forecloses civil action to directly enforce the federal \"spring water\" standard,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525596\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/314/375/\">\n    314 F.Supp.3d at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , there is no indication that Congress meant to foreclose the States from creating remedies that are predicated on state law standards that are identical to the federal \"spring water\" standard. The FDCA limits its express preemptive effect in allowance and contemplation of such state law remedies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525596\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/314/375/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 384 n.8. Thus, the FDCA allows a State to \"impose the identical requirement or requirements, and by doing so be enabled ... to enforce a violation of the [FDCA] as a violation of state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Turek v.

Accordingly, because preemption is primarily an inquiry about Congress's specific intent as to a specific statutory scheme, the facts and particulars of the\n   <em>\n    Marentette\n   </em>\n   decision are of little use in evaluating the scope of preemption under the FDCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In short, I conclude for the most part that plaintiffs' claims in the amended complaint are not preempted by federal law. Except for plaintiffs' Vermont law claims, the FDCA does not preempt plaintiffs' statutory and common law claims from Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Safe harbor\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Nestl\u00e9 moves to dismiss plaintiffs' statutory claims for consumer fraud and unfair trade practices on the ground that \"[r]egulators specifically authorized the sale of Poland Spring as 'spring water' after they determined it complied with the FDA Identity Standard\" and that the state statutory\n   causes of action have \"safe harbor\" protections to the effect that these statutes do not apply to actions that have been \"specifically approved and authorized pursuant to a regulatory regime administered by a dedicated regulatory agency.\" Doc. # 164-1 at 77. To support this argument, Nestl\u00e9 has appended to its papers a collection of letters, certifications, and other documents from multiple state regulatory agencies. Doc. # 53-3 at 7-29; Doc. # 53-4 at 1-20; Doc. # 164-2 at 1-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Like any other affirmative defense, a \"safe harbor\" defense may be raised on a motion to dismiss, but only \"if the defense is based on facts appearing on the face of the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Mercer v.

Because Nestl\u00e9's \"safe harbor\" argument turns on fact-laden issues of what actions specific regulatory bodies have taken (and whether such actions constitute sufficient authorization to qualify for any \"safe harbor\"), it is not appropriate for me to resolve the application of the \"safe harbor\" defense on a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, the amended complaint alleges unlawful conduct dating back to 2003. For the most part, however, Nestl\u00e9's submissions include documents that only show current, single-year certifications and authorizations, such that I am in no position-even if I were to fully credit the documents that Nestl\u00e9 has submitted to date-to evaluate Nestl\u00e9's authorization status in prior years. Accordingly, I will deny Nestl\u00e9's motion to dismiss insofar as it is based on a \"safe harbor\" defense but without prejudice to renewal of such a defense at the conclusion of discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Adequacy of state common law claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Nestl\u00e9 argues that plaintiffs have not alleged plausible grounds for relief to support their common law fraud and contract claims in light of the fact that Nestl\u00e9 obtained regulatory approvals. But, as with the \"safe harbor\" defense, the validity and status of regulatory authorizations is a fact-based argument that is not appropriate for me to address at the pleadings stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Nestl\u00e9 further argues that plaintiffs' contract claim must be evaluated under the Uniform Commercial Code rather than under Connecticut common law and that plaintiffs cannot state a breach of contract claim because they are deemed under the UCC to have accepted the goods. Doc. # 164-1 at 89-90. But Nestl\u00e9 did not raise this specific UCC argument in its prior motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 53-1 at 73-74, and Rule 12(g)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \"[e]xcept as provided in Rule 12(h)(2) or (3), a party that makes a motion under this rule must not make another motion under this rule raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leyse v.

Because the parties' briefing does not meaningfully address any distinction to be drawn between the words that appear on the Poland Spring label and the imagery, I will assume for present purposes that this additional allegation is a subset of plaintiffs' broader allegation that the labeling is misleading because it misrepresents Poland Spring water to be \"spring water\" as defined by law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    While the latter statute authorizes the state health department to adopt additional regulations, the parties have not identified any other state regulations on bottled water that would be expressly preempted by federal law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Defendants claim that \u00a7 21a-150e(c) does not apply here because it \"does not define spring water\" and instead \"provides for how the water that meets the Connecticut definition of spring water is to be collected in order to be certified for sale as bottled water by the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection.\" Doc. # 164-1 at 48. I disagree. While the statute doesn't use the word \"define,\" it describes the process by which spring water may be removed from the ground-an issue at the heart of what constitutes spring water under the federal standard.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Conn.

Given the pleading standard of substantive equivalence, there is no cause at this stage for me to decide whether the use of the word \"adjacent\" renders the state statute expressly preempted where the FDA has elected to use different words to \"encompass[ ] the intent\" of an adjacency requirement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    In their reply brief, doc. # 170 at 42, plaintiffs also point to Vt.

Code R. 12-030-003 ch. 21, \u00a7 2. But neither the statute nor the regulation uses the phrase \"spring water,\" and the regulation's only use of \"spring\" that is in any way connected to bottled water labeling requirements is the provision that \"all bottled water labels shall contain the following information ... source, i.e. private spring, private well, or the name of the Public water system supplying the water,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Fed.%20Reg.%2057%2C076\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , ch. 21, \u00a7 11.1.2(g)(4).
