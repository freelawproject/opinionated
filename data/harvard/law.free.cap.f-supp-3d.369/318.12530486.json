On March 10, 2006, Thuot executed a promissory note in the amount of $ 268,800 (\"Note\") in favor of Quicken Loans (\"Quicken\"). That same date, as security for the loan, Thuot granted a mortgage lien to the Mortgage Electronic Filing System (\"MERS\"), as nominee for Quicken (the \"Mortgage\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 18, 2010, MERS assigned the Mortgage to IndyMac Federal Bank FSB (\"IndyMac\") and recorded the assignment at the Worcester Registry of Deeds. On March 1, 2011, the Federal Deposit Insurance Agency, as receiver for IndyMac, assigned the Mortgage to Deutsche Bank and recorded the assignment in the Worcester Registry of Deeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural History and the Foreclosure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 25, 2009, Thuot filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy action in the United States Bankruptcy Court, for the District of Massachusetts. On March 31, 2009, IndyMac claiming an interest in the Mortgage, filed a \"Motion for Relief from Automatic Stay\" with the Bankruptcy Court. This motion was granted by the Bankruptcy Court on June 24, 2009. On October 10, 2009, the Bankruptcy action was terminated, without discharge of the Mortgage. On February 3, 2010, Thuot was sent a \"Complaint to Foreclose.\" The Complaint to Foreclose was recorded in the Worcester District Registry of Deeds on March 17, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 21, 2010, OneBankWest, issued a \"cash-for-keys notice\" to Thuot, referring to itself as the owner/servicer of the Property. The cash-for-keys notice also stated the Property had been obtained through a foreclosure sale. On July 27, 2010, Thuot accepted the offer of cash-for-keys, in the amount of $ 4,500.00. On August\n   7, 2010, believing that his home had been foreclosed, Thuot surrendered possession of the Property and obtained lodging for himself and his family at considerable expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 11, 2011, Thuot received a \"Notice of Intention To Foreclose\", as well as a \"Notice of Mortgagee's Sale of Real Estate\" stating the sale was to occur March 9, 2011, at 2:00 p.m. The notices referenced in the above paragraph were sent by Bennett &amp; McHugh, PC, a Connecticut law firm claiming to act on behalf of Deutsche Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On or about October 25, 2013, Thuot received correspondence from IndyMac Mortgage Services. This letter acknowledged that no foreclosure sale had occurred due to a \"court filing error.\" On or about November 12, 2013, Thuot received correspondence from Ocwen Loan Servicing (\"Ocwen\") stating it was a loan servicer, for Deutsche Bank. The correspondence also stated that the Property appeared vacant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 14, 2014, Thuot received from Ocwen an invitation to submit an application to its \"Home Retention Department.\" Thuot immediately hired counsel who assisted him completing and submitting the application. On or about April 26, 2014, Ocwen acknowledged receipt of Thuot s application for a \"Deed-In-Lieu of Foreclosure.\" On May 11, 2014, Thuot received correspondence from Ocwen, quoting a \"payoff.\" This quote included a number of line items, including:\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Plaintiff's name is spelled \"Thout\" in the caption of the Complaint, which is how I have spelled it in the caption to this opinion. However, it appears that the correct spelling is actually \"Thuot,\" which is how I will spell it hereafter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The Property was purchased by Thuot and Lisa Thuot, as tenants by the entirety. Lisa Thuot also signed the Note and the Mortgage. She is not a party to this action and it is not clear what interest she held in the Property at the time of the relevant events. The Court has a concern that Lisa Thuot may be a necessary party pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 19. Given that I am granting Defendant's motion to dismiss, this issue need not be resolved.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    On March 29, 2016, the FDIC recorded a \"Corrective Assignment\" to Deutsche Bank and recorded it in the Worcester County Registry of Deeds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    -Cash-For-Keys\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    -Attorney Eviction Fees\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    -Securing/Rekeying\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    -Foreclosure Expense\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    -Eviction Fee Costs\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    In 2014, Thuot, who was unaware that the foreclosure had not taken place, made an offer on a residence in Auburn, Massachusetts.

To date, Thuot has not reacquired possession of the Property. Thuot believes that Property has suffered significant damage and waste.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Discussion\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Deutsche Bank asserts that: Thuot's negligence claims (Count I-IV) must be dismissed because it owed him no duty, the economic loss doctrine bars recovery, the claims are based on false allegations and/or are barred by the statute of limitations. Deutsche Bank further assets that Thuot's fraud claims (Counts V and VI) fail because they are barred by the statute of limitations, fail to plead the elements of fraud, and fail to plead fraud with particularity. As to Thuot's Chapter 93A claim (Count VII), Deutsche Bank asserts it fails as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <em>\n     The Negligence Claims\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Thuot asserts that Deutsche Bank is liable to him for negligence as a result of its failure to file affidavits with the registry of deeds certifying that it had complied with Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 244 \u00a7 35B (requiring public notice of intent to foreclose), Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 244, \u00a7 14 (requiring notice be filed in registry of deeds where entity claims interest in the mortgage through assignment), Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 244, \u00a7 35C (requiring filing with the registry of deeds certifying compliance with the statute, including that the creditor foreclosing attest that it is the actual mortgagee), and Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 244, \u00a7 15A (requiring that mortgagee who takes possession of property notify all residential tenants of such property).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Regarding Counts I-III, it is not necessary to address whether Deutsche Bank owed a duty to Thuot, or whether his claims are barred by the economic loss doctrine. Given the posture of Thuot's allegations, I will focus instead on Deutsche Bank's assertion that the claims are inherently incorrect, or are barred by the statute of limitations. Thuot's claims are premised\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    on Deutsche Bank's alleged failure to comply with its substantive obligations under various statutory requirements, but on its alleged failure to comply with a procedural obligation to file affidavits and/or certificates of compliance. The long and short of it is that Deutsche Bank has submitted copies of the affidavits and/or certificates of compliance that it filed with the Worcester Registry of Deeds. More specifically, Deutsche Bank has submitted copies of the following: (1) an Affidavit Regarding Compliance With Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 244, \u00a7 35B, (2) an Affidavit Regarding Note Secured By Mortgage To be Foreclosed Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 244, \u00a7 35C, (3) an Affidavit Regarding Note Secured By Mortgage being Foreclosed (indicating that Deutsche Bank was the holder of the Note secured by the Mortgage), and (4) the Foreclosure Deed and affidavit of compliance with Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 244, \u00a7 14.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Since Thuot's negligence claims asserted in Counts I-III are based on Deutsche Bank's alleged failure to file the specified affidavits and/or certificates of compliance with the Worcester Registry of Deeds, I find, as a matter of\n    law, that he has failed to state a plausible claim for negligence on these Counts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Thuot's claim for violation of Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 244, \u00a7 15A also fails, albeit on different grounds. Thuot asserts that Deutsche Bank violated Section 15A by failing to notify him, in his capacity as a residential tenant, within 30 days of having taken possession of the Property following his surrender. Thuot's claim is based on Deutsche Bank's alleged failure to notify him and the appropriate governmental agencies that it was taking possession of the Property in 2010. This claim is barred by the applicable three year statute of limitations.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    <sup>\n     ,\n    </sup>\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <em>\n     Fraud Claims\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    In order to state a claim for fraud under Massachusetts law, a complaint must plead:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    '(1) that the statement was knowingly false; (2) that [defendant] made the false statement with the intent to deceive; (3) that the statement was material to the plaintiff['s] decision ...; (4) that the plaintiff[ ] reasonably relied on the statement; and (5) that the plaintiff[ ] w[as] injured as a result of [his] reliance.'\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    Of course, the complaint must also pass muster under Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), which imposes a so-called particularity requirement. A complaint must, therefore, include specifics about \"the time, place, and content of the alleged false representations.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <em>\n     Juarez v.

Thuot specifies one alleged instance \"\n    <em>\n     [a]mong others\"\n    </em>\n    of a \"concerted pattern of actions designed to fraudulently confuse and obfuscate [its] actions and Plaintiff's rights and responsibilities.\"\n    <em>\n     See Verified Complaint\n    </em>\n    , at \u00b6\u00b6 71-72 (emphasis supplied). He does not allege materiality, reasonable reliance or even injury.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541232,4170028\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/269/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at \u00b6\u00b6 70-75. Suffice to say, he has failed to allege the essential elements of a claim for fraud\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    has failed to plead fraud with particularity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Arguably, Thuot's fraud claims asserted in Count V suffers from the same deficiencies. However, it is not necessary for me to make this determination. The allegations asserted in Count V all relate to conduct which occurred in 2010. The statute of limitations for fraud is three years.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 260, \u00a7 2A. The latest such cause of action can have said to accrue is 2013 when Thuot became aware he was still the owner of record with respect to the Property. Accordingly, the claim is barred by the statute of limitations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <em>\n     The Chapter 93A Claim\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    As pled, Thuot's Chapter 93A claim is based on the same alleged facts and theories on which he relied to support his negligence and fraud claims-that is, his Chapter 93A claim is entirely derivative of his other claims. Deutsche Bank asserts that since those claims fail, as a matter of law, his Chapter 93A claims must be dismissed. I agree. In so finding I note that Chapter 93A has a four year statute of limitations rather than the three year statute of limitations which applies to Thuot's negligence and fraud claims. Nonetheless, Thuot's Chapter 93A claims based on unfair and deceptive acts and practices which occurred in 2010 would also be barred under the longer statute of limitations applicable to Chapter 93A claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Conclusion\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Defendant's Motion To Dismiss (Docket No. 10) is\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      <em>\n       granted\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-59\">\n     Defendant has submitted the following extrinsic materials with their motion to dismiss,\n     <em>\n      see Mem.
