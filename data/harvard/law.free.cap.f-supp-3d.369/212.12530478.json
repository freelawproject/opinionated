INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Plaintiff the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (\"RCFP\") challenges the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (\"FBI's\") response to a request for records relating to the FBI's impersonation of documentary filmmakers and film crews. In early 2017, it was publicly disclosed that the FBI had impersonated a documentary film crew to investigate cattle rancher Cliven D. Bundy (\"Bundy\") and his followers following a 2014 armed standoff between Bundy and law enforcement. RCFP subsequently filed an eight-part FOIA request seeking,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the production of records referencing any other instance of impersonation of a documentary filmmaker or film crew by the FBI in connection with a criminal investigation\n   since 2010 (\"Item 6\"), and records of professional credentials, websites, and business cards used by FBI agents in connection with the impersonation of documentary filmmakers or film crews since 2010 (\"Item 7\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   RCFP filed suit against the FBI and the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") in August 2017 after the FBI failed to release any documents in response to its FOIA request. The FBI subsequently issued a so-called \"\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   \" response pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(E) as to all records responsive to Items 6 and 7 and not related to the criminal investigations of Bundy and of one of his supporters, Gregory Burleson (\"Burleson\"), refusing to confirm or deny the existence of any such records. Defendants now move for summary judgment solely on the issue of whether the FBI's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response is appropriate, while RCFP cross-moves for summary judgment on the same issue. Because it finds that the impersonation of documentary film workers is an enforcement technique commonly known to the public, and that acknowledging the existence or absence of records would not reduce or nullify the effectiveness of that technique, the Court denies Defendants' motion and grants RCFP's cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The FBI's Impersonation of News Media\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While law enforcement impersonation of journalists is a practice that has been documented for decades, the FBI's impersonation of news media has received increased scrutiny in recent years. In 2014, it was widely reported that the FBI had impersonated an Associated Press (\"AP\") editor in a 2007 investigation of a Seattle high school student suspected of sending bomb threats.

Then FBI director James Comey sent a public letter to the editor of the New York Times on November 6, 2014 acknowledging the operation, representing that the FBI's impersonation of a journalist was a \"proper and appropriate\" technique under FBI and DOJ guidelines, and indicating that as of 2014, \"the use of such an unusual technique would probably require higher level approvals than in 2007, but would still be lawful and, in a rare case, appropriate.\" Letter from James Comey, FBI Director, to the Editor of the New York Times (Nov. 6, 2014), Townsend Decl.

Public Knowledge of Law Enforcement Impersonation of Documentary Film Workers\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court first addresses whether the impersonation of documentary filmmakers and film crews is an investigation technique not known to the public. Because of the intense publicization of the Bundy standoff and of the government's subsequent criminal investigation and prosecution, the Court finds that it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In its motion for partial summary judgment, RCFP argues that the investigation technique at issue in this case is publicly known for two reasons.

Reply 3 (\"Documentary filmmakers may or may not be members of the news media, and not all members of the news media are documentary filmmakers.\").

The government's public revelation that it had impersonated a documentary film crew to investigate Bundy and his supporters was widely disseminated in the media and triggered follow-up reports covering the details of the operation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Devereaux &amp; Aaronson,\n   <em>\n    America Reloaded.\n   </em>\n   Defendants argue that the technique is not well-known \"outside the single publically acknowledged instance in the\n   <em>\n    Burleson\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Bundy\n   </em>\n   case,\" Defs.' Reply 4, but that is all that is needed in order for the technique itself to become known. The Court agrees with RCFP that it is implausible for Defendants to assert the technique is secret simply because it has only been acknowledged to have been used in one instance. What other situations the technique may have been used in is still a secret, but the fact that it is a technique law enforcement uses is not, and Defendants accordingly cannot justify the FBI's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response on the grounds that revealing whether documents exist would disclose an unknown law enforcement technique.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   2.

The Court is not entirely convinced that the line of cases cited by Defendants sets out a different standard from that articulated by RCFP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   But in\n   any event, the Court finds that Exemption 7(E) does not warrant a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response here because disclosing the existence or nonexistence of records relating to the impersonation of documentary film workers would not reduce or nullify the effectiveness of the technique. Defendants do not specifically argue that disclosure here would \"reduce or nullify\" the effectiveness of the technique, but extensively argue that such disclosure would risk circumvention of the law. Because those arguments are analogous, the Court considers them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants argue that a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response is necessary to prevent a reasonable risk of circumvention of the law for two reasons. First, they contend that disclosing law enforcement's impersonation of documentary film workers in contexts other than the Bundy standoff investigation \"would allow criminals to reasonably discern whether or not the FBI has employed this technique to investigate their own criminal activity.\" Defs' Mem. Supp. 11-12. This would in turn allow criminals to \"predict FBI investigative efforts targeting their activities, thereby allowing them to pre-emptively destroy or tamper with valuable evidence, intimidate or eliminate potential witnesses, and create false alibis,\" as well as \"embolden some criminals to continue ongoing criminal activity\" if the FBI has not used the technique against them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Second, Defendants argue that acknowledging the existence or absence of records would provide criminals with \"key information about the frequency of the technique's use,\" which in turn would allow criminals to \"alter their patterns of behavior, areas of operation, contacts, and other behaviors to circumvent FBI undercover operations,\" as well as to \"judge whether they should completely avoid any contacts with documentary film crews.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   RCFP retorts that simply indicating whether records responsive to the request exist would not trigger the harms Defendants describe. Pl.'s Mem. Supp. 16-19. RCFP further argues that the \"reduce or nullify\" standard has only been applied in non-\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   cases and is inapplicable to the situation here. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On their face, none of Defendants' arguments support the conclusion that revealing whether the FBI has records relating to additional instances of law enforcement impersonation of documentary film workers would reduce or nullify the effectiveness of the technique. Simply revealing that the FBI has any such records would not allow criminals to discern whether or not the FBI has used the technique to investigate their own, specific criminal activity, because all a criminal would know is the existence of an unquantified number of records. For the same reason, acknowledging the existence of records, without any indication about the number or type of records found, would not provide any information about the frequency of the technique's use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Revealing that the FBI does not have any responsive records would conclusively establish that the FBI has not used the technique outside of the Bundy investigation since 2010, which might well \"embolden some criminals to continue ongoing criminal activity,\" Defs' Mem. Supp. 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   And revealing that the FBI has responsive records would establish that it has used the technique at least once more, suggesting that the Bundy standoff investigation was not an isolated, one-off case. But given the information already publicly available to criminals, this would not reduce or nullify the effectiveness of the technique when it is actually used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   With the information already in the public sphere, criminals can already discern that the FBI has used the technique in the past-with the extensive media coverage of the Bundy standoff investigation even yielding information on various missteps made by FBI agents when using the technique,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Devereaux &amp; Aaronson,\n   <em>\n    America Reloaded\n   </em>\n   28 (describing the poor filmmaking techniques used by FBI agents during Operation Longbow and noting that \"[h]ad [the suspects] known anything about filmmaking, the FBI's on-camera interviews would have blown their cover\"). While former FBI director James Comey described the impersonation of news media as a \"rare\" and \"unusual\" technique in 2014, he also acknowledged that deception in undercover operations \"has long been a critical tool in fighting crime.\" Letter from James Comey to the Editor of the New York Times 2. And criminals can further determine that the FBI has gone through the effort of issuing detailed guidance on the impersonation of documentary filmmakers and crews.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   FBI Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This publicly available information suggests that the impersonation of documentary film workers in the Bundy standoff investigation was not an isolated instance, and that the FBI has either used the technique elsewhere, or may use it elsewhere. Accordingly, with the information available today, a criminal approached by purported documentary film workers pitching an upcoming project would already be able to conclude that the film workers are unlikely to be FBI agents, but that they could be. The FBI does not explain how the existence or absence of additional documents would change this calculus at all in the criminal's decision as to what to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Ultimately, the Court agrees with RCFP that the type of disclosure sought to be prevented by the FBI's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response would not reduce or nullify the effectiveness of law enforcement impersonation of documentary film workers. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Petrucelli\n   </em>\n   , which involved the invocation of Exemption 7(E) to withhold specific records relating to a law enforcement technique, here the exemption is used to withhold the potential existence of any such records in the first place. The Court does not see how disclosing whether any records exist could reduce or nullify the technique's effectiveness. The determination of whether disclosure of any information in the documents sought could cause harm must be made utilizing the standard FOIA tools applied on a document-by-document basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
