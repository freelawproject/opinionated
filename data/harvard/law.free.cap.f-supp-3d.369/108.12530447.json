Referencing the brief submitted on his behalf to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, Cutchin appears to argue that he could not have committed a theft offense, which requires specific intent, because the 90 bus was stationary when he boarded, and he could not have committed \"theft until the bus began operating.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1 (Excerpt from Reply Brief of the Appellant) at 12.

Because the DVR Request indicates that Santiago escorted Cutchin off the bus, Cutchin appears to argue that Mu\u00f1oz was never on the bus, Pl.'s Facts \u00b6 8, and therefore could not have observed Cutchin board the bus without paying a fare. The Court does\n   not agree. Whether Santiago, or Mu\u00f1oz, or both, escorted Cutchin off the bus, Cutchin's reliance on the portion of the DVR Request indicating the Santiago escorted him off the bus does not rebut the officers' representation that Mu\u00f1oz had previously been aboard the bus and was in a position to observe Cutchin when he boarded. Cutchin ignores, and apparently expects the Court to disregard, the preceding sentence of the DVR Request which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   R/O [Mu\u00f1oz] REPORTS WHILE ON A CASUAL CLOTHES ASSIGNMENT ON 01292013 AT APROX 1740HRS AT THE 90 BUS STAND AT THE ANACOSTIA METRO STATION OBSERVING A1 BOARD THE BUS MAKING NO ATTEMPT TO PAY THE ESTABLISHED FARE\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 3 (DVR Request).

Cutchin also identifies a purported conflict as to which officer or officers approached him on the bus and which officer or officers escorted him off the bus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. According to Mu\u00f1oz's DVR Request, Santiago escorted Cutchin off the bus,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 3 (DVR Request), and at trial Mu\u00f1oz testified that he escorted Cutchin off the bus,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1 at 52:24-53:13. In a third example, Cutchin notes inconsistencies as to which officer removed a handgun from his person: before a grand jury, Cutchin asserts, Mu\u00f1oz testified that both he and Santiago retrieved the gun,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, at a motion hearing, Mu\u00f1oz testified that uniformed officers retrieved the gun,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and at trial, Mu\u00f1oz testified that he retrieved the gun,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1 at 62:12-63:5. The discrepancies Cutchin identifies may be disputed issues of fact, but these facts are not material to the qualified immunity question, because retrieval of the gun, by whichever officer, occurred after Mu\u00f1oz had developed a reasonable belief that Cutchin did not pay his bus fare and after Cutchin's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Lastly, Cutchin references other matters which allegedly occurred during or after his arrest, namely, failing to read Cutchin his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, conducting an investigation after he was handcuffed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, and tampering with SmarTrip card records,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. None of these matters is probative of the officers' perceptions leading to and ending with the decision to arrest Cutchin. Rather,\n   these matters pertain to the underlying criminal case, the merits of which have been resolved by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, and are not properly reviewed by this Court in this civil case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The defendants have demonstrated, and Cutchin has not disputed, that Mu\u00f1oz observed Cutchin board the bus, and take a seat without paying his fare. A reasonable officer in the defendants' position would not have known whether Cutchin had transferred from another bus (after having paid the fare) to the 90 bus at the Anacostia Metro Station within the two-hour period when a transfer would not require payment of an additional fare. Rather, on these facts, the Court agrees that Mu\u00f1oz and Santiago have demonstrated that they reasonably believed that they had probable cause to arrest Cutchin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tillman v.
