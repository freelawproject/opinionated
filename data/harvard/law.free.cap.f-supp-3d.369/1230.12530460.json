BYRON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This cause comes before the Court on Defendant's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 50. The Court granted Defendant's motion at the end of the defense case, having deferred ruling following Plaintiff's presentation of evidence. The Court articulated on the record its reasoning for granting Defendant's motion, and this Order incorporates the Court's earlier pronouncement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff B. Stanley McCullars brought this\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   action against Defendant Grant Maloy, individually and in his official capacity as Clerk of the Circuit Court and Comptroller of Seminole County, Florida (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Clerk\n   </strong>\n   \"), for alleged First Amendment violations. (Doc. 1). The Court granted summary judgment in favor of Mr. Maloy in his individual capacity and the trial proceeded against Defendant in his official capacity. (Doc. 72). This suit arises from Plaintiff's controversial social media comments that precipitated the end of his employment with Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Posts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 16, 2017, State Attorney Aramis Ayala declared publicly that her office would not seek the death penalty in capital murder cases. Ms. Ayala made this statement in the wake of a tragic double-murder wherein Mr. Markeith Loyd killed his pregnant girlfriend and subsequently murdered Orlando Police Department officer\n   LT Debra Clayton as she attempted to apprehend him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another officer was fatally injured in a traffic accident connected to this crime-spree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 19, 2017, at approximately 10:30 p.m. while at home, Plaintiff posted comments from his Facebook account criticizing the State Attorney's decision. The Plaintiff posted a comment to another individual's Facebook page concerning Ms. Ayala's position on the death penalty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Mr. McCullars wrote that Ayala, the first African-American State Attorney in Florida, \"should get the death penalty,\" and followed this post by writing Ms. Ayala \"should be tarred and feathered if not hung from a tree.\" (Def. Ex. 6). Later that same night, Plaintiff made another Facebook post that said: \"Yep, it was wrong for me to post that. I let my anger at her efforts to thwart justice get the better of me. No excuses.\" Plaintiff strenuously denies that the post was racially motivated, claiming that he was unaware of Ayala's race when he made the posts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The posts were deleted by a third party shortly after they were posted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Impact of Plaintiff's Facebook Comments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff's comments literally went viral. Almost immediately after the posts spread across the internet, Plaintiff McCullars was identified as a Clerk's Office employee. The next morning, March 20, 2017, the Clerk's Office's phones were ringing off the hook with complaints. Ms. Lia Denning, the head of human resources, testified that citizens calling the Clerk's Office were upset, with some people crying while others used profanity to express their outrage. Mr. McCullars' comments were largely characterized by concerned citizens as racist. Some citizens requested that the Clerk of Court, Mr. Maloy, return their call. The volume of telephone calls was so significant that two additional staff members were pulled from their duties to answer phone calls. Ms. Denning characterized the volume of telephone traffic as incredible, and the work environment was a nightmare with media converging outside the building. Ms. Amy Midyette, one of Plaintiff's co-workers, corroborated Ms. Denning's description of the volume of citizen complaints, adding that calls were so numerous that the Office's voicemail was overwhelmed. Additionally, the Clerk's Office received many emails related to the Facebook posts. Ms. Denning was, therefore, tasked with reviewing Plaintiff's social media posts as part of an on-going investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   General counsel for the Clerk's Office, Ms. Susan Dietrich, further corroborated Ms. Denning's testimony that on Monday morning the phones were constantly ringing with citizens complaining about Plaintiff's Facebook posts. Ms. Dietrich testified that personnel were removed from their normal duties for 2-3 days following the posts. Plaintiff's actions caused Ms. Dietrich to spend time researching First Amendment issues and reviewing the Clerk's options. Ms. Jenny Spencer, the\n   Plaintiff's supervisor, called a meeting of 22 staff members to discuss the situation and to provide guidance on dealing with citizens and the media. Ms. Dietrich also related that protests were being threatened in response to the Facebook posts. And Ms. Dietrich had meetings with Mr. Maloy to discuss the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Dietrich testified that Plaintiff's posts violated the Clerk's Code of Ethics (contained in the deputy clerk handbook), which provides: \"We shall avoid any activities that would impugn the dignity of the clerk's office.\" (Def. Ex. 55, p. 3). Ms. Dietrich explained that Florida Rules of Court identify the Office of the Clerk of Court as an arm of the judiciary. Accordingly, Ms. Dietrich was concerned that Mr. McCullars' comments reflected poorly upon the integrity and impartiality of the Clerk's Office, thereby undermining the public's confidence in the administration of justice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This concern was echoed by Mr. Maloy, the Clerk of Court, who explained that citizens access the court through the Clerk's Office, and Plaintiff's comments negatively impact upon public confidence in the administration of justice. Moreover, Plaintiff's comments had a negative impact on office morale and, if left unchecked, would have impacted the Clerk's ability to recruit and retain a diverse workforce. For example, Plaintiff's supervisor, Ms. Spencer is a highly educated Finance Director with vast experience in governmental accounting. Ms. Spencer testified that she could not continue to work with Mr. McCullars in light of his comments which she perceived as racist and impugning the dignity of the office. Mr. Maloy testified that the loss of Ms. Spencer, via her potential resignation, would have a detrimental impact on the operation of his office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff McCullars was not a line employee; he was a supervisor occupying the number two position in the finance department of the Clerk's Office. Plaintiff testified at trial and acknowledged that impartiality is important to the work of the Clerk's Office. Plaintiff McCullars admitted the importance of discharging his duties in an impartial manner and avoiding the appearance if bias. Mr. McCullars also acknowledged that the Clerk's Office is racially and ethnically diverse. He conceded that his comments on Facebook were made in anger, and he agreed that his comments did not address the merits of the death penalty or State Attorney Ayala's position on that subject. Plaintiff knew his comments generated public outcry, but he claims his suggestion that Ms. Ayala receive the death penalty or that she be tarred and feathered and hung from a tree was misconstrued by a handful of people who engaged in a crusade to have him fired. In contrast, Mr. McCullars' letter of resignation, submitted on March 22, 2017, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Please consider this letter as my official resignation with an effective separation date of April 3, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   My social media posts of last weekend resulted in the Clerk and Clerk staff spending resources answering questions from some members of the public. I believe my resignation will help the Clerk's Office to more quickly return to the people's business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Def. Ex. 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Community Leaders Respond\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   State Attorney Ayala testified that on March 19, 2017, she began receiving calls\n   by people who had seen Plaintiff's Facebook posts. Ms. Ayala took the threat literally, and she was offended and concerned for her safety and for the safety of her children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Ayala went to Plaintiff's Facebook page, clicked on his profile, and saw that he was employed by the Clerk of Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On Monday morning, Ms. Ayala directed her staff to call Mr. Maloy to express her displeasure. Mr. Maloy testified to the importance of maintaining a positive working relationship with the community and its leaders, including Ms. Ayala, and how Plaintiff's posts caused him to apologize to the State Attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Other community leaders beyond State Attorney Ayala voiced their concern to the Clerk of Court. By March 20, 2017, the day after Plaintiff's Facebook comments, the Orange County Democratic Party passed a resolution condemning Mr. McCullars' comments, resolving that \"the Orange County Democratic Party expresses its outrage over the terroristic threat made by Stan McCullars towards State Attorney Aramis Ayala, and calls upon Clerk Grant Maloy to terminate Stan McCullars immediately.\" (Def. Ex. 28). This resolution was sent to Mr. Maloy on March 22, 2017 at 8:44 a.m., three days after the Facebook post. (Def. Ex. 47). The negative impact from Plaintiff's comments did not subside quickly. Plaintiff's friend and former co-worker, Ms. Danalee Ellner testified that the atmosphere in the office after Mr. McCullars' posts was like a \"grenade\" went off, with the buzz about it lasting for weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pastor Roman Oliver, a community leader in Sanford, Florida, also testified at trial. Pastor Oliver spent a career as an educator and administrator before taking a leadership role at Saint Paul Baptist church in Sanford.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pastor Oliver is active in the African-American community on issues of economic, social, and political justice. He was involved in organizing peaceful protests over the killing of Trayvon Martin, an African-American teenager shot by George Zimmerman as he walked home from a convenience store where he had purchased candy. Pastor Oliver quickly learned of Mr. McCullar's posts and his affiliation with the Clerk's office. Plaintiff's position in the judicial system concerned Pastor Oliver and other community leaders, and they met with Mr. Maloy. Because the Clerk of Court had placed Mr. McCullars on administrative leave, no protests took place. However, Pastor Oliver testified that had the Clerk's office declined to act, peaceful protests would have ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Florida Representative Geraldine Thompson testified as an expert witness for the Defendant on African-American history and culture, including the prevalence of lynching in Florida and more particularly in Central Florida. After providing a comprehensive history of this dark chapter in American history, Representative Thompson opined that it is reasonable to foresee that the African-American community would interpret Plaintiff's statement that Ms. Ayala should be tarred and feathered and hung from a tree to be a reference to lynching.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Representative\n   Thompson also provided a scholarly history of racial tension and segregation in Sanford, where the Seminole County Courthouse is located. She concluded her expert testimony by explaining how the Sanford community reacted to the killing of Trayvon Martin and how Plaintiff's comments, coming a year later, would elicit public outcry in the community. Representative Thompson explained how the African-American community has mistrust for the judicial system, making Plaintiff's comments capable of undermining confidence in the Courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Judgment as a matter of law should only be granted if no objectively reasonable jury, based on the evidence and inferences adduced at trial and through the exercise of impartial judgment, could reach the verdict reached.\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Stated differently, the party moving for judgment as a matter of law must show that the trial evidence \"is so overwhelmingly [in its favor] that a reasonable jury could not arrive at a contrary verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Middlebrooks v. Hillcrest Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090326\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/256/1241/#p1246\">\n    256 F.3d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1246 (11th Cir. 2001). However, where there is substantial evidence in the trial record which would allow reasonable minds to reach different conclusions, judgment as a matter of law is inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    Mee Indus. v.

In considering a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district court must review the record and draw all reasonable inferences derived therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219901\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/1160/#p1173\">\n    597 F.3d at 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Comments Made as Employee or Private Citizen\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court must determine whether Plaintiff's comments were made within the scope of his employment or in his capacity as a private citizen. When government employees speak \"as citizens about matters of public concern, they must face only those speech restrictions that are necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and effectively.\"\n   <em>\n    Garcetti v.
