Moreover, Plaintiff was not litigating this case at the time the request for admissions was filed and the responses were served, and thus, she has no personal knowledge of whether the responsive document was, in fact, ever served. Accordingly, her contention that Defendant's counsel has only now fabricated this document in response to her arguments is speculative at best.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff also contends that she was cross-examined using her own deposition transcript that she never had an opportunity to review before trial. (Dkt. 375-2 at 20-21). Plaintiff was deposed less than 30 days before the trial began, and, according to Defendant, Defendant's counsel emailed her a copy of her deposition transcript on June 8, 2018, ten days before the trial commenced. (Dkt. 379-4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 379-5 at 12-13). In her reply papers, Plaintiff does not contend that she never received this email; rather, she argues that \"Defendant's email was not properly served.\" (Dkt. 380 at 17). The Court addressed this issue during the trial, and without the benefit of the trial transcript, it is challenging for the Court to sort through Plaintiff's allegations.

Because Plaintiff has not established how at all she was prejudiced by the alleged late service of her deposition transcript, the Court finds no reason to grant her request for a new\n   trial on this ground and if there was any error, it was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To the extent Plaintiff argues that it was improper for the undersigned to caution Plaintiff when she was testifying during trial (Dkt. 375-2 at 31-34), Plaintiff's contentions provide no basis for a new trial. The Court has the authority to exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of how evidence is presented at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 611(a) (providing that the \"court should exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to: ... make those procedures effective for determining the truth ... avoid wasting time ... [and] protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment\"). Moreover, the challenged statements occurred outside the presence of the jurors and had no impact on their view of the case. The Second Circuit has observed that in presiding over a trial, a district judge \"acts as more than a mere moderator or umpire. [Her] function is to set the tone of the proceedings and exercise sufficient control to insure that the trial will be an orderly one in which the jury will have the evidence clearly presented.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.
