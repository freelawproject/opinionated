I find it useful to provide an overview of the relevant orders and opinions in order to arrive at my understanding of the law. I ultimately conclude that the pre-2015 FCC guidance on autodialer functions remains good law, and that under this guidance, the ExpressText and EZ Texting programs do not qualify as autodialers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The 2003 FCC Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In 2003, the FCC addressed whether \"predictive dialers\" are autodialers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2003 Order,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 129-33. \"A predictive dialer is an automated dialing system that uses a complex set of algorithms to automatically dial consumers' telephone numbers in a manner that 'predicts' the time when a consumer will answer the phone and a telemarketer will be available to take the call.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8 n.31;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131 (\"[A] predictive dialer is equipment that dials numbers and, when certain computer software is attached, also assists telemarketers in predicting when a sales agent will be available to take calls.\"). The FCC noted that \"in most cases, telemarketers program the numbers to be called into the equipment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131. Members of the telemarketing industry argued that predictive dialers do not qualify as autodialers because they do not dial \"randomly or sequentially,\" i.e., (1) they dial from a database of numbers, and (2) they dial \"in a manner that maximizes efficiencies for call centers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The FCC rejected the industry members' argument and held that predictive dialers do fall under the statutory definition of an ATDS. Regarding the use of a database of numbers, the FCC wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   In the past, telemarketers may have used dialing equipment to create and dial 10-digit telephone numbers arbitrarily. As one commenter points out, the evolution of the teleservices industry has progressed to the point where using lists of numbers is far more cost effective....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ... [T]o exclude ... equipment that use[s] predictive dialing software from the definition of \"automated telephone dialing equipment\" simply because it relies on a given set of numbers would lead to an unintended result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 132-33. Thus, the FCC reasoned, while early autodialing equipment created and dialed numbers on its own, technology has developed such that equipment that relies on lists of numbers is more effective, and technological advances should not enable telemarketers to avoid TCPA liability. In response to the claim that predictive dialers are not autodialers because they do not dial numbers arbitrarily, the FCC noted that \"the basic function of [early autodialing equipment and predictive dialers] ... has not changed-the\n   <em>\n    capacity\n   </em>\n   to dial numbers without human intervention.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132. In other words, there is no substantive difference between predictive-dialing software and software that dials numbers randomly or sequentially, because both dial numbers without human intervention.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131 n.432 (\"Some dialers are capable of being programmed for sequential or random dialing; some are not\" (quoting industry comments) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   I interpret the 2003 Order as holding that a piece of equipment can constitute an autodialer if it relies on a list of numbers, so long as the equipment also has the capacity to dial those numbers without human intervention. This reading comports with the FCC's implication that predictive dialers qualify as autodialers because of the pairing between the database of numbers and the predictive-dialing software, i.e., the component of the equipment that operates without human intervention.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131 (\"[A] predictive dialer is equipment that dials numbers and,\n   <em>\n    when certain computer software is attached\n   </em>\n   , also assists telemarketers in predicting when a sales agent will be available to take calls.

The FCC's subsequent orders, which focus on the absence of human intervention as the defining characteristic of an autodialer, lend further support to my interpretation of the 2003 Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20FCC%20Rcd%20559\">\n    23 FCC Rcd. 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13 (2008) [hereinafter 2008 Order] (rejecting the argument \"that a predictive dialer meets the definition of autodialer only when it randomly or sequentially generates telephone numbers, not when it dials numbers from customer telephone lists,\" and noting that it had already found \"that the evolution of the teleservices industry had progressed to the point where dialing lists of numbers was far more cost effective, but that the basic function of such dialing equipment, had not changed-the capacity to dial numbers without human intervention\"); Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n    27 FCC Rcd. 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,391 \u00b6 2 n.5 (2012) [hereinafter 2012 Order] (\"The Commission has emphasized that [the definition of an ATDS] covers any equipment that has the specified\n   <em>\n    capacity\n   </em>\n   to generate numbers and dial them without human intervention regardless of whether the numbers called are randomly or sequentially generated or come from calling lists.\").

As a result, the ruling's reference to \"dialing random or sequential numbers\" cannot simply mean dialing from a set list of numbers in random or other sequential order: if that were so, there would be no difference between \"dialing random or sequential numbers\" and \"dialing a set list of numbers,\" even though the ruling draws a divide between the two. It follows that the ruling's reference to \"dialing random or sequential numbers\" means generating those numbers and then dialing them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted) (first quoting 2015 Order,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10; then citing 2015 Order,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). The court went on to state that the 2003 Order \"reinforce[s] th[e] understanding\" that \"the [2015 Order's] reference to 'dialing random or sequential numbers' means generating those numbers and then dialing them,\" because in the 2003 Order, the FCC also drew a distinction between \"calling from a list of numbers\" and \" 'creating and dialing' a random or arbitrary list of numbers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\"In its 2003 ruling addressing predictive dialers, the Commission observed that, '[i]n the past, telemarketers may have used dialing equipment to\n   <em>\n    create and dial\n   </em>\n   10-digit telephone numbers arbitrarily.' But the industry had 'progressed to the point where' it had become 'far more cost effective' instead to 'us[e] lists of numbers.' \" (quoting 2003 Order,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 132) ). Thus, the D.C. Circuit concluded, because the FCC \"espouse[d] ... competing interpretations in the same order\" regarding whether a device must be able to generate random or sequential numbers to qualify as an autodialer, the 2015 Order was not \"consistent with reasoned decisionmaking.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 703.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The D.C.

Thus, the court concluded: \"The order's lack of clarity about which functions qualify a device as an autodialer compounds the unreasonableness of the Commission's expansive understanding of when a device has the 'capacity' to perform the necessary functions.
