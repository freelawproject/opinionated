Francis Cissna, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, and USCIS California Service Center Director Kathy A. Baran's Motion to Dismiss [ECF No. 37]. The Court has carefully reviewed Plaintiffs, Canal A. Media Holding, LLC (\"Canal Media\") and Erick Archila's (\"Archila['s]\") First Amended Complaint [ECF No. 36] (\"FAC\" or \"Amended Complaint\"); Plaintiffs' Response in Opposition [ECF No. 38] (\"Pls.'

For the following reasons, the Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case concerns the USCIS's decision to deny an L-1A petition filed by Canal Media, a U.S. subsidiary of Guatemalan news and entertainment media company Canal Antigua, S.A. (\"Canal Antigua\"), at the behest of the parent company, which sought to transfer the parent company's president, Mr. Archila, to Canal Media. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 2). Canal Media sought to employ Mr. Archila as its president to oversee the company's expansion into the U.S. broadcasting and media market, but the USCIS denied the L-1A petition because Canal Media was not Canal Antigua's subsidiary. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). The USCIS's conclusion is an abrupt shift in the agency's adjudicatory criteria for L-1A petitions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under 8 C.F.R. section 214.2(l)(ii)(K), defining \"subsidiary,\" a U.S. company is a qualifying subsidiary if it is owned and controlled by a foreign company. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs allege Canal Media satisfies the ownership and control prong of the \"subsidiary\" test. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). Nevertheless, the USCIS concluded Canal Media is not Canal Antigua's subsidiary because the latter never made a capital contribution in exchange for its ownership interest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). Plaintiffs assert no statute, regulation, or precedent supports the USCIS's \"capital contribution\" requirement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). This new \"capital contribution\" rule contravenes the agency's published rule, constitutes an impermissible retroactive application of a new adjudicatory policy, and violates Canal Media's due process of law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). Plaintiffs state the \"Court should reverse USCIS's unlawful actions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Amended Complaint goes on to detail the statutory and regulatory framework governing L-1A non-immigrant petitions, including working for a foreign company with a qualifying relationship to a U.S. employer for at least one year in the preceding three years, and the intention the person will work in an executive or managerial capacity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9 (citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-12). Plaintiffs describe the corporate relationship between Canal Antigua and Canal Media. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-15). On November 25, 2016, Canal Media filed an I-129 petition to secure L-1A status for Mr. Archila, Canal Antigua's former president. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). At the time, Mr. Archila was in the United States on a B-2 tourist status. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs devote several paragraphs of the Amended Complaint describing how the visa adjudication policy has made an abrupt shift following the 2016 presidential election. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-26). Plaintiffs return to their charge the USCIS denied the L-1A petition based on a novel \"capital contribution\" requirement, notwithstanding Canal Antigua has complete ownership and control over Canal Media. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-33). Plaintiffs attach to the Amended Complaint the USCIS's July 24, 2017 denial of the I-129 petition. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30 (citing Ex. A) ). On \"information and belief,\" Plaintiffs allege:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   USCIS's insistence that Canal A Media present proof that it received a \"capital contribution\" from its Guatemalan parent corporation to establish that it is a \"subsidiary\" results from an internal policy directive within USCIS, adopted in furtherance of the President's \"Buy American and Hire American\" Executive Order and the Trump Administration's broader agenda to curtail lawful immigration to the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs state the Court has federal question subject matter jurisdiction under\n   28 U.S.C. section 1331 because the case arises under the laws of the United States; the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), related agency regulations, and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. section 701. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege the USCIS issued its decision denying Canal Media's L-1A petition on July 24, 2017, and Plaintiffs have exhausted administrative remedies. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). They assert the APA allows judicial review of agency decisions when, as here, no law or regulation requires interagency review before seeking judicial review. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs state four claims for relief. The first claim is titled, \"Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action in Violation of the APA and the INA,\" in which Plaintiffs allege the USCIS's denial of the petition should be set aside under 5 U.S.C. section 706(s)(A). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   13-14). The second claim is titled, \"Failure to Follow Notice and Comment Procedures,\" alleging the USCIS's retroactive application of its new \"capital contribution\" rule violates the APA's requirement agencies post notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register and allow public comment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   14-15). The third claim is titled, \"Impermissible Retroactive Application of Agency's New Rule,\" raising allegations similar to the second claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   15-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The fourth claim is titled, \"Violation of Canal A Media's Right to Due Process\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   16), in which Plaintiffs allege:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   USCIS Director Francis Cissna and members of the Trump Administration ... caused USCIS to adopt adjudicatory policies specifically implemented to increase the denial rate of L-1A petitions without regard to actual eligibility under the statute and regulations. These policy changes were responsible for USCIS's denial of Canal A Media's L-1A petition ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60 (alteration added) ). The due process claim also relies on allegations about the retroactive application of a new requirement for establishing a subsidiary relationship, which according to Plaintiffs, the USCIS has used as a \"cover for the denial of otherwise approvable petitions ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61 (alteration added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs ask the Court to declare the USCIS's denial of the L-1A petition as unlawful; enjoin the USCIS from deciding cases based on Buy American and Hire American or other pronouncements of the White House; enjoin U.S. government officials in the White House, DHS, and the USCIS from denying L-1A petitions by using criteria not disclosed to the public; require the USCIS approve Canal Media's L-1A and change-of-status petition on behalf of Mr. Archila; and award Plaintiffs their fees and costs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Parties' Briefing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants seek dismissal of the case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), contending the Court lacks jurisdiction under the APA because Mr. Archila is still in removal proceedings before an immigration judge (\"IJ\"), and so there has not been a final agency action under the APA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 1, 7-12). Defendants explain it is irrelevant that remedies available in removal proceedings before the IJ are not identical to that which Plaintiffs seek here -- a grant of the application for\n   L-1A status. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply 1-5). Defendants argue Plaintiffs' claims are barred by 8 U.S.C. section 1252(g), which eliminates judicial review over \"any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien ... arising from the decision or action ... to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders[.]\" (Mot. 12-14; Reply 5-7 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(9) (alterations added) ) ). Finally, Defendants assert 8 U.S.C. section 1252(b)(9) channels Plaintiffs' claims to the court of appeals as part of review of a final order of removal, not to a district court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 14-17; Reply 4-5; Defs.' Surreply 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For their part, Plaintiffs insist DHS's denial of the L-1A petition and change of status application is a final agency action because: (1) the denial meets the two-prong finality test of\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. Spear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p177\">\n    520 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177-78,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p177\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p177\">\n    137 L.Ed.2d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) ; (2) ongoing immigration proceedings against Mr. Archila do not affect finality as the immigration court lacks jurisdiction to review the denial of a nonimmigrant visa petition; and (3) the authorities Defendants rely on actually show why the I-129 petition denial challenged here is final agency action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 7-18). Plaintiffs state the IJ's recent decision to continue Mr. Archila's removal proceeding reflects the finality of the USCIS's decision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Surreply 1-3). Plaintiffs next argue the denial of the L-1A petition does not \"arise from\" removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. section 1252(g) or 1252(b)(9), and the Eleventh Circuit lacks jurisdiction to consider the merits of the L-1A petition denial on direct review of a final removal order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 18-20; Pls.' Surreply 3-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court considers these competing arguments in its discussion below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
