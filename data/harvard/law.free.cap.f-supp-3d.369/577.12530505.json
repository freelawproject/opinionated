(collectively \"LKQ\" or \"Plaintiffs\") for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. For the reasons discussed below, the Court will GRANT Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Since April of 2017, the United States Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\"), an agency within Defendant, United States Department of Homeland Security, has executed more than 165 seizures of LKQ replacement automotive grilles (\"Repair Grilles\") because of alleged infringement of U.S. trademarks. (D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 2-4). Seizures have occurred at the Port of Savannah, Georgia, Port of Long Beach, California, and Port of International Falls, Minnesota. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). For each seizure, CBP issued written notification to LKQ identifying the property seized and outlining the processes by which Plaintiff could challenge the seizure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5; D.I. 11, Ex. 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The notices explain the petition option as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Petition\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   : You may file a petition with this office within 30 days from the date of this letter in accordance with title 19 United States Code (U.S.C.), section 1618 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201618\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) and title 19, Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), section 171.1 and 171.2 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20171.1\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 171.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171.2 ), seeking remission of the forfeiture. The petition does not\n   need to be in any specific form, but it must describe the property involved, identify the date and place of the seizure, include all the facts and circumstances which you believe warrant relief from forfeiture, and must include proof of your interest in or claim to the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   If you are dissatisfied with the petition decision (initial petition or supplemental petition), you will have an additional 60 days from the date of the initial petition decision or 60 days from the date of the supplemental petition decision, or such other time as specified by the Fines, Penalties and Forfeitures Officer to file a claim to the property, along with the required cost bond, requesting referral of the matter to the U.S. Attorney's Office for judicial action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   At any point prior to the forfeiture of the property, you may request a referral to the U.S. Attorney by filing a claim and cost bond.\n   <em>\n    Please see section 4 of this letter for information on how to file a claim and cost bond\n   </em>\n   . If you take such action after filing a petition for relief, your pending petition will be withdrawn from consideration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (D.I. 11, Ex. 3 at 2-3). After receiving the notices, LKQ submitted at least 81 petitions for remission or mitigation. (D.I. 1 \u00b6 6). Those petitions were \"referred to the Chief, Intellectual Property Rights Branch [of the CBP] for a recommendation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs characterize the petitions by category: (1) grilles that were seized but then deemed to be returned \"because LKQ was licensed to make those grilles under its design patent license agreements;\" (2) grilles that were seized and then deemed to be returned, but for which CBP \"alleges it had probable cause at the time to seize because the Automakers told CBP that the grilles violated their rights;\" (3) \"grilles that CBP now acknowledges are not counterfeit but that CBP, instead, now alleges are confusingly similar to the asserted mark;\" (4) \"grilles that CBP maintains are allegedly counterfeit;\" (5) grilles \"that have been seized on the basis that they are counterfeit but that CBP has not yet formalized its seizure decision;\" and (6) grilles for which Plaintiffs have requested referral to the U.S. Attorney. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8). At the time of the Complaint, the grilles in the first two categories were subject to storage fees and \"hold-harmless\" agreements \"disallowing any future claims against the government related to the improper seizures.\" (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9). It is undisputed, however, that CBP later \"agreed to remit these grilles without those conditions.\" (D.I. 10 at 8; D.I 16 at 17). Petitions relating to at least thirteen (13) seizures have been withdrawn, filed as claims, and referred to the U.S. Attorneys' offices in the districts where the original seizures took place. (D.I. 10 at 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 2, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this Court. (D.I. 1). The Complaint contains seven counts alleging the following: violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A) (Counts I-V), excessive fines in violation of the Eighth Amendment (Count VI); and violation of Plaintiffs' due process rights in violation of the Fifth Amendment (Count VII). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants filed their motion to dismiss (D.I. 9) on May 9, 2018, asserting pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction for Counts I through VI, and pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) that Counts VI and VII fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.

Specifically, the notices state \"[i]f you are dissatisfied with the petition decision (initial petition or supplemental petition), you will have an additional 60 days from the date of the initial petition decision or 60 days from the date of the supplemental petition decision, or such other time as specified by the Fines, Penalties and Forfeitures Officer to file a claim to the property, along with the required cost bond, requesting referral of the matter to the U.S. Attorney's Office for judicial action.\" (D.I. 11, Ex. 3 at 2-3). The procedure here not only provides an alternative route, but also requires the CBP to refer the case to the U.S. Attorney who must either bring an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   forfeiture proceedings against the goods or return the goods to Plaintiffs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs argue that \"[w]ith CBP having issued determinations documenting its misunderstanding of trademark law, LKQ's only means of ensuring a substantive resolution of this dispute was to file this declaratory judgment action.\" (D.I. 16 at 11). Plaintiffs, however, tacitly recognize that a judicial forfeiture procedure still exists, arguing that it \"does not provide LKQ with\n   <em>\n    adequate\n   </em>\n   judicial relief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added). Thus, even if (as Plaintiffs allege) CBP misunderstands trademark law, as alleged, the agency's determination is not the last word. Following CBP's determination not to remit certain Repair Grilles, Plaintiffs can compel referral to the U.S. Attorney in the district of the original seizure. This is an alternative judicial remedy and provides Plaintiffs with judicial review of trademark laws as they pertain to the seized goods. That Plaintiffs may not prefer the venue or process by which the judicial forfeiture proceedings would follow is of little moment to the Court, which is bound by the statutory scheme codified in the customs laws and was provided by notice to the Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5410544\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/536/#p539\">\n    449 F.3d at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[a] legal remedy is not inadequate for purposes of the APA because it is procedurally inconvenient for a given plaintiff.\").

Counts IV and VI of the Complaint assert claims regarding the imposition of conditions on the remission of certain LKQ goods. Specifically, Count IV challenges \"CBP's decision to impose conditions on the release of [repair grilles]\" as a violation of the APA and Count VI raises an Eighth Amendment excessive fines claim for the same conduct. (D.I. 1 at 33-35). There is no dispute that the conditions previously imposed on the return of repair goods are no longer in place. (D.I. 10 at 13; D.I. 16 at 17). Instead, Plaintiffs argue the question is not mooted because \"[i]t is foreseeable that ... CBP will re-institute demands for such 'forfeiture amounts' as conditions for the release of those goods,\" and cites a D.D.C. case emphasizing its point. (D.I. 16 17-18). In the Third Circuit, however, \"[t]he capable-of-repetition doctrine is a narrow exception that 'applies only in exceptional situations' where '(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v.

Here, Plaintiffs' provide a cursory rebuttal to the mootness question and repetition doctrine. After review of the facts provided, the Court cannot find sufficient basis to apply this narrow exception. There is no indication that conditions applied would be too short in duration to be litigated fully had they not been removed by the CBP and the government has argued \"[it] has provided LKQ with no reason to think ... that it would subsequently condition the[ ] release [of grilles] on a monetary payment.\" (D.I. 18 at 9). Moreover, the Court does not expect the CBP to change its position and again impose fees and conditions on Plaintiffs following the dismissal of this action.

Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege that CBP has violated their due process rights \"by detaining and then seizing LKQ's lawful Repair Grilles based solely on input from direct competitors\" and because \"CBP officials are ... beholden to the policy objectives of the President.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In its response to the motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs make three arguments to support their Due Process claim: (1) \"CBP's seizure and forfeiture process as applied to alleged trademark infringement violates due process as an unconstitutional mechanism by which CBP is deciding disputes of private rights between private parties without prior judicial determination;\" (2) \"CBP's delay in forwarding LKQ's numerous requests for judicial forfeiture constitutes violation of LKQ's due process rights.\"; and (3) LKQ may not be \"afforded an opportunity to challenge the Customs on the merits\" because an AUSA may elect to return the Repair Grilles in lieu of a judicial forfeiture action. (D.I. 16 at 18-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs' first argument in essence asks the Court to find the forfeiture statute unconstitutional because LKQ was not afforded a \"prior judicial determination\" before the Repair Grilles were seized by CBP. Due process, however, does not require a pre-seizure hearing for goods detained at the border.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ohio Sept. 27, 2012) (\"The Supreme Court has been clear that due process does not require federal customs officials to conduct a hearing before seizing items subject to forfeiture.\"). Indeed, a \"forfeiture proceeding, without more, provides the postseizure hearing required by due process\" necessary to protect a property owners interest in the seized goods.\n   <em>\n    Von Neumann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203264\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/242/#p249\">\n    474 U.S. at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203264\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/242/#p249\">\n    106 S.Ct. 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As identified in the CBP's seizure notice, the Plaintiffs were informed of the seizures and provided options for challenging the CBP's action, either administratively or judicially. Whereas Plaintiffs are currently pursing both options, the Court finds that these proceedings adequately protect the Plaintiffs' rights in accordance with the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs' second argument likewise fails because the Complaint does not request a remedy this Court can provide. Plaintiff argues its Due Process rights were violated because the CBP delayed in referring cases to U.S. Attorneys' offices. (D.I. 16 at 20). A party, however, may itself initiate a challenge to a seizure in a judicial forfeiture action by the government by formal or informal means.\n   <em>\n    Von Neumann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203264\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/242/#p249\">\n    474 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   244 at n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203264\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/242/#p249\">\n    106 S.Ct. 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Von Neumann\n   </em>\n   stated that \"[t]he claimant may trigger the Government's initiation of forfeiture proceedings\" by \"fil[ing] an equitable action seeking an order compelling the filing of the forfeiture action or return of the seized property.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203264\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/242/#p249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A review of the Complaint here shows that Plaintiffs do not request that this Court compel the government to file a forfeiture action or return the Repair Grilles, and instead requests a broad declaration of rights with respect to seizures and petitions for remission. Moreover, any delay between an informal request for referral of a case to a local U.S. Attorney's office and the CBP's execution of that\n   referral could have been averted or overcome by Plaintiffs' filing of an equitable action asking the Court to compel action. Plaintiffs elected instead to wait, and the Court is now aware through the motion to dismiss that no requests for referral are outstanding. (D.I. 10 at 9). Even accepting the well-plead facts as true, Plaintiff has failed to state a due process claim relating to the CBP's delay in referring cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs' final argument relies on speculation and conjecture. LKQ argues \"whether such a forfeiture action would ever commence, whether LKQ will be afforded an opportunity to challenge Customs on the merits, is left to the sole discretion of the Local AUSA\" and \"LKQ\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     does not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   'ha[ve] the ability to trigger those proceedings.' \" (D.I. 16 at 19). First, as discussed above, LKQ has the ability to trigger judicial forfeiture proceedings through formal or informal means and has already done so on a number of occasions. Second, whether a Fifth Amendment Due Process claim could arise in a situation where seized goods are referred to a U.S. Attorney's office that later elects not to pursue a judicial forfeiture action is a hypothetical question not properly before the Court. The Court's authority under Article III extends only to \"real and substantial\" cases and controversies, which prevents it from issuing \"an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172056\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/244/#p246\">\n    404 U.S. at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172056\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/244/#p246\">\n    92 S.Ct. 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
