The Clerk subsequently filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), asserting among other things that Nisi's claim is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The Court grants the motion, albeit on a somewhat different ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March 2005, Mary Nisi received a speeding ticket which was sent to the Clerk for processing. Compl. Ex. 1. The ticket included identifying information such as Nisi's gender, date of birth, home address, and driver's license number. According to the complaint, the Clerk allows members of the public to access that personal information (and the personal information of all others who receive traffic citations in Cook County) through electronic computer terminals located at all Cook County courthouses. Nisi filed suit in 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that such conduct violates the DPPA. The complaint seeks both injunctive and monetary relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The DPPA prohibits state departments of motor vehicles (\"DMVs\") and their employees from disclosing or making available to a third-party personal information contained in an individual's motor vehicle record.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202721\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also makes it \"unlawful for any\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     person\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   knowingly to obtain or disclose\" that personal information. \u00a7 2722(a) (emphasis added). The statute explicitly defines a \"person\" as \"an individual, organization or entity\" but\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"a State or agency thereof.\" \u00a7 2725(2). State DMVs with policies of noncompliance are subject to civil penalties imposed by the U.S. Attorney General, \u00a7 2723(b), while \"persons\" in violation of the statute may be sued civilly. \u00a7 2724(a). Nisi maintains that the Clerk is a \"person\" who has violated the statute and filed suit under \u00a7 2724(a). The Clerk moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that it is barred by the Eleventh Amendment and fails to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). For the reasons discussed below, the Court agrees that Nisi's claim against the Clerk, acting in her official capacity, must be dismissed-not because it is barred by the Eleventh Amendment (a question the Court does not reach) but because the DPPA does not provide a private right of action against the Clerk in her official capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Clerk's lead argument is that, as a state official sued in her official\n   capacity, she is immune from Nisi's DPPA action because the Eleventh Amendment prohibits federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over suits brought by individual litigants against a state. U.S. Const. amend. XI ;\n   <em>\n    Hans v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299056\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/134/1/\">\n    134 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299056\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/134/1/\">\n    10 S.Ct. 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299056,8299156\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed/33/842/\">\n    33 L.Ed. 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1890). Presumably, the Clerk leads with this defense, and invokes Rule 12(b)(1) in making it, because it is often characterized as \"jurisdictional.\" The Seventh Circuit, however, has explained that an Eleventh Amendment defense \"is unusual in that it does not strictly involve subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indiana Protection and Advocacy Servs. v. Indiana Family and Social Servs. Admin.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    IPAS\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4227113\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/603/365/#p370\">\n    603 F.3d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 370 (7th Cir. 2010). Moreover, the Supreme Court has instructed that, before addressing an Eleventh Amendment defense, federal courts should consider the question of \"whether the statute itself\n   <em>\n    permits\n   </em>\n   the cause of action it creates to be asserted against States (which it can do only by clearly expressing such an intent).\"\n   <em>\n    Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/#p779\">\n    529 U.S. 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 779,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/#p779\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/#p779\">\n    146 L.Ed.2d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (emphasis in original). The statutory question should precede the constitutional question, the Court explained, both because it is \"logically antecedent\" and because resolving the statutory question-does the statute provide a private right of action against the state-carries with it no risk of \"expanding the Court's power beyond the limits that the jurisdictional restriction has imposed.\" The overlap between the statutory and constitutional inquiries makes it unnecessary, in most cases anyway, to address the constitutional defense at all, much less first. In jumping first to her Eleventh Amendment affirmative defense, then, the Clerk pretermitted the required threshold inquiry as to whether the DPPA authorizes official-capacity claims against state officials like the Clerk. The Court, however, must attend first to the statutory question.\n   <em>\n    Power v. Summers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11233696\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/815/#p818\">\n    226 F.3d 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 818 (7th Cir. 2000) (\"the district court should have dismissed the official-capacity claims before addressing the Eleventh Amendment defense, the sequence ordained by\n   <em>\n    VermontAgency\n   </em>\n   ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DPPA's Private Right of Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court concludes that the DPPA does not provide a private right of action against state officials acting in their official capacities. Section 2724 of the DPPA provides an express private right of action against any \"person\" who knowingly discloses personal information from a motor vehicle record for an unauthorized purpose. Under the statute, \"person\" means \"an individual, organization or entity, but does not include a State or agency thereof.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202725\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). This carve out raises the question of whether the Clerk, a state official acting in her official capacity, constitutes the \"State\" for purposes of DPPA liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Invoking both the plain text of \u00a7 2725(2) and the familiar interpretive canon of\n   <em>\n    expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n   </em>\n   , one might infer that by providing an\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     express\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   liability carve out for states and their agencies, Congress did not intend to create an\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     implicit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   liability exemption for state officials acting in their official capacities.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hartford Underwriters Ins.

Although confirming that the scope of \u00a7 1983 and the Eleventh Amendment are distinct issues, the Court concluded that the reach of \u00a7 1983's private right of action against state actors was not intended to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity of states or other well-established immunities or defenses under the common law.
