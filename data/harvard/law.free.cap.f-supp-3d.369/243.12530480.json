It is apparent that the relevant statute and regulations provide for notice of the IG's decision prior to the exclusion's effective date, a hearing before an ALJ, an opportunity to present and cross-examine witnesses, appeal of the ALJ's decision to BAD's Appellate Division, and judicial review in federal district court. It is also apparent that Lasher availed herself of the administrative process at both the ALJ and the appellate level, even though her request for in-person hearing before the ALJ was denied because it was filed after the deadline for making such a request had passed. The ALJ's pre-hearing order set forth filing deadlines and clear instructions for submission of written direct testimony, as well as the ALJ's warning that, if an in-person hearing were necessary, its sole purpose would have been for cross-examination of the witnesses whose direct testimony the parties had submitted previously in writing. As neither party submitted witness testimony in writing, Lasher cannot claim a due process violation arising from the ALJ's refusal to conduct an in-person hearing. Nor did the ALJ or DAB err by declining to consider evidence which Lasher sought to introduce for the stated purpose of undermining the validity of her conviction. An administrative hearing under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7(f)\"does not necessitate an evidentiary hearing concerning the underlying conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Travers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7406140\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/801/394/#p403\">\n    801 F.Supp. at 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
