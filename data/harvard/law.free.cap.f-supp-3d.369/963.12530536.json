On October 10, 2018, defendants also filed an application to stay plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, pending the Court's determination of defendants' motion to dismiss. Dkt. 55. Plaintiff filed an opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss on October 15, 2019. Dkt. 60 (\"OTD\"). Defendants filed a reply on October 22, 2019. Dkt. 74 (\"RTD\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 16, 2018, the parties jointly filed a stipulation to continue the hearing on plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to December 3, 2018. Dkt 63. The Court granted the stipulation on October 18, 2018. Dkt. 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 31, 2018, the Court converted defendants' motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. Dkt. 91 (citing\n   <em>\n    Toxgon Corp. v.

Plaintiff filed its supplemental briefing on February 25, 2019, dkt. 121 (\"OSJ\"), along with a statement of disputed facts and conclusions of law, dkt. 121-2 (\"DSUF\"), and supporting documents and declarations. With leave of Court, defendants filed a reply to plaintiff's briefing on March 1, 2019. Dkt. 128 (\"RSJ\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court held a hearing on March 4, 2019. The motion for summary judgment is now before the Court. Having carefully considered the parties' arguments, the Court finds and concludes as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The following facts are not meaningfully disputed and are set forth for purposes of background. Unless otherwise noted, the court references only facts that are uncontroverted and as to which evidentiary objections have been overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The Production of Sapphire Sheets and Plaintiff's Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff Saint-Gobain Ceramics &amp; Plastics, Inc. (\"Saint-Gobain\") is part of the Saint-Gobain Group, one of the world's largest makers of industrial and construction materials. Compl. \u00b6 2. Plaintiff is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Plaintiff produces ceramic materials, including industrial crystals, grains and powders, refractories, and engineered ceramic components.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. These products and components are produced for and sold in various industrial markets, including oil and gas extraction, defense and military, and the aeronautical and aerospace industries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   One specific product that plaintiff produces is single crystal sapphire sheets. Plaintiff explains that sapphire is the \"material of choice for engineers faced with design challenges of extreme conditions-such as those found in high-temperature, high-pressure, or harsh chemical and physical environments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Sapphire is chemically inert, rendering it durable and capable of withstanding harsh chemicals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is also relatively unique in its ability to transmit ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light, as well as microwaves.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Manufacturers \"grow\" single sapphire crystal sheets by drawing molten material through a die in a crucible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In this action, plaintiff asserts three patents, obtained from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, that relate to the production of single crystal sapphire sheets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. First, plaintiff asserts United States Patent No. RE43,469 (the \"'469 Patent\"), a patent with apparatus claims titled \"Single crystals and methods for fabricating same.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl, Ex. A. Plaintiff alleges that the '469 Patent covers a single crystal sapphire sheet that is wider and thicker than sheets that were produced by prior methods.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Specifically, the '469 Patent purports to address issues caused by non-uniform temperatures (a \"thermal gradient\") across molten, sapphire material.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, plaintiff asserts United States Patent No. 9,926,645 (the \"'645 Patent\"), titled \"Method of forming a single crystal sheet using a die having a thermal gradient along its length.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. B. Finally, plaintiff asserts United States Patent No. 9,963,800 (the \"'800 Patent\"), titled \"Method\n   of making a sapphire component including machining a sapphire single crystal.\" Compl. \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. C. The '645 Patent and the '800 Patent claim methods for forming sapphire components from sapphire crystals. Compl. \u00b6 19. These three patents are collectively referred to as the \"Sapphire Patents,\" and plaintiff alleges that together, these patents \"claim sapphire single crystal sheets that are larger than could be successfully manufactured before Saint-Gobain's invention as well as methods of making and finishing the sheets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff produces large, sapphire, single crystal sheets that are used for \"an extraordinarily demanding window application,\" required by Lockheed Martin (\"Lockheed\") for installment in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a fighter jet that Lockheed manufactures for the United States Government, pursuant to a U.S. Government Prime Contract. DSF \u00b6 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lockheed allegedly purchases the sapphire sheets to be used in the window application for many tens of thousands of dollars per sheet. Compl. \u00b6 8. Plaintiff alleges that in 2004 - 2005, it was the sole supplier of large sapphire single crystal sheets for Lockheed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Plaintiff Alleges that Defendants Infringe Plaintiff's Sapphire Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant II-VI Inc. is a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Defendant II-VI Optical Systems, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of II-VI Inc. It is a California corporation with its principal place of business in California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. II-VI Inc. and II-VI-Optical Systems are collectively referred to as \"II-VI\" or \"defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants participate in the supply chain for the sapphire window application that Lockheed purchases, though their role has evolved over the years. Initially, the parties represent that defendants crafted the window applications that were inserted into the F-35 Fighters after receiving the raw-material, single crystal sapphire sheets that plaintiff grew and sold to Lockheed. However, in 2015, defendants purchased one or more sapphire furnaces in order to produce their own sapphire single crystal sheets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Thereafter, defendants excluded plaintiff from the supply chain because defendants began producing sapphire single crystal sheets and then \"machin[ing] them into windows by grinding, lapping, polishing and/or removing bulk material from them\"-without purchasing the raw materials from plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants admit that they \"purchased the furnace to replace [plaintiff] as the supplier of the raw materials.\" RTD at 7. Defendants also sell these window applications to Lockheed. DSUF \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Accordingly, plaintiff alleges that \"II-VI now competes directly with Saint-Gobain, supplying sapphire single sheets to [Lockheed] and thereby diverting sales to itself that Saint-Gobain would otherwise have made.\" Compl. \u00b6 9. Importantly, plaintiff also alleges that by producing the raw-material, single crystal sapphire sheets, defendants infringe certain claims of plaintiff's Sapphire Patents. Plaintiff now alleges three counts of patent infringement, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

MTD at 3, n.4. Notwithstanding this fact, defendants further argue that, even if they were infringing claims of the Sapphire Patents, the Court should dismiss this case pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201498\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants therefore move for summary judgment under \u00a7 1498 on the grounds that all of their accused products are sold to Lockheed pursuant to government contracts that include the government's authorization and consent to infringe one or more claims of the Sapphire Patents.

It would indeed be unusual for a government supply contract to specifically require that a contractor infringe a United States patent. If courts were to apply [plaintiff's] proposed standard[, which is substantially similar to clause 2 of FAR 52.227-1 ], \u00a7 1498 would be relevant to only a tiny percentage of government supply contracts. In the vast majority of cases, the government's supply contractor would remain unprotected and thus the Congressional purpose of \u00a7 1498 would remain unfulfilled. While \u00a7 1498's application to service contracts may be more narrow, the government's interest in the statute's application in those cases is correspondingly weaker. If the government vitally needs certain services, in most cases it may simply undertake to provide those services for itself; for example, in\n    <em>\n     Carrier [Corporation\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1068312,10813701\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/534/244/\">\n     534 F.2d 244\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Ct. Cl. 1976) ], the Air Force could undertake to haul its own trash. The required capital and expertise to engage in such an activity would be relatively small. However, where the sale of goods is at issue, it would usually be a much more daunting task for the government to step into the shoes of the contractor. For example, the government could not reasonably begin the manufacture of [light armored vehicles], due to the enormous outlays of capital and technical expertise required for such an undertaking. The potential for harm due to the reluctance of contractors to provide such goods, particularly war materials, was central to the Congress that passed \u00a7 1498's 1918 amendments. Thus the purpose of \u00a7 1498 dictates that its strongest protection should be extended to contractors who sell military goods to the government, the exact situation presented by this case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *7-8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The Court agrees with the reasoning of the magistrate judge in\n    <em>\n     St. Switch.\n    </em>\n    The Federal Circuit's admonition that \"the coverage of \u00a7 1498 should be broad so as not to limit the Government's freedom in procurement\" supports defendants' position that the broader FAR 52.227-1 clause should apply in this procurement case. To restrict supply contracts by applying the narrower authorization and consent clause whenever patents with method claims are utilized in the execution of a supply contract, would strip \u00a7 1498 of its power to \"prevent delays injurious to the government which necessarily follow the restraining of any person from carrying out a contract to furnish patented articles, devices, et al., manufactured for or to be used by or for the United States.\"\n    <em>\n     Foundation Co\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6731742\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/256/374/#p375\">\n     256 F. at 375\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Even without an express government bidding process or solicitation, the\n    <em>\n     Raymond\n    </em>\n    court applied \u00a7 1498 because developing prototypes was an expected and standard industry practice, and because it facilitated efficient contracting systems.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Plaintiffs argue that these cases are inapposite because, in those cases, the defendants developed products and technologies after the government expressed an interest in procuring those items-whether through a solicitation or bidding process. OSJ at 12. In contrast, plaintiff argues, \"[h]ere, all evidence indicates that II-VI undertook its accused development activities without any solicitation-contractual or otherwise-by the government or Lockheed.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 13.

Moreover, while \"[s]ection 1498 does not shield the manufacturer or seller of an infringing item simply because it eventually ends up in the hands of the United States Government,\" 5\n    <em>\n     Chisum on Patents\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 16.06 (2019), that is not the circumstance here. At the time defendants began researching a process to grow sapphire sheets, defendants knew that the government was procuring sapphire sheets because defendants were a component of the sapphire window supply chain. Accordingly, while the record does not indicate that the government issued a formal solicitation or bidding process, the government had indicated, and defendants knew of, its interest in acquiring sapphire sheets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Importantly, the same policy rationales that underscored the appropriateness of applying \u00a7 1498 in pre-bidding and solicitation contexts also apply here. As the\n    <em>\n     Raymond\n    </em>\n    court reasoned, \"[r]equiring a government contractor to receive a purchase order with the necessary authorization and consent clauses before even beginning the initial design and development work would impair the efficiency and quality of the current contracting system.\"\n    <em>\n     Raymond\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%20488\">\n     1986 WL 488\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3. The\n    <em>\n     BAE Systems\n    </em>\n    court added, \"encouraging research and development to be used in government military operations was the most basic purpose of \u00a7 1498.\"\n    <em>\n     BAE Systems\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203474344\">\n     2011 WL 3474344\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *11. For \u00a7 1498 to achieve\n    its intended goal, the Court thus finds that research and development activities are \"for the government\" when a party develops a process to manufacture products that it knows will benefit the government because the party is already under contract with the government in relation to that product.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    These circumstances are met here. At oral argument, defendants stressed that they researched and developed a process to grow sapphire sheets for the government, and that all of their research activities were related to fulfilling the same window panel contracts they had already executed with Lockheed. RSJ at 7. Illustrative of defendants' stated purpose, defendants sold their sapphire sheets exclusively to the United States Government, through Lockheed, once defendants solidified their manufacturing process. It is of no consequence that defendants also stood to benefit financially from developing the capability to grow sapphire sheets. It bears repeating that, for a use to be \"for the government,\" \"[i]t is not necessary [for the government] to be the sole beneficiary ... in order to be a beneficiary for the purposes of \u00a7 1498(a).\"\n    <em>\n     Advanced Software\n    </em>\n    , 583 F.3d at 1378.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The Court also finds that defendants undertook these accused activities with the implied \"authorization and consent\" of the government. As the court in\n    <em>\n     TVI Energy\n    </em>\n    held when it applied \u00a7 1498 to accused activities arising out of a government bidding process, \"[i]n proper circumstances, Government authorization can be implied.\"\n    <em>\n     TVI Energy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1656010,5637413\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/806/1057/\">\n     806 F.2d at 1060\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, where the Government, through Lockheed, later authorized and consented to defendants' infringing activities by including FAR 52.227-1 in defendants' procurement contracts, the Court finds that the Government impliedly authorized and consented to the pre-contractual development activities, as well.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     BAE Sys.

On this record, the Court is uncertain as to whether infringement on this basis occurred. The Sapphire Patents cover sapphire sheets of specific sizes that are grown through specific methods. As defendants argue, the record does not clearly establish the size of the sapphire sheets pictured. The method by which the sheets are grown is also unknown. At oral argument, the parties conceded that sapphire panels could be produced by alternative methods. Accordingly, the sheer existence of a sapphire sheet of unknown size would not necessarily indicate that infringement of plaintiff's Sapphire Patents occurred. The Court also notes that Lucero did not testify that defendants necessarily demonstrate their sapphire sheets to customers, but rather, their technical capabilities.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Lucero Depo. 81:20 - 82:22.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    However, on this motion for summary judgment, the Court views the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the non-moving party, and the Court assumes, for the purposes of this motion, that defendants produced infringing single crystal sapphire sheets for the industry trade show and to be photographed for plaintiff's website. Notwithstanding this assumption, the Court finds these accused uses to be sufficiently\n    <em>\n     de minimis\n    </em>\n    , such that the Court may dismiss this entire action, pursuant to \u00a7 1498.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    As\n    <em>\n     Chisum\n    </em>\n    explains, \"[i]f the defendant makes, uses, or sells an invention for both the United States and others, a district court may adjudicate a claim of infringement as to the latter.
