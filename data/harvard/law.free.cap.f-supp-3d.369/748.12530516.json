In November of that same year, WaMu, through its attorneys and agent, sent a written Notice of Acceleration and Notice of Posting &amp; Foreclosure to the plaintiff and on that same date, also sent a Notice of Trustee's Sale setting forth a sale date of December 2, 2003.

However, plaintiff contends he has alleged sufficient independent post-acquisition conduct of the defendants to justify subject matter jurisdiction in this case. Specifically, plaintiff references paragraphs 22, 23, 25, and 26 of his complaint which provide as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   22. On information and belief, and on showing that signs bearing the name and telephone numbers of Defendant MCS are still posted on the doors of the\n   Property, Plaintiff alleges that MCS, at the orders initially of WaMu and thereafter Defendant CHASE [JPMC herein], has on some routine basis inspected the Property, maintained the Property and continued to keep locks on the doors of the Property to which Plaintiff has had no keys, from December 2003 until the present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   23. Beginning in 2003 and continuing to the present, first WaMu and thereafter Defendant CHASE paid the property taxes on the Property and placed insurance on the Property with insurance companies at exorbitantly high premium rates, despite the fact the WaMu had ordered Plaintiff out of the Property and had told him it would be sold at a trustee's sale on December 2, 2003.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   25. In compliance with the SCRA's requirement, Plaintiff supplied to either WaMu or Defendant CHASE copies of the extensions of his active duty orders each time such orders were published. However, WaMu and Defendant CHASE failed to comply with the requirements of the SCRA and charged interest on the obligation secured by the Deed of Trust at interest rates above 6% per annum and added fees and charges not authorized by the SCRA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants also continued to place insurance on the Property with insurers that charged exorbitantly high premiums and continued the wrongful seizure of the Property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   26. At various times during th period from November 2003 until the present, Plaintiff has been contacted, first, by representatives of WaMu, and, thereafter by representatives of Defendant CHASE, concerning the Deed of Trust debt on the Property. However, because first WaMu and thereafter Defendant CHASE would not or could not compute an accurate payoff figure for the obligation, Plaintiff was unable to sell or re-finance the Property. Furthermore, Plaintiff was unable to rent the Property because WaMu and Defendants CHASE and MCS had locked Plaintiff out of the house when it was seized without the benefit of a valid court order. That wrongful seizure continued after Defendant CHASE acquired the the [sic] Property, Promissory Note and Deed of Trust securing the Property from WaMu, which wrongful seizure continues to this date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , docket # 1 at pages 7-8.

They claim that WaMu knowingly provided banking services-including allowing the Nevada LLCs to utilize CMT and RDC systems-despite its actual knowledge of the Millennium Ponzi scheme. They argue that JPMorgan is liable for this conduct because it assumed WaMu's liabilities pursuant to a purchase and assumption agreement with the FDIC. By relying on WaMu's alleged wrongdoing, plaintiffs' claims plainly \"relat[e] to any act or omission' of \"a depository institution for which the [FDIC] has been appointed receiver.\" And because plaintiffs did not exhaust administrative remedies, their claims are jurisdictionally barred by FIRREA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that the district court erred by dismissing the portions of their claims based on JPMorgan's independent activity. In denying plaintiffs' Rule 60(b) motion, the district court held that \"although plaintiffs alleged that practices continued after [JPMorgan] acquired WaMu in September 2008, this assertion fell short of transforming Plaintiffs' claims into something other than claims 'relating' to WaMu's alleged misconduct.\" Moreover, the court held that even if the complaints \"include stand-alone allegations of post-receivership misconduct by [JPMorgan], FIRREA still applies\" because the phrase \"relating to\" as used in \u00a7 1821(d)(13)(D)(ii) \"has a deliberately broad and sweeping meaning.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   We disagree with the district court's analysis. Claims of independent misconduct by an institution that purchased a failed bank are not covered by FIRREA's exhaustion requirement. We need look no further than the plain language of the statute to reach this conclusion. As relevant to this matter, FIRREA\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   requires exhaustion of claims \"relating to any act or omission of [a failed bank] or the [FDIC] as receiver.\" If a plaintiff alleges that a purchasing bank aided and abetted a fraudulent scheme following its assumption of a failed bank, that claim simply does not relate to any act or omission of the failed bank or the FDIC..... Because plaintiffs alleged that JPMorgan continued the tortious conduct that WaMu began, the district court ruled that plaintiffs' claims relate to the conduct of WaMu.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   This analysis misinterprets the operative language. Although we do not quibble with the district court's conclusion that the phrase \"relating to\" has a broad meaning, we nevertheless hold that a claim alleging liability based only on post-purchase misconduct of a purchasing bank would not \"relate to\" acts or omissions of a failed bank for purposes of FIRREA. The fact that JPMorgan acted in a manner that was similar, or even identical, to the manner in which WaMu acted, does not alter our conclusion. The\n   <em>\n    acts\n   </em>\n   of the purchasing bank might be related to the\n   <em>\n    acts\n   </em>\n   of the failed bank, but FIRREA's jurisdictional bar applies when a\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   relates to the\n   <em>\n    acts\n   </em>\n   of a failed bank.

IndyMac Mortg. Servs.\n   </em>\n   , came to a similar conclusion as did the Eight Circuit concerning exhaustion. In that case, IndyMac made a loan to couple who primarily spoke Spanish and who had communicated with IndyMac's representatives in Spanish but were given all documents in English when they closed on their loan to\n   refinance their home. IndyMac subsequently failed and eventually the plaintiffs' loan was transferred by the FDIC to OneWest. A month after the transfer, the plaintiffs sent a notice to One West that they were seeking to cancel the loan in violation of the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Laws.\n   <em>\n    Tellado\n   </em>\n   , 707 at 277-78,. They additionally notified OneWest they intended to file suit if OneWest did not respond to them within ten days. After they did not receive a response, the plaintiffs filed suit seeking a \"determination that their loan was void and that OneWest had forfeited the right to any further payment or, in the alternative, seeking triple damages based on the amount of payments they had made on the loan or on the amount of the security interest retained in their home.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 278. Following a bench trial, the court ruled in the plaintiffs' favor finding IndyMac had not provided plaintiffs the proper notice in Spanish and therefore, their three-day right of recission had not begun to run. The court further found plaintiffs' notice to OneWest was effective and binding and ordered OneWest to refund payments, terminate the security interest in plaintiffs' property, and return any negotiable instruments executed as a part of the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On appeal, OneWest successfully argued the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' claim pursuant to FIRREA because the claim was \"predicated upon an act or omission of IndyMac specifically IndyMac's failure at closing to provide notice in Spanish of the right to cancel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 279-80. Referencing the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Benson\n   </em>\n   , relied upon by the plaintiffs herein, the court found the Tellados' claim to be \"functionally, albeit not formally, against Indy Mac.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 280. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   The Tellados characterize their claim as a claim against OneWest for its own misconduct, pointing to OneWest's failure to cancel the loan in response to the Tellados' August 2009 notice of cancellation. However, as the District Court correctly held, the Tellados' notice of cancellation was valid only because IndyMac had failed to provide proper notice of the right to cancel and as a result the cancellation period had not begun to run. Without IndyMac's wrongdoing, the Tellados would have no right to cancel and therefore no claim. Thus, the Tellados' claim is not a claim of independent misconduct by OneWest, rather, it relates to an act or omission of the depository institution, IndyMac, and is, therefore, jurisdictionally barred under section 1821(d)(13)(D)(ii).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finding the applicability of \u00a7 1821(d)(13)(D) turns on \" 'the actor responsible for the alleged wrongdoing' \" and not depending upon \"which party the plaintiff happened to bring the case against,\" the Eleventh Circuit found\n   <em>\n    Tri-State Hotels, Inc. v.

The plain language of section 1821(d)(13)(D) bars judicial review of \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   claim relating to\n   <em>\n    any act\n   </em>\n   ... of [a failed lending institution] .... (emphasis added). Because Lazarre's claims against Chase relate to an act of WaMu, they are subject to the administrative exhaustion requirement of section 1821(d).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239356\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/780/1320/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239356\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/780/1320/\">\n    at 1326-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the court recognized that if it allowed a plaintiff to avoid the FIRREA exhaustion requirement by recharacterizing his claims, the teeth of the exhaustion requirement would be removed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239356\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/780/1320/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239356\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/780/1320/\">\n    at 1327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Based on the foregoing and the argument and authorities presented by the defendants in the motions and replies, the Court finds that plaintiff's second cause of action against all three of the named defendants, concerning only the alleged seizure of the property, arises out of the conduct of WaMu and does not fall into the category excluded by the court in\n   <em>\n    Benson\n   </em>\n   of liability based only on post-purchase misconduct by the named defendants. As plaintiff asserts in his complaint, \"[t]he actions, first of WaMu, and, thereafter of and by all three Defendants in changing the locks on the doors of the Property, maintaining the Property, paying the taxes on the Property, and such other additional acts as will be detailed at the trial of this matter, have constituted a continuing unlawful seizure without court authorization.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Cause of Action Under Rule 12(b)(1) (docket # 10), and Defendant Mortgage Contracting Services, LLC's Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) (docket # 24) are GRANTED such that plaintiff's second cause of action is DISMISSED for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as barred by the administrative exhaustion requirement of FIRREA. The dismissal is without prejudice to plaintiff seeking administrative relief if such relief is still available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   It is so ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The second cause of action is the only cause asserted against defendant Mortgage Contracting Services, LLC.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Plaintiff's Response and Opposition to Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss Filed by Mortgage Contracting Services, LLC, docket # 26 at page 2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    This claim is the subject of Count I of the complaint and not a part of the pending motions to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    In a footnote appended to this finding, the court explained:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    Permitting Tri-State to recharacterize its claims as such would, as appellees note, effectively eviscerate the claims process, because every plaintiff could (and would) simply challenge the FDIC's failure to reverse the failed bank's fraudulent actions rather than challenge the bank's fraudulent actions directly. Thus, in order to effectuate the stated congressional purpose in enacting FIRREA, namely \"enabl[ing] the FDIC to dispose of the bulk of claims against failed financial institutions expeditiously and fairly,\" courts should look to the underlying substance of the challenged events. If plaintiff brings an action against the assets of the failed institution, then FIRREA's exhaustion requirement is applicable regardless of how plaintiff styles its claim.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 713, n.9 (citation omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
