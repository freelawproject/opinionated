(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1, Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 10-14). Plaintiff filed her Second Amended Complaint (Dkt. 43, \"SAC\"), the operative complaint, on December 22, 2017.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, Statement of Uncontroverted Facts (\"SUF\") at D1; Dkt. 101-3, Joint Evidentiary Appendix (\"JEA\"), Exhibit (\"Exh.\") 1, Audio of Radio Dispatch, dated January 25, 2016 (\"Dispatch\"); Dkt. 101-4, Exh. 2, Call History Log Re: 8831 Eleventh Ave., dated January 25, 2016 (\"Call Log\"); Dkt. 101-5, Exh. 3, Deposition of Jonathan Flores (\"Flores Depo.\") at 74-76). Dispatch advised the officers that a male suspect had forced his way into a residence (\"11th Avenue Residence\"), assaulted a resident with a bat, stolen a motorcycle, and had set a big rig on fire. (Dkt. 101-3, Dispatch at 00:31-0:40; 2:07-2:12 &amp; 4:15-4:19;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D2 &amp; D4-D6; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 76-79; Dkt. 101-6, Exh. 4, Deposition of Kent Watson (\"Watson Depo.\") at 19 &amp; 41; Dkt. 101-7, Exh. 5, Deposition of Spencer Wilt (\"Wilt Depo.\") at 22-23 &amp; 30-31). Several officers responded to the call as a \"Code 3[,]\" with lights and sirens. (Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 75-76 &amp; 77-79; Dkt. 101-2, Watson Depo. at 19-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Around 4:23 a.m., Flores arrived at the 11th Avenue Residence and saw a woman in the driveway waving her arms yelling, \"He's in the back[.]\" (Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-4, Call Log at ECF 1932; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 91; Dkt. 101-20, Exh. 18, Transcript of Jonathan Flores Statement to Homicide Detail (\"Flores St.\") at ECF 2306-07). Flores walked past the woman in the driveway and noticed a male near the front door of the 11th Avenue Residence, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D9-D10; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 91), who had minor scratches and a cut on one finger later treated by paramedics with band-aids. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-9, Exh. 7, Statement of Ben Mestas (\"Mestas St.\"); Dkt. 101-10, Exh. 8, Statement of Craig Cummings (\"Cummings St.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Flores made his way to the backyard of the 11th Avenue Residence and saw an individual - later identified as Schenck - wearing black clothing and running eastbound toward the back fence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D10-D12; Dkt. 101-3, Dispatch at 6:21; Dkt. 101-4, Call Log at ECF 1932; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 91 &amp; 94). Flores did not see a bat in Schenck's hands. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 98). As Schenck continued toward the back fence of the 11th Avenue Residence, Flores began to chase him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D14-D15; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 96-97). Schenck hopped over the fence onto the easement behind the 11th Avenue Residence and neighboring houses, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D15; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 96-97), then ran northbound\n   through the easement and scaled a fence to another backyard. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D17; Dkt. 101-3, Dispatch at 6:46-7:45; Dkt. 101-4, Call Log at ECF 1932; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 98-100).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Flores requested backup, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D18; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 101; Dkt. 101-3, Dispatch at 10:30-10:42), and radioed for a perimeter to be set up to prevent Schenck from fleeing the area. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D19; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 102). Around 4:29 a.m., Flores confirmed with Dispatch that there was no big rig on fire. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at P6; Dkt. 101-3, Dispatch at 9:33-9:39). Flores then waited between five to ten minutes for additional deputies to arrive. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D20; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 105-06).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Wilt soon arrived, and he and Flores hopped over the fence to search for Schenck, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D19-D21; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 105-07; Dkt. 101-7, Wilt Depo. at 31-32), entering a backyard filled with debris and vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D22; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 108). Flores found Schenck hiding face down, under a bus, and alerted Wilt to Schenck's presence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D23 &amp; D27; Dkt. 101-3, Dispatch at 15:00; Dkt. 101-4, Call Log at ECF 1932; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 109-11; Dkt. 101-7, Wilt Depo. at ECF 2058). Although there was some light in the backyard, there was a carport blocking much of the light in the area where the bus was parked. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 110-11 &amp; 114-15; Dkt. 101-6, Watson Depo. at 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Wilt stood at the front of the bus and Flores stood on the left side of the bus. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D32; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 115; Dkt. 101-7, Wilt Depo. at 41). Both officers drew their guns and began yelling conflicting commands at Schenck. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 111-12; Dkt. 101-8, Exh. 6, Audio of Radio Belt Recording from Spencer Wilt (\"Wilt Audio\") at 00:01; Dkt. 101-20, Flores St. at ECF 2308; 101-21, Exh. 19, Transcript of Spencer Wilt's Statement to Homicide Detail (\"Wilt St.\") at ECF 2325). Wilt yelled, \"You're gonna get shot if you don't show me your fucking hands!\" (Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 0:01-0:03). Immediately afterwards, Wilt yelled, \"Crawl out now,\" followed shortly by Flores yelling, \"let me see your hands[.]\" (Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 0:04;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-7, Wilt Depo. at 35-36; Dkt. 101-20, Flores St. at ECF 2309). One second later, Flores yelled, \"Don't reach in your ..., \" and was interrupted by Wilt saying, \"Fucking pop him!\" (Dkt. 101-1, SUF at P19; Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 0:07-0:08). A few seconds later, Flores yelled, \"You reach in your pocket and you're fucking dead!\" (Dkt. 101-1, P20; Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 0:10). Schenck initially laid still and offered no response to the conflicting commands, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 114; Dkt. 101-20, Flores St. at ECF 2309-10), but within about 15 seconds of being discovered under the bus, Schenck said, \"Okay.\" (Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 0:15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Very soon thereafter, Flores holstered his firearm, unholstered his taser, and pointed it at Schenck, who was still under the bus. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D43; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 134; Dkt. 101-20, Flores St. at ECF 2308-09). The officers and Schenck then had the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Flores: Show me your hands! Come out! Come out now or I'm tasing you!\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Schenck: I'm coming out! I'm coming out!\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Flores: Come out! Let me see your hands!\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Wilt: Fucking pop him!\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Flores: Come out or I'm gonna fucking tase you! Let me see your hands!\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 00:24-00:35; Dkt. 101-1, SUF at P27). Schenck showed his hands to Flores, said he was going to come out, and then started to crawl out. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-20, Flores St. at ECF 2310). As Schenk began to crawl out from underneath the bus on the side where Flores was standing, Flores told Wilt that Schenck was coming out on Flores's side of the bus. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 0:43). Wilt then walked around the back of the bus to assist Flores in taking Schenck into custody. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D35; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 119; Dkt. 101-7, Wilt Depo. at 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Within seconds, as Schenck was in the process of crawling out from under the bus, Wilt struck him in the back three to four times with a closed fist, yelling, \"Let me see your fucking hands!\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at P30; Dkt. 101-7, Wilt Depo. at 56-57;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 0:50). Schenck, who was lying flat on his stomach, yelled, \"Ow, Ow!\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at P31; Dkt. 101-7, Wilt Depo. at 51, 52, 56; Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 0:54; Dkt. 101-21, Wilt Tr. at ECF 2331). Flores then placed his taser on Schenck's lower back and deployed it in drive-stun mode.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D43; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 134). Although Wilt did not believe that Schenck was trying to hit or attack the officers, (Dkt. 101-21, Wilt St. at ECF 2327 &amp; 2329;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-7, Wilt Depo. at 58-60 &amp; 63-64), he nonetheless delivered about 15 hammer strikes to Schenck's face and head. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt 101-7, Wilt Depo. at 58-60; Dkt. 101-21, Wilt St. at ECF 2327; Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 0:54-1:10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Meanwhile, Flores administered two more taser electrical shocks to Schenck's back. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 140 &amp; 146, Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 1:23). Schenck cried out in pain after Flores placed the taser in his lower back pleading, \"I'll show them to you!\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 1:22). One of the officers yelled, \"Don't fucking move, you understand? Don't move! Stop moving! Stop moving now!\" as Schenck moaned and gasped for air. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:36-1:45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Around 4:37 a.m., while lying flat on his stomach, Schenck began to tell the officers that he could not breathe. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 1:41; Dkt. 101-21, Wilt St. at ECF 2322). Schenck grabbed Flores's leg, and Flores, fearing he would fall backwards, struck the left side of Schenck's face with the butt of his taser. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at D49; Dkt. 101-5, Flores Depo. at 148; Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 1:45-1:47). Meanwhile, Schenck, gasping, told the officers at least 15 times - over the course of more than a minute - that he could not breathe. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 1:43-2:40). Wilt then released some of the pressure off of Schenck's back. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-21, Wilt St. at ECF 2322). Watson arrived around this time, and saw Schenck lying on his stomach, with Wilt resting one of his knees across Schenck's shoulders as Wilt and Flores handcuffed Schenck. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at P40 ; Dkt. 101-6, Watson Depo. at 21; Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 1:40-1:45; Dkt. 101-21, Wilt Tr. at ECF 2322).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After Schenck was handcuffed, Wilt commanded him to \"Roll onto [his] fucking butt now!\" and to \"Stand the fuck up now.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at P45-P46;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dkt. 101-6, Watson Depo. at 22; Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 2:42 &amp; 2:47; Dkt. 101-21, Wilt St. at ECF 2322). Schenck looked dazed and struggled to get to his feet. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-1, SUF at P48; Dkt. 101-21, Wilt St. at ECF 2322). He began to moan, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 2:50-3:00), and shortly after the officers stood Schenck up, Watson, with one of his palms on the back of Schenck's head and the other on Schenck's shoulders, shoved Schenck into the bus. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-6, Watson Depo. at 25, 26, 28). Immediately thereafter, he pushed Schenck into a post. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 25-28 &amp; 44-45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For the next few minutes, the officers attempted to force Schenck to walk from the bus to the patrol vehicle, commanding him to \"Walk, mother fucker!\" \"Get up bitch!\" and \"Get on your fucking feet now!\" (Dkt. 101-1, SUF at P52-P55; Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 3:38, 4:12, 4:30, 4:46). Schenck's moans escalated into gasping cries. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio, 3:15-3:22, 3:39-3:50, 4:09-4:15; 4:46-4:48). As the officers attempted to force Schenck to walk, he collapsed three times, once going deadweight on the officers' shoulders, once bending at the waist, and finally collapsing to the ground. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-8, Wilt Audio at 3:00-5:25; Dkt. 101-21, Wilt St. at ECF 2323; Dkt. 101-20, Flores St. at ECF 2317-19; Dkt. 101-6, Watson Depo. at 35-36 &amp; 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After Schenck collapsed the third time, the officers carried him the rest of the way to the patrol car. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-6, Watson Depo. at 38; Dkt. 101-7, Wilt Depo. at 88; Dkt. 101-20, Flores St. at 2318-19). They placed him in a seated position, and around 4:42 a.m., Wilt called for medical assistance.

As an initial matter, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the force used against Schenk caused or otherwise contributed to his death.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 101-18, Spitz Depo. at Spitz Discussion of Cause of Death). In addition, Dr. Spitz opined that the pressure the officers placed on Schenck's back while he lay in a prone position on his stomach not only caused pain, but interfered with his ability to breathe.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 107-10). Finally, with respect to the amount of methamphetamine in Schenk's body, Dr. Spitz noted that, although a 2.0 milligram per liter dose of methamphetamine was, in one documented case, determined to be the cause of death, he was skeptical that that amount is universally fatal and, in any event, the amount of methamphetamine in Schenck's system was below that amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 88-90).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"The use of deadly force implicates the highest level of Fourth Amendment interests both because the suspect has a 'fundamental interest in his own life' and because such force 'frustrates the interest of the individual, and of society, in judicial determination of guilt and punishment.' \"\n   <em>\n    A.K.H. ex rel.

But for him to make such a gesture when no gun is there makes no sense whatsoever. A jury may doubt that Cruz did this. Of course, a jury could reach the opposite conclusion.

However, in this case, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, it is obvious that defendants used considerable and extensive force against plaintiff that was unwarranted by the circumstances facing defendants. When the officers arrived, the scene they observed undermined the description of the crime relayed to them by Dispatch. Specifically, they did not see the suspect with any bat or other weapon, the only person injured had minor injuries later treated with band-aids, and there was no big rig on fire. Moreover, when defendants found the suspect, he was hiding under a bus and immediately surrounded by two armed officers. Under these circumstances, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, no reasonable officer would believe that it was lawful to: without proper warning, use force against a suspect who was neither threatening nor actively resisting the officers, and who had verbalized an intent to surrender, seconds after the suspect had shown the officers his hands and was attempting to crawl out from under the bus in an effort to surrender; deliver three to four closed fist strikes to the suspect's back, 15 successive closed fist strikes to his face and head, and three rapid taser drive-stun deployments to his back; hit the suspect in the head with the butt of a taser; restrain the suspect with his chest on the ground while applying pressure to the suspect's back and ignoring his pleas that he could not breathe; force the weakened, dazed, handcuffed, and non-resisting suspect to his feet and then slam him into a bus and then a post. In short, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, it is obvious that Schenck posed no immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others and that the officers used excessive force against Schenck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hope v.
