In 2013, Canalichio was convicted of RICO conspiracy and sentenced to incarceration for 137 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Canalichio filed a motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in three ways: failure to object and preserve objections over evidentiary issues; conflict of interest; and failure to advise of the benefits of entering an open plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court finds that Canalichio has not shown that his trial counsel was ineffective. First, Canalichio is incorrect that certain objections should have been made at trial, and he is incorrect that other objections were not made. Second, because his counsel properly made the foregoing objections and had no grounds to make others, there is no conflict of interest. Third, Canalichio was advised of the risks and benefits of an open plea, and his counsel could not be expected to be clairvoyant about the Court's discretionary rulings. For the reasons set forth below, the \u00a7 2255 Motion will be denied, and a certificate of appealability will not be issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Table of Contents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.

ECF No. 3. The charges arose from Canalichio's involvement with a criminal enterprise known as the Philadelphia La Cosa Nostra Family (\"the LCN Family\") from 1999 through January 2011. The indictment charged fourteen members and associates of the LCN Family, including Canalichio.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Canalichio and six other defendants proceeded to trial in October 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On February 5, 2013, following a four-month trial, a jury convicted Canalichio of RICO conspiracy, acquitting him of the illegal gambling charges. The Government produced evidence at trial demonstrating that Canalichio was a \"made\" member of the LCN Family and was involved in a pattern of racketeering activity that included extortion and illegal gambling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On May 3, 2013, Canalichio filed a sealed post-trial motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to convict him.

Canalichio argued in the alternative for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, on the basis that the Court had not excluded two jurors who had been exposed to extraneous information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201955\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court denied the motions on July 8, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 1387, 1388.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On July 18, 2013, Defendant was sentenced to 137 months of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release, with a fine of $ 1,000 and a special assessment of $ 100. ECF No. 1414. At sentencing, the Court calculated a base offense level of 20 and reached a final level of 26 after applying two enhancements: 1) a two-level enhancement after finding that Canalichio was a manager or supervisor of racketeering activity under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c) ; and 2) a four-level enhancement based on grouping under \u00a7 3D1.4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1427 at 48-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court did not apply a career offender enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201955\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201955\">\n    at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Canalichio argues that Martinelli gave impermissible overview testimony which \"tainted the trial.\" ECF No. 1806, Rider to Motion \u00b6 28. But Canalichio's arguments lack merit because Martinelli's testimony was not overview testimony -- Martinelli was involved early on in the investigation and had a key role in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Martinelli did not provide an overview or roadmap to the case; rather, he testified about his role in the investigation and what he learned in that role. He was a case agent and also a handling agent for three people involved in the investigation: Henry Scipione, a cooperating witness in the case, and Special Agents Stone and Sebastiani who were two undercover FBI agents. Martinelli had a great deal of personal knowledge about all aspects of the case, and he properly testified about those aspects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Canalichio also argues that Martinelli gave impermissible overview testimony by testifying as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   AUSA Han: Now, we've heard from Mr. Scipione that he made recorded payments to Anthony Staino. Where did that money come from?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Martinelli: The money for all his payments was paid by us. At the point where he decides to cooperate with us, it's now turned into evidence purchased is the words we use. Obviously there are no drugs or narcotics in this case, but it's akin to that. If you're purchasing drugs or narcotics as a cooperator, the FBI is paying for those drugs or narcotics and that's going to be evidence. So for us making a loanshark payment was evidence. As we paid the money, that was evidence of the crime that was being committed at that time, so it was all FBI money.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   AUSA Han: Is there a particular process that you must pursue before getting approval for money to be used in this manner?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Martinelli: There is. To get money, I have to put in a paper request which goes to my supervisor and then goes to his supervisor above him. So, we have two layers that can either approve, deny or change the amount you request. So, I have to write up what the situation is, I have to write up what the case is, I have to write up what my plan is for the particular day and a particular event that we're doing, and why I need the money I need and what the amount is. So basically your two layers of supervision have to say yep, you got a good case, we think this will work, let's move forward and you can have the money for today to make the payment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   AUSA Han: Do you have to undergo that process every time you make a payment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Martinelli: Yes, every single time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   ECF No. 1307 at 14:8-15:16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   This testimony is not overview testimony, or otherwise improper for the reasons that overview testimony is regarded as suspect. Martinelli's testimony was based on personal knowledge. He provided background and context for how the FBI deals with handling money as part of a criminal investigation, be it payments for narcotics transactions or payments to pay off debts, as was the case in this investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Martinelli's explanation of the process does not suggest government imprimatur on his or a subsequent witness's testimony. At most, the testimony shows that the government requires approval at two levels before a case agent may proceed with a particular course of action involving the transfer of money. The testimony explains that the approval is conferred when, in the judgment of two levels of supervisors, the plan of action is sound and worthy of spending taxpayer dollars. This is not a situation where Martinelli testified that, in his opinion, Canalichio was guilty of the crimes charged, which is a typical imprimatur situation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He was advised of the benefits of an open plea. He was told that he might be found to be a non-career offender. He was also told that the Court, and the Court alone, would make that decision.

Indeed, after discussing strategy with her client, Ms. Grasso filed a motion seeking to reopen the hearing on Canalichio's bail status, in which she argued that if Canalichio were to be convicted of the crimes charged, he would not be a career offender and would have a concomitantly much shorter sentence.

The Court could have sentenced Canalichio as a career offender\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Canalichio's argument is premised on the idea that he was always going to be sentenced as a non-career offender. Canalichio is wrong. He did qualify as a career offender. However, sentencing as a career offender is discretionary, and Ms. Grasso could not be expected to predict with certainty that the Court would invoke the rule of lenity. Such a prediction, if it was made, would have amounted to no more than guesswork and speculation. Canalichio's use of 20-20 hindsight is inappropriate, and his ineffective assistance argument requires prescience that no lawyer can be expected to command.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Several Circuit Courts have used the \"modified categorical approach\" to determine whether a defendant's instant conviction was a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505088\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/690/1056/#p1068\">\n    690 F.3d 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1068-69 (8th Cir. 2012) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This stands in contrast to past convictions, where an \"ad hoc mini-trial,\" separate and distinct from the trial just had, is required to inquire about the facts of the past conviction.\n   <em>\n    Riggans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11093296\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/1200/#p1203\">\n    254 F.3d at 1203-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court recognized the approach to be the better one for the RICO conspiracy at hand, and explained its reasoning when sentencing one of Canalichio's coconspirators, Joseph Massimino.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Nevertheless, it is clear that this Court could have applied the modified categorical\n   approach. \"The rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Yet, simple ambiguity is not the test.

Evidently, because other courts have applied the modified categorical approach to all flavors of instant convictions, there is no per se rule against doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   There was no way for Ms. Grasso to know before the case proceeded through trial that the Court would opt to apply the rule of lenity in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   To be clear, the Court, the Government, and the U.S. Probation Service all found that Canalichio's RICO offenses were, in fact, crimes of violence, and therefore had the Court applied the modified categorical approach, Canalichio would have been deemed a career offender. ECF No. 1427 at 54-55. The Government was adamant that Canalichio was a career offender and would not agree to a plea deal in which he was not a career offender. Nevertheless, despite having the option of not entering a plea deal with the Government, Canalichio decided not to make an open plea, even though he had been advised that the Court would decide his status, not the Government. ECF NO. 1873 at 25-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    3. There is no prejudice from any failure by trial counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The Court finds that Canalichio's trial counsel was not ineffective, and so the Court does not need to resolve whether there is any prejudice. In any event, Canalichio makes an apples-to-oranges argument about the prejudice he has experienced. He argues that his exposure for an open plea was up to 105 months as opposed to 210 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1806, Rider to Motion \u00b6 99. Yet the difference between these sentences arises not from making an open plea, but from the Court's decision not to sentence Canalichio as a career offender. The Court's career-offender sentencing decision was made independently of whether Canalichio elected to go to trial (as he did) or make an open plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Canalichio overlooks that the prejudice he alleges arises from his informed decision not to make an open plea. Canalichio was aware that pleading guilty carries a reduction in sentence from one that would be imposed after a trial. Indeed, the reduction in the sentence for making an open plea is virtually the same whether career offender status applies or does not apply: career offender - 240 months vs. 210 months; non-career offender - 137 months vs. 105. Thus, there was no prejudice arising from Ms. Grasso's advice concerning his status as a career offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Canalichio has failed to show that Ms. Grasso was ineffective. He was advised of the option and benefits of an open plea and that the Court would make the ultimate sentencing determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   When a court issues a final order denying a \u00a7 2255 motion, it must also decide whether to issue a certificate of appealability. Such a certificate \"may issue ... only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). \"A petitioner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree\n   with the district court's resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\"\n   <em>\n    Pabon v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Canalichio's arguments are without merit. As to Ground One, Canalichio's trial counsel's performance did not fall below the requirements imposed by the Constitution. As to Ground Two, Canalichio's trial counsel suffered no conflicts arising from her representation of Canalichio at trial and on appeal. As to Ground Three, trial counsel properly advised Canalichio of the option and benefits of an open plea, and that sentencing is committed to the sound discretion of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The Court denies the \u00a7 2255 Motion on all grounds and denies issuing a certificate of appealability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this\n   <strong>\n    28th\n   </strong>\n   day of\n   <strong>\n    March, 2019,\n   </strong>\n   for the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   1.
