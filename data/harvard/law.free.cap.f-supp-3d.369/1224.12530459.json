The Clerk is directed to close this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED on April 3, 2019.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    (1) This case was not particularly time-consuming or laborious. (2) The questions were not particularly novel or difficult. (3) This case did not require exceptional skill. (4) Plaintiff's counsel was understandably precluded from other employment, but his timesheet reflects that he had plenty of time to work on other matters,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 48-1; (5) the customary fee is within the range of $ 375 per hour; (6) the fee was contingent; (7) there were no extenuating time limitations; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained were relatively low; (9) Plaintiff's counsel has been a member of the Florida Bar since late 1998; (10) this case was relatively undesirable; (11) Plaintiff's counsel has failed to adduce facts as to the nature and length of his professional relationship with Plaintiff; and (12) awards in similar cases have been within the range of $ 375 per hour.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    In reaching that conclusion, this Court also gives credence to the findings of Gary D. Wilson, who-without compensation-prepared a declaration on behalf of Defendants.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 51-1. Given his rate of \"$ 375 with nearly 29 years' experience,\" Mr. Wilson concluded \"that a rate of $ 350 to $ 375 would be an appropriate maximum for this type of matter.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 8. Although this Court disagrees that $ 375 would be a \"maximum\" (this Court finds it is closer to the midrange given the circumstances), $ 375 is still within the range offered by Defendant's expert.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Perhaps Defendants are relying on Florida law.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     State Farm Fire &amp; Cas.
