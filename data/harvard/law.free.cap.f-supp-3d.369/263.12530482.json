Hogan, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Ladale Rich is a veteran of the United States Navy who suffered traumatic injuries in a motorcycle accident on May 21, 2014. In November 2014, Rich submitted a claim for benefits under the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection (\"TSGLI\") program, stating that he was unable to independently perform at least two \"activities of daily living\" (\"ADLs\") as a result of his injuries. The Navy initially denied Rich's claim in full. Rich applied for reconsideration, and his claim was approved for the first 30 days of claimed losses but denied for the remaining 30 days. Rich appealed the partial denial several times, and the Board for Correction of Naval Records (\"BCNR\") ultimately denied his claim on January 3, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Rich filed this lawsuit against the United States on November 6, 2017, arguing that the Court should vacate the BCNR's decision because it was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment [ECF Nos. 11, 14], and the Court held a motions hearing on December 6, 2018. For the reasons that follow, Rich's motion will be granted in part and denied in part, and the United States's motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rich submitted his first TSGLI application on November 7, 2014 with a Medical Professional's Statement from Dr. Shupe claiming that Rich was unable to independently perform the ADLs of bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, and transferring from the dates of May 21, 2014 to July 2, 2014.

The letter informed Rich of the type of information that must be presented to support his claim and further stated that \"[b]ecause your claim did not have the necessary information, your branch of service could not approve your claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following receipt of the December 10, 2014 denial letter, Rich corresponded several times via email with Mary Koontz, Navy Program Manager for Traumatic Injury &amp; Family SGLI. AR 25-28. On December 23, 2014, Ms. Koontz emailed Rich:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   CS1, the reason you were denied is despite being bilateral lower legs, your medical records clearly states [sic] you were weight bearing on crutches and\n   you started physical therapy on day 43. Both which stop any ADL losses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   AR 27. Rich informed Ms. Koontz that the information in her email was incorrect, and their correspondence concluded on December 29, 2014 with Rich stating that he would discuss the matter with his surgeon [Dr. Shupe]. AR 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Rich retained counsel, and on May 26, 2015, he submitted a request for reconsideration of the denial of his first claim for TSGLI benefits for 30 days of ADL losses, and a supplemental claim for ADL losses for over 60 days. AR 31-32. This supplemental claim asserted that Rich was unable to independently perform the ADLs of bathing, dressing, toileting, and transferring from May 21, 2014 to July 22, 2014. AR 47-50. In addition to his medical records, Rich submitted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) a declaration regarding his injuries and inability to independently perform ADLs (AR 51-52);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (2) a declaration from his fianc\u00e9e, Melanie Escobar, who helped provide care to Rich during his recovery (AR 53-54); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (3) a medical professional's statement from an independent registered nurse, Nancy Olson, RN, MSN, who reviewed Rich's medical records and concluded that the evidence showed he could not independently perform the claimed ADLs for at least 60 consecutive days (AR 55-58).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Rich's declaration stated in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   3. Upon discharge, I was identified as a \"fall risk\", and was asked if anyone would be able to take care of me. Since I was living in the barracks at that time, it would not be feasible for me to return there, given my injuries and the stairs. Instead, I went to live with my fianc\u00e9e Melanie at her mother's house, which was a flat-level home. I was provided with a wheelchair and walker, but most of the time I had to stay in bed, as Melanie had to work, and I couldn't get up without her help. Melanie's mother and sister helped me out when she was at work as much as they could.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   4. I remember being in tremendous pain. Due to the road rash, I had dressings on both arms that were wrapped, and needed to be changed daily. My arms hurt so much that it was too painful for me to eat. Melanie fed me for the first couple weeks, and took care of my dressings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   5. Transferring from bed was limited to when someone could help me. I would have to slide to the edge of the bed, and someone would stand with the walker steady, so I could pull myself up. I had to put my hands around their arms, and they helped me at my waist, due to the intense pain from the road rash and ankle injuries, and the limitations of the splint. My legs were very weak, and I needed hands-on assistance so I would not fall. I needed this assistance until at least July 22, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   6. For bathing, Melanie would either sponge-bathe me in bed, or transfer me to the edge of the bathtub, where she would wash my wounds, and use a shower head device, while keeping my splinted leg covered. She used an antiseptic wash on my wounds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   7. For toileting, I mainly used a urinal, which Melanie had to empty. When I had to move my bowels, I needed assistance to the bedside commode, and then someone would have to\n   empty and clean it for me. This continued until at least July 22, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   8. For dressing, Melanie went out and bought me loose clothing, such as sweatpants and loose shorts. Shirts were painful to put on and take off. The road rash looked like burns, and was treated as such. I would need assistance to sit up, and hold on to something while she removed my shirt and pants. Twice a day, she wrapped my arm dressings from shoulders to hands to prevent infection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   9. I continued to have pain in my right ankle that was not improving. Two weeks after the accident, my doctor ordered an MRI of the right ankle, which showed that I needed surgery. On July 8, six weeks after the accident, I had surgery on my right ankle. Just as I had not been able to bear weight on my left leg, now I was not to bear weight on my right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   10. I continued to need assistance with ADLs of transferring, toileting, bathing, and dressing up until this right ankle surgery on July 8, and for at least two weeks after (July 22). On July 25, 2014, I was cleared to begin physical therapy, and LIMDU was initiated. I am still dealing with a damaged nerve in my right ankle, and will need another surgery to it soon. I currently walk with a cane, and perform light duty work at a computer here in Jacksonville.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   AR 51-52. Melanie Escobar's declaration stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   2. I provided my fianc\u00e9, LaDale Rich, with physical and standby assistance after he suffered fractured ankles and severe road rash as the result of a motorcycle [sic] on May 21, 2014. He was taken by car to Naval Hospital of Jacksonville, where he underwent surgery for debridement of his wounds, and splinting of his left ankle. He was discharged on May 23, with a wheelchair and walker, and was instructed not to bear any weight on his left leg. He came to live at my mother's house, as he was not fit to return to the barracks, and required constant assistance and observation so that he would not fall. He needed constant assistance until at least July 22, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   3. When LaDale got home, he was wrapped up like a mummy. He had so much road rash on his arms and him [sic] left knee that he had many dressings. I cleaned his wounds twice a day. Although they told me once a day was enough to change his dressings, the wounds were draining, and the dressings would often slide out of place when he tried to move, so I ended up changing them a second time. For the dressings, I would clean the wounds with saline, apply an antiseptic wash, pat dry and cover the wounds with Vaseline gauze, then wrap with gauze.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   4. For the first 3 weeks, I had to feed him, due to the pain in his arms and shoulders. He took his pain med oxycodone, but still was in a lot of pain that made it difficult to use his arms as well as his legs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   5. For LaDale to transfer out of bed, I would have him move his feet to the edge of the bed. Then I would push the walker as close to the bed as I could, so that he could pull up. I told him to put his arms on my shoulders, and I would put my arms under his. He's much bigger than I am, so we had to limit the times he actually got out of bed. I am a certified medical assistant, so I used the\n   experience I had with his transferring (and dressing changes). Once he was up and walking with the walker, I would walk backwards to the bathroom or wherever we were going, to make sure he didn't fall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   6. For bathing, I bathed him a lot in the bed. I used the big pads to keep things dry. When he felt like he really needed more, I would get him out of bed to the tub every 2-3 days. There I would cover his cast with plastic, have him sit on the edge of the tub and keep that leg outside the tub. We had a shower head for me to use on him. There was no way he could stand in the shower. This continued until at least July 22, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   7. For toileting, he used a urinal, which I would empty. He used a bedside commode for bowel movements. During the day while I was at work, my sister and mom would help him with toileting and emptying the urinal and commode, until at least July 22.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   8. For dressing, I went out and got him new clothes that were loose. Pajama shorts and extra-large t-shirts were helpful. I would get the shirts over his arms first, then his head. For pants, I would put on one leg at a time, and have him raise his bottom while lying down, like a baby. He was dependent on me to dress him due to his pain and weakness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   9. We found out weeks after the accident that his right ankle was shattered. He was dependent on me and my mom and sister up until the time of his right ankle surgery on July 8, and for at least two weeks after, which was July 22, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   10.

So, I was now non-weight bearing on both legs. Because, I was already ordered to be non-weight bearing on my left leg following that surgery. On July 7, 2014, I had the left cast removed. And, they put me in a Cam boot. I couldn't use crutches. I had to wait a little bit. Because, they had to wait to see if I could bend my left knee. My left knee had been split open in the accident. I had to also wait and see if I could put weight on my left ankle. I was having issues with it for a while. Then, on July 8, 2014, I had surgery on my right ankle/foot. After they did the surgery on my right ankle, I was on bedrest. I could not walk or do anything. Then, after a few weeks, they gave me a new cart to relieve the other ankle.

J. 2; AR 572. The parties' dispute, then, relates to whether Rich suffered a \"qualifying loss\" under the TSGLI schedule of losses for a period of 60 consecutive days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether the BCNR applied the incorrect burden of proof.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Rich first argues that the BCNR erred in applying the wrong burden of proof to the evaluation of his claim. Pl.'s Mem of P. &amp; A. 18. The parties agree that the appropriate evidentiary standard for TSGLI determinations is preponderance of the evidence. Pl.'s Mem of P. &amp; A. 18; Def.'s Opp'n 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SECNAV Instruction 1770.4 \u00a7 3(e)(2) (\"The evidentiary standard for TSGLI determinations is a preponderance of the evidence.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Rich argues that the BCNR failed to consider the preponderance standard when reviewing his claim, but the crux of this argument is that the BCNR failed to properly consider the evidence he submitted. While it is true that the BCNR's decision letter does not explicitly state that it applied a preponderance of the evidence standard in reviewing Rich's claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   there is no evidence indicating that the BCNR applied a higher standard. Accordingly, this challenge is more appropriately evaluated in connection with whether the BCNR failed to consider all of the evidence submitted by Rich in support of his claim, and whether its failure to do so was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether it was arbitrary and capricious for the BCNR to fail to consider first-hand caregiver statements.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Rich argues that it was arbitrary and capricious for the BCNR to either fail to consider or to discount the first-hand statements of his caregivers regarding his inability to independently perform ADLs for 60 days. Pl.'s Mem of P. &amp; A. 26-31. The BCNR's denial letter states that \"[d]ocumentary material considered by the Board consisted of your application, together with all material submitted in support thereof,\" AR 572, but there is no further indication in the record that the BCNR reviewed Rich's initial or supplemental statements, or the statements of Melanie Escobar or Kendra Clayton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Citing the BCNR's statement that it had considered Rich's \"application, together with all material submitted in support thereof,\" the government argues that \"[i]t is ... clear that the BCNR considered the letters submitted by Plaintiff's fianc\u00e9, his fianc\u00e9's sister, and his mother-in-law, along with all other evidence attached to his petition.\" Def.'s Opp'n 6. As an initial matter, it should be noted that there is no evidence in the record of a letter having been submitted by Rich's \"mother-in-law,\" so it is not clear what the government is referring to here. Regardless, it does not seem \"clear\" that any of this evidence was reviewed by the BCNR, or at any prior stage in the adjudication of Rich's claim, as the evidence is never specifically referenced or discussed in any of the Navy's decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Courts have found that an agency's failure to consider, or to discount, first-hand caregiver statements without explanation may render an agency's decision to deny TSGLI benefits arbitrary and capricious. In\n   <em>\n    Fail v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado held that the Army's failure to review statements submitted by two plaintiffs' wives in\n   support of their TSGLI claims was arbitrary and capricious:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Mr. Andersonn's wife's statement is enough to permit the conclusion that Mr. Andersonn is qualified for benefits.... Mr. Andersonn's wife's statement is more than a\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   opinion based on general patterns; it is a statement from a percipient witness about the specific limitations that Mr. Andersonn actually experienced. Although the statement is somewhat stilted, conclusory, and ambiguous, never quite articulating what the phrase \"maximum help\" means, it is nevertheless clear and unrebutted evidence that Mr. Andersonn indeed employed human assistance to perform the various ADLs during the 60-day time period set forth in the statement. The Army either failed to consider this evidence or simply discounted it without explanation, either of which would clearly be arbitrary and capricious action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Fail v.

There are at least three different, and inconsistent, \"explanations\" offered for how the conclusion was reached. First, the December 23, 2014 email from Mary Koontz to Rich states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   CS1, the reason you were denied is despite being bilateral lower legs, your medical records clearly states [sic] you were weight bearing on crutches and you started physical therapy on day 43. Both which stop any ADL losses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   AR 27. However, there is no mention of crutches anywhere in the medical records, and the medical records clearly show that Rich did not receive a referral for physical therapy until July 25, 2014 [65 days post-accident] and did not begin physical therapy (on his left leg only) until July 31, 2014 [71 days post-accident]. AR 439.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In its Memorandum in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, the government then offered the following explanation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   On June 24, 2014, Plaintiff's medical records indicate that Dr. Shupe explained that he would remove Plaintiff's cast from his left leg before performing surgery on his right leg. AR 454. Then on July 7, 2014, Plaintiff had surgery on his right leg. AR 450. Plaintiff's medical records indicate that Dr. Shupe instructed Plaintiff to be non-weight-bearing on his right leg but that Plaintiff was\n   <em>\n    released without limitations\n   </em>\n   . AR 451. This is in stark contrast to Dr. Shupe's previous medical notes in Plaintiff's medical record. This statement cannot be found in the notes prior to July 7, 2014. This is clear evidence that cuts against Plaintiff's argument that he \"required\" assistance\n   with ADLs during the second 30-day period and establishes that the agency's decision was not arbitrary and capricious.

There are at least two factual errors in this argument that are directly contradicted by Rich's medical records: (1) Rich had surgery on his right leg on July 8, 2014, and (2) there are multiple instances prior to July 7, 2014 in which Dr. Shupe's notes indicate that Rich was \"Released without Limitations,\" the first of which is on May 27, 2014, only 6 days post-injury and 4 days after the defendant was released from the hospital.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 468.

AR 12-13. There are 43 days between those two dates, if the start and end date are included. This is consistent with Defendant's approval of 30 days but not 60 days of TSGLI benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Def.'s Opp'n and Reply 6-7 [ECF No. 16]. But these\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   explanations by the government do not satisfy the BCNR's obligation to adequately explain the basis for its decision that Rich did not suffer 60 days of ADL losses. The BCNR's decision thus \"omitted the critical step - connecting the facts to the conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Dickson v. Sec'y of Def.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5708666,7415909\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/1396/\">\n    68 F.3d 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1405 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Similar to the Air Force's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   , here the BCNR's analysis consisted of conclusory statements \"without providing an account of how it reached its results.\"\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523576\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/292/399/#p402\">\n    292 F.Supp.3d at 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dickson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5708666,7415909\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/1396/\">\n    68 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1405 ). Accordingly, the Court finds that the BCNR's decision was arbitrary and capricious. The BCNR's decision will therefore be vacated, and this case will be remanded to the BCNR so that it may reconsider Rich's claim by taking into account all of the record evidence and adequately explain the basis for its decision. The Court denies Rich's motion to the extent it requests the Court order the BCNR to obtain an advisory opinion on his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   For these reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Rich's motion, DENIES the United States's motion, VACATES the BCNR's decision, and REMANDS the case to the BCNR for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion. An appropriate Order accompanies this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    As explained herein, Rich's right ankle fracture was not diagnosed until approximately 3 weeks after his accident.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    It is not clear where Dr. Shupe got the July 2 date, as there is no indication in the medical records submitted with the Administrative Record that Rich was seen by Dr. Shupe on that date or that any change was made to his weightbearing status at that time. In fact, the surgery on Rich's right ankle did not take place until July 8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    It is not clear based on the Administrative Record what these \"new and material medical records\" were.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The TSGLI Appeals Board's denial does state \"[t]he Appeals Board found that the preponderance of the evidence does not support that CS1 Rich required assistance for two or more ADLs for a period of 60 days or more.\" AR 486.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
