CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that it must deny the defendants' motion to dismiss the original Complaint as moot in light of the plaintiffs' filing of the Amended Complaint. The Court also concludes that it must grant the plaintiffs' motion for leave to proceed under the pseudonyms Jane Does 1 to 5, but only during the pretrial components of the case. Moreover, the Court concludes that it must deny the defendants' motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as moot in light of the Court's granting of the plaintiffs' motion for leave to proceed during all pretrial proceedings with the pseudonyms Jane Does 1 to 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In addition, the Court concludes that it must grant in part and deny in part the defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Specifically, as to the plaintiffs' claims in Counts II and VII, the Court concludes that it must grant the motion with respect to all plaintiffs' claims based on Renner's alleged relocation request, the claims of Jane Does 4 and 5 based on Renner's alleged disciplinary statements, the claims of Jane Does 2, 3, 4, and 5 based on Renner's alleged reduction of their hours, and the claims of Jane Does 3, 4, and 5 that the defendants retaliated against them by forcing them to resign. The Court also concludes that it must grant the defendants' motion to dismiss as to Count III with respect to the plaintiffs' gender discrimination claim based on the alleged denial of the plaintiffs' due process rights, unequal implementation of Title IX, and Renner's suggestion that the plaintiffs work from their homes. The Court also concludes that it must grant the defendants' motion to dismiss Count V. The Court further concludes that it must grant the defendants' motion to dismiss the Title IX-deliberate indifference claims of Jane Does 1 and 3 in Count VI based on Renner's alleged conduct. The Court further concludes that it must also grant the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' Title IX-retaliation claim in Count VII with respect to alleged retaliation in the form of denial of their Title-IX rights. Finally, the Court concludes that the defendants' motion to dismiss is denied in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part the defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 27th day of March, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    In addition to the filings already identified, the Court considered the following submissions in rendering its decision: (1) the Defendants' Memorandum in Support of [the Defendants'] Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint (\"Defs.' 2d Mem.\"); (2) the Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to [the] Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [the] First Amended Complaint (\"Pls.'
