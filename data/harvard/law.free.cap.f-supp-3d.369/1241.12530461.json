The Supreme Court of Florida has never claimed this unprecedented reach of Section 48.193(1)(a)(2), and the Supreme Court of the United States applies the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to forbid this unprecedented reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Volt sues (Doc. 1) Volt Lighting Group (VLG) for trademark infringement. Volt alleges that VLG infringed Volt's trademark by operating a website under the domain www.voltlightinggroup.com, which Volt contends was confusingly similar to Volt's domain, www.voltlighting.com. Volt is a citizen of Florida. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 1) VLG, which currently operates as Kelvix, LLC, is a citizen of Oregon. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 2) VLG moves to dismiss Volt's complaint for a lack of personal jurisdiction in Florida. (Doc. 11) The parties agree that general jurisdiction does not exist but dispute the existence of specific jurisdiction. (Doc. 11 at 14-15; Doc. 23 at 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Formed by Alan Brynjolfsson in 2008, Volt is a limited liability company headquartered and registered in Florida. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12) Volt specializes in outdoor and \"landscape lighting.\" (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 13; Doc. 18 at \u00b6 8) In 2008, Volt purchased the www.voltlighting.com domain but sold lights from www.landscapelightingworld.com, which prominently displayed \"VOLT.\" (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 12) And although Volt did not acquire the \"VOLT\" trademark until 2014, Volt since 2009 has used \"VOLT\" in trade-show advertising, in trade magazines, and on the internet. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18) Additionally, the products sold from landscapelightingworld.com, as well as those products' packaging, bore the word \"VOLT.\" (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 12) In late 2012 or early 2013, Volt began redirecting internet traffic from landscapelightingworld.com to voltlighting.com. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 16)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May 2010, Brent Newman \"registered\" \"Volt Lighting\" with the Oregon Secretary of State. (Doc. 11-1 at \u00b6 5) At the time, Newman's business consisted of a small \"brick-and-mortar\" store in Bend, Oregon. (Doc. 11-1 at \u00b6 6) The store did not sell \"landscape lighting.\" (Doc. 11-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 13) Newman promoted the store through www.voltlighting.net. (Doc. 11-1 at \u00b6 5) But in 2011 and 2012, Newman purchased the www.voltlightinggroup.com domain and \"transitioned the business name from Volt Lighting to Volt Lighting Group.\" (Doc. 11-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7) As part of the business's transition, Newman began selling customized LED lighting, closed the store, and ceased using voltlighting.net. (Doc. 11-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-7, 37, 44) In April 2014, Newman's two business partners registered Volt Lighting Group as a limited liability company in Oregon\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and adopted the voltlightinggroup.com domain. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26; Doc. 11-1 at \u00b6 8) However, VLG did not sell either through the voltlightinggroup.com website or by telephone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 11-1 at \u00b6 40) Nor did voltlightinggroup.com display prices. (Doc. 11-1 at \u00b6 40) VLG maintains sixteen employees,\n   all of whom work in Oregon; VLG manufactures only in Oregon; and VLG's headquarters are in Oregon. (Doc. 11 at 6) VLG is not registered to conduct business in Florida, keeps no office in Florida, and participates in no trade shows in Florida. (Doc. 11 at 6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In sum, beginning in either 2012 or 2013 and continuing through June 2018, Volt used voltlighting.com and VLG used voltlightinggroup.com. Volt alleges that the similarity between the domain names caused consumer confusion and that VLG's using voltlightinggroup.com infringed Volt's trademark. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 6) Newman claims not to have known about Volt's website or business through 2013. (Doc. 11-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 10-14) Although he admits learning about Volt in 2015, Newman received no complaint from Volt about infringement.

Under Section 48.193(1)(a)(2), Florida Statutes, a non-resident submits to personal jurisdiction in Florida by \"[c]ommitting a tortious act within [Florida].\" Trademark infringement is a tortious act under the long-arm statute.\n   <em>\n    Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v.

A non-resident can submit to Florida's jurisdiction by transmitting \"into Florida\" an electronic communication that results in a tort.\n   <em>\n    Wendt v.

For example, a non-resident who posts a defamatory statement on a website that is accessible in Florida submits to Florida's jurisdiction only if a person in Florida views the website. Accordingly, a non-resident who uses a website to infringe a trademark submits to Florida's jurisdiction if the website bearing the infringing mark is not only accessible in Florida but is viewed in Florida.\n   <em>\n    Jackson-Bear Group, Inc. v.

Although Brynjolfsson declares that Volt \"employees have reported multiple instances of confused customers\" (Doc. 24 at \u00b6 9), the statement permits no inference that a customer in Florida viewed VLG's allegedly infringing website. Under\n   <em>\n    Internet Solutions\n   </em>\n   , Volt fails to establish that Florida's long-arm statute subjects VLG to Florida's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Licciardello v.

But\n   <em>\n    Licciardello\n   </em>\n   pre-dates the Supreme Court of Florida's governing directive in\n   <em>\n    Internet Solutions\n   </em>\n   , which requires not only the website's accessibility in Florida but the website's viewing in Florida to subject a non-resident to Florida's jurisdiction under the long-arm statute.\n   <em>\n    Oriental Imps. &amp; Exps., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12147098\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/701/889/#p890\">\n    701 F.2d at 890-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring a federal court in Florida to construe Florida's long-arm statute as the statute is understood by the Supreme Court of Florida).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   But even if the long-arm statute encompasses VLG's alleged infringement, Florida's exercising personal jurisdiction over VLG violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    International Shoe Co. v.
