INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff was convicted of filing a false tax return over seven years ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Now, as a convicted felon, she is prohibited from owning firearms by federal law. A claim that the federal law is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment as applied to her has been brought.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants move to dismiss the complaint in its entirety under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2011 Lisa Folajtar pled guilty in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to filing a false tax return, a felony subject to possible fine up to $ 100,000, imprisonment for up to three years, or both. The Honorable James Knoll Gardner sentenced Folajtar to three years' probation, including three months of home confinement with an electronic monitoring device, a $ 10,000 fine, and a mandatory $ 100 special assessment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   She completed her probation without any violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Folajtar wants to obtain firearms and ammunition to defend herself and her family within their home and a Federal Firearms License for Archery Addictions, LTD, a Pennsylvania corporation of which she is President. Federal law, however, bars her from owning, possessing, using, or purchasing a firearm or ammunition. After learning of this bar, Folajtar has not attempted to purchase a firearm or apply for a Federal Firearms License for Archery Addictions for fear of violating federal law. As a result, she filed the complaint in this matter seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The Attorney General of the United States, Acting Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States (collectively, the \"Government\") move to dismiss the complaint in its entirety with prejudice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) allows a court to dismiss a complaint for its \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The Rules generally demand \"only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, in order to give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\"\n   <em>\n    Connelly v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Government moves to dismiss the complaint in its entirety with prejudice. The Government argues that Folajtar seeks an unreasonable and unsupportable expansion of Second Amendment case law because Congress defined her conviction as a felony-a serious criminal offense. Folajtar argues her non-violent felony conviction is distinguished from the class of individuals historically barred from gun ownership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After applying the relevant authority and the framework established in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   and confirmed in\n   <em>\n    Binderup v. Attorney General\n   </em>\n   , and for the reasons discussed below, the Court concludes that Folajtar does not state a plausible Second Amendment claim, grants the Government's motion, and dismisses this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Second Amendment and Challenges to the Constitutionality of Section 922(g)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Second Amendment states: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" U.S. Const. amend. II. These Second Amendment rights are not without limitations. In 2008, the United States Supreme Court considered the Second Amendment's protections and clarified that it protects the right to possess and use firearms for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.
