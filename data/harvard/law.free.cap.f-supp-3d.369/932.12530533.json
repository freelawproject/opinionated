The Court previously ruled that Defendants' Motion would be determined without oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 299. For the reasons set forth below, the Court hereby DENIES Defendants' Motion for Partial Judgment on the Pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a professional artist who resides in Indiana and sells her artwork from her own website and through authorized dealers. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 180. She alleges that her artwork was reproduced and sold on websites operated by Alibaba Defendants-e.g., Alibaba.com, AliExpress.com, Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, and 1688.com-by Chinese merchants without her authorization.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 149-156, 190-201.

(\"AGHL\"), and Alipay US, Inc. On February 7, 2018, Keck dismissed Defendant Alipay US, Inc. without prejudice. ECF 165. On August 30, 2018, the Court dismissed Defendant AGHL for lack of personal jurisdiction without leave to amend and dismissed Plaintiff's claim for\n   vicarious copyright infringement against Defendants Alibaba.com, Inc. and Alibaba Group (U.S.), Inc. with leave to amend, among other rulings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Alibaba Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 25, ECF 277.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently filed her FAC amending,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , her vicarious copyright infringement claim.

In reversing the district court's grant of a preliminary injunction, the Ninth Circuit held that Perfect 10 did not demonstrate a likelihood of success in establishing that Google had the right and ability to stop or limit the infringing activities of the third-party websites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/#p1173\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/#p1173\">\n    at 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Amazon.com\n   </em>\n   , some third-party websites participated in Google's AdSense program, which matches online content with ads relevant to that content.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/#p1173\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/#p1173\">\n    at 1156, 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

By contrast, Google cannot stop any of the third-party websites from reproducing, displaying, and distributing unauthorized copies of Perfect 10's images because that infringing conduct takes place on the third-party websites.\"\n   <em>\n    Amazon.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/#p1173\">\n    508 F.3d at 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, although a close call, the Defendants are more similarly situated to the swap meet operator and Napster than to Google. Crucially, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants' websites are online marketplaces that constitute \"a large ecosystem for online and mobile commerce\" over which Defendants \"exercise high levels of control.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 11, 133, 151, 253. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants are \"involved in the day-to-day operation, control, marketing, and design of [the marketplaces].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 253, 346-49.

Thus, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Amazon.com\n   </em>\n   , the alleged direct infringement here takes place not \"on the internet\" writ large but instead on Defendants' websites/marketplaces. Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have the right and ability to terminate the membership of merchants who repeatedly infringe, the right to remove, modify, or reject unlawful content on the websites/marketplaces, and the discretionary right to suspend access to the websites/marketplaces.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 248-251. In other words, where Google had the right to terminate the AdSense partnership-which would not have stopped direct infringement by third parties-here the Defendants could have ended the alleged direct infringement on their own websites/marketplaces by terminating or suspending the merchants' memberships.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amazon.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/#p1173\">\n    508 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1174 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Routt v.

Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have deployed technology to identify and take down \"millions of postings that infringed third parties' intellectual property rights,\" but contend that these measures \"do not reflect an ability\n   <em>\n    to prevent sellers from uploading infringing listings in the first place.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (emphasis in original). However, as Plaintiff points out,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 9, a \"practical ability\" to stop or limit infringement does not require antecedent prevention. Instead, the question is whether\n   Defendants have \"the practical ability\n   <strong>\n    to police\n   </strong>\n   the infringing activities of third-part[ies].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amazon.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/#p1173\">\n    508 F.3d at 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Indeed, \"[t]o escape imposition of vicarious liability, the reserved right to police must be exercised to its fullest extent. Turning a blind eye to detectable acts of infringement for the sake of profit gives rise to liability.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A &amp; M Records\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11077046\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/1004/#p1022\">\n    239 F.3d at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, Plaintiff has adequately alleged that Defendants failed to police their websites/marketplaces to the fullest extent, thus permitting detectable acts of infringement to occur. For example, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have technology to proactively identify infringing material,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6\u00b6 246, 252, and that Plaintiff has repeatedly notified Defendants of infringing material,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 264-73, but that Defendants nonetheless failed to remove the infringing material,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 221, 256, 274-86, 332. As another example, Plaintiff alleges that so-called \"repeat offenders\"-merchants identified as having previously infringed-were permitted to continue to use Defendants' websites/marketplaces despite Defendants' knowledge of the merchants' infringing activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 337-341. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants have failed to maintain adequate records of infringing activity,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 342, which the Court may reasonably infer hinders Defendants' ability to police their system. Taken as a whole, the Court finds sufficient allegations of Defendants' practical ability to stop or limit infringement and failure to police their websites/marketplaces \"to [the] fullest extent.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A &amp; M Records\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11077046\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/1004/#p1022\">\n    239 F.3d at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In sum, Plaintiff sufficiently alleges \"a legal right to stop or limit the directly infringing conduct, as well as the practical ability to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517572\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/1106/#p1132\">\n    895 F.3d at 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

For example, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants receive commissions from the sale of unauthorized copies of Keck's artwork and that the unauthorized display, reproduction and sale of copyrighted\n   works owned by Keck and others draws visitors to Defendants' platforms.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6\u00b6 257-59. As another example, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have knowledge that goods are being sold on their platforms in violation of third parties' copyright and trademark rights, that Defendants have developed the reputation as marketplaces for such \"[k]nock-off goods,\" and that Defendants monetize increased traffic due to those goods.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6\u00b6 161-63.
