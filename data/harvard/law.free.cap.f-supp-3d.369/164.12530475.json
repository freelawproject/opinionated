LAMBERTH, United States District Judge\n   In Fall 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the \"Service\") issued two new findings with respect to elephants and lions in Zimbabwe. By determining that permitted hunting of these animals will enhance the survival of each species, the country-wide findings paved the way for U.S. importation of sport-hunted trophies of these animals. After the D.C.

Whether or not the Service relies on the same information to make its individual enhancement determinations does not give the withdrawn country-wide findings any operational effect in and of themselves. Instead, the proper vehicle to challenge the Service's methods in coming to an enhancement finding is to challenge the new enhancement determinations themselves-the findings that actually affect the ability to import sport-hunted trophies. In other words, these new enhancement findings do not create a live controversy over old ones.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Furthermore, plaintiffs cannot rely on an exception to the mootness requirement under either the doctrine of \"actions capable of repetition yet evading review\" or because of the defendant's voluntary cessation of offending conduct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review exception applies where a party demonstrates that \"(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action.\"\n    <em>\n     Clarke v.

And plaintiff cannot save their claims from the mootness doctrine on the basis that future litigation challenging not country-wide findings but instead the issuance of a specific import permit might evade review. If the concern is that those individual adjudication decisions are too short in duration to be fully litigated, the capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review exception can be applied in that context.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The voluntary cessation doctrine is equally inapplicable.

For example, it \"will have to dedicate more of the limited time and resources of [its] small international program to providing, for example, new scientific studies on trophy hunting, the population status of elephants or lions in different countries or regions, governance in specific countries, and other relevant information to FWS.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs argue that this \"consequent drain on [ ] resources, which could be dedicated to other conservation efforts, supports their organizational standing here.\" Pls.' Opp. Mot. Dismiss 51.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    But two flaws doom plaintiffs' argument. First, on its face, the alleged \"policy\" in the March Memo has an indeterminate effect on the Center's primary mission to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats in the United States and abroad. The change to case-by-case adjudication does not by itself suggest that more sport-hunted trophies will be imported to the United States. And the D.C. Circuit has cautioned that \"[i]f the challenged conduct affects an organization's activities, but is neutral with respect to its substantive mission, [the Circuit has] found it 'entirely speculative' whether the challenged practice will actually impair the organization's activities.\"\n    <em>\n     Am.

Because of the shift to case-by-case evaluation, the Center argues that it will have to devote more resources to FOIA actions and providing more updated information to the Service in order to challenge sport-hunted trophy importation.

CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the majority of plaintiffs claims. Claims one through six are moot. Additionally, plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the Service's withdrawal of positive enhancement findings and its decision to change from country-wide to case-by-case enhancement and non-detriment determinations. And while plaintiffs have plausibly alleged standing to challenge the withdrawal of certain negative enhancement and non-detriment determinations, plaintiffs fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. As such, the case will be\n    <strong>\n     DISMISSED.\n    </strong>\n    A separate order will issue.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-101\">\n     In addition to the 2017 Zimbabwe lion and elephant findings, the March Memo withdrew the following enhancement findings: 1997, 2014, and 2015 findings for elephants in Zimbabwe; 1997, 2014, and 2015 findings for elephants in Tanzania; a 1995 finding for elephants in South Africa; a 1997 finding for bontebok taken in South Africa; 2016 and 2017 findings for lions in South Africa; a 1997 finding for elephants in Botswana; 1995 finding for elephants in Namibia; a 2012 finding for elephants in Zambia; a 2017 finding for lions in Zambia; and the 2017 finding for elephants in Zambia.
