First, the Final Rule did not force Ms. Brennan to reduce her cattle turnout numbers.

That is especially true when the Defendants offer a reasonable explanation for the 40 percent allowable use standard in 2017. They point out that the 2004 SNFPA's S &amp; Gs, adopted by the 2014 BiOp and the Three Amphibians BO, set the allowable use percentage from late seral meadows, like Eagle Meadow, at 40 percent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Mot. at 24-25; Def.-Int. Reply in Supp. of Cross Mot. Summ. J. at 4, ECF No. 58;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2014\n   BiOp at 94. So the 2017 Operating Instructions were arguably instituting the 2004 S &amp; Gs, not the 2016 Final Rule at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Cattlemen's argument that the Final Rule caused the Forest Service to implement new monitoring requirements is also unpersuasive. First, the language incorporated into the Cattlemen's permits under \"Monitoring\" almost entirely describes the\n   <em>\n    Forest Service's\n   </em>\n   monitoring practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Royer Decl., Ex. 1 at 3, ECF No. 60-1 (\"The Forest Service regularly conducts two types of monitoring ... to meet the monitoring requirements described in the Three Amphibian BO\"). Extra monitoring requirements imposed on the Forest Service do not harm the Cattlemen. The only direction to permittees is that they \"take appropriate action and/or monitoring\" to ensure compliance with the terms and condition of their grazing permit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699384,9418085\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/895/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   But permittees needed to monitor their allotments even before the Final Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Operating Instructions at 5. It is true that Brennan Ranch's forage monitoring requirements are different for the 2016 and 2017 permits. But much like the change in utilization, the Cattlemen have pointed to no evidence showing that the change derives from the Final Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, the Cattlemen have not shown an injury traceable to the Final Rule from the Forest Service's application of S &amp; G 53.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Cattlemen note that the Forest Service added language to permits explicitly detailing S &amp; G 53.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wilbur Decl. 3 \u00b6\u00b6 6-14. But the Forest Service adopted S &amp; G 53 well before the Final Rule.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2014 BiOp at 2, 87. And the language added to the Eagle Meadow permit mirrors the language in S &amp; G 53.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Wilbur Decl. \u00b6 6 (\"Under the Plan ... livestock are excluded from occupied Yosemite toad breeding habitat during the breeding and rearing season (through metamorphosis\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   2014 BiOp at 87 (S &amp; G 53). Indeed, permits as far back as 1995 contain similar language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wooster Decl., Ex. 1 at 2, ECF No. 60-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Even so, the Cattlemen argue that before the Final Rule the Forest Service had a \"pattern of either not applying, or loosely applying, S &amp; G 53.\" Wilbur Decl. 3 \u00b6 14. But their evidence is unpersuasive. They point to a 2013 Guidance Letter that states, \"local line officers should not consider themselves bound by S &amp; G 53 and 54.\" Wooster Decl., Ex 2 at 4. This, however, does not establish evidence of a pattern or practice of ignoring or departing from S &amp; G 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, the letter was published before the FWS published the Listing Regulation and the 2014 BiOp. But the 2014 BiOp adopted the S &amp; Gs from the 2004 SNFPA, like S &amp; G 53.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 BiOp at 87. Moreover, the guidance document instructs local line officers to discuss alternative approaches with the Regional Office before varying from S &amp; Gs 53 and 54.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699384,9418085\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/895/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Cattlemen have pointed to no evidence that any officer did such a consultation to circumvent S &amp; G 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   These permit modifications also present a redressability problem. The Forest Service is responsible for issuing grazing permits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2017 Brennan Permit. But the Forest Service is not a party here, and the Cattlemen seek no relief directed at the Forest Service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 1, 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   So even if the Court invalidated the Final Rule, whether that relief would redress the Cattlemen's injuries depends on an unknowable factor: how the Forest Service will react. The Cattlemen have pointed to no evidence suggesting that the\n   Forest Service would revise Brennan Ranch's utilization to 60 percent or absolve permittees from monitoring their allotments. Indeed, existing authorities, like the 2004 SNFPA and 2014 BiOp, would still require the Forest Service to impose permit terms to protect the listed amphibians. For example, S &amp; G 53 would still apply.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2014 BiOp at 2, 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In sum, it is unclear that the Forest Service would modify the Cattlemen's permits even if the Court granted the requested relief. But to satisfy the redressability prong \"the prospect of obtaining relief from the injury as a result of a favorable ruling cannot be too speculative.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abulhawa v. U.S. Dep't of the Treasury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267682\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/24/#p36\">\n    239 F.Supp.3d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 36 (D.D.C. 2017) (cleaned up). Relief is too speculative here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Ultimately, the Cattlemen have failed to establish that any of their members have suffered an injury in fact traceable to the Final Rule, rather than the pre-existing requirements. Nor have they shown that the relief sought would redress the injuries alleged. Thus, because the Cattlemen's members lack standing to challenge the Final Rule, the Cattlemen lack organizational standing to sue on their members behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warth v. Seldin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9528\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/490/#p511\">\n    422 U.S. 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 511,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9528\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/490/#p511\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9528\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/490/#p511\">\n    45 L.Ed.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975).

The Court explained that after considering the declarations and the arguments in the briefing, it was not inclined to find standing at the summary judgment stage. Tr. at 35-37.
