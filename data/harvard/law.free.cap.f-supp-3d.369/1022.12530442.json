(ECF No. 14.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This motion has been fully briefed. (ECF Nos. 2, 24.) The second is Defendant Hartford Fire Insurance Company's (\"Hartford's\") motion to dismiss EHCC's FAC (ECF No. 17), which has also received the benefit of full briefing. (ECF Nos. 25, 26.) The final motion at issue is EHCC's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion for an order setting or amending the briefing schedule on the pending Rule 12(b) motions (ECF No. 18), which has been opposed by Scottsdale. (ECF No. 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1(d)(1), the Court finds the matter suitable for adjudication without oral argument. For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   both motions to dismiss with leave to amend and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   as moot EHCC's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1. EHCC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff Erickson-Hall Construction Company is a California Corporation with approximately 150 employees. EHCC \"competes for highly talented employees by offering its employees certain employment benefits in addition to its compensation packages.\" (ECF No. 10, at 3.) One of the benefits EHCC offers is company paid Life Insurance, Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Long Term Disability Insurance (collectively, the \"EHCC Benefit Plans\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The EHCC Benefit Plans are purchased by EHCC for its employees from a third-party insurance company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   EHCC employees are also presented with the option to purchase additional coverage under the EHCC Benefit Plans. Employees have been made to understand that the additional coverage would be paid for directly from their paychecks, and that payments would be administered by EHCC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   EHCC employed a non-executive level Controller with a background in accounting to oversee the operation of the EHCC Benefit Plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) The Controller was the primary person responsible for informing employees about their eligibility for, and the scope of any of the EHCC Benefit Plans which EHCC offered to purchase on the employees' behalf. The Controller was tasked with enrolling employees (by providing third party insurance companies the information required to enroll and maintain coverage), deducting from employees' paychecks moneys to pay premiums for the additional coverages which employees elected to purchase, as well as paying premiums for the ordinary coverage offered as part of the EHCC Benefit Plans. The financial part of the Controller's responsibilities included receiving and processing premium invoices from the third-party insurance companies and responding to any late payment notifications sent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Scottsdale Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To guard against the incidents of its administration of the EHCC Benefits Plans, EHCC purchased a \"Business and Management Indemnity Policy\" from Scottsdale (the \"Scottsdale Policy\"), which was effective between August 15, 2016 to August 15, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Scottsdale is organized under the laws of Ohio, and is a subsidiary of Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (\"Nationwide\"), also of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Scottsdale Policy included a Fiduciary Coverage Section that ensured that Scottsdale would indemnify EHCC for any \"Loss\" which EHCC \"become[s] legally obligated by reason of a Claim ... for any Wrongful Act.\" (ECF No. 10-1, at 30, 96.). A \"Claim\" encompasses any \"written demand for damages or other relief against [EHCC],\" and a Wrongful Act is defined to include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Allegations of a breach of the responsibilities imposed on the fiduciaries of a \"Sponsored Plan\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Any matter \"claimed against [EHCC] solely because of the service of [EHCC] as a fiduciary of a Sponsored Plan,\"; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 \"[A]ny actual or alleged act, error or omission in the Administration of any Sponsored Plan.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (ECF No. 10-1, at 32.) With respect to the third category of Wrongful Act, \"Administration\" is defined to include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 \"enrolling, terminating or canceling employees under any Plan\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 \"providing interpretations with respect to any Plan\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 \"counseling employees, beneficiaries or Plan participants\" about benefit Plans; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 \"handling records in connection with any Plan.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Hartford Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   EHCC also secured a \"Special Multi-Flex Business Insurance Policy\" with Hartford that was effective between August 15, 2016 and August 15, 2017 (the \"Hartford Policy\"). Hartford is a company organized under the laws of Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Hartford Policy included an Employee Benefits Liability Coverage Endorsement, pursuant to which Hartford agreed to \"pay those sums that [EHCC] shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'employee benefits injury' to which this endorsement applies.\" (ECF No. 10-2, at 40.) \"Employee benefits injury\" is further defined as \"any injury that arises out of any negligent act, error, or omission in the 'administration' of EHCC's 'employee benefits program.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Administration,\" as defined in relation to an employee benefits program, encompasses both:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 \"Giving counsel\" to EHCC's employees and beneficiaries with respect to interpreting the scope of EHCC's employee benefits program or the\n   employees' eligibility to participate in such programs, and;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 \"Handling records in connection with an 'employee benefits program.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Lapse in Premium Payments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Unbeknownst to anyone else at EHCC, the Controller failed to make the premium payments required to maintain and renew the EHCC Benefit Plan and coverage terminated as of January 1, 2016. (ECF No. 10, at 8.) According to EHCC, the lapse in coverage resulted from the Controller's negligent administration of, and mishandling of records related to, the EHCC Benefit Plans-the Controller did not \"adequately and timely transfer[ ] and administer[ ]\" the \"premium payments collected from employees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Even after the termination of coverage, the Controller did not notify anyone at EHCC that the EHCC Benefit Plans had lapsed, and did not inform EHCC employees that they were no longer enrolled or participating in the EHCC Benefit Plans. It is further alleged that, had the Controller taken reasonable steps to counsel and inform EHCC's employees about the lapse of their EHCC Benefit Plans, EHCC employees may have been able to take remedial actions to renew the EHCC Benefit Plans. In addition, it is alleged that, had the Controller taken reasonable steps to inform EHCC about the EHCC Benefit Plans, then EHCC would have had an opportunity to reinstate the EHCC Benefit Plans before incurring losses that would have been covered thereunder. EHCC maintains the Controller's actions were both unreasonable and negligent, but never \"intentional.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Thereafter, three of EHCC's employees (i.e., the \"Employment Claimants\") suffered injuries or death that the Employment Claimants and/or their beneficiaries claimed would have been covered by the EHCC Benefit Plans if the EHCC Benefit Plans had been properly administered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Upon being informed that their EHCC Benefit Plans were not in effect, each Employee Claimant submitted written demand letters (constituting the \"Underlying Claims\") to EHCC seeking payment of the benefits they would have been entitled to recover under the EHCC Benefit Plans had they been in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   EHCC settled all three Underlying Claims without litigation. One of the Underlying Claims was resolved by purchasing a cash value replacement plan that would provide an equivalent benefit to that which would have been due under the EHCC Benefit Plan, had it been in effect. The other two Underlying Claims were settled for payments of the anticipated values of the EHCC Benefit Plans, had they been in effect. The total cost of settling the three Underlying Claims was in excess of $ 200,000. In addition to that outlay, EHCC suffered losses arising from the defense and negotiation of the settlements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Denials of Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On or about March 21, 2017, EHCC submitted a timely claim to Scottsdale seeking coverage and indemnification for the Underlying Claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) In response, a representative from Scottsdale\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   denied the claim by a letter dated May 23, 2017. After the denial, Scottsdale made a series of document requests to EHCC. EHCC alleges that these requests did not arise out of a genuine, good faith investigation into EHCC's claim, but were rather\n   disguised attempts to create a record supporting its decision to deny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   EHCC submitted a similar claim to Hartford, which was denied by a letter dated April 26, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Following the denial, EHCC sought a reason for the denial and offered to provide additional information supporting coverage. On September 11, 2017, Hartford issued a letter which stated that it had forwarded EHCC's information on to another department for further review, but that its \"coverage position remain[ed] unchanged at this time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) After several later attempts by EHCC to obtain further review of its coverage request, Hartford re-confirmed its decision denying coverage on February 1, 2018. In that letter, Hartford advised EHCC that it would revisit the coverage decision \"[s]hould a lawsuit be filed in this matter,\" and if EHCC submits a copy of that suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) EHCC alleges that Hartford never conducted a good faith investigation into EHCC's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   EHCC sued Scottsdale and Hartford (collectively, \"Defendants\"), in federal court on October 25, 2018. After Hartford filed its initial motion to dismiss EHCC's original complaint on December 11, 2018, EHCC amended its complaint as a matter of course. FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The operative complaint, i.e., the FAC, states three causes of action against both Defendants: breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and declaratory judgment. Each of the three causes of action is bottomed on Defendants' denial of EHCC's insurance claim and their failures to indemnify EHCC for the settlement of the Underlying Claims. Specifically, EHCC alleges that Defendants had breached their contractual duty to \"provide indemnification and coverage for the losses incurred by EHCC arising from negligent acts performed in the administration of the EHCC Benefit Plans.\" (ECF No. 10, at 12.) Under EHCC's reading of the insurance agreements, Defendants were obliged to indemnify losses arising from the Controller's \"failure to take reasonable steps to maintain the EHCC Benefits Plans and to inform EHCC employees about the lapsed status of the EHCC premium payments, [his] mishandling of records, paycheck deductions, premium payments, and renewal notices in connection with EHCC Benefit Plans.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On December 27, 2018, EHCC filed a motion with Magistrate Judge Berg, requesting that an Early Neutral Evaluation Conference take place prior to any briefing on any motions to dismiss that may be filed. (ECF No. 12.) While that motion was pending, Scottsdale and Hartford filed their respective motions for dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). (ECF Nos. 14, 17.) On January 15, 2019, Plaintiff filed an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion for a briefing schedule on the motions to dismiss that would take into accounts to its motion for an early ENE conference. (ECF No. 18.) Later, on January 18, 2019, Judge Berg denied EHCC's request for an early ENE conference. (ECF No. 22.) The Court will first address EHCC's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion before turning to the motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    II. EHCC's\n    <em>\n     ex parte\n    </em>\n    Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   EHCC's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion requests two things of the Court. First, it asks that the Court issue a briefing schedule that would allow for resolution of EHCC's motion for an early ENE conference before any briefing on any Rule 12(b)(6) motions take place. (ECF No. 18, at 2.) However, as mentioned\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , EHCC's request for an early ENE was denied by order of Magistrate Judge Berg on January 18, 2019. Thus, EHCC's related ex parte motion for a briefing schedule which would take into\n   account the motion for an early ENE is\n   <strong>\n    denied as moot\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, at the time EHCC filed its\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion, Hartford had not filed its motion to dismiss the FAC. Instead, Hartford had elected to oppose the allegations in the FAC through its reply in support of its motion to dismiss EHCC's\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   complaint. (ECF No. 15.) In light of this procedural oddity, EHCC's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion also requested an opportunity to respond to the arguments raised by Hartford's reply-i.e., to file a sur-reply. (ECF No. 18-1, at 4-6.) However, on the same day that EHCC filed its\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion, Hartford filed its motion to dismiss EHCC's FAC. And EHCC thereafter was provided with an opportunity to oppose Hartford's arguments regarding the allegations in its FAC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 25.) That being the case, EHCC's request for an opportunity to file a sur-reply is also\n   <strong>\n    denied as moot.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Defendants' Motions to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants argue that EHCC's FAC fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted with respect to all three of its causes of action-breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and declaratory judgment. Although Defendants have submitted separate motions to dismiss based on the particularities of their respective agreements with EHCC, their arguments are both premised on the claim that a failure by EHCC to pay insurance premiums is not a covered event. Without coverage, Defendants argue, there can be no claim for breach of contract, declaratory judgment, or breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard Applicable to a Rule 12(b)(6) Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests the sufficiency of a complaint.\n   <em>\n    Navarro v.

EHCC's Burden of Proving the Potential for Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   EHCC contends that there is potential for coverage under both the Hartford and Scottsdale policies. Both policies insured EHCC against losses arising from any negligent acts or omissions and or breach of fiduciary duty associated\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   with its administration of the EHCC Benefit Plans, and by EHCC's reckoning, the Controller's actions with respect to the EHCC Benefit Plans were at all times either negligent or done without the requisite standard of care. In addition, EHCC contends that all of the Controller's acts were with respect to 'administration.' Administration, as defined by the policies, includes the handling of records, the enrollment or termination of employees, and counseling with respect to EHCC Benefit Plans. Both policies, then, would ostensibly cover a claim that EHCC's Controller inadvertently and negligently failed to process the premium records-i.e., payments-necessary to maintain enrollment in the EHCC Benefit Plans, and unreasonably failed to counsel EHCC employees about their termination from those plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Although EHCC's proffered understanding of what it means to \"administer\" the EHCC Benefit Plans-i.e., 'handling records' and 'counseling'-is somewhat capacious and borders on the \"strained\" and \"absurd,\"\n   <em>\n    Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1998566\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/5/854/#p867\">\n    5 Cal. 4th 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20691\">\n    21 Cal.Rptr.2d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=855%20P.2d%201263\">\n    855 P.2d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court does find these terms sufficiently ambiguous as to warrant construction in favor of coverage and against the drafters of the insurance policies-i.e., Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Granite Outlet, Inc. v.

The Court agrees with Defendants that because EHCC incurred its claimed losses as a result of its contractual undertaking toward the Employee Claimants, any claim for indemnification would fall outside the scope of the Hartford or Scottsdale Policies because they cover only breaches of fiduciary duties and negligent, tortious actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court further holds that the doctrine of reasonable expectations invoked by Plaintiff cannot save its breach of contract claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 23-1, at 11; ECF No. 25-1, at 12.)

As there is no ambiguous policy language to construe-indeed, the meaning of the direct, but-for causation demanded by the policies is well-settled-there is no basis for applying the doctrine in this case.

Thus, dismissal must be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   EHCC has asked for leave to amend in the event of dismissal. EHCC contends that is ready to \"expand on its allegations in the Amended Complaint as to [Defendants'] breach of duties and the covenant of good faith.\" (ECF No. 25-1, at 21 (with respect to Hartford's motion to dismiss);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 23-1, at 30 (making a similar contention with respect to Scottsdale's motion to dismiss) ). Hartford argues that amendment would be futile because an exclusion under the Hartford Policy for damages \"arising out of an insufficiency of founds to meet any obligations under any plan\" would apply. (ECF No. 17-1, at 17.). However, EHCC's FAC expressly pleaded that EHCC \"had sufficient funds to provide the benefits of EHCC Benefit Plans,\" and EHCC argues that it was not for want of funds that the EHCC Benefit Plans lapsed. (ECF No. 10, at 9; ECF No. 25-1, at 22.). Accepting these factual allegations as true, and reading an arguably ambiguous exclusionary provision narrowly, as the Court must, the Court finds that amendment would not be futile. As a result, the Court\n   <strong>\n    grants dismissal, with leave to amend.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
