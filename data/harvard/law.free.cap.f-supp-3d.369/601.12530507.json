STARK, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (\"Sun Life\" or \"Plaintiff\") filed this action in January 2017 against U.S. Bank National Association (\"U.S. Bank\" or \"Defendant\") and Lindsay Spalding-Jagolinzer (\"Spalding\"). (D.I. 1) In its complaint, Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that a Sun Life insurance policy (\"the Policy\") brokered by Spalding and eventually sold to U.S. Bank lacked an insurable interest at inception and constitutes an illegal human life wagering contract. (D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 39-52) As such, Sun Life asks the Court to declare the Policy void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   under Delaware law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on a settlement, the claims against Spalding have since been dismissed with prejudice. (D.I. 180)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court are Plaintiff's and Defendant's cross-motions for partial summary judgment. (D.I. 131, 135) For the reasons set forth below, the Court will grant Plaintiff's motion deny Defendant's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Spalding is a Miami-based insurance agent who was appointed by several carriers to sell life insurance policies. (D.I. 130-2, Spalding Dep. at 15, 31-32, 40-43) In particular, she had a \"Sales Representative Agreement\" with Sun Life, whereby she would solicit applications for Sun Life policies in exchange for a fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-43, 149; D.I. 130-3 at 140-46 (A576-82) ) ) ) Between 2005 and 2008, Spalding also worked with Coventry Capital Partners (\"Coventry\") on behalf of her clients to finance the premiums those clients had to pay on life insurance policies Spalding helped them obtain. (D.I. 130-2, Spalding Dep. at 15, 85-87, 95) Coventry's terms for agents and prospective insureds, including all rates and fees, were non-negotiable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119-20) Any time Spalding originated a policy financed by Coventry, she and Coventry split the commission 50-50. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 160) Spalding did not, however, have an exclusive arrangement with Coventry, so she would generally contact several premium finance companies on behalf of her clients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In late 2005, Harriet Sol, then aged 71, was referred to Spalding for the purpose of securing a life insurance policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52) During their initial phone conversation, Spalding and Sol discussed life insurance options, including the concept of premium financing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54-56) Spalding informed Sol that in order to secure premium financing, Sol needed to have a net worth over $ 5 million; Sol indicated that she wanted to pursue premium financing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sol allegedly claimed that her net worth was about $ 10 million and that she had an annual household income of over $ 200,000, and Spalding apparently accepted these statements as true. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89-90, 142, 147-48) Spalding then obtained Sol's medical records, compiled an informal application, and submitted the application and records to Sun Life to secure a tentative offer for a policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63-65) Sun Life made such an offer in late January 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65, 173-74)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Within days of receiving the offer, Spalding's company, Spalding Financial Group (\"SFG\"), obtained life expectancy reports on Sol. (D.I. 132-15; D.I. 132-16) A few months later, Coventry obtained its own independent life expectancy report on Sol. (D.I. 132-17) Spalding has testified in deposition that her regular practice is to obtain such reports for any client over the age of 70, and that the reports are useful for clients who may consider selling their policy on the secondary market. (D.I. 132-3 at 79-82)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February 2006, Spalding received a Coventry Loan Proposal through Coventry's Premium Financing Program, offering Sol non-recourse premium financing. (D.I. 132-18) Spalding describes non-recourse premium financing as an option for individuals who do not want to be exposed to the risk of repaying a loan, since the policy being purchased with the loan is pledged as the sole collateral, capping the maximum amount of the borrower's loss at the value of the policy. (D.I. 132-3 at 88-89) For Sol's premium financing, Coventry enlisted LaSalle Bank National Association (\"LaSalle\") to serve as the lender. (D.I. 130-2, Spalding Dep. at 99, 149, 166; D.I. 130-3 at 185-90 (A621-26) ) Coventry's initial Loan Proposal was for premium financing on a $ 5 million Sun Life policy, proposing that the borrower be the then non-existent Harriet Sol 2006 Family Trust, Premium Finance Sub-Trust. (D.I. 132-3 at 89;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 132-18; D.I. 132-19) Subsequently, the Loan Proposal was increased, in contemplation of Sol acquiring a $ 10 million Sun Life policy instead of $ 5 million. (D.I. 132-3 at 93-94)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sol eventually executed a series of trust agreements. Sol first established the Harriet\n   Sol Irrevocable Insurance Trust (\"Insurance Trust\"), naming her daughter Jacqueline Sol (\"Jacqueline\") as the trustee and her husband and descendants - excluding her son, Allen Sol - as beneficiaries. (D.I. 132-22 at 26 (COVCAP584) ) The Insurance Trust Agreement did not disclose any specific property being held in trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (\"I have delivered or will deliver certain assets to the Trustee.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Insurance Trust then created the Harriet Sol 2006 Family Trust (\"Family Trust\"), naming the Wilmington Trust Company (\"WTC\") as trustee and Sol's daughter Jacqueline as co-trustee, with the Insurance Trust as beneficiary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5) The Family Trust was nominally funded with $ 1.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Insurance Trust also established the Harriet Sol 2006 Family Trust, Premium Finance Sub-Trust (\"Sub-Trust\") to secure premium financing for the life insurance policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 24) As with the Family Trust, the Sub-Trust's trustees were WTC and Jacqueline and its beneficiary was the Insurance Trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With the Insurance Trust, Family Trust, and Sub-Trust (collectively, the \"Trusts\") in place, Jacqueline, on behalf of the Insurance Trust, entered into a Settlor Non-Recourse Security Agreement (\"Security Agreement\") with LaSalle, pledging the Family Trust and Sub-Trust as collateral for a loan to purchase a $ 10 million life insurance policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-45) Pursuant to the Security Agreement, LaSalle agreed to provide non-recourse premium financing via a loan to the Sub-Trust in exchange for a note providing LaSalle an exclusive beneficial ownership interest in the Family Trust and Sub-Trust (as well as any assets, such as the Policy, held therein) should the loan default. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Coventry was named the servicing agent under the Security Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42) Coventry was also granted an irrevocable durable power of attorney with respect to Sol regarding any policies owned by the Family Trust and Sub-Trust, the release of her medical records, and the originating or servicing of any life insurance policies in her name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47, 59)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   WTC, on behalf of the Sub-Trust, then executed a separate Note and Security Agreement (\"Note Agreement\") with LaSalle, which constituted the loan agreement between LaSalle and the Sub-Trust. (D.I. 132-26) Coventry again was named as the servicing agent of the Note Agreement. (D.I. 132-26 at 5 (COVCAP31) ) The Note Agreement called for a 26-month loan of $ 355,000 to the Sub-Trust with an interest rate of 17.24%, plus a $ 10,262.92 \"Origination Fee\" and $ 5,142.70 \"Trust Administration Fee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10) In total, then, the premium finance agreement required payments of $ 508,764.47 at maturity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Sub-Trust would have to pay back (or refinance) that amount in 26 months or the loan would go into default and the Policy, which was pledged as collateral, would be seized by LaSalle and/or Coventry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Once the financing was secured, on March 30, 2006 Maria Lacayo, an SFG employee, submitted a formal application to Sun Life for a $ 10 million life insurance policy. (D.I. 132-27) The application designated Harriet Sol as the insured and the Family Trust as the policy owner and beneficiary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7 (SunLife52-54) ) The application represented that Sol had a net worth of $ 10 million, an annual household income of over $ 200,000, and that the payor of the premium was the same as the owner of the policy, i.e., the Family Trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8) Spalding certified that the answers provided in the application were \"complete and true to the best of [her] knowledge.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As part of the subsequent underwriting process, Sun Life sought to verify Sol's\n   financial information. (D.I. 132-3 at 176-77; D.I. 132-9 at 254-56) To that end, SFG enlisted an outside vendor, Infolink, to prepare an inspection report. (D.I. 132-14; D.I. 132-29) SFG's Lacayo sent the Infolink inspector, Jewel Sutton (formerly Jewel Strader), an e-mail summarizing Sol's purported finances, but without any supporting documentation. (D.I. 132-29; D.I. 132-31 at 74-78) While Sutton claimed it is \"unusual\" for an agent to provide her the insured's financial information directly and she would typically disregard it, she also admits that in this case the information in her report matches exactly the information provided by SFG: that Sol had an annual income of over $ 200,000 and a net worth of $ 10 million. (D.I. 132-14; D.I. 132-29; D.I. 132-31 at 77, 92-95)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Upon receiving the inspection report, Sun Life requested further justification for a $ 10 million policy. (D.I. 132-32 at 8 (SunLife43) ) Spalding responded that the estate planned to grow at a rate of 6% annually, resulting in a total estate of over $ 20 million by the end of Sol's 14-year life expectancy, thereby justifying a $ 10 million policy (after a 50% discount). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7) Sun Life then approved the application (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2), which was issued on May 12, 2006, with a Policy date of June 4, 2006 (D.I. 132-33). One week later, Sun Life received a wire transfer for the initial premium payment of $ 355,000. (D.I. 132-34)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As the 26-month maturity date on the Coventry/LaSalle loan approached, Spalding began exploring bridge loans,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to provide Spalding sufficient time to sell Sol's policy on Sol's behalf on the secondary market. (D.I. 132-3 at 196-99) Spalding and Sol eventually secured a bridge loan from W Capital Partners, LLC (\"W Capital\") and, soon thereafter, Sol's policy was sold on the secondary market to Life Settlement Solutions (\"LSS\") for $ 700,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 198-201; D.I. 132-36; D.I. 132-37) Of those proceeds, $ 508,764.47 was paid to W Capital to pay off the bridge loan (which had been used to pay Coventry/LaSalle the $ 508,764.47 owed for the original loan) and the remaining $ 191,235.53 was paid to Isidore Sol, Sol's husband. (D.I. 132-38; D.I. 132-39) LSS later sold the Policy to another entity before it was finally acquired by Defendant U.S. Bank in May 2009. (D.I. 137-2 Ex. 25 at 11, Ex. 35)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sol died on November 21, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 38) U.S. Bank then filed a claim under the Policy with Sun Life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, by no later than May 10, 2007, Sun Life had become aware of Coventry's premium financing operations, which Sun Life considered to be part of a scheme to foster the issuance of Stranger-Owned Life Insurance (\"STOLI\") policies,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Sun Life had at that time begun barring applications associated with Coventry. (D.I. 130-2, Foley Dep. at 109-10 (A212-13); D.I. 130-3 at A438-42) Sun Life further identified a series of \"flags\" that its underwriters should look for before approving policy applications that may be STOLI. (D.I. 130-3 at\n   A437) Additionally, Sun Life had copied Spalding on an e-mail dated January 26, 2006 (prior to the submission of Sol's application) stating, \"Sun Life does not accept non recourse premium financed business. If premium financed we would need complete details.\" (D.I. 132-32 at 13 (SunLife78) ) By at least 2009, Sun Life had specifically placed Sol's Policy on a suspected STOLI list. (D.I. 130-2, Lawrence Dep. at 89-90 (A23-24) )\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thus, after Sol's death, Sun Life, instead of paying U.S. Bank's claim, initiated a death claim investigation. (D.I. 132-10 at 138-41) As part of that investigation, Sun Life learned that Sol could not afford the premiums on her policy. (D.I. 132-41 at 9-10 (\u00b616) ) In fact, according to her son, Richard, Sol had previously entered into bankruptcy and had been financially dependent on him since approximately 2000-2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; D.I. 132-6 at 19-30) Considering Sol's Policy to be an illegal STOLI policy, Sun Life commenced this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(D.I. 136 at 12) The undisputed facts show, however, that Sol did not have a genuine obligation to repay the full amount of the Coventry/LaSalle loan. One reason for this conclusion is that it was not actually Sol, but instead the Sub-Trust, which was the borrower on the loan (as well as being the holder of the Policy). (D.I. 132-22 at 24 (COVCAP582) ) The Sub-Trust, then, owed the obligation to repay the loan, not Sol (the insured). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 132-22 at 41-42 (COVCAP599-600) (stating Security Agreement committing Sub-Trust as collateral is between Insurance Trust (not Sol) and LaSalle, and \"[i]f the Sub-Trust fails to pay the amount due under the Note Agreement ... we may take the Collateral from you [i.e., from the Sub-Trust]\"); D.I. 132-26 (setting\n   forth LaSalle's interest in Sub-Trust and terms of default in Note Agreement); D.I. 181 at 38 (\"the subtrust was the borrower\") ) Thus, Sol herself did not have any personal obligation to repay the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Even if Sol is considered the borrower, the non-recourse nature of the loan meant that neither she nor the Sub-Trust had an \"obligation to repay\" sufficient to support a conclusion that Sol actually \"procured\" the Policy. Pursuant to the non-recourse nature of the loan, LaSalle secured an interest in the Policy (via the Trusts) as collateral but had no ability to collect monies from Sol or the Trusts beyond the value of the collateral, i.e., the value of the Policy. (D.I. 132-3 at 118; D.I. 132-18 at 5; D.I. 132-22 at 41 (COVCAP559); D.I. 132-34) Consequently, it is undisputed that Sol could never have been personally liable to repay the loan. (D.I. 132-3 at 118; D.I. 181 at 14, 40) In other words, had the Sub-Trust (or even Sol) defaulted, the only loss to the Sub-Trust (and Sol) would have been its interest in the Policy, a policy that would not have existed but for the loan. (D.I. 132-18 at 5; D.I. 132-22 at 41; D.I. 132-34; D.I. 181 at 40)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A reasonable juror would also have to conclude that Sol lacked the practical ability to repay the loan using anything other than proceeds from transfer of the Policy. (D.I. 132-3 at 228 (Spalding testifying that Policy's annual premiums were double Sol's allegedly inflated salary); D.I. 132-6 at 19-30 (Sol's son testifying as to her \"dismal\" finances at time she took out Policy); D.I. 132-7) While Defendant argues that \"there is a dispute only because [her son] did not have complete knowledge of her factual circumstances\" (D.I. 181 at 39), Defendant provides no financial statements, testimony, or other evidence to support its suggestion that Sol could have repaid the loan without selling the Policy. On the record before the Court, there simply is no genuine dispute that Sol could not have repaid the loan without the proceeds of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, by not paying the premiums herself and by not undertaking a personal obligation to repay the premiums, Sol did not procure the Policy and did not provide the Policy's insurable interest at inception. Even if the Sub-Trust had a contractual obligation to repay, and Sol and the Trusts could be considered one-and-the-same, the obligation to repay was nothing more than a cover, as the loan was non-recourse and the undisputed facts show that neither Sol nor the Sub-Trust had the practical ability to repay using anything other than the proceeds of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This same conclusion has been reached by two other courts applying Delaware law to cases involving similar facts - including Coventry contracts.

This conclusion is based on at least the following, none of which (on the record before the Court) is in genuine dispute: (1) Sol's application contained material misrepresentations as to her finances and who would be paying the premiums (D.I. 132-3 at 228; D.I. 132-6 at 19-30; D.I. 132-7); (2) all of the third parties failed to perform adequate due diligence of (and may have willfully ignored) Sol's finances (D.I. 132-3 at 142; D.I. 132-29; D.I. 132-31 at 74-78); (3) Coventry sought its own pre-application independent life-expectancy report of Sol (D.I. 132-17); (4) the premium finance loan was non-recourse (D.I. 132-22 at 41 (COVCAP599) ); (5) Sol and the Trusts lacked the practical ability to pay the premiums or repay the loan using anything but the proceeds from the Policy (D.I. 132-3 at 228; D.I. 132-6 at 19-30; D.I. 132-7); (6) Coventry secured an irrevocable appointment of power of attorney over any life insurance policy owned by the Trusts, and to originate other policies in Sol's name (D.I. 132-22 at 47 (COVCAP605), 59 (COVCAP617) ); and (7) the entire arrangement presented a win-win situation for Coventry and its lending associates, as discussed in further detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Against all this, the only fact the Court can discern in the record that a reasonable factfinder might view as supporting a finding that the Policy may have been taken out in good faith as an insurance policy, as opposed to being a cover for a wager, is that Sol explicitly excluded one of her sons, Allen, from being a beneficiary of the Insurance Trust. (D.I. 132-22 at 26 (COVCAP584);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 132-6 at 18-21 (Sol's son Richard testifying that his brother, Allen, \"ran up a tremendous amount of debt\" in their father's name, resulting in their parents' bankruptcy) ) Arguably, this fact suggests that Sol viewed the Policy as property in which she had a real interest, and viewed her (family) beneficiaries as true beneficiaries, and, hence, exercised control over which family members (all of whom had an insurable interest in Sol) should obtain some or all of the value of the Policy. Even accepting that there is support for such a finding, the Court remains of the view that the only conclusion that can be reached based on the complete record is that the third parties did not act in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   There are several reasons for this conclusion. First, it is not apparent that the Court should even look to Sol's intent, as she did not procure the Policy. Second, as Spalding acknowledged, a policy must be in force for at least 24 months before it may be sold on the secondary market (as purchasers do not wish to buy a policy that is still contestable). (D.I. 132-3 at 199;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   18 Del. C. \u00a7 2908 ) That within this contestable period the third parties allowed Sol to say who she would and would not want to obtain the Policy proceeds is simply part of the gamble the third parties were taking; had Sol died in that 24-month period, the third parties would have recouped their investment plus substantial interest and fees, but they would not have had a chance to also collect the Policy proceeds (which in that instance would have gone to Sol's designated beneficiaries). This limited opportunity for individuals with a legitimate insurable interest in Sol to obtain the Policy proceeds does not establish, as a matter of law or fact, that the third parties were acting in good faith. Instead, merely naming Sol's family members as beneficiaries who would be paid if the third-parties' wager did not \"pay off\" as hoped - if Sol were to have died before the Policy was sold on the secondary market - does not render the Policy legal under \u00a7 2704(a), notwithstanding the technical compliance of such an arrangement with \u00a7 2704(c)(1). After all,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     somebody\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   had to be named as beneficiary during the contestable period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, the Court rejects U.S. Bank's wholly unpersuasive argument that \"Sun Life's entire case unravels based on one simple, undisputed fact -\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Coventry never acquired the Policy from Ms. Sol.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" (D.I. 153 at 21) (emphasis added) Defendant repeatedly asserts that the Policy cannot be a \"cover for a wager\" under\n   <em>\n    Dawe\n   </em>\n   because none of the parties involved in procuring the Policy ended up acquiring the Policy, and the parties had no prior arrangement for any of them to do so. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 136 at 13-14; D.I. 153 at 3, 19-20, 27-28) Defendants' efforts to point to any place in\n   <em>\n    Dawe\n   </em>\n   in which the Delaware Supreme Court establishes this as a prerequisite for a policy to be a STOLI are unavailing. All of the statements on which Defendants rely are non-exhaustive, non-limiting descriptions of the facts the Court was considering in\n   <em>\n    Dawe\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, it was\n   undisputed that the third parties involved in procuring the policy for the insured were also, by pre-arrangement, the same parties that would eventually come to purchase the policy from the insured. Similarly, while both\n   <em>\n    Van de Wetering\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Malkin\n   </em>\n   involved situations in which Coventry at one point took possession of the policies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208116141\">\n    2016 WL 8116141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20161598\">\n    2016 WL 161598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7, nothing in these opinions, either, persuades the Court that the correct interpretation of Delaware law is to treat the presence or absence of such a fact as dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Nor has Defendant identified a persuasive reason as to why, under Delaware law, the legality of the Policy should turn on whether the third party procuring the policy is also the same third party that will acquire the policy on the secondary market. Instead, the Court agrees with Sun Life that \"\n   <em>\n    Dawe\n   </em>\n   precludes strangers from procuring policies for strangers. It would turn [ ]\n   <em>\n    Dawe\n   </em>\n   on its head to take U.S. Bank's invitation to create a loophole where a stranger cannot create a policy for itself, but can do so for a different stranger.\" (D.I. 168 at 5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In this regard, it is noteworthy that, were the Court to agree with Defendant's position, the result would be a \"win-win situation\" for Coventry and its associates; no matter when the insured dies, or no matter who purchases the policy on the secondary market, Coventry and/or its associates would be guaranteed to profit. If the insured allowed the loan to default, or if Coventry (or an associate, such as Defendant) elected to purchase the policy, Coventry (or its associate) would then enter the wager on the insured's life, and collect the policy proceeds whenever the insured dies. Alternatively, if the insured dies during the 24-month contestability period, or if the insured outlives the contestability period and the policy is sold to a disinterested third party on the secondary market, Coventry and/or its associates are still guaranteed a substantial return from the loan fees and interest they collect. Having the legality of the insurance policy depend on whether there is a prearrangement as to whom to sell a policy would do nothing to further Delaware's constitutionally-enshrined policy prohibiting life wager contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Moreover, taking a wider view, facts of which the Court may take judicial notice demonstrate that Coventry, with the help of U.S. Bank, established and directed a program to increase the number of high-value life insurance policies available on the secondary market. (D.I. 132-2 at 5 (LAV3467563) ) Coventry arranged financing for numerous individuals - at least some of whom appear to have been financially strained - to procure high-value life insurance policies with little to no risk to the individuals. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   D.I. 132-6 at 19-30; D.I. 132-7;\n   <em>\n    see also generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van de Wetering\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208116141\">\n    2016 WL 8116141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17 ;\n   <em>\n    Malkin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20161598\">\n    2016 WL 161598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17 ) In exchange for its services, Coventry (or its contracting lenders) charged high fees and interest rates on the short-term loans used to pay the policies' premiums. (D.I. 132-18 at 5 (COVCAP24) ) In this context, no persuasive reason has been identified for how or why Delaware law makes an otherwise unlawful STOLI policy somehow lawful simply because a party that contributed\n   substantially to creating a market for such policies has no plan necessarily to acquire the particular policy before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In sum, after scrutinizing the circumstances under which the Policy was issued, the Court concludes that the Policy lacked an insurable interest at its inception and, thus, is void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   under Delaware law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
