Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Nippon Shinyaku Company, Limited (\"Nippon\") owns United States Patent Nos. 7,205,302 and 7,494,997 (respectively, \" '302 patent\" and \" '997 patent\"). The United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") issued the '302 patent in 2007 with a patent term adjustment (\"PTA\") of 344 days, and the '997 patent in 2009 with a PTA of ninety-nine days. In 2010, the USPTO adopted new methods for calculating PTAs necessitated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's (\"Federal Circuit\") decision in\n   <em>\n    Wyeth v. Kappos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3508089\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1364/\">\n    591 F.3d 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2010). Prior to adopting the final procedure for such calculations, the USPTO established an Interim Procedure for patentees seeking a recalculation of their PTAs subject to certain time restrictions. Given its untimely requests, however, Nippon was ineligible for a recalculation. Nippon brings this action under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , against the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. Nippon challenges the USPTO's Interim Procedure, alleging that the Interim Procedure arbitrarily ensures disparate treatment of two categories of patents and leaves it without a remedy to correct the improper calculations of the PTAs for the patents at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pending before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. Having carefully reviewed the motions, oppositions and replies, and the entire record herein, the Court concludes that the USPTO's Interim Procedure was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Nippon's motion for summary judgment and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the USPTO's cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Pl.'s MSJ, ECF No. 46 at 23. The first category of similarly-situated patentees are those who could timely challenge the pre-\n   <em>\n    Wyeth\n   </em>\n   determinations to the USPTO pursuant to Rule 1.181(f) (\"Rule 1.181(f) Challengers\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24. Nippon argues that the Interim Procedure created an \"exception\" to allow patentees in this category to seek relief pursuant to the Interim Procedure and that the exception is arbitrary because a patentee's ability to timely seek relief depends upon the date the USPTO's response to the request for reconsideration was mailed pursuant to Rule 1.705(d).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-25. As a result, two patentees who received a patent on the same day are being treated differently due to the date the USPTO's response was mailed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. Specifically, if one patentee timely requested reconsideration pursuant to Rule 1.705(d) and that request was denied within two months of February 1, 2010, the patentee could seek a post-\n   <em>\n    Wyeth\n   </em>\n   adjustment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If, however, the patentee's request for reconsideration was denied more than two months prior to February 1, 2010, the patentee could not seek a post-\n   <em>\n    Wyeth\n   </em>\n   adjustment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nippon argues that this is arbitrary and capricious because: (1) the two-month window from December 1, 2009 to February 1, 2010 was arbitrary in part because the patentee has no control over the date triggering that\n   window; and (2) no rationale was provided in the Interim Procedure for allowing this category of patentees to challenge the PTA determinations within two months rather than 180 days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-28.
