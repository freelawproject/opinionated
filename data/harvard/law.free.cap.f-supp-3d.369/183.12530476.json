Prior to the enactment of the MMA, and prior to the FDA's Suboxone Letter Decision, the agency applied the \"first effective approach.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Purepac Pharm.

But, after studying the issue, the FDA concluded that the \"first effective approach\" is inconsistent with \"the statutory definition of '[f]irst [a]pplicant' as defined by Congress in the MMA,\" Dkt. 1-2 at 10 (Suboxone Ltr. Decision), and that a \"first submitted approach\" better coheres with the current version of the FDCA,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (Suboxone Ltr. Decision). According to that approach, the definition of \"first applicant\" sets a specific \"static date\" on which an applicant must file in order to achieve \"first applicant\" status,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   : that is, \"the first day on which a substantially complete application containing a\" Paragraph IV certification \"is submitted for approval of a drug.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(5)(B)(iv)(II)(bb). As a result, the decision further explained, \"[a]ny application, whether an original application, amendment, or supplement submitted after this 'first day' cannot satisfy the 'when' prong and cannot be a '[f]irst [a]pplicant,' as there can be only one 'first day on which a substantially complete application containing a [P]aragraph IV certification is submitted.' \" Dkt. 1-2 at 11 (Suboxone Ltr.

Teva simply speculates that the FDA will imminently approve Mylan's ANDA based on Mylan's representations during a quarterly earnings call. Dkt. 16 at\n   6-7 (Oct. 26, 2018 Hrg. Tr.). Teva also alleges that it has expended significant resources in anticipation of the FDA's impending approval of Teva's own ANDA.

Minute Entry (Oct. 26, 2018). In order to ensure that Teva \"ha[d] the opportunity to be heard\" before \"it suffer[ed] an irretrievable loss of generic exclusivity,\" while also protecting confidential information and avoiding any undue intrusion into the FDA's administrative process, the Court entered an order establishing the following procedure: (1) the FDA was required to \"provide the Court with 48 hours' notice before issuing a decision that would permit any manufacturer, other than Teva, to market a generic version of [Restasis \u00ae];\" (2) all counsel were required to be available to appear in Court for a hearing on Teva's \"motion for a preliminary injunction on four hours' notice;\" (3) both the FDA and the parties were precluded from disclosing or releasing the FDA's decision without authorization from the Court; (4) the FDA was directed to bring copies of its decision to any such hearing; and (5) if summoned to a hearing, the FDA and the parties were precluded from disclosing that a decision from the FDA was \"likely forthcoming.\" Dkt. 15 at 1-2. The FDA objected that the Court lacked jurisdiction to enter the order because Teva does not have standing to bring suit and the case is unripe. Dkt. 19 at 2. The Court subsequently ordered supplemental briefing on the jurisdictional issues and held oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order (Nov. 1, 2018); Minute Entry (Nov. 5, 2019).

In Teva's view, the FDA erred as a matter of substance and process in defining \"first applicant\" as the first substantially complete ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification, regardless of whether the applicant provided the required notice to the patent owner and NDA holder (i.e., the \"first submitted approach\"). Teva contends that the Suboxone Letter Decision must, therefore, be set aside under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   According to Teva, the FDA erred as a matter of substance because the MMA definition of \"first applicant\" not only requires that the applicant be the first to file a substantially complete ANDA, but also requires that the applicant timely effect notice (i.e., the \"first effective approach\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Dkt. 1 at 32-33 (Compl. \u00b6 55). Teva argues, moreover, that the statutory purpose of rewarding those who take on the risk and cost of patent infringement litigation is not served by according \"first applicant\" status to those who submit Paragraph IV certifications to the FDA but never provide notice to the patent owners and NDA holders. Teva also argues that the Suboxone Letter Decision must be set aside because it was issued in violation of the procedural requirements of the APA. In particular, Teva maintains that the decision countermanded a \"legislative rule[ ] promulgated though the notice-and-comment process without undertaking a new round of notice-and-comment rulemaking,\" and it failed \"to account for the reliance interests\" of those manufacturers that had acted based on the FDA's prior account of the law.

It further argues that, unless the FDA is enjoined, \"application of the [Suboxone ] Letter Decision to Teva's cyclosporine ANDA will harm Teva irreparably by divesting the company of its statutory right to 180-day exclusivity and imposing at least $ 50 million in losses that Teva can never recover.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court is unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Teva is, of course, correct that a first applicant can suffer a concrete injury before its ANDA is approved. That is because, once a first applicant files an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification (and, according to Teva, provides the required notice to the patent owner and NDA holder), the FDA may not approve any subsequently-filed ANDA until at least \"180 days after the date of the first commercial marketing of the drug ... by any first applicant.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(5)(B)(iv)(I).

This \"exclusionary right,\" according to Teva, \"[l]ike every other property right, ... has immediate, real, and tangible value to the first applicant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although Teva acknowledges that it has no intention of waiving its first applicant status, it maintains that the Suboxone Letter Decision \"already has eviscerated Teva's current\" property right and, \"along with it, the embedded value that otherwise-alienable property would have.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Teva argues that the immediate nature of this loss \"forecloses the defendants' suggestion\" that \"Teva must at least show that another applicant's ANDA will be approved\" to establish a concrete injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, even if no cyclosporine ANDA is ever approved, Teva maintains that it has nonetheless suffered a cognizable loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Teva's theory of \"embedded value\" misconceives how the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and the MMA function and what Article III demands. Teva fails to identify any precedent that has ever held that a first applicant acquires a property interest akin to a patent as soon as it files a substantially complete ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification and provides the requisite notice. That absence of authority is unsurprising for several reasons. First and foremost, a patent differs in fundamental respects from first applicant status. A patent is issued to a qualifying inventor,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20154\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), who may then bring an infringement action against anyone who practices or sells the patent owner's invention without her permission,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20154\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 271. The Patent Act, moreover, provides that \"patents shall have the attributes of personal property,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20154\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 261, and the Supreme Court has long recognized that \"[a] patent for an invention is as much property as a patent for land,\"\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Fruit-Jar Co. v. Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5644393\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/94/92/#p96\">\n    94 U.S. 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5644393\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/94/92/#p96\">\n    24 L.Ed. 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1876). First applicant status, in contrast, dictates only the order and timing with which the FDA may approve ANDAs. A first applicant, to be sure, obtains a benefit, but its rights are only enforceable against the FDA for failing to abide by\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   statutory obligations, and not (at least directly) against another manufacturer who may attempt to market its product prematurely. The benefit conferred, moreover, is far more inchoate than the benefit conferred by a duly issued patent, and neither history nor statutory text suggests that Congress intended to confer first applicants an immediate property interest. Indeed, as discussed further below, an ANDA applicant may not know for years after it files its Paragraph IV certification whether it will attain the ultimate benefit of 180 days of generic exclusivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Nor is the Court convinced that a putative first applicant attains an alienable interest in its status immediately upon submitting its ANDA and effecting notice of the Paragraph IV certification. According to Teva, the FDA and courts have recognized that a \"first applicant can in certain circumstances 'waive' its right to another company in exchange for monetary consideration, and that [a] first applicant always is free to 'relinquish' its exclusivity altogether for such consideration.\" Dkt. 36 at 20. In support of this contention, Teva cites to a letter decision from the FDA, a proposed regulation that was never finalized, and three judicial decisions. None of those sources, however, supports Teva's sweeping view that an ANDA applicant obtains an immediate property interest in its first applicant status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   To start, the FDA letter decision, which contains the most extensive discussion of\n   the issue, actually undercuts Teva's asserted property interest. In that proceeding, the FDA was asked by a brand-name manufacturer to preclude the first applicant from transferring or waiving its right to 180-day exclusivity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 42-2 at 2. The FDA declined to do so, concluding that it \"is a public health agency\" and \"generally do[es] not interfere in business arrangements of private parties\" in the absence of a \"public health impact\" or a statutory prohibition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The FDA, nonetheless, drew a distinction between what an ANDA applicant may do\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the 180-day \"exclusivity period has been triggered.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. Before the date of the first commercial marketing of the generic by a first applicant, a first applicant may relinquish, but may not selectively waive, its claim to exclusivity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the exclusivity period is triggered, however, a first applicant \"may relinquish its exclusivity entirely[,] or [it may] selectively waive [that] exclusivity in favor of a single ANDA, or multiple ANDAs, containing a [P]aragraph IV certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As the FDA explained, it \"limited the availability of selective waiver\" prior to the trigger-date based on two concerns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 n. 5. First, \"there are many reasons why an ANDA applicant might lose its eligibility before the exclusivity period has been triggered;\" for instance, \"the patent could expire necessitating a change to a Paragraph II certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, \"permitting selective waiver before exclusivity is triggered could lead to the 'commercialization' of the first 'seat' \" and might, accordingly, \"encourage applicants to submit only marginally adequate ANDAs solely to obtain the economic benefit of waiving the exclusivity as to an applicant with a more viable ANDA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The FDA stressed that, \"[a]lthough [it] has stated that it does not consider exclusivity to be a property right that transfers separately and apart from an application,\" it was concerned that it might be \"drawn into complex private disputes regarding the economic and competitive impacts of a selective waiver 'right' that is never 'perfected' because first the applicant loses eligibility for that exclusivity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Contrary to Teva's \"embedded value\" theory, the FDA has declined to accord any \"embedded\" right, beyond simple relinquishment, to first applicants\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the exclusivity period is triggered. The other authorities that Teva cites, moreover, provide no support to the contrary. The proposed regulation addressing this issue mirrors the discussion in the FDA's letter decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   180-Day Generic Drug Exclusivity for Abbreviated New Drug Applications,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Fed.%20Reg.%2042%2C873\">\n    64 Fed.

Teva argues, moreover, that, even if its ANDA is not ready for approval when exclusivity is triggered, as a first applicant, it is entitled to block other generic manufacturers, who are not entitled to exclusivity, from marketing their drugs. Dkt. 36 at 18. Finally, Teva points to the following dicta in\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5908049\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/789/1/#p3\">\n    789 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   8 : \"Granting first filers pre-tentative-approval standing to challenge the FDA's approval of a competitor's ANDA is at times necessary to prevent imminent harm.

In\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that a generic applicant that was, by its own admission, not a first applicant and that had not yet received tentative approval, lacked standing to compel the FDA to act on a competitor's ANDA.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5908049\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/789/1/#p3\">\n    789 F.

The court noted, in dicta, however, that a \"first filer\" might have \"pre-tentative approval standing to challenge the FDA's approval of a competitor's ANDA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5908049\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/789/1/#p3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5908049\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/789/1/#p3\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is not this case. Teva is neither an undisputed first filer nor is it challenging the FDA's imminent approval of a specific competitor's ANDA. Moreover, as the\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   decision goes on to explain, what was \"[c]ritical to\" the D.C. Circuit finding that the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Teva v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   had standing \"was the fact that 'there [was] no material ambiguity about [the] essential facts.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5908049\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/789/1/#p3\">\n    789 F.Supp.2d at 8-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Although the presence of tentative approval was not a\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of Teva's standing in that case, it was essential to the court's finding that Teva's alleged injury was certain and impending. Indeed, the D.C.

In short, as the\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   decision itself recognizes, \"\n   <em>\n    Teva v.

Without tentative approval as a signal or any other indication about the status of the FDA's review, the Court has no means of assessing whether any ANDA is likely to receive approval, and if so, when that is likely to occur.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , even if the FDA eventually approves an ANDA for cyclosporine, the Court can only speculate about whether Teva's ANDA will still be under review at that point. Given the rigor of the ANDA process, it is possible that Teva's ANDA will be rejected before the FDA issues its first approval.\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , and most significantly, the FDCA includes six \"forfeiture events\" that result in a first applicant's loss of \"[t]he 180-day exclusivity period,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(5)(D)(ii), two of which are of particular relevance here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   A dispositive factor in\n   <em>\n    Teva v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   was Teva's ability to demonstrate that none of these forfeiture events would occur.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216336,3547399\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/1303/\">\n    595 F.3d at 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to a number of the statutory forfeiture events, Teva has done so here as well. But, with respect to two, Teva has not cleared this hurdle. First, although Teva contends that much of the delay in the FDA's review of its ANDA is attributable to the FDA, it is too soon to tell whether Teva would, if otherwise qualified, forfeit its entitlement to exclusivity because it has failed to obtain approval within thirty months of the date its ANDA was received.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(5)(D)(i)(IV). Teva answers this contention by noting that the FDA will never make the thirty-month determination absent the relief that Teva is seeking in this action because the forfeiture provision applies only to first applicants, and, under the Suboxone Letter Decision, Teva is not a first applicant. Dkt. 36 at 28. But, even if the FDA was prepared to consider whether the thirty-month provision forecloses Teva's claim to exclusivity before considering the issue raised in the Suboxone Letter Decision, it is not possible to determine, on the present record, whether Teva would have any plausible basis for disputing the applicability of the forfeiture event. The Court cannot tell, for example, whether Teva's ANDA is weeks, months, or years away from approval-or, indeed, whether it will ever be approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The second possible forfeiture event raises even greater uncertainty. Under that provision, a first applicant loses any entitlement to market exclusivity if it fails to market its drug within 75 days after the entry of a final court decision \"from which no appeal (other than a petition to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari)\" is taken, finding the referenced patents invalid or not infringed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 355(j)(5)(D)(i)(I)(bb). As explained above, that provision may well apply here because the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas found that each of the relevant Restasis\u00ae patents is invalid,\n   <em>\n    Allergan, Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204803941\">\n    2017 WL 4803941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *65, and the Federal Circuit summarily affirmed that decision on November 13, 2018,\n   <em>\n    Allergan, Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=742%20F.%20App%27x%20511\">\n    742 F. App'x at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since then, Allergan filed a timely petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc, Dkt. 103,\n   <em>\n    Allergan, Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-1130 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 21, 2018), and the Federal Circuit ordered a response to that petition, Dkt. 108,\n   <em>\n    Allergan, Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-1130 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 17, 2019). If the Federal Circuit grants rehearing and reverses the district court's decision invalidating the Restasis \u00ae patents, Teva would forfeit its right to exclusivity because it will need to amend its ANDA to assert a Paragraph III certification with respect to the '111 patent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(2)(D)(i)(III). Alternatively, if the Federal Circuit denies rehearing, and Teva fails to market cyclosporine within 75 days the Federal Circuit's final entry of judgment, Teva will forfeit any entitlement to exclusivity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 355(j)(5)(D)(i)(I)(bb). As a result, Teva's interest-or claim of injury-turns on the prospect that the FDA will grant final approval to an ANDA\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the Federal Circuit renders a final decision,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   , assuming the Federal Circuit enters a final judgment affirming the district court's decision, that a first applicant will enter the market within seventy-five days of that decision. That is, of course, possible. But it falls far short of the lack of \"material ambiguity\" that informed the D.C. Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Teva v.

Dkt. 1 at 28-29 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48-49).
