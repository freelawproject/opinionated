(Dkt. # 21). On February 13, 2019, the Court held a hearing on the motion. At the hearing, David Boies, Esq. and Luis R. Vera, Jr., Esq. represented Plaintiffs and Matthew H. Frederick, Esq., Patrick K. Sweeten, Esq., and Todd L. Disher, Esq. represented Defendants. The motion is fully briefed and ripe for review. After careful consideration of the memoranda filed in support of and in opposition to the motion, as well as the arguments advanced at the hearing, the Court-for the reasons that follow-<strong>GRANTS</strong> Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (<em>Id.</em> )</p><p id=\"p-9\"><em>BACKGROUND</em></p><p id=\"p-10\">In presidential elections, Article 2 of the United States Constitution prescribes that \"Each State shall appoint, <em>in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct</em> , a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress ....\" U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 2 (emphasis added). This action challenges Texas' \"winner-take-all\" (\"WTA\") method for selecting Presidential Electors. Texas, along with 47 other States and the District of Columbia, has adopted statutes under which its 38 Electoral College Electors for president are appointed on a WTA basis. <em>See</em> Tex. Elec. Code \u00a7 192.005 (\"The set of elector candidates that is elected is the one that corresponds to the candidates for president and vice-president receiving the most votes.\").</p><p id=\"p-11\">Under the WTA system, all of a state's Electors are chosen by the political party whose candidate received the most votes in the State's presidential election. For instance, in the 2016 election President Donald Trump received 52.2% of the Texas vote, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton received 43.2% of the vote. (Dkt. # 1 at 2.) Yet the Republican Party selected all 38 of Texas' Electors, and the Democratic Party selected none.</p><p id=\"p-12\">On February 21, 2018, Plaintiffs filed suit in this case, asserting three causes of action: (1) violation of the Fourteenth Amendment because by \"discarding\" the votes cast for the losing candidate, the WTA system \"unconstitutionally magnifies the votes of a bare plurality of voters by translating those voters into an entire slate of presidential Electors\" (Dkt. # 1 at 5); (2) violation of the First Amendment because <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"775\" href=\"#p775\" id=\"p775\">*775</a>the WTA system \"burdens ... the right of association and ... the right to have a voice in presidential elections through casting a vote\" (<em>id.</em> at 6); and (3) violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (\"VRA\") because the WTA system works in the same way as at-large voting districts in allowing \"white voters to ... defeat all Electors slated for Hispanic and African-American preferred candidates\" (<em>id.</em> ).</p><p id=\"p-13\">Defendants filed their motion to dismiss on April 9, 2018. (Dkt. # 21.) Plaintiffs filed a response in opposition on May 7, 2018. Defendants filed a reply in support of their motion on May 21, 2018. A hearing was held on Defendants' motion on February 13, 2019.</p><p id=\"p-14\"><em>LEGAL STANDARD</em></p><p id=\"p-15\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) authorizes dismissal of a complaint for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Review is limited to the contents of the complaint and matters properly subject to judicial notice. <em>See</em> <em>Tellabs, Inc. v.

Once \"the state legislature vests the right to vote for President in its people, the right to vote ... is <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"776\" href=\"#p776\" id=\"p776\">*776</a>fundamental ....\" <em>Bush</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/#p104\">531 U.S. at 104</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/#p104\">121 S.Ct. 525</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-19\">Against this backdrop, Plaintiffs challenge the State of Texas' decision to have all of its State's Electors chosen by the political party whose candidate receives the greatest number of votes as being in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and Section 2 of the VRA. In response, Defendants argue their motion to dismiss should be granted on one or both of two bases: (1) Plaintiffs' claims are precluded by binding precedent; and even if not (2) they are entitled to dismissal on the merits of each of Plaintiffs' claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p><p id=\"p-21\">Defendants begin by pointing to several prior decisions of the Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit that they argue preclude all of Plaintiffs' claims as a matter of settled law. <em>McPherson v. Blacker</em> upheld a district-based mechanism<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for electing presidential Electors as against challenges that it violated Article 2, Section 1, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">146 U.S. at 3, 24, 42</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">13 S.Ct. 3</extracted-citation>. However, <em>McPherson</em> is not controlling. <em>McPherson</em> dealt with the question of the constitutionality of a district-based system; it did not address the question of WTA, beyond pointing out as a matter of historical practice that many States up to that point had implemented such a system. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\"> at 29-33</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">13 S.Ct. 3</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-22\">Defendants rely on language from <em>McPherson</em> that \"if [Electors] are elected in districts where each citizen has an equal right to vote, the same as any other citizen has, no discrimination is made.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\"> at 40</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">13 S.Ct. 3</extracted-citation>. However, this holding predates by more than seventy years the revolution in the Supreme Court's thinking on the issue of voter equality that occurred in the 1960s and early 1970s and the establishment of the \"one person, one vote\" principle. <em>See, e.g.,</em> <em>Gray v.

Thus, that the Supreme <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"777\" href=\"#p777\" id=\"p777\">*777</a>Court found a different system, against a different doctrinal backdrop, preserved and respected the equal right to vote does not dictate that the presently challenged system also does so.</p><p id=\"p-25\">Plaintiffs argue <em>Hitson</em> is distinguishable because in <em>Hitson</em> there was \"no contention that Alabama's electoral scheme for the selection of presidential Electors\" operates \"to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of [minority voters].\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993048\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/446/674/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> (citing cases). Plaintiffs here assert that in contrast they have alleged such facts. (<em>See</em> Dkt. # 27 at 26 n.9.) Plaintiffs are correct that they have alleged facts indicating their votes are being minimized or cancelled out. (<em>See, e.g.</em>, Dkt. # 1 at 2-3, 13-14.) But the premise underlying that assertion is that their votes are being minimized or cancelled, or otherwise not treated equally, because they \"have not had a single elector slated for their preferred candidate in the last four decades\" and are unable \"to have Electors for their preferred candidate in <em>each</em> presidential election.\" (Dkt. # 1 at 6, 7.) These allegations fail to state an Equal Protection claim because, as stated in <em>Hitson</em> and affirmed by the Fifth Circuit, \"[n]o minority group has a right under the Constitution to insist that state electoral systems be designed, where possible, to give its members electoral control over the selection of persons for particular political offices.\"<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993048\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/446/674/\">446 F.Supp. at 676</extracted-citation>.

Admittedly, once the electoral slate is chosen, it speaks only for the element with the largest number of votes. This in a sense is discrimination against the minority voters, but in a democratic society the majority must rule, unless the discrimination is invidious. No such evil has been made manifest here.

(<em>See</em> Dkt. # 27 at 27; <em>see also</em> Tex. Elec. Code \u00a7 192.034(b).) But as Defendants point out, under the Virginia system at issue in <em>Williams</em>-and just like the current Texas system-voters voted for one or the other political party, for that party's nominees for President and Vice-President, which constituted a block vote for all the Electors slated by that party. (Dkt. # 29 at 3; <em>see also</em> Dkt. # 27-1, Ex. A.) No vote could be cast for Electors individually, nor could any votes be cast separately from the other Electors. (<em>Id.</em> ) Voters in Virginia voted for a collective full slate of Electors, just as they do now in Texas through voting expressly for a Presidential candidate. (<em>Id.</em> ) Thus the mere naming of the Electors does not present a meaningful factual distinction between <em>Williams</em> and the instant case.</p><p id=\"p-33\">Plaintiffs also argue that <em>Williams</em> does not \"address Plaintiffs' primary constitutional claim: that a state may not discard votes for the president through the WTA method of allocating Electors in the same manner that, in <em>Gray</em>, votes were discarded at an intermediate step in a two-step election.\" (Dkt. # 27 at 27.) But the court <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"779\" href=\"#p779\" id=\"p779\">*779</a>in <em>Williams</em> specifically confronted a <em>Gray</em> based argument and concluded Virginia's WTA system-functionally identical to Texas'-\"does not come within the brand of [that] decision[ ].\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2856710\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/288/622/#p626\">288 F.Supp. at 626</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-34\">Next, Plaintiffs argue <em>White v. Regester</em>'s striking down of a Texas county's use of multi-member at-large elections \"fundamentally shifted the legal landscape.\" (Dkt. # 27 at 28 (citing <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175946\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/755/#p768\">412 U.S. 755</extracted-citation>, 768, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175946\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/755/#p768\">93 S.Ct. 2332</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175946\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/755/#p768\">37 L.Ed.2d 314</extracted-citation> (1973).) In <em>White</em>, the Supreme Court found two specific multimember districts were unconstitutional as an intentional attempt to \"invidiously ... cancel out or minimize the voting strength of racial groups\" in light of Texas' history of discrimination against African-American and Mexican-American citizens. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175946\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/755/#p768\">412 U.S. at 765-70</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175946\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/755/#p768\">93 S.Ct. 2332</extracted-citation>. Importantly, the <em>White</em> court carefully limited its holding, emphasizing that \"multimember districts are not per se unconstitutional.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175946\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/755/#p768\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175946\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/755/#p768\"> at 765</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175946\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/755/#p768\">93 S.Ct. 2332</extracted-citation>. Even if the Court were to agree with Plaintiffs' analogy of WTA as creating one large, state-wide multimember district, <em>White</em> does not mandate the invalidation of all multimember districts. Instead, <em>White</em> recognizes \"claims that multimember districts are being used invidiously to cancel out or minimize the voting strength of racial groups.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175946\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/755/#p768\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> <em>White</em>'s holding is thus consistent with <em>Williams</em>' conclusion that WTA elector selection is permissible because \"in a democratic society the majority must rule, unless the discrimination is invidious.\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2856710\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/288/622/#p626\">288 F.Supp. at 627</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-35\">While the Court is cognizant of the troublesome history of electoral discrimination in the state of Texas, as described in <em>White</em> and elsewhere, Plaintiffs allege no facts suggesting the WTA system was specifically adopted to cancel out the voting strength of any particular group. Long before the specter of invidious electoral discrimination reared its head, WTA was the dominant form of choosing Electors for President. <em>See</em> <em>McPherson</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">146 U.S. at 32</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">13 S.Ct. 3</extracted-citation> (\"After 1832 Electors were chosen by [WTA] in all the states except South Carolina ....\"). Texas itself has used WTA since 1848, its first presidential election after joining the Union. <em>See</em> Act approved March 15, 2848, 2d Leg., ch. 94, \u00a7 2, reprinted in 3 H.P.N. Gammel, <em>The Laws of the Texas, 1822 -1897</em>, at 104-06; <em>see also</em> <em>McPherson</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">146 U.S. at 32</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">13 S.Ct. 3</extracted-citation>. And WTA remains the dominant form of choosing Electors, utilized in 48 States and the District of Columbia, including many States that lack the history of discrimination that plagues Texas.</p><p id=\"p-36\">Moreover, the WTA system has a readily discernable non-invidious purpose. WTA protects a state against the use of WTA by other States. When a State slates its Electors in a way that permits divided representation, if other States use a WTA method, their consolidated block of Electors carries more weight in the electoral college.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See</em> <em>Williams</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2856710\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/288/622/#p626\">288 F.Supp. at 626</extracted-citation> (pointing out that this justification was relied on by Thomas Jefferson in advising Virginia to implement a WTA system, despite his own preference for a district-based system).</p><p id=\"p-37\">Finally, Plaintiffs argue <em>Bush v.

(Dkt. # 27 at 29). The Supreme Court in <em>Bush</em> held that \"[h]aving once granted the right to vote on equal terms, the State may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person's vote over that of another.\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/#p104\">531 U.S. at 104-05</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/#p104\">121 S.Ct. 525</extracted-citation>. Plaintiffs <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"780\" href=\"#p780\" id=\"p780\">*780</a>thus suggest that before <em>Bush</em>, a \"one person, one vote\" claim required proof of invidiousness, but that after <em>Bush</em>, a showing of arbitrary and disparate treatment is sufficient. (Dkt. # 27 at 29-30.)</p><p id=\"p-38\">However, <em>Bush</em>'s precedential value is unclear.

It is therefore unlikely the Supreme Court intended to overturn or undermine <em>Williams</em>, particularly so where <em>Bush</em> does not discuss <em>Williams</em> or address in any way the issues it decided.

To resolve challenges to specific provisions of a State's election laws, a court:</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-46\">must first consider the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate. It then must identify and evaluate the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule. In passing judgment, the Court must not only determine the legitimacy and strength of each of those interests; it also must consider the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff's rights. Only after weighing all these factors is the reviewing court in a position to decide whether the challenged provision is unconstitutional. The results of this evaluation will not be automatic; as [the Supreme Court has] recognized, there is no \"substitute for the hard judgments that must be made.\"</p><p id=\"p-48\">Plaintiffs argue their association rights are burdened because Texas' WTA scheme: (1) discards or dilutes the votes of minority party members and magnifies the impact of majority party votes; (2) disincentivizes voters from joining or participating in minority parties and discourages voting by minority party members; and (3) eliminates all practical opportunities for non-dominant party voters in Texas to effectively voice their preference for President.

It is beyond dispute that in determining who received more votes for President in Texas, Plaintiffs' individual votes were counted just the same as any other voter, and that they were permitted the opportunity to express their Presidential preference by means of that vote. Whatever disincentive to vote or participate in minority parties arises from their preferred candidate having failed to receive more votes than her opponent. But that one candidate will lose by virtue of receiving fewer votes, and that her supporters will be thereby dispirited and disincentivized, is an inescapable reality of democracy. It does not state a cognizable First Amendment burden on free association. Further, that Plaintiffs' votes failed to win them any Electors for their preferred candidate does not mean their opportunity to express their Presidential preference was ineffective because \"no ... group has a right under the Constitution to insist that state electoral systems be designed, where possible, to give its members electoral control over the selection of persons for particular political offices[,]\" including presidential Electors. <em>Hitson</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993048\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/446/674/\">446 F.Supp. at 676</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-56\">Finally, even were this Court to conclude Plaintiffs had adequately alleged First and Fourteenth Amendment associational harms, those harms are justified by Texas' interest in maximizing its electoral power by having its Presidential Electors vote in a unified bloc. As previously stated, no less than Thomas Jefferson recognized the merit and necessity of this \"protect[ion] ... against the use of [WTA] by the other States\" in recommending Virginia adopt WTA, despite his own personal preference for district-based selection of Electors. <em>Williams</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2856710\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/288/622/#p626\">288 F.Supp. at 626</extracted-citation>. As 47 other states and the District of Columbia also utilize WTA systems, the impetus-as recognized by Jefferson-for Texas' policy under this interest is well established. As such, a divided slate of Electors would greatly diminish Texas' influence in the Electoral College and its ability to elect the Presidential candidate chosen by the majority of its citizens. Moreover, that nearly all States have implemented this policy, and <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"784\" href=\"#p784\" id=\"p784\">*784</a>have done so since 1832, <em>see</em> <em>McPherson</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">146 U.S. at 32</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">13 S.Ct. 3</extracted-citation>, only further underscores the non-pretextual nature of the asserted interest.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-57\">For these reasons, Plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment Freedom of Association cause of action must be <strong>DISMISSED.</strong></p><p id=\"p-59\">Section 2 of the VRA prohibits any \"standard, practice, or procedure ... which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color,\" <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301</extracted-citation>(a), or by virtue of membership in \"a language minority group[,]\" <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010303\">52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10303</extracted-citation>(f)(2).

Plaintiffs rely on the analytical framework established by the Supreme Court in <em>Thornburg v. Gingles</em> in scrutinizing North Carolina's \"legislative decision to employ multimember, rather than single-member, districts in the contested jurisdictions ....\" 478 U.S. at 47, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/\">106 S.Ct. 2752</extracted-citation>. Plaintiffs invoke <em>Gingles</em> by analogizing a WTA system of selecting Electors to that of an at-large, i.e. multimember, voting district, congruent to the whole of the State of Texas. (Dkt. # 1 at 6, 22.)</p><p id=\"p-63\">As a threshold matter, the Court firmly agrees with Plaintiffs that Section 2 the VRA applies to Presidential Elections.

However, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under Section 2 of the VRA.</p><p id=\"p-64\">\"Multimember districts and at-large election schemes ... are not per se violative of minority voters' rights.\" <em>Gingles</em>, 478 U.S. at 48, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/\">106 S.Ct. 2752</extracted-citation>. <em>Gingles</em> requires that Plaintiffs challenging an at-large system must show: \"(1) the group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district; (2) it is politically cohesive; and (3) the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\"</p><p id=\"p-66\">According to Plaintiffs, in 2008 and 2016, 27% and 31% respectively of white voters in Texas voted for the Democratic candidate for President, undercutting the premise that whites vote in a uniform bloc. (Dkt. # 1 at 26.) And 37% and 39% respectively of Hispanic voters voted for the Republican candidate. (<em>Id.</em> at 25.) Thus not only did a sizable number of white voters vote for the candidate preferred by the asserted minority groups, but a sizable number of non-white voters did not.</p><p id=\"p-67\">Taking the relevant numbers advanced by Plaintiffs in their complaint, in 2008 and 2016, Hispanic voters who voted for the Republican candidate constituted roughly 16% of the voting electorate, nearly twice the margin by which the Democratic Candidate lost the 2016 presidential election in Texas. (<em>See</em> Dkt. # 1 at 2, 26.) If nearly 40% of Hispanic voters had not voted for the Republican candidate,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the combined strength of minority voters and the large number of white \"crossover\" voters would have been able to carry the Presidential election in Texas, challenging the assertion that whites vote as a legally significant bloc. <em>See</em> <em>Gingles</em>, 478 U.S. at 31, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/\">106 S.Ct. 2752</extracted-citation> (\"In general, a white bloc vote that normally will defeat the combined strength of minority support plus white \"crossover\" votes rises to the level of legally significant white bloc voting.\")</p><p id=\"p-68\">The facts alleged by Plaintiffs, therefore, strongly implicate the conclusion that the relevant bloc frustrating Plaintiffs' election success is not whites but Republicans. As the Fifth Circuit has recognized, \"[t]here is ... a powerful argument supporting a rule that plaintiffs, to establish legally significant racial bloc voting, must prove that their failure to elect representatives of their choice cannot be characterized as a mere euphemism for political defeat at the polls, or the result of partisan politics.\" <em>Clements</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958970\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/831/#p849\">999 F.2d at </extracted-citation>859 (citing <em>Whitcomb v.

As the Fifth Circuit elaborated, based on the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Whitcomb</em>:</p><p id=\"p-69\">Absent evidence that minorities have been excluded from the political process, a lack of success at the polls is not sufficient to trigger judicial intervention. Courts must undertake the additional inquiry into the reasons for, or causes of, these electoral losses in order to determine whether they were the product of partisan politics or racial vote dilution, political defeat or built-in bias. It is only upon concluding that a minority group's failure to prevail at the polls, that is, their failure to attract the support of white voters, was the result or function of racial vote dilution or built-in bias, that a court may find that minority plaintiffs have suffered a denial or abridgement of the right ... to vote on account of race or color....</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-70\">[F]ailures of a minority group to elect representatives of its choice that are attributable to partisan politics provide <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"786\" href=\"#p786\" id=\"p786\">*786</a>no grounds for relief. Section 2 is a balm for racial minorities, not political ones-even though the two often coincide. The Voting Rights Act does not guarantee that nominees of the Democratic Party will be elected, even if [minority] voters are likely to favor that party's candidates. Rather, \u00a7 2 is implicated only where Democrats lose because they are black, not where blacks lose because they are Democrats.</p><p id=\"p-72\">That a similar pattern also emerges under WTA systems in states where Democrats hold political majorities underscores that the animating issue here is partisan, not racial.

The simple fact is that Plaintiffs in this case were not:</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-74\">any more underrepresented than ... whites who also voted Democratic and lost, or any more discriminated against than other interest groups or voters ... with allegiance to the Democratic Party, or, conversely, and less represented than Republican[s in areas] of Republican defeat[.] ... The mere fact that one interest group or another concerned with the outcome of [the] election[ ] has found itself outvoted and without [Electors] of its own provides no basis for invoking constitutional remedies where, as here, there is no indication that this segment of the population is being denied access to the political system.</p><p id=\"p-75\"><em>Whitcomb</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026813\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/124/#p153\">403 U.S. at 154-55</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026813\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/124/#p153\">91 S.Ct. 1858</extracted-citation>. Plaintiffs' defeats were shared equally among all members of their political party and members of the opposing political party in other states.</p><p id=\"p-76\">Thus the inescapable conclusion is that Plaintiffs were unable to elect Electors for their candidate of their choice because there are fewer Democrats who voted in Texas, not because the system operates to cancel out the ability of racial minorities to elect their preferred candidate-roughly 40% of Hispanics were able to do so, and roughly 30% of whites were not. (<em>See</em> Dkt. # 1 at 25, 26.)</p><p id=\"p-77\">Finally, \"[b]ecause the very concept of vote dilution implies-and, indeed, necessitates-the existence of an 'undiluted' practice against which the fact of dilution may be measured, a \u00a7 2 plaintiff must also postulate a reasonable alternative voting practice to serve as the benchmark 'undiluted' voting practice.\"</p><p id=\"p-79\">As stated by Plaintiffs, their \"primary remedy is to allow the state to devise its own constitutional scheme for the selection of Electors.\" (Dkt. # 27 at 36; <em>see also</em> Dkt. # 1 at 32.) This vague, unspecified remedy fails to adequately define an undiluted voting practice for this Court to use as a benchmark to compare with the current practice of the State of Texas. And Plaintiffs specifically disclaim the readily apparent alternative of Congressional district-based selection as equally unrepresentative. (Dkt. # 1 at 5, 32.) Plaintiffs cannot shift the burden of presenting an undiluted benchmark onto Defendants in this way.</p><p id=\"p-80\">To the extent Plaintiffs specify any adequate alternate scheme, they propose that \"if state authorities fail to propose or implement a valid method of selecting Electors ...,\" the Court should \"order a proportional method of distributing Electors, selecting a proportional number of Electors to each party, based on the number of votes each party's candidate receives statewide.\" (Dkt. # 1 at 32.) But Section 2 of the VRA specifically disavows \"a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.\" <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301</extracted-citation>(b). If Section 2 does not entail a right of racial minorities to proportional representation, it certainly cannot entail such right of political minorities.</p><p id=\"p-81\">The \"on account of race or color\" requirement of Section 2 of the VRA was intended to \"effectuate the Fifteenth Amendment's guarantee that no citizen's right to vote shall be denied or abridged ... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.' \" <em>Voinovich v. Quilter</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224381\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/146/#p152\">507 U.S. 146</extracted-citation>, 152, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224381\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/146/#p152\">113 S.Ct. 1149</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224381\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/146/#p152\">122 L.Ed.2d 500</extracted-citation> (1993) (quoting U.S. Const. amend.

If Section 2 permitted or required a remedy of proportional representation in the Electoral College for political parties it would not be \"congruent or proportional\" to the violation of the asserted constitutional right, which is required of remedial legislation under the Reconstruction Amendments. <em>See</em> <em>City of Boerne v. Flores</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915698\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/507/#p520\">521 U.S. 507</extracted-citation>, 520, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915698\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/507/#p520\">117 S.Ct. 2157</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915698\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/507/#p520\">138 L.Ed.2d 624</extracted-citation> (1997) ; <em>see also</em> <em>City of Mobile</em>, 446 U.S. at 79, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181507\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/236/\">100 S.Ct. 1519</extracted-citation>, <em>superseded by statute on other grounds as stated by</em> <em>Gingles</em>, 478 U.S. at 71, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/\">106 S.Ct. 2752</extracted-citation> (\"[T]he [Supreme] Court has sternly set its face against the claim, however phrased, that the Constitution somehow guarantees proportional representation.\").</p><p id=\"p-82\">Accordingly, Plaintiffs claim under Section 2 of the VRA must be <strong>DISMISSED.</strong></p><p id=\"p-83\"><em>CONCLUSION</em></p><p id=\"p-84\">For the reasons stated, the Court <strong>GRANTS</strong> Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. (Dkt. # 21.) Because the Court finds Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment \"one person, one vote\" claim is precluded by binding precedent, that claim is <strong>DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE</strong> . Further, because the Court believes any amendment to Plaintiffs' First Amendment freedom of association and VRA Section 2 claims would be futile-for the reasons discussed in this order-those claims are also <strong>DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE</strong> .</p><p id=\"p-85\"><strong>IT IS SO ORDERED.</strong></p><p id=\"p-88\">In so ruling, the Court reaches the same conclusion recently reached in sister courts in the District of Massachusetts and the Central District of California as to the one person, one vote and First Amendment challenges to the winner-take-all system for selecting Presidential Electors that were presented in those cases. <em>See</em> <em>Lyman et al. v. Baker et al.</em>, No. 1:18-CV-10327-PBS (D. Mass. Dec. 7, 2018) (Dkt. # 52); <em>Rodriguez et al. v. Brown et al.</em>, No. 2:18-CV-1422 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 21, 2018) (Dkt. # 83).</p><p id=\"p-89\">In this respect, Plaintiffs' prudential arguments are entirely beside the point. That WTA systems may lead Presidential campaigns to focus on \"battleground states\" or facilitate outside interference in our elections (Dkt. # 1 at 3-4; Dkt # 27 at 8) are irrelevant to this Court's determination. Either a WTA system for choosing Presidential electors is permissible under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and the VRA, or it is not. If WTA systems are constitutional and not in violation of statute, their wisdom and necessity are to be left to the reasoned judgment of the legislatures of each of the Several States. And if WTA systems are unconstitutional or in violation of statute, it is impermissible, no matter how wise or providential.</p><p id=\"p-90\">Under the Michigan system at issue in <em>McPherson</em>, each congressional district chose one elector, corresponding to the electors Michigan was entitled to through its congressional representatives for those districts, and each half of the state selected an \"at large\" elector, corresponding to the electors Michigan was entitled to through its two senators. <em>Id.</em> at 24, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">13 S.Ct. 3</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-91\">Plaintiffs' proposed remedy of proportional selection of electors is also problematic. <em>City of Mobile v.

The candidate \"chosen\" by the State of Texas is thus the Presidential candidate receiving the largest share of its citizens' votes.</p><p id=\"p-97\">The Court recognizes that if WTA systems were struck down nationwide, the validity of this interest would seem to vanish. However, this Court is not in the position to award such a remedy. This suit, as brought by Plaintiffs, only challenges the WTA system in Texas and does not request any nationwide injunction or any other remedy that would reach beyond the borders of Texas.</p><p id=\"p-98\">The Court also questions whether the Plaintiffs have satisfied the second prong, at least as it relates to Hispanics in Texas. According to Plaintiffs, 37% and 39% of Hispanics did not vote for the Democratic Presidential candidate in 2008 and 2016 respectively. (Dkt. # 1 at 25.) In 2012, 27% did not. (<em>Id.</em> )</p><p id=\"p-99\">A roughly 16% swing in Hispanic voters from Republican to Democrat would have been enough to swing the 2016 Presidential election in Texas to the Democratic candidate.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
