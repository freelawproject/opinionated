II, \u00a7 1, cl. 2 (emphasis added). This action challenges Texas' \"winner-take-all\" (\"WTA\") method for selecting Presidential Electors.

In the selection of Electors the rule does not in any way denigrate the power of one citizen's ballot and heighten the influence of another's vote. Admittedly, once the electoral slate is chosen, it speaks only for the element with the largest number of votes. This in a sense is discrimination against the minority voters, but in a democratic society the majority must rule, unless the discrimination is invidious. No such evil has been made manifest here. Every citizen is offered equal suffrage and no deprivation of the franchise is suffered by anyone.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-32\">\n       Plaintiffs first argue that\n       <em>\n        Williams\n       </em>\n       is not controlling because in\n       <em>\n        Williams\n       </em>\n       \"voters cast their vote for Electors as candidates listed on the ballot[,]\" whereas under the Texas system voters cast their vote directly for the presidential candidate.

But as Defendants point out, under the Virginia system at issue in\n       <em>\n        Williams\n       </em>\n       -and just like the current Texas system-voters voted for one or the other political party, for that party's nominees for President and Vice-President, which constituted a block vote for all the Electors slated by that party. (Dkt. # 29 at 3;\n       <em>\n        see also\n       </em>\n       Dkt. # 27-1, Ex. A.) No vote could be cast for Electors individually, nor could any votes be cast separately from the other Electors. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       ) Voters in Virginia voted for a collective full slate of Electors, just as they do now in Texas through voting expressly for a Presidential candidate. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       ) Thus the mere naming of the Electors does not present a meaningful factual distinction between\n       <em>\n        Williams\n       </em>\n       and the instant case.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-33\">\n       Plaintiffs also argue that\n       <em>\n        Williams\n       </em>\n       does not \"address Plaintiffs' primary constitutional claim: that a state may not discard votes for the president through the WTA method of allocating Electors in the same manner that, in\n       <em>\n        Gray\n       </em>\n       , votes were discarded at an intermediate step in a two-step election.\" (Dkt. # 27 at 27.)

It is beyond dispute that in determining who received more votes for President in Texas, Plaintiffs' individual votes were counted just the same as any other voter, and that they were permitted the opportunity to express their Presidential preference by means of that vote. Whatever disincentive to vote or participate in minority parties arises from their preferred candidate having failed to receive more votes than her opponent. But that one candidate will lose by virtue of receiving fewer votes, and that her supporters will be thereby dispirited and disincentivized, is an inescapable reality of democracy. It does not state a cognizable First Amendment burden on free association. Further, that Plaintiffs' votes failed to win them any Electors for their preferred candidate does not mean their opportunity to express their Presidential preference was ineffective because \"no ... group has a right under the Constitution to insist that state electoral systems be designed, where possible, to give its members electoral control over the selection of persons for particular political offices[,]\" including presidential Electors.\n       <em>\n        Hitson\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993048\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/446/674/\">\n        446 F.Supp. at 676\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-56\">\n       Finally, even were this Court to conclude Plaintiffs had adequately alleged First and Fourteenth Amendment associational harms, those harms are justified by Texas' interest in maximizing its electoral power by having its Presidential Electors vote in a unified bloc. As previously stated, no less than Thomas Jefferson recognized the merit and necessity of this \"protect[ion] ... against the use of [WTA] by the other States\" in recommending Virginia adopt WTA, despite his own personal preference for district-based selection of Electors.\n       <em>\n        Williams\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2856710\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/288/622/#p626\">\n        288 F.Supp. at 626\n       </extracted-citation>\n       . As 47 other states and the District of Columbia also utilize WTA systems, the impetus-as recognized by Jefferson-for Texas' policy under this interest is well established. As such, a divided slate of Electors would greatly diminish Texas' influence in the Electoral College and its ability to elect the Presidential candidate chosen by the majority of its citizens. Moreover, that nearly all States have implemented this policy, and\n      have done so since 1832,\n       <em>\n        see\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        McPherson\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">\n        146 U.S. at 32\n       </extracted-citation>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">\n        13 S.Ct. 3\n       </extracted-citation>\n       , only further underscores the non-pretextual nature of the asserted interest.\n       <footnotemark>\n        10\n       </footnotemark>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-57\">\n       For these reasons, Plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment Freedom of Association cause of action must be\n       <strong>\n        DISMISSED.\n       </strong>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-58\">\n       III.\n       <em>\n        Section 2 of the VRA\n       </em>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-59\">\n       Section 2 of the VRA prohibits any \"standard, practice, or procedure ... which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color,\"\n       <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n        52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (a), or by virtue of membership in \"a language minority group[,]\"\n       <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010303\">\n        52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10303\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (f)(2).

As the Fifth Circuit elaborated, based on the Supreme Court's decision in\n       <em>\n        Whitcomb\n       </em>\n       :\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-69\">\n       Absent evidence that minorities have been excluded from the political process, a lack of success at the polls is not sufficient to trigger judicial intervention. Courts must undertake the additional inquiry into the reasons for, or causes of, these electoral losses in order to determine whether they were the product of partisan politics or racial vote dilution, political defeat or built-in bias. It is only upon concluding that a minority group's failure to prevail at the polls, that is, their failure to attract the support of white voters, was the result or function of racial vote dilution or built-in bias, that a court may find that minority plaintiffs have suffered a denial or abridgement of the right ... to vote on account of race or color....\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-70\">\n       [F]ailures of a minority group to elect representatives of its choice that are attributable to partisan politics provide\n      no grounds for relief. Section 2 is a balm for racial minorities, not political ones-even though the two often coincide. The Voting Rights Act does not guarantee that nominees of the Democratic Party will be elected, even if [minority] voters are likely to favor that party's candidates. Rather, \u00a7 2 is implicated only where Democrats lose because they are black, not where blacks lose because they are Democrats.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-72\">\n       That a similar pattern also emerges under WTA systems in states where Democrats hold political majorities underscores that the animating issue here is partisan, not racial. If \"the Democrats won\" the election-as they did under an identical mechanism in majority democratic states-Plaintiffs \"would have had no justifiable complaints about representation.\"\n       <em>\n        Whitcomb\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026813\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/124/#p153\">\n        403 U.S. at 152\n       </extracted-citation>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026813\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/124/#p153\">\n        91 S.Ct. 1858\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .

The simple fact is that Plaintiffs in this case were not:\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-74\">\n       any more underrepresented than ... whites who also voted Democratic and lost, or any more discriminated against than other interest groups or voters ... with allegiance to the Democratic Party, or, conversely, and less represented than Republican[s in areas] of Republican defeat[.] ... The mere fact that one interest group or another concerned with the outcome of [the] election[ ] has found itself outvoted and without [Electors] of its own provides no basis for invoking constitutional remedies where, as here, there is no indication that this segment of the population is being denied access to the political system.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-75\">\n       <em>\n        Whitcomb\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026813\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/124/#p153\">\n        403 U.S. at 154-55\n       </extracted-citation>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026813\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/124/#p153\">\n        91 S.Ct. 1858\n       </extracted-citation>\n       . Plaintiffs' defeats were shared equally among all members of their political party and members of the opposing political party in other states.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-76\">\n       Thus the inescapable conclusion is that Plaintiffs were unable to elect Electors for their candidate of their choice because there are fewer Democrats who voted in Texas, not because the system operates to cancel out the ability of racial minorities to elect their preferred candidate-roughly 40% of Hispanics were able to do so, and roughly 30% of whites were not.

This vague, unspecified remedy fails to adequately define an undiluted voting practice for this Court to use as a benchmark to compare with the current practice of the State of Texas. And Plaintiffs specifically disclaim the readily apparent alternative of Congressional district-based selection as equally unrepresentative. (Dkt. # 1 at 5, 32.) Plaintiffs cannot shift the burden of presenting an undiluted benchmark onto Defendants in this way.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-80\">\n       To the extent Plaintiffs specify any adequate alternate scheme, they propose that \"if state authorities fail to propose or implement a valid method of selecting Electors ...,\" the Court should \"order a proportional method of distributing Electors, selecting a proportional number of Electors to each party, based on the number of votes each party's candidate receives statewide.\" (Dkt. # 1 at 32.)
