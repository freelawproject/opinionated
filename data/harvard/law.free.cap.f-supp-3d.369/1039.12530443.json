[Docs. 33, 36.] Plaintiffs WTW Enterprises, LLC, Argonaut Insurance Company, and B &amp; M Sportfishing, Inc. oppose. [Doc. 42.] The Court decides the matter on the papers submitted without oral argument pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1(d)(1). For the reasons discussed below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On or about October 6, 2016, Argonaut Insurance Company (\"Argonaut\") issued policy no. KDH-1099-W16 to WTW Enterprises LLC (\"WTW\"), providing WTW's commercial sportfishing vessel\n   <em>\n    M/V Mali\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    hini\n   </em>\n   with maritime Hull &amp; Machinery and Protection &amp; Indemnity insurance for the policy period October 5, 2016 to October 5, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Revised Joint Statement of Disputed and Undisputed Facts (\"JSDUF\")\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6 1.) This policy also covered the related entity B &amp; M Sportfishing, Inc. (\"B &amp; M\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That policy granted WTW the privilege to waive subrogation. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6 2\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Malihini\n   </em>\n   is a 72.5-foot double-planked wood sportfisher built by Higgins Marine of New Orleans, Louisiana. (\n   <em>\n    Pacific Rim Surveyors Report\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 42-12] 10.) The craft was originally built as a PT boat, but it never saw military service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Instead, it was surplused when World War II ended. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) It became a yacht, then a sportfishing vessel based out of San Diego. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It is certified for 51 passengers and 3 to 6 crew. Mr. Wilkerson, CEO of WTW, bought the\n   <em>\n    Malihini\n   </em>\n   in 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Wilkerson Decl.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 42-7] \u00b6 1.) The vessel is now owned by WTW and operated by B &amp; M. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 42-7] \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In or around May of 2017, the\n   <em>\n    Malihini\n   </em>\n   struck a submerged object, believed to be a whale. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    Wilkerson Decl.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 42-7] \u00b6 3.) Per U.S. Coast Guard instructions, the vessel was hauled to Marine Group Boat Works, LLC (\"Marine Group\"), a Chula Vista boatyard. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6\u00b6 5-6;\n   <em>\n    Wilkerson Decl.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 42-7] \u00b6 4.) Mr. Wilkerson signed a work order, labeled \"Contract,\" in order to haul out the\n   <em>\n    Malihini\n   </em>\n   to Marine Group. (\n   <em>\n    Contract\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 28-1, Exh. A].) Among a full page of fine print, that contract contained an assumption of risk and a subrogation waiver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 28-1, Exh. A] \u00a7 8.) The waiver stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Owner, having assumed the risk of loss, shall purchase and maintain such types and amounts of insurance as owner deems reasonable and prudent to fully insure the vessel and to protect against risks of loss, including the risks assumed by owner under this contract. Owner agrees to look only to such insurance in the event of any loss irrespective of legal responsibility for such loss. As to all such policies of insurance and all claims made thereon, owner, for itself, and on behalf of owner's insurers, specifically waives all right of subrogation against contractor, its subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, officers, directors and employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 28-1, Exh. A] \u00a7 8(B).) This waiver further stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Nothing herein is intended to or may be construed to relieve contractor of liability for loss or damage caused by its gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 28-1, Exh. A] \u00a7 8(F).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Marine Group selected carpenter Francisco Magana to repair the\n   <em>\n    Malihini.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6 46.) Mr. Magana is a subcontractor who has worked with Marine Group for some time but who has never been an employee. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49.) Magana admitted in deposition that this project was the first double-planked wooden hull he had ever worked on, and that he does not understand the double-planked system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6 51.) Marine Group Project Manager Brooks Detchon chose Mr. Magana for the project despite lacking any information about his training. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6\u00b6 46, 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Malihini\n   </em>\n   spent two months at the Marine Group boatyard. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6 56.) Afterwards, the boat was launched into the water on July 21, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6 64.) The boat immediately began taking on water. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6 65.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Wilkerson and his crew made their best efforts to patch the leaks without the assistance of Marine Group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6 66.) The boat was relaunched on July 24, 2017 and returned to service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6 67.) Further problems arose, and Marine Group and Magana performed further work on the\n   <em>\n    Malihini\n   </em>\n   in August of 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6\u00b6 68-91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs' expert, marine surveyor David Jackson, identified the following problems in a 2017 inspection:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The inner planking had gaps where the planking did not go to the chines. At least one butt block had protruding screws. The diagonal inner layer of bottom planking was cut back to the garboards and is short of the chines in places. No bedding compound or cloth was used in between the plank layers. The inner and outer layer planking lacked proper backfastening. Improper bolting was used in the bottom frames. An improper plank butt schedule was used, as well as insufficient butt blocks. There are many replacement planks that are too short. The forward lower chine guard fell off after the vessel was re-launched. Port shaft and struts were not properly aligned, and the port shaft coupling bolts were only hand tight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6 78 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jackson Decl.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 42-10] \u00b6 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Also, Marine Group moved the\n   <em>\n    Malihini\n   </em>\n   on a device called a travel lift while there were planks missing from its hull-a process that exposed the hull to a risk of distortion. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6\u00b6 80-91;\n   <em>\n    Jackson Decl.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 42-10] \u00b6 5.) Ultimately, Plaintiffs brought the ship to another party to have it successfully repaired. (\n   <em>\n    See JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Argonaut has paid a total of $ 506,205.63 on this claim-$ 121,740.60 for the work done by Marine Group, and $ 384,465.03 in order to bring the ship back to working order after Marine Group finished with it. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 46] \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants filed this motion for summary judgment on December 18, 2018, seeking to enforce the subrogation waiver on the WTW work order's reverse side. (\n   <em>\n    Defs.' MSJ\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 33].) Plaintiffs oppose. [Doc. 42.] For the reasons that follow, the motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
