LEON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2001, KPS Investment Company (\"KPS\"), a business owned by Pete Patel (\"Patel\"), sought authorization for Abhishek Ramanlal Raval (\"Raval\") to work for KPS in the United States. KPS filed a labor certification with the United States Department of Labor and an I-140 visa petition with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (\"USCIS\"), listing Raval as the beneficiary of both. The requested work authorization was initially granted. But in 2004, USCIS invalidated KPS's labor certification and revoked its I-140 petition due in part to a finding that Raval had willfully misrepresented his work experience on KPS's applications. The decision left Raval ineligible for permanent residency in the United States, which he had been seeking at the time his work authorization was revoked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   KPS, Patel, and Raval (collectively, \"plaintiffs\") filed this lawsuit against nine governmental entities and officials\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to challenge USCIS's decision, alleging that it was arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful. The Government responded with a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint for lack of\n   subject matter jurisdiction, and the motion is now pending before me. Upon consideration of the pleadings and the relevant law, the Government's motion must be GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Raval is an alien seeking legal authorization to work and permanently reside in the United States through a three-step process administered by the Department of Labor and USCIS.

Under Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), such decisions are not subject to judicial review, so plaintiffs' challenge to the revocation of KPS's I-140 petition must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Undaunted, plaintiffs also challenge the denial of Raval's I-485 application and the invalidation of KPS's labor certification. But with no possibility of obtaining an approved I-140 petition, plaintiffs lack standing to bring these claims. After all, standing requires a showing that it is \"likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury [alleged in the complaint] will be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

And plaintiffs' alleged injuries cannot be cured so long as KPS's I-140 petition remains revoked. How so?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To redress injuries caused by USCIS's decision to deny Raval's I-485 application, plaintiffs must show that a favorable judgment in this case allows Raval to pursue an I-485 application that has, at least, some chance of being granted. But my dismissal of plaintiffs' I-140 claims rules this out. An \"approved I-140 Petition\" is \"\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   for the processing of a[n] I-485 Application.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    George v.

Since Raval cannot obtain the prerequisite I-140 approval, he cannot obtain relief that permits the possibility of a successful I-485 application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vemuri v.

Plaintiffs, therefore, lack standing to challenge the denial of that application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Similarly, a reinstated labor certification offers no relief to plaintiffs when the associated I-140 petition is foreclosed. \"A labor certification involving a specific job offer is valid only for the particular job opportunity\" identified and only for \"the alien for whom certification was granted.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20656.30\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 656.30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (2004) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. 2 at 9. Even if approved, the certification on its own does not authorize the beneficiary to work for the employer who sought it-work authorization requires an I-140 petition, too.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    George\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016771\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/693/125/#p131\">\n    693 F.Supp.2d at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An alien cannot work in the United States without the appropriate authority from USCIS to do so....\n   <em>\n    Upon approval of an I-140 Petition\n   </em>\n   , the named alien receives a visa which allows him to work for the named employer.\" (emphasis added) ). Because a labor certification is the first step in a multi-step process for securing a specific individual's work authorization, injuries caused by a certification's invalidation are not remedied when the beneficiary's work authorization remains out of reach. Rather, invalidated or denied labor certifications can be redressed through a lawsuit when the \"offer of employment\" at issue \"remains open\"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   \"[US]CIS could grant [the associated I-140] petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Patel v.

Plaintiffs fail at the second step. KPS's I-140 has been revoked, and the revocation cannot be reversed or vacated through this suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A\n   reinstated labor certification would, therefore, leave the parties as they now stand: KPS would remain unauthorized to employ Raval and unable to secure an approved I-140 petition. Just like with the I-485 application, plaintiffs' inability to obtain relief on their I-140 claims prevents them from obtaining relief that redresses the invalidation of KPS's labor certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, plaintiffs' complaint must be dismissed in its entirety. Congress has stripped courts of jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs' challenge to the revocation of KPS's I-140 petition, and plaintiffs consequently lack standing to challenge the invalidation of KPS's labor certification and the denial of Raval's I-485 application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Government's motion to dismiss is GRANTED.
