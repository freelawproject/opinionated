Plaintiff claims that Defendants violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq., by failing to pay him and similarly situated employees overtime for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a single workweek. Instead, Defendants paid Plaintiff overtime only for hours worked in excess of 84 hours in a two-week period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties' primary dispute is whether Defendant Air Evac EMS, Inc. (\"Air Evac\") is a \"carrier by air subject to the provisions of title II of the Railway Labor Act\" (the \"RLA\"), and, thus, exempt from the overtime provisions of the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). Plaintiff also argues that Air Evac should be estopped from asserting an FLSA exemption based on its representations regarding its overtime policies in an employment offer letter to Plaintiff. For the reasons set forth below, the Court will grant Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the purpose of the motion before the Court, the record establishes the following. Defendant Global Medical Response, Inc. (\"GMR\") is the parent of Air Medical Group Holding LLC (\"AMGH\"). GMR and AMGH are both holding companies, and neither has any employees. AMGH, in turn, is the parent company of several air ambulance companies, including but not limited to Air Evac.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Air Evac provides air medical transport services via helicopter to critically ill or injured patients in medically underserved rural areas. Air Evac collaborates with hospitals, physicians, 911 centers, and emergency medical services (\"EMS\") agencies to provide rural patients increased access to emergency trauma care. Air Evac operates more than 130 air medical bases across 15 states, and transports patients both within states and across state lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Air Evac's sole business is providing air services in the form of an air ambulance, and it derives 100% of its revenue from providing such air ambulance services. Air Evac provides air ambulance services without regard to a patient's insured status. Air Evac markets its air ambulance services to hospitals, physicians, 911 centers, and EMS agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Air Evac charges a fee to the patients it transports by air for the air ambulance services it provides. In some instances, patients have insurance coverage that covers in whole or in part the air ambulance services provided by Air Evac, and in some instances, patients are required to pay directly for such air ambulance services. In addition, Air Evac markets and sells to the public an \"air ambulance membership,\" which is a form of prepaid protection against costs not covered by a member's insurance, other benefits, or third party responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Air Evac operates under Part 135 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (\"FAR\"), 14 C.F.R. Part 135, pursuant to a license issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\"). Air Evac's Part 135 Certificate has been in effect continuously since February 13, 1986. In addition, Air Evac has a license to operate under 14 C.F.R. Part 298, as an air taxi operator. Pursuant to its Part 135 Certificate, Air Evac is authorized to operate as an air carrier and conduct common carriage operations in accordance with the FAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff Jacob Riegelsberger began working for Air Evac as a flight paramedic on or about December 3, 2017. He is still employed by Air Evac as a flight paramedic. Plaintiff was previously employed as a paramedic by one of Air Evac's sister subsidiaries, REACH Air Medical Services (\"REACH\"). REACH classified Plaintiff as non-exempt, paid him an hourly rate, and paid him overtime for each hour worked in excess of 40 hours in a single workweek. In late 2017, Air Evac offered Plaintiff his current position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff attached to his statement of additional facts submitted in connection with his opposition to this motion, a letter from Air Evac dated October 19, 2017. The letter explains that REACH was transitioning Plaintiff's base to Air Evac, and thus, REACH employees like Plaintiff were being given the option to transfer to Air Evac. The letter further states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   While REACH and Air Evac have similar employment practices in many areas, there are a few differences we want to point out:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Base Salary - Base salaries will remain as they currently are within REACH\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Annual Increase - Employees are eligible for an annual increase based on performance\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 PTO - We have attached a PTO comparison table that shows what your new accrual rate will be\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Holiday's - AEL has the same Holiday's\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Overtime - After crew members have worked 84 hours in a pay period, they will receive overtime at 1\u00bd times their base hourly rate for all other time worked.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ECF No. 35-3 at 3 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Air Evac also presented the terms and conditions of its job offer to Plaintiff in a two-page letter dated November 8, 2017, which stated, under the heading \"Compensation,\" that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   This position is considered a non-exempt position for purposes of Federal Wage and Hour Law, which means that you will be eligible for overtime pay for hours actually worked in excess of 84 hours in a pay period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ECF No. 35-3 at 1. Air Evac paid Plaintiff biweekly at an hourly rate, and paid him overtime when he worked more than 84 hours in a two-week period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The flight crew for an Air Evac air ambulance consists of a pilot, one flight paramedic, and one flight nurse. The duties of an Air Evac flight paramedic include providing advanced life support care to critically injured or ill patients from initial contact and during air ambulance transport until care is relinquished at the hospital; assisting in pre-mission liftoff checklists and pilot assistance when needed, such as radio, navigational, and visual observation activities; conducting aircraft safety briefings as needed; complying with safety standards to assure safety of self, crewmembers, medical personnel, patient, bystanders, and equipment prior to liftoff; and completing and submitting flight records. An Air Evac flight paramedic functions as a medical flight crew member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants argue that Air Evac is exempt from the overtime provisions of the FLSA because Air Evac is a \"carrier by air subject to the provisions of Title II of the [RLA].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). Defendants assert that a two-part test governs whether this exemption applies: (1) whether the employer is a common carrier by air, and (2) whether the employee's job duties bear more than a tenuous, negligible and remote relationship to the employer's transportation activities. Regarding the latter, Defendants maintain that Plaintiff cannot dispute that his duties as a flight paramedic bear more than a tenuous, negligible and remote relationship to Air Evac's transportation activities. With respect to the first element, Defendants argue that the Court should rule in line with every court and federal agency to have considered the issue, that air ambulance companies like Air Evac are common carriers by air.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In opposition, Plaintiff argues that Air Evac should be estopped from raising an exemption defense because it previously promised Plaintiff that he was accepting a non-exempt position under the FLSA. Specifically, Plaintiff points to Air Evac's November 8, 2017, job offer letter, which described Plaintiff's position as \"a non-exempt position for purposes of Federal Wage and Hour Law.\" Plaintiff argues that he relied on this statement in accepting the job offer from Air Evac and that Air Evac should be estopped from repudiating the statement now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In any event, Plaintiff argues that Air Evac is not a common carrier because (1) it does not hold itself out to the public as a common carrier, instead only marketing its\n   services to hospitals, fire departments, and other emergency service providers; (2) it does not transport patients indiscriminately, instead transporting patients based on its own determination of medical necessity and according to its own detailed policies and procedures; and (3) it does not transport patients \"for hire\" in exchange for a fare, instead transporting patients based on medical need regardless of their ability to pay, as required by state law. Plaintiff urges the Court to disregard the court and agency opinions cited by Defendants as non-binding and unpersuasive. Plaintiff also likens air ambulances to ground ambulances, which according to Plaintiff, are not common carriers under the common law of at least a few states for the purpose of determining the duty of care owed in a tort action. Plaintiff does not dispute that his duties as a flight paramedic bear more than a tenuous, negligible, and remote relationship to Air Evac's transportation activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In reply, Defendants reiterate that every court and federal agency to have considered the question has held that air ambulance companies are common carriers by air under the RLA. Defendants also oppose Plaintiff's estoppel argument because Air Evac specifically represented that Plaintiff would only be paid an overtime premium for hours worked in excess of 84 hours in a two-week pay period, and Plaintiff was paid in accordance with that representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In a surreply filed with leave of the Court, Plaintiff maintains that Air Evac should be estopped from raising an exemption defense and that, in any event, the exemption does not apply because Air Evac is not a common carrier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Summary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant, there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Metro.

Defendants dispute that they are a single and/or joint employer under the FLSA, but Defendants argue that the issue is irrelevant to resolution of this motion because a parent company of an air carrier subject to the RLA is not liable for overtime under the FLSA as a consequence of its alleged joint employer status with the direct carrier employer. Plaintiff does not dispute this assertion, and the Court agrees that if Plaintiff's work for Air Evac is exempt from the FLSA, GMR cannot be held liable either.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dennis v.
