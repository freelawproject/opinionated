INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case involves a dispute over the public transparency obligations of the Drone Advisory Committee (\"DAC\"), an advisory committee created by the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") to address the challenges associated with the integration of drones in the National Airspace System (\"NAS\"). Plaintiff the Electronic Privacy Information Center (\"EPIC\") has a particular interest in the privacy concerns posed by drones, and has engaged the FAA on that issue on multiple occasions in the past few years. In this case, EPIC alleges that the DAC, its subcommittee (the DAC Subcommittee, or \"DACSC\"), and three DAC task groups active between 2017 and 2018 violated the public record requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (\"FACA\"), 5 U.S.C. App. 2, by failing to make available records of their activities pursuant to the Act. EPIC also alleges that the DACSC and DAC task groups failed to comply with FACA's open meeting requirements, by engaging in secret meetings closed to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   EPIC initially brought claims against the FAA, the Department of Transportation\n   (\"DOT\"), FAA and DOT officials, the DAC, and the DAC's parent advisory committee, the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (\"RTCA\") Advisory Committee, under FACA, the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Declaratory Judgment Act (\"DJA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). After EPIC voluntarily dismissed its claims against the RTCA, the remaining Defendants have now moved to dismiss all claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or failure to state a claim. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider EPIC's FACA claims, APA open meetings claims, DJA claim, and APA claims against the DAC. The Court also finds that while EPIC's complaint states a cognizable APA claim as to the DAC's alleged failure to comply with its public records obligations, it fails to state a claim as to the public records obligations of the DACSC and the DAC task groups. The Court accordingly grants in part and denies in part the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

App. 2), was intended to create more transparency around the multitude of advisory committees working with the executive branch. FACA defines an advisory committee as \"any committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group, or any subcommittee or other subgroup thereof,\" which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , is \"established or utilized by one or more agencies[ ] in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or one or more agencies or officers of the Federal Government.\" 5 U.S.C. App. 2 \u00a7 3(2). The Act imposes a number of transparency requirements on advisory committees, including that advisory committee meetings be open to the public and that advisory committee records be publicly available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With respect to the open meeting requirement, FACA provides that \"[e]ach advisory committee meeting shall be open to the public,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20Stat.%20770\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10(a)(1), and that \"timely notice of each such meeting shall be published in the Federal Register,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20Stat.%20770\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10(a)(2). And as to committee records, FACA mandates that the \"records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendixes, working papers, drafts, studies, agenda, or other documents which were made available to or prepared for or by each advisory committee\" be made available for public inspection, subject only to the exceptions provided under the Freedom of Information Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . 5 U.S.C.

EPIC argues that it sought to enforce the open meeting provisions when it sent its request for records to the FAA and RTCA. Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n at 31.

Failure to State a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court next addresses Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim Counts V and VI of the Complaint, EPIC's remaining APA claims tied to the DAC, DACSC, and DAC task groups' alleged failure to comply with FACA's public records requirements. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 124-37. Defendants first argue that the DACSC and task groups are not advisory committees, and thus not subject to FACA's public records requirement. Defs.' Mem. Supp. at 21. Defendants next argue that the DAC itself has complied with FACA's public records requirements, withholding only those \"preparatory\" and \"administrative\" records that FACA does not require to be disclosed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. The Court addresses each argument in turn. The Court agrees that EPIC has not plausibly alleged that the DACSC and DAC task groups are advisory committees subject to FACA's public records requirements. However, the Complaint plausibly suggests that not all DAC records required to be made public have been produced, and the Court accordingly finds that EPIC has brought sufficiently plausible APA claims for violation of FACA.

Records of the DACSC and DAC Task Groups\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendants argue that the DACSC and DAC task groups are not advisory committees under FACA, and therefore are not subject to FACA's recordkeeping requirements. Defs.' Mem. Supp. at 21. EPIC makes two separate arguments in response: first, EPIC contends that all subcommittee records are records of their parent advisory committee under FACA, and therefore that it is entitled to all DACSC and DAC task group records because they are subgroups of the DAC, which Defendants agree is an advisory committee. Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n at 18. Second, EPIC argues that the DACSC and DAC task groups are themselves advisory committees, because they were established or utilized by the FAA and directly issued recommendations to the agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. The Court first addresses, and rejects, EPIC's broader FACA argument, before reviewing whether the DACSC and DAC task groups are advisory committees under FACA. The Court concludes that they are not, and consequently that FACA does not require disclosure of DACSC and DAC task group records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    a. Subcommittee Records as Component of Parent Committee Records\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   EPIC argues that because the DACSC and DAC task groups are subgroups-or\n   subdivisions-of the DAC, all records of the DACSC and DAC task groups are necessarily records of the DAC. Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n at 18. As a result, EPIC contends, all DACSC and DAC task group records must be made available to the public because the DAC is an advisory committee subject to FACA's public records requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. Defendants retort that EPIC's argument improperly construes FACA and its implementing regulations. Defs.' Reply at 9-10. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   FACA defines an advisory committee as \"any committee, ... or any subcommittee or other subgroup thereof, which is ... established or utilized by one or more agencies, in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations.\" 5 U.S.C. app. 2 \u00a7 3(2). And while FACA only mandates that advisory committee meetings be open to the public,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10(a)(1), the Act requires the availability for public inspection of \"the records ... or other documents which were\n   <em>\n    made available to or prepared for\n   </em>\n   or by each advisory committee,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10(b) (emphasis added). Interpretive regulations by GSA note that \"[i]n general, the requirements of [FACA] ... do not apply to subcommittees of advisory committees that report to a parent advisory committee and not directly to a Federal officer or agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.35\">\n    41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-3.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But while GSA regulations specifically note that subcommittee meetings need not comply with FACA's openness requirements if the subcommittee reports to a parent advisory committee,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.35\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 102-3.145, they do not contain a similar exception with regards to records production, where the regulations note only that \"records generated by or for an advisory committee must be retained,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.35\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 102-3.175.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   EPIC's argument is based primarily on a textual interpretation of the statute. If the DACSC and DAC task groups are subgroups of the DAC, then, EPIC contends, any record belonging to such subgroup necessarily belongs to the parent group. Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n at 18 (citing\n   <em>\n    Subgroup\n   </em>\n   , Collins English Dictionary (2018) ). And a record \"made available to or prepared for or by\" a subgroup is thus necessarily \"made available to or prepared for or by\" the DAC itself.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.35\">\n    at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While this \"commonsense conclusion,\" Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n at 19, may be intuitively appealing, the Court finds that it is not supported by the statute or regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   First, the statutory text itself does not support EPIC's conclusion. \"In construing a statute, we look first for the plain meaning of the text.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700284,9416079\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/1354/\">\n    295 F.3d 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1359 (D.C. Cir. 2002). Even taking EPIC's definition of a subgroup, the Court disagrees that any record made available to or prepared for a subgroup (or subdivision of a group) is necessarily made available to or prepared for the parent group pursuant to 5 U.S.C. app. 2 \u00a7 10(b). Just because the DACSC and DAC task groups ultimately answer to the DAC does not mean that all of their documents are made available to or prepared for the DAC. For example, meeting minutes of any DACSC and DAC task group meetings would be prepared for those specific subgroups, rather than for the DAC as a whole. In addition, \"the cannons of statutory interpretation instruct courts to avoid construing the text of a statute to be contradictory; 'our task is to fit, if possible, all parts into a harmonious whole.' \"\n   <em>\n    Humane Soc'y of the U.S. v.

As Defendants point out, it would make little sense for FACA to provide for subgroups to separately qualify as advisory committees under \u00a7 3(2), and only for records \"made available to or prepared for\" an\n   advisory committee to require public disclosure, 5 U.S.C. app. 2 \u00a7 10(b), if all subcommittee records were automatically considered records of an advisory committee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Second, both EPIC and Defendants spend a significant portion of their briefs discussing various executive documents and regulations regarding the applicability of FACA to subcommittees. Relying on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.35\">\n    41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-3.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Defendants argue that the GSA regulations \"expressly exclude subcommittee records from FACA's disclosure requirements.\" Defs.' Reply at 10. By contrast, EPIC relies on the lack of subcommittee exception to FACA's public records requirements in the CFR for the proposition that those records are necessarily included in parent committee records. Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n at 20. EPIC also points to the National Archives and Records Administration's (\"NARA's\") General Records Schedule 6.2, which provides for the permanent conservation as FACA records of \"records that document the activities of subcommittees that support their reports and recommendations to the chartered or parent committee.\" General Records Schedule 6.2 at 132, Compl. Ex. 15. And it points to a GSA training presentation that indicates subcommittee records should be publicly accessible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GSA FACA Training Course at 192, Compl. Ex. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   On the balance, the Court finds that the supplementary authority discussed by the parties supports the government's interpretation of the statute. The Court initially notes that it need not defer to interpretative regulations of a statute that were not promulgated pursuant to express statutory authority.\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4217086\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/736/24/\">\n    736 F.Supp.2d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 33 n.4 (D.D.C. 2010). In any event, and notwithstanding the lack of subcommittee records exception in the regulations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.35\">\n    41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-3.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   makes clear that GSA's interpretation is that subcommittees are not generally subject to FACA. NARA's General Records Schedule also supports the notion that not all subcommittee records are records of an advisory committee, because the schedule specifically identifies as subject to FACA \"records that document the activities of subcommittees\n   <em>\n    that support their reports and recommendations to the chartered or parent committee.\n   </em>\n   \" General Records Schedule 6.2 at 132 (emphasis added). And, regardless, a requirement that records be preserved is not the same as a requirement that they be made public. While the GSA training presentation EPIC points to appears to contradict GSA's own interpreting regulations of FACA, that presentation does not \"have the force of law sufficient to contradict its regulations.\" Defs.' Reply at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    b. Whether the DACSC and DAC Task Groups Are Advisory Committees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Next, EPIC argues that DACSC and DAC task group records must be made available to the public even if they are not automatically included as records of the DAC because the DACSC and DAC task groups are themselves advisory committees subject to FACA's public records requirements. Defendants argue the Complaint does not show that the DACSC and DAC task groups were established or utilized by the FAA, or that they were intended to provide advice or recommendations directly to the FAA.

EPIC, on the other hand, contends that it has shown that the DACSC and DAC task groups were established or utilized by the FAA and issued recommendations directly to the FAA. Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n at 21-30. The Court finds that, regardless of whether they were \"established\" or \"utilized\" by the FAA, the\n   Complaint fails to plausibly allege that the DACSC and DAC task groups were established or utilized \"in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for\" the FAA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court accordingly concludes that neither the DACSC nor the DAC task groups are advisory committees, and as a result, that their records need not be made public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Pursuant to FACA, a committee (or subcommittee) becomes an advisory committee only when it is,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"established or utilized ... in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or one or more agencies or officers of the Federal Government.\" 5 U.S.C. app. 2 \u00a7 3(2).

The authority of the FAA DFO over DACSC and DAC task groups meetings therefore does not suggest that the FAA bypassed the DAC in obtaining advice and recommendations. And the fact that FAA officials may have briefed, educated, or provided guidance and assistance to the DACSC does not mean that the DACSC bypassed the DAC and advised the FAA directly. The exhibits to the Complaint suggest the opposite: the DACSC's Terms of Reference indicate that its purpose was to \"support the DAC in developing consensus-based recommendations to the FAA\" by \"provid[ing] the staff work for the DAC, applying knowledge and expertise to forge consensus on critical issues and providing input to the DAC for public deliberation and the development of recommendations.\" DACSC Terms of Reference at 1. The Terms of Reference also made clear that the DACSC would act at the DAC's direction, with all its recommendations to be vetted and approved at DAC meetings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.120\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.120\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And DAC meeting minutes included as exhibits to EPIC's complaint confirm that the DACSC briefed the DAC on several occasions.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   January 31, 2017 Meeting Minutes; November 8, 2017 Meeting Minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Here, EPIC has not alleged any fact that suggests the DACSC was established or utilized directly for the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations for the FAA. Like the task forces in\n   <em>\n    Anti-Hunger\n   </em>\n   , the DACSC was set up specifically to conduct staff work for the DAC, with a clearly established hierarchical structure mandating for all recommendations to be approved by the DAC. And unlike the working group in\n   <em>\n    Ass'n of Am. Physicians\n   </em>\n   , the\n   DACSC is subordinate to an advisory committee that forms \"the point of contact between the public and the government.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3816579,1878734\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/898/\">\n    997 F.2d at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The DACSC provided reports of its activities at public DAC meetings, and so did its component task groups. Absent any allegation that the DACSC provided advice or recommendations directly to the FAA-beyond the conclusory assertion that \"FAA officials have repeatedly circumvented the full DAC\"-the Complaint does not plead sufficient facts to plausibly suggest that the DACSC was an advisory committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The facts alleged with respect to the DAC task groups dictate the same conclusion. EPIC alleges that the FAA issued detailed tasking statements for each task group, including fact-finding assignments, topics each task group should advise on, and deadlines to deliver recommendations and reports. Compl. \u00b6 39. And it also alleges that because the task groups were subcommittees of the DAC, the designated FAA DFO had the same powers over them as over the DACSC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. As discussed above, GSA regulations require agencies to designate a DFO with such authority over the meetings of every subcommittee of an advisory committee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.120\">\n    41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-3.120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And as with the DACSC, exhibits to the complaint indicate that the DAC task groups were established as, and functioned as, subordinate groups to the DAC. The DACSC Terms of Reference, while noting that the DACSC would coordinate the work of the DAC task groups, DACSC Terms of Reference at 1, stated that \"[n]o recommendations w[ould] flow directly from the ... DAC TGs directly to the FAA,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.120\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.120\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The task groups presented reports and substantive recommendations for review by the DAC at multiple DAC meetings.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 63, 75. These substantive recommendations were not simply rubber-stamped and accepted wholesale by the DAC; they were discussed and sometimes amended prior to final approval and forwarding to the FAA.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   January 31, 2017 DAC Meeting Minutes at 12-13; May 3, 2017 DAC Meeting Minutes at 9-14, 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Even more so than with the DACSC, these facts point to the conclusion that the DAC task groups did not provide advice or recommendations directly to the FAA and are therefore not advisory committees under FACA. As in\n   <em>\n    Anti-Hunger,\n   </em>\n   the task forces were subordinate to two layers of advisory committees. The D.C. Circuit's suggestion that there is \"less reason to focus on subordinate advisers or consultants who [were] presumably under the control of the superior groups,\"\n   <em>\n    American Ass'n of Physicians,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3816579,1878734\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/898/\">\n    997 F.2d at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is thus even stronger. EPIC points to the significant work conducted by the task groups and to the limited discussion of some of their recommendations before approval at DAC meetings to argue that they did not merely provide staff work-and essentially that they were directly advising the FAA. Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n at 29. The Court is not convinced by the argument, when the DAC suggested changes to task group recommendations,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   May 3, 2017 Meeting Minutes at 17 (noting direction to Task Group 2 to adjust recommendation), and where some of the more contentious task group recommendations received extensive discussion,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   November 8, 2017 Meeting Minutes at 8-10 (discussing Task Group 1's fragmented recommendations). And the Complaint does not allege that the DAC \"rubber-stamped\" or acted as a meaningless conduit between the DAC task groups and the FAA. The Court accordingly finds that the Complaint fails to allege facts that plausibly support the claim that the DAC task groups are advisory\n   committees under FACA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   2.

Opp'n at 14, while Defendants contend in their reply that the limited references to records of the DAC (as opposed to the DACSC and DAC task groups) in the Complaint are insufficient to state a claim, Defs' Reply at 3-9. The Court finds that EPIC has sufficiently pled its remaining APA claims as to the DAC for the claims to survive the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Complaint contains only sparse reference to records of the DAC itself. EPIC asks for \"[a]ccess to the[ ] nonpublic ... records\" of the DAC in the Complaint, Compl. \u00b6 3, and contends that \"the vast majority of DAC records ... remain closed to the public,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.

In its opposition, EPIC also points to multiple records of the DAC referenced in exhibits to the Complaint, which it alleges have not been made available to the public. Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n at 16-18. These records include documents shared in an online workspace the DAC made available to its members \"to facilitate the consensus process of the committee,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, a legal fact sheet prepared by the FAA,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17, RTCA SC-228 briefing materials,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and records of \"listening sessions\" meetings organized by Task Group 3 and attended by DAC members,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In their reply, Defendants argue that the limited reference to the records of the DAC in the Complaint is insufficient to support EPIC's claims, because the allegations referencing the DAC are merely conclusory statements and \"bald allegations\" of a \"conclusory nature.\" Defs.'

First, while it agrees that the Complaint contains only very limited references to DAC records, the Court notes that EPIC alleges it made a request for DAC records that Defendants entirely ignored.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 95-99. Defendants argue that the Complaint and its exhibits \"establish that numerous records of the DAC ... were made available to the public,\" which they contend \"readily support the legal conclusion that [D]efendants fully complied with FACA's disclosure requirements.\" Defs.' Reply at 4. But it would be difficult for EPIC to specifically identify records that were not published when those records are not public in the first place, and when Defendants refuse to provide the full list of records they believe are required to be published. Instead, EPIC identifies a request it has made for public inspection, to which Defendants failed to reply-other than with their assertion in briefs in this lawsuit that all required records have been made public. For the same reason that FOIA cases are \"typically and appropriately ... decided on motions for summary judgment,\"\n   <em>\n    Defenders of Wildlife v. U.S. Border Patrol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4161055\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/623/83/#p87\">\n    623 F.Supp.2d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87 (D.D. C 2009), because the Court can then identify what documents have been withheld and why, the failure to make available any DAC documents for review militates in favor of EPIC's claims surviving the motion to dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Second, the Court does not find persuasive Defendants' argument that it \"would be entirely consistent with FACA\" for them not to release the documents EPIC identified as improperly withheld from the public in its opposition. Defs.' Reply at 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants rely on a regulation contained in Subpart D of GSA's interpretive regulations of FACA, \"Advisory Committee Meeting and Recordkeeping Procedures,\" for the notion that preparatory and administrative records of advisory committees are not covered by FACA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply at 8;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.160\">\n    41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-3.160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, \u00a7 102-3.160 is entitled \"What activities of an advisory committee are not subject to\n   <em>\n    the notice and open meeting requirements\n   </em>\n   of the Act?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.160\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). And \"preparatory work\" and \"administrative work\" are both defined as \"\n   <em>\n    [m]eetings\n   </em>\n   of two or more advisory committee or subcommittee members\" conducted for specific purposes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.160\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The Court is thus not convinced that \u00a7 102-3.160 actually justifies withholding records from publication under FACA because they are preparatory or of an administrative nature. In fact, the broad list of documents required to be made public by the statute, including preparatory documents such as drafts or agendas, suggests that there is no such exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. app. 2 \u00a7 10(b). And even if such an exception to the public records requirement is justified under the statute, the Court cannot determine that the exception applies simply by accepting the government's unsworn arguments contained in a legal brief that all documents shared in the DAC workspace, and all documents created in connection with Task Group 3 listening sessions, were preparatory\n   or administrative in nature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'
