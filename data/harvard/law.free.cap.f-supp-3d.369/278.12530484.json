Similarly, section 14502(a)(1) states: \"In the case of an officer or former officer who the Secretary of the military department concerned determines was not considered for selection for promotion ... by a mandatory promotion board ... the Secretary concerned shall convene a special selection board under this subsection to determine whether such officer or former officer should be recommended for promotion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Thus, both \u00a7 1558 and \u00a7 14502 address convening a board to review a personnel decision made by either a selection board or a promotion board (both of which can promote someone). The primary difference between the statutes is that \u00a7 14502 specifically deals with promotions of officers, while \u00a7 1558 addresses a wider range of personnel decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The regulations plaintiff posits were most relevant implement \u00a7 1552, which by contrast, generally address the correction of a military record. While a board convened to correct a military record may be considered a Special Board under \u00a7 1558, it must be specifically designated as such by the Secretary.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201558\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B).

The \"first application\" he refers to was an application to correct his military records pursuant to \u00a7 1552. Pl.'s Mem. at 3-4; Pl.'s Reply at 2-3. It was not a request to convene a Special Board; plaintiff did not request a Special Board until December 2016. And in his second argument, plaintiff argues that Captain Loser only reviewed fifteen applications to draw her conclusions, when the BCNR processes over 12,000 petitions annually. Pl.'s Reply at 3. But a board convened pursuant to \u00a7 1552 is not the same as a Special Board convened pursuant to \u00a7 1558. It is true that a Special Board can include a board for the correction of military records, but only \"if designated a Special Board by the Secretary concerned.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201558\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B). The boards referenced in \u00a7 1552 and \u00a7 1558 are therefore not coterminous, and plaintiffs' arguments regarding BCNR applications is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   And, while there is no document memorializing the use of the Special Selection Board regulations in considering Special Board requests, there does not appear to be any document stating that the BCNR regulations should be applied to Special Board requests. Thus if the Assistant Secretary had followed the course that plaintiff recommends, it would be equally subject to attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, the Court does recognize that both the Deputy Commandant and Director referred to the standards set forth in the regulations implementing \u00a7 1552. Suppl. AR 524 (referencing the \"injustice\" standard);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201558\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201558\">\n    at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the fact that they used the BCNR standard does not mean it was arbitrary and capricious for the Assistant Secretary, on the advice of the JAG, to use the standard applicable to Special Selection Boards. And, both the Deputy Commandant and the Director recommended denying plaintiff's request for a Special Board even under the \"more permissive\" BCNR standard that plaintiff argues should have been used. Thus, the Court finds that the Assistant Secretary's decision to use the Special Selection Board regulations was not arbitrary or capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Cir. 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court finds that the Assistant Secretary's decision to deny convening a Special Board was the product of reasoned decisionmaking. The Assistant Secretary stated that plaintiff did not demonstrate that the decisions of the four selection boards in the 1990s were contrary to law or involved material error of fact or material administrative error. The Assistant Secretary's finding was predicated on the recommendations of the Deputy Commandant of M &amp; RA and the Director of the Reserve Affairs Division.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Director reasoned that the evidence submitted by plaintiff did \"not demonstrate that an irregularity, error, or injustice occurred, but rather that his non-selection was due entirely to his own record and actions, the competitive nature of the FTS and AR programs, and the needs of the Marine Corps at the time that he was applying for selection.\" Suppl. AR 524. The Director also stated that in 1996, plaintiff \"did not possess the skills that the AR program was seeking.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 523. In 1999, the program wanted more junior officers, and he was a Senior Major.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He explained that plaintiff's military record was \"simply not strong enough to warrant his selection by the 1991, 1992, 1996, or 1999 FTS or AR Boards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 524. He cites to a February 2011 advisory opinion that noted \"a lack of break out comments that are normally associated with highly competitive officers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And the Director opined that \"[b]ased on his performance evaluations, [plaintiff] was not a highly competitive officer and the FTS and AR programs are highly competitive programs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Director then goes on to address each selection board decision and concludes that a Special Board was not warranted because plaintiff could not show that the non-selections were due to any irregularities, errors, or injustices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 524-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Similarly, the Deputy Commandant observed that in 1996, \"HQMC notified [plaintiff] that he was not a grade or 'hard-skill' MOS match that met the needs of the AR program.\" Suppl. AR 529. And, in 1999, the AR program was accepting only \"captains and specific flight-trained majors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Deputy Commandant found that the Reserve Affairs division did a\n   thorough review in 2011, and that plaintiff's \"repeated non-selection for the AR and FTS programs was due to the needs of the Marine Corps and the competitive nature of the program.\" Suppl. AR 530. Finally, the Deputy Commandant found that the \"evidence provided by [plaintiff] fails to demonstrate any irregularity, error, or injustice in the conduct of the FTS and AR selection boards,\" and even if plaintiff had demonstrated such, his request for a Special Board is untimely, and he \"has failed to explain ... why it would be in the interest of justice to consider his untimely request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In his final decision, the Assistant Secretary also points out that plaintiff should have been more diligent in reviewing and correcting his records when he discovered the mistakes over twenty-five years ago. Under Marine Corps Order 1610.11D (replaced by 1610.7), referenced in the Director's memorandum, it is a Marine's responsibility to ensure that his personnel file is accurate and complete, \"especially in advance of eligibility before a particular selection board.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. C to Def.'s Mot. [Dkt. # 36-3] (\"MCO1610.7\") at Ch. 8 \u00b6 11(b). The individual Marine bears the burden to petition the BCNR and request a correction to a military personnel file.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. AR 525; Ex. B to Def.'s Mot. [Dkt. # 36-2] (\"MCO1610.11D\") \u00a7 e.2(a). This aspect of the Assistant Secretary's decision was also consistent with the recommendations that flowed up the chain of command: both the Director and the Deputy Commandant observed that plaintiff should have been more diligent in correcting his records earlier. The Director in particular stated that plaintiff \"had exercised reasonable diligence, any errors he allege[d] would have been identified and corrected prior to the convening of the selection boards.\" Suppl. AR 526.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, the Assistant Secretary states that the requests were extremely untimely. At best, the request for a Special Board in December 2016 came seventeen years after plaintiff had notice that he was not selected for the 1999 AR selection board - fourteen years too late. Similarly, the Deputy Commandant and Director found that the plaintiff did not adequately explain why the request was so untimely and why it would be in the interest of justice to waive the three-year deadline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Suppl. AR 530.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the decisionmaking process was deficient because the recommendations by the Director and the Deputy Commandant depended on an allegedly erroneous advisory opinion issued by HQMC RA in February 2011. He also argues that \"no further review\" of his record was conducted, and therefore the decision was not based on substantial evidence. Pl.'s Mem. at 20-21. This argument fails for three reasons. First, the Director and the Deputy Commandant did not simply adopt the conclusions from the February 2011 advisory opinion without any additional analysis. Each memorandum explained that plaintiff's request should be denied because he had not demonstrated that the selection boards' decisions\n   amounted to an injustice or had relied on a material administrative error, and each pointed to specific reasons, such as plaintiff's service record and the needs of the programs at the time. Suppl. AR 522-33. Second, the 2011 advisory opinion was not the only document relied on and referenced by the Director and Deputy Commandant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. AR 522 (listing the documents enclosed and references used, including plaintiff's applications to the FTS/AR program in 1992 and 1996);\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 530 (referencing the plaintiff's petition to the BCNR in 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Third, it is not clear that plaintiff's characterization of the 2011 advisory opinion that was cited in the recommendations as \"erroneous\" is accurate. In plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment, he explains that the advisory opinion was issued in response to the application to correct military records he submitted in September 2010. Pl.'s Mem. at 3. In that application, he argued that but for the mishandling of his professional records, he would have been accepted into the FTS and AR programs in 1991 and 1996.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The HQMC RA issued the 2011 advisory opinion, recommending denial of the application, because it found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   After a thorough review of [plaintiff's] entire Official Military Personnel File (OMPF), it is apparent that [he] was not highly competitive. [Plaintiff's] performance reports lack break-out comments that are normally associated with highly competitive officers. Out of the 19 reports from the previous performance evaluation system, [plaintiff] received after departing the active component in 1985, he had one report with an \"excellent\" in general value to the service and 3 reports with an \"excellent to outstanding\" in general value to service. In his seven reports where he was in the \"outstanding\" value to service when he was compared to his peer, he was ranked 2 out of 2 on 4 occasions. Accession into other AR program has been highly competitive based on the needs of the Marine Corps and the AR program at the time of selection. Based off his performance and the needs of the Marine Corps, [plaintiff] was not competitive to be assigned to the FTS program in 1991 or the AR program in 1996.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4; AR 287. Plaintiff petitioned for reconsideration, arguing that the Board had not considered the various statements from General Officers and Colonels he had submitted. Among those was an analysis conducted by a retired Marine Corps JAG, Colonel Wendy Stafford, which explained how the BCNR had significantly erred in conducting its review and denial. Pl.'s Mem. at 5-6. Despite this evidence, the BCNR again denied plaintiff's requested relief, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   After a careful review of his application with his supporting letter and enclosures, the Board was unable to find any new and material evidence or other matter it had not previously considered. The Board found [plaintiff] had provided documentation that is new, but not material, in that it would not have changed the outcome of his case. The Board further found the new documentation,\n   <em>\n    to the effect that [plaintiff] would have been competitive for selection to the Full Time Support Program in 1991 but for the two fitness reports whose removal has been directed by the Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) Performance Evaluation Review Board\n   </em>\n   , did not establish that he would, in fact, have been selected with a fully corrected record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   AR 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the italicized text above amounts to a finding that plaintiff was competitive for the programs, and thus, \"actually overturn[s]\" the 2011 advisory\n   opinion. Pl.'s Mem. at 21 n.10. But that statement, at best, is a description of the purpose for which plaintiff submitted the extra documents, not a finding that is tantamount to a reversal of the opinion. Thus, the fact that the Director and Deputy Commandant referenced the 2011 advisory opinion does not render the decisionmaking process deficient, because that opinion was not later found to be \"clearly erroneous\" as plaintiff contends, and the Director and Deputy Commandant each conducted an independent analysis of plaintiff's petition and the administrative record. The fact that they ultimately agreed with the reasoning of the 2011 advisory opinion, and disagreed with plaintiff's interpretation of the evidence, does not mean they did not base their recommendations on substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Even if the Court were to find plaintiff's assessment of the evidence to be persuasive, the Court does not have the authority to set aside a decision that has \"examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks and citation omitted).

Pl.'s Mem. at 18. But both the Director and Deputy Commandant analyzed plaintiff's request for a Special Board under the very standards plaintiff believes are applicable, and both found that plaintiff had not demonstrated that a waiver of the time limit was in the interest of justice, because plaintiff \"failed to explain why he did not request a special board in a timely manner.\" Suppl. AR 530. The Director found that contrary to plaintiff's \"assertions in his BCNR petition that he only identified the errors or injustices on 27 September 2010, he was on notice of his non-selection immediately after the boards in 1991, 1992, 1996, and 1999.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 525-26. Further, the Director stated that \"[g]enerally, claims that are older than three years are not heard by the BCNR without an explanation as to why it is necessary to hear the claim in the interest of justice\" and plaintiff did not provide a \"compelling explanation\" for his tardiness.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201552\">\n    at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
