(\"ChromaDex\") filed this action against Defendant Elysium Health, Inc. (\"Elysium\") on December 29, 2016. (Dkt. 1 [Complaint].) On November 27, 2018, pursuant to the Court's order granting leave to amend under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), ChromaDex filed a Fifth Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 153 [Fifth Amended Complaint, hereinafter \"FAC\"].) The Fifth Amended Complaint added Defendant Mark Morris. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Before the Court is Defendants' motion to dismiss the sixth, seventh, and eighth claims of the Fifth Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 174 [hereinafter \"Mot.\"].) For the following reasons, the motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Fifth Amended Complaint alleges the following facts. ChromaDex is a corporation that develops patented ingredients for use in dietary supplements, food, beverages, skin care, and pharmaceuticals. (FAC \u00b6 13.) Elysium is a corporation that sells a dietary supplement named \"Basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) ChromaDex alleges that it was \"Elysium's sole supplier of the two fundamental active ingredients\" in Basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These two ingredients are NIAGEN\u00ae, a health ingredient that is comprised of nicotinamide riboside (\"NR\"), and pTeroPure\u00ae, a health ingredient made of synthetic pterostilbene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ChromaDex and Elysium's dealings were \"unremarkable\" until 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Then, in 2016, Elysium secretly began developing an alternative manufacturing source for NR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) To further this plan, Elysium began recruiting Mark Morris, ChromaDex's Vice President of Business Development. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) Elysium allegedly offered employment to Morris in exchange for his commitment to act as Elysium's inside agent before he terminated his employment with ChromaDex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Morris allegedly began giving to Elysium \"confidential and proprietary information on ChromaDex's sales to other customers,\" including information concerning the prices and volumes of NR ordered by another ChromaDex customer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) ChromaDex keeps this information, which is only accessible by its employees, in a highly-confidential document called the \"Ingredient Sales Spreadsheet,\" which\n   tracks quarterly sales for all ingredients since 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) While at ChromaDex, Morris allegedly texted and used his personal email account to send information to Elysium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.) Elysium recorded the information that Morris provided in a spreadsheet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By providing this information to Elysium, Morris allegedly violated two confidentiality agreements that he signed at ChromaDex. On February 26, 2016, Morris executed an agreement entitled Receipt &amp; Acknowledgement of Employee Handbook (the \"February Confidentiality Agreement\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) In the February Confidentiality Agreement, Morris agreed to protect ChromaDex's proprietary and confidential information and not to duplicate or remove any of ChromaDex's files, documents, and software. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) On July 15, 2016, Morris signed a Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreement (the \"July Confidentiality Agreement\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Sections 2 and 3 of the July Confidentiality Agreement required Morris to return all tangible items, such as computer-stored information and disks, and all ChromaDex trade secret and confidential information upon termination of his employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Section 3 of the July Confidentiality Agreement also prohibited Morris from disclosing ChromaDex trade secret and confidential information to any other person or business entity or using or permitting others to use such information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Using Morris's information, Elysium purportedly conspired with Morris and hatched a plan to obtain a market advantage over its competitors, including over ChromaDex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) Under this plan, Elysium would order a twelve-month supply of NIAGEN and pTeroPure from ChromaDex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) After obtaining a stockpile, Elysium then planned to seek out alternate sources of ingredients and eventually compete with ChromaDex in the manufacture of NR and synthetic pterostilbene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) While still at ChromaDex, Morris apparently knew of Elysium's plans to displace ChromaDex in the market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Elysium then put its plan to action. On June 28, 2016, Elysium submitted two extraordinarily large purchase orders for NIAGEN and pTeroPure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) These purchase orders contained a demand for the two products at less than half of the parties' agreed price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Morris arranged a phone call between the two companies to discuss the orders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) On the phone call, Elysium's management represented that Elysium was ramping up production and would continue to place additional large orders in the next quarters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) Based on these promises, ChromaDex offered Elysium a discounted price for NIAGEN. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On June 30, 2016, Elysium submitted two revised purchase orders for pTeroPure and NIAGEN at a smaller quantity than the June 30 purchase orders, but still at three times the size of any of Elysium's previous fulfilled orders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At this time, Morris, who remained a ChromaDex officer, failed to inform ChromaDex that Elysium's orders were expected to last for nine months, that Elysium did not intend to pay for the orders, and that Elysium was preparing to compete with ChromaDex by obtaining an alternate source of NR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) ChromaDex sent its first shipment to fulfill the purchase orders on July 1, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) On July 15, 2016, Morris resigned from ChromaDex after one week's notice and allegedly started working for Elysium the next day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 73.) On August 9, 2016, ChromaDex shipped the final shipment to fulfill the purchase orders and sent invoices to Elysium for $ 2,983,350. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Since then, Elysium has refused to pay the amount due on the invoices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action, ChromaDex brings claims for breach of the July Confidentiality Agreement, breach of fiduciary duty, and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty. (\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants now move to dismiss these claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Mot.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of the claims asserted in the complaint. The issue on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is not whether the claimant will ultimately prevail, but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims asserted.\n   <em>\n    Gilligan v.

Rule 12(b)(6) is read in conjunction with Rule 8(a), which requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).

Breach of July Confidentiality Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ChromaDex brings its sixth cause of action against Morris for breach of the July Confidentiality Agreement. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 223-37.) To state a cause of action for breach of contract, a plaintiff must allege \"(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Oasis W. Realty, LLC v.

Defendants challenge whether there was an enforceable contract. A contract exists only if the parties are capable of contracting, they manifest objective consent, the contract has a lawful object, and there is sufficient consideration.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201550\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants contend that ChromaDex fails to allege the July Confidentiality Agreement was supported by adequate consideration. (Mot. at 6-9.) The July Confidentiality Agreement states that ChromaDex's consideration includes \"without limitation ... an offer of employment with [ChromaDex] in an at-will employment relationship and [Morris's] exposure to [ChromaDex's] proprietary and confidential business information as its employee.\" (FAC Ex. B.) Defendants, however, characterize this language as a \"false recitation of consideration\" because Morris left ChromaDex on the same day that he signed the July Confidentiality Agreement. (Mot. at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under California law, \"[a] written instrument is presumptive evidence of consideration.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201614\">\n    Cal.

ChromaDex alleges that the July Confidentiality Agreement is a written instrument and attaches a copy of it to the Fifth Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC Ex. B.) ChromaDex also alleges that it \"fulfilled its obligations under the July Confidentiality Agreement by providing Morris with employment and benefits.\" (FAC \u00b6 226.) Although Morris ended his employment the same day that he signed the July Confidentiality Agreement, ChromaDex pleads that it provided Morris with continued access to ChromaDex confidential information after signing the contract and permitted him to leave without further assurances or steps to ensure that he had returned ChromaDex's confidential information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 102.)

Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ChromaDex brings its seventh cause of action against Morris for breach of fiduciary duty and its eighth cause of action against Elysium for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 238-51.) To state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must allege (1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship, (2) its breach, and (3) damages proximately caused by that breach.\n   <em>\n    AccuImage Diagnostics Corp. v.

Cal. 2014) (denying motion to dismiss breach of fiduciary duty claim where neither the breach nor alleged fiduciary role were based on the taking or use of proprietary or confidential information).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   ChromaDex's breach of fiduciary duty claims are premised on two theories distinct from the misappropriation of confidential information. First, ChromaDex contends that Morris breached his fiduciary duty by encouraging ChromaDex to fulfill Elysium's extraordinarily large purchase orders in June 2016. (FAC \u00b6 48.) Morris never disclosed that he had accepted an offer of employment from Elysium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) Morris also did not inform ChromaDex\n   that Elysium's orders were expected to last for nine months, that Elysium did not intend to pay for the orders, and that Elysium was preparing to compete with ChromaDex by obtaining an alternate source of NR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) Second, while a ChromaDex fiduciary, Morris allegedly helped Elysium recruit another senior ChromaDex employee, Ryan Dellinger. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) This conduct allegedly harmed ChromaDex because ChromaDex continued to pay Morris while he recruited Dellinger and Dellinger's resignation, with less than one day's notice, required the company to scramble to find a new Director of Scientific Affairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 125, 240.) Since ChromaDex's breach of fiduciary duty claims are premised on conduct broader and different from the taking of confidential information, they are not preempted by CUTSA. Defendants' motion to dismiss the seventh and eighth causes of action is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss the sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Having read and considered the papers presented by the parties, the Court finds this matter appropriate for disposition without a hearing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.
