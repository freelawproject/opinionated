National Controversy Concerning Sexual Assaults on College Campuses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that recent political developments and governmental pressure have led American colleges and universities to become more aggressive in policing sexual misconduct on campus. In April 2011, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (\"OCR\") issued a \"Dear Colleague Letter\" to colleges and universities in order to explain its interpretation of Title IX. Complt. at \u00b6\u00b6 11-13. The Letter instructed colleges and universities that compliance with Title IX requires transparent and prompt procedures for investigating and resolving complaints of sexual misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11(a). The Letter required colleges and universities to employ a \"more likely than not\" standard of proof in sexual misconduct cases; this standard was less exacting than the \"clear and convincing\" or \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standards utilized at some colleges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11(b). The Letter also instructed universities that they should \"minimize the burden on the complainant,\" \"focus more on victim advocacy,\" and transfer \"alleged perpetrators\" away from any \"shared courses or housing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11(c)-(d). Many colleges changed their sexual misconduct policies and procedures after the Dear Colleague Letter was issued.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11(e). In addition to the Dear Colleague Letter, the Obama administration pressured colleges to investigate sexual assaults on campus aggressively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Letter, Plaintiff alleges, was only the first part of the government's efforts to address sexual assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12(a). Members of the Department of Education publically urged \" 'radical' change,\" which colleges interpreted as \" 'marching orders' \" that required them to take the issue more \" 'seriously.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12(b)-(c). Plaintiff asserts that schools \"including Syracuse, were scared of being investigated or sanctioned by the Department of Education.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. The government, Plaintiff claims, also \"created a significant amount of pressure on colleges and universities to treat all those accused of sexual misconduct with a presumption of guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13(a). These policies also tended to treat men as aggressors and women as victims, applying different standards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Some administrators expressed concern that \"schools are running so scared of\n   violating the civil rights of alleged victims that they end up violating the due process rights of\" the accused.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13(b). Schools appeared to risk losing federal funding unless they altered policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13(c)-(e). In July 2016, then-Vice President Joseph Biden suggested that schools that do not comply with Title IX administration guidelines could be stripped of federal funding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13(g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   All of these pressures led colleges and universities established policies that reduced \"procedural protections\" to men, like Plaintiff, accused of sexual misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Syracuse's Alleged Crackdown Amid Public and OCR Pressure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In recent years, and during the period preceding the disciplinary action against John Noakes, Syracuse experienced substantial criticism from both the student body and the public media for failing to take seriously female students' allegations of sexual assault by male students.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. Critics attacked the way that Syracuse handled Title IX investigations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17(a). In September 2014, students, faculty and staff gathered on the steps of Hendricks Chapel at Syracuse to protest the University's changes to sexual assault policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17(c). An organization called \"THE General Body,\" a collective of student organizations, spent close to three weeks occupying the Syracuse administration building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Among the organization's demands were an increase in attention to the issue of sexual assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17(c)(i). The group also protested closure of the Advocacy Center, which focused on the needs of sexual-assault survivors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17(c)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In December 2014, Syracuse received a report from the Chancellor's Workgroup on Sexual Violence Prevention, Education, and Advocacy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. The report observed that much of the University's focus in preventing campus sexual assault is the prevention of acts by males.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18(a). The report says: \"The discourse on campus about sexual assault and relationship violence typically focuses on male-on-female violence involving students who are fulltime undergraduates, White, and heterosexual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff contends that the report \"suggested\" that Syracuse had not invested sufficient staff and resources to investigate claims of sexual assault and relationship violence, nor to educate members of the Syracuse community on those issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18(b). The report also criticized the Chancellor for closing the Advocacy Center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18(c). Further, Plaintiff alleges, the report urged Syracuse to adopt more \"victim-centered\" policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In July 2015, New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law so-called \"Enough is Enough\" legislation designed to combat sexual assault on college campuses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. Syracuse Chancellor Kent Syverud adopted the \"Enough is Enough\" legislation in summer 2015, making him the first private college chancellor or president to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19(a). Syracuse officials expressed pride at being the first private university to adopt the \"Enough is Enough\" program and alleged \"progress\" on the issue of sexual misconduct in recent years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Various other events highlighted the alleged sexual assault problem on the Syrcause campus. Syracuse received national\n   attention as a result of a September 2015 CNBC report titled, \"One of the most dangerous places for women in America.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. The report highlighted a 2012 sexual assault on campus, praising \" 'courageous students-both male and female-[who are] continuing to speak out, refusing to be silenced until the crisis stops.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 2016, Syracuse responded to some of the criticism that it was not taking the problem of sexual assaults on campus seriously.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. One Syracuse Dean responded to such allegations by stating, \"the university has expelled and suspended students and put students on probation f or sexual misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21(b). In October 2016, Syracuse students dragged mattresses covered with messages in red tape to protest rape culture on campus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. The protesters described Syracuse as an \"institution that lets perpetrators walk free while survivors, activists, and our families must bear the injustice silently.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges that \"[o]n information and belief, Syracuse was aware of OCR investigations of other schools and took actions to either [avoid] OCR scrutiny or to make sure that it had a record of aggressive enforcement to show OCR.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. The Chancellor admitted that the University had \"engaged in 'aggressive efforts to crack down on campus sexual assaults.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. In an email sent to the campus community after the current presidential administration rescinded the \"Dear Colleague\" letter, Chancellor Syverud \" 're-emphasized' \" that the University continues to be committed to fighting sexual assault and \" 'exceeding' \" the legal requirements that have been the subject of national debate on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Syracuse has been the subject of at least two investigations by OCR into the school's responses to allegations of sexual assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. On June 22, 2016, OCR notified Syracuse that it was investigating an allegation that Syracuse failed to respond \"promptly and equitably\" to a \"report of sexual assault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25(a). In connection with this investigation, OCR requested a significant amount of data and information from Syracuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On January 17, 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   OCR notified Syracuse that it was investigating a second allegation that Syracuse failed to respond \"promptly and equitably\" to a \"report of sexual assault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25(b). Plaintiff alleges that the graduate student \"at the center of the second OCR investigation\" withdrew that complaint and OCR closed the investigation in February 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25(b)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   OCR officials scheduled a visit at Syracuse on January 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. According to news reports, University officials attempted to emphasize actions they had taken to appease OCR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During that January 2017 visit, federal officials hosted two meetings for students, faculty and staff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. OCR attorneys asked students and faculty general questions about how they viewed Syracuse's response to allegations of sexual assault and discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges, on information and belief, that Syracuse provided OCR with information about the investigation and adjudication of sexual misconduct claims against John Noakes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. The University provided this information \"in response to inquiries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. The Syracuse Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the relationship between John Noakes and Syracuse is governed\n   by the Student Conduct System Handbook.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. Plaintiff also contends that the Student Conduct System Handbook is a contract between students and the school and between John Doakes and Syracuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29(a). The Syracuse Student Conduct System Handbook, attached to the Complaint as Exhibit A, contains a section entitled \"Syracuse University Policy On Sexual Assault, Sexual Harassment, Stalking Or Relationship Violence (the \"Sexual Misconduct Policy.\").\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. The Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibits, among other conduct, sexual assault and relationship violence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31(a). This section provides that students who violate the Sexual Misconduct Policy will be disciplined under the University's Code of Conduct whether or not a criminal prosecution occurs, and that violations of this policy may result in counseling, educational sanctions, disciplinary probation, suspension, expulsion, and referral to the proper law enforcement authorities for prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31(b-c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Sexual Misconduct Policy contains a section referred to as the \"Bill of Rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. Syracuse students have the right to \"participate in a process that is fair, impartial, and provides adequate notice and meaningful opportunity to be heard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32(a). Students have a right to appeal and a right \"to 'be accompanied by an advisor of choice who may assist and advise a reporting individual, accused or respondent throughout the judicial or conduct process including during all meetings and hearings related to such process.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32(b-c). Students may not be represented by an attorney unless they also face criminal or civil proceedings related to the incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32(c)(i). Plaintiff further alleges that Syracuse employs \"a biased, 'victim centered' approached aimed at always believing and supporting the victim without regard to results of any investigation or adjudicatory process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32(d). Plaintiff contends that, under the written policy, alleged victims are guaranteed \"[t]he right to 'be treated with dignity and to receive from the institution courteous, fair and respectful health care and counseling services where available.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32(d)(i). Alleged victims also have a right \"to be 'free from any suggestion that the reporting individual is at fault when their crimes and violations are committed, or should have acted in a different manner to avoid such crimes or violations.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32(d)(ii). Such persons also enjoy a \"right to 'describe the incident to as few institutional representatives as possible' \" and protection from \" 'retaliation by the institution, any student, the accused or respondent and/or their friends, family and acquaintances within the jurisdiction of the institution.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32(d)(iii-iv). Plaintiff alleges that adopting such \"victim-centered\" approaches have caused \"erroneous and unfair outcomes in the investigation and adjudication of claims of sexual misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. Indeed, Syracuse's web page addresses Title IX matters, but lists no rights for the accused.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Process for Investigation and Review of Sexual Misconduct Complaints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Also attached to the Complaint are portions of the Student Conduct System Handbook the provide the procedures Syracuse follows upon receipt of an allegation of sexual misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh.

The Syracuse Police detective who used a photo array to obtain Plaintiff's identification also failed to testify.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73(b).

Plaintiff denied he ever saw Jane Roe on that night.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73(d)(ii).

The written decision the Board issued made a number of indings of fact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75.

Both students were intoxicated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75(a)(3). Someone Roe did not know assaulted her when she left the bar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75(a)(4). Jane Roe saw Plaintiff in the bar in January 2016 and identified him as her attacker on October 25, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75(a)(5). She also identified a photograph of him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75(a)(6).

Despite never hearing testimony from Roe, the Board found her testimony \"mostly credible\" and supported by the testimony of another student.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75(b). The Board concluded that Plaintiff \" 'lacked credibility' \" in part because of inconsistencies between his story and those told by \"Student 3\" and \"Student 4.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Syracuse found him responsible for the attack \"based on a flawed identification by Jane Roe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76. Moreover, Plaintiff contends, \"numerous errors,\" caused the identification to be the result of an unfair, subjective and suggestive process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff points to a number of alleged flaws in the identification process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   First, he argues, Syracuse police employed a \"false and unreliable\" photo identification method.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76(a). Police provided the photos for the array \"\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Jane Roe identified\" Plaintiff \"as a suspect on the street.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The photo array failed because Jane Roe simply picked out a picture of the person she had recently seen and accused, a procedure courts have found flawed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76(a)(i-ii). Moreover, recent research calls into doubt the general reliability of eyewitness identifications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76(b). The Board, Plaintiff claims, also failed to take into account the \"Cross-Race Effect,\" which notes the tendency of people of one race to mistakenly identify a person of another race.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76(c). Finally, Plaintiff complains that the Board believed Jane Roe's allegations, even though they had never heard testimony from her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff appealed the Conduct Board's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77.

For example, a complaint may allege particular evidentiary weaknesses behind the finding of an offense such as a motive to lie on the part of a complainant or witnesses, particularized strengths of the defense, or\n   other reason to doubt the veracity of the charge. A complaint may also allege particular procedural flaws affecting the proof. However, allegations of a procedurally or otherwise flawed proceeding that has led to an adverse and erroneous outcome combined with a conclusory allegation of gender discrimination is not sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. The fatal gap is, again, the lack of a particularized allegation relating to a causal connection between the flawed outcome and gender bias. A plaintiff must thus also allege particular circumstances suggesting that gender bias was a motivating factor behind the erroneous finding. Allegations of a causal connection in the case of university disciplinary cases can be of the kind that are found in the familiar setting of Title VII cases. Such allegations might include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , statements by members of the disciplinary tribunal, statements by pertinent university officials, or patterns of decision-making that also tend to show the influence of gender.

As \"[c]ircumstances giving rise to a plausible inference of racially discriminatory intent,\" Plaintiff points to: the investigator's alleged \"assumption\" of his guilt \"before conducting any investigation\"; the credibility assigned to Jane Roe's account as opposed to Plaintiff's, when Jane Roe was white and Plaintiff black; and \"[t]he investigator and hearing panel accept[ing] an inherently unreliable identification and fail[ing] to take into account the bias inherent in cross-race identification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 103.

Plaintiff has not alleged that any Syracuse official or investigator made any comment about his race, and Plaintiff has not pointed to any conduct by any official that indicated that race was a substantial motivating factor in the decision to discipline him for the alleged assault. His claims that Plaintiff found Roe credible instead of him because of his race, unlike his geder-discrimination claims, are merely conclusory. His allegations that Syracuse has disciplined black students more frequently than white students for sexual assault are also conclusory, which Plaintiff admits. Though he has alleged that Roe's identification of him may have been a result of systemic cultural biases that produce false identifications when the identification involves a person whose race is different than the accuser's, Plaintiff does not offer more than a conclusory allegation that Syracuse accepted this flawed identification because Plaintiff is black.
