HAMILTON, United States District Judge\n  On December 7, 2018, plaintiffs Vladi Zakinov and David Oconer moved to remand this action to the San Mateo County Superior Court. On the same day, in a separately filed motion, plaintiff Avner Greenwald also moved to remand this action to the San Mateo County Superior Court. Those motions came on for hearing before this court on February 13, 2019. Plaintiffs Zakinov and Oconer appeared through their counsel, Stephen Oddo and Brian O'Mara. Plaintiff Greenwald appeared through his counsel, Tom Laughlin. Defendants Ripple Labs, Inc. (\"Ripple\"), XRP II, LLC, a subsidiary of Ripple, and various individual defendants\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  appeared through their counsel, Peter Morrison. Having read the papers filed by the parties and carefully considered their arguments and the relevant legal authority, and good cause appearing, the court hereby DENIES plaintiffs' motions, for the following reasons.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The individual defendants are executives or directors of Ripple: Bradley Garlinghouse, Christian Larsen, Ron Will, Antoinette O'Gorman, Eric Van Miltenburg, Susan Athey, Zoe Cruz, Ken Kurson, Ben Lawsky, Anja Manuel, and Takashi Okita.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is the third action premised on the same theory of liability that this court has considered.

While those two paragraphs\n   set out procedures for bringing related cases to the San Mateo County Superior Court's attention, they do not suggest that future complaints consolidated with\n   <em>\n    In re Ripple\n   </em>\n   would be extinguished.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Consol.
