Protradenet, LLC et al\n   </em>\n   (\"Member Case\") ), and Predictive Profiles, Inc.'s First Amended Complaint, (ECF No. 2 in Member Case). The Court has also considered all responses and replies to the Motion to Dismiss. After careful consideration, the Court is of the opinion that the Motion should be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This suit arises out of a Distributor Vendor Relations Agreement (\"Agreement\") between ProTradeNet, LLC (\"ProTradeNet\") and Predictive Profiles, Inc. (\"Predictive\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both sides agree the Agreement was formalized in February of 2017. Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 2 in Member Case; Defs.' Mot.

Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 2 in Member Case; Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 2, ECF No. 4 in Member Case. In return, ProTradeNet agreed to recommend Predictive to its franchisors' franchisees and encourage those franchisees to use Predictive's services. Pl.'s Am.

Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-41, 55, ECF No. 2 in Member Case. Plaintiff also alleges that ProTradeNet specifically told franchise owners to stop using Predictive and that Dwyer pushed ProTradeNet to unilaterally terminate the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40-42, 58-61, 70-73. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Dwyer and ProTradeNet interfered with the prospective contracts Plaintiff had a reasonable probability of entering into with other franchisees in Dwyer's system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the dispute over the Agreement arose, ProTradeNet filed its Original Petition in state court on January 12, 2018. Notice Removal at 1, ECF No. 1 in Lead Case. ProTradeNet sought a declaratory judgment from the court declaring that the Agreement did not create a partnership relationship between it and Predictive. Pl.'s Pet. at 3, ECF No. 1-1 in Lead Case. Predictive removed the case to this Court on February 9, 2018. Notice Removal, ECF No. 1 in Lead Case. The same day Predictive removed the case, Predictive filed its Original Complaint in the Member Case seeking affirmative relief against Defendants. Pl.'s Am. Compl., ECF No. 1 in Member Case. On April 24, 2018, Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss. Defs.' Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 4 in Member Case. On August 23, 2018, Magistrate Judge Manske ordered that the Member Case and the Lead Case be consolidated and that the current case becomes the Lead Case. Order at 5, ECF No. 20 in Lead Case.

As discussed above, the vast weight of the authority supports the rule that, as a matter of law, a parent company cannot tortiously interfere with its subsidiary's contracts. The amount of authority alone is enough for this Court to dismiss Plaintiff's tortious interference claim against Dwyer. However, even if this Court were to analyze Plaintiff's allegations under the\n   <em>\n    Valores\n   </em>\n   rule, Plaintiff's claim still fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Valores\n   </em>\n   , the court stated that a parent company is privileged to interfere with its subsidiary's contractual relations (1) when the contract threatens a present economic interest of its wholly-owned subsidiary and (2) the parent does not employ wrongful means or act with an improper purpose.\n   <em>\n    Valores\n   </em>\n   , 945 S.W.2d at 168.

Thus, Plaintiff's claim of improper purpose arises from its allegation that \"[m]embers of Dwyer's board have a connection with Career Plug which strongly suggests the motive for interference was for those individuals' personal gain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff fails to plead any factual enhancement to these allegations.

If this\n   <em>\n    allegation\n   </em>\n   proves true, Dwyer acted improperly by interfering with ProTradeNet's contract with Predictive and that interference was not privileged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Pl.'s Mem.
