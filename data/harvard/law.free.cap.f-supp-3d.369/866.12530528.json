ELLIS, United States District Judge\n   Similar to the CW television series \"Riverdale,\" this case alleges intrigue, political subterfuge, and the darkness lurking just under the surface of a seemingly picture perfect small town. After the Village of Riverdale (the \"Village\") passed Ordinance Number 2017-22 (the \"Ordinance\") granting Riverdale Materials, LLC (\"Riverdale Materials\") a special use permit to operate a waste collection business in Riverdale, Illinois, Tri-State Disposal, Inc. (\"Tri-State\") filed this lawsuit against the Village and its Mayor, Lawrence L. Jackson. Tri-State brings claims against the Village for violation of procedural and substantive due process (Counts I and II) and equal protection (Count III), and breach of contract (Count VII). It also seeks judicial review of the Ordinance (Count IV). Finally, Tri-State contends that the Village and Jackson engaged in political retaliation in violation of the First Amendment (Counts V and VI). Defendants move to dismiss the first amended complaint under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of standing and Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Court concludes that Tri-State has standing to pursue its claims but dismisses the due process claims for failure to allege a deprivation of a protected property interest and the equal protection claim because the first amended complaint and exhibits reveal a conceivable rational basis for the Village's actions. Tri-State also cannot pursue common law\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   review of the Ordinance, where the zoning decision involves a legislative, not administrative, action. But the Court concludes that Tri-State has sufficiently stated its political retaliation and breach of contract claims, which may proceed to discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Tri-State operates a solid waste, construction, and demolition transfer station in Riverdale, having provided waste services for the Village since 2002. In 2012, Tri-State and the Village entered into a written contract for waste services in Riverdale. The contract requires, among other things: Tri-State to pick up trash from Village residents, Tri-State to conduct a spring clean-up, and the Village to pay Tri-State's invoices within fifteen days. Additionally, pursuant to a settlement agreement entered in 2002 between the parties, Tri-State agreed to post a $ 50,000 bond for the benefit of the Village as security for its site and to pay royalties to the\n   Village. The contract and settlement agreement are currently still in effect. The contract has an end date of July 31, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Initially, Tri-State supported Jackson's administration. In the summer of 2017, it came to light that a competing disposal business, Riverdale Materials, sought to establish itself in Riverdale with Jackson's support. Riverdale Materials applied for a special land use ordinance to operate a solid waste transfer station, construction demolition station, dirt transfer station, and stone processing facility on its property in Riverdale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jackson assured Tri-State that Riverdale Materials would have to post the same security and pay the same royalties outlined in the original contract and settlement agreement between Tri-State and the Village to operate in Riverdale. At some point, Tri-State learned that the Village did not plan to require Riverdale Materials to comply with these conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Tri-State's facility is less than one mile from Riverdale Materials' site. Riverdale Materials' property sits on a former landfill that the courts shut down in 1962 because of the environmental condition of the property. The property remains unremediated. In its application for the special use ordinance, Riverdale Materials represented it would use an on-site retention pond for drainage and storm water control. But this pond is not located on its property nor does Riverdale Materials have the right to use it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Village ordinance requires a hearing and recommendation from the Village Plan Commission for conditional use applications. Because the Village does not have a Plan Commission, the notices for hearing regarding Riverdale Materials' special use application indicated that the Zoning Board of Appeals (the \"Zoning Board\") would hold the hearings sitting as the Plan Commission. No documents or records identify that the Zoning Board had authority to act as the Plan Commission. The Zoning Board held hearings to consider Riverdale Materials' application on September 7, 2017, and November 2, 2017. Tri-State appeared at these Zoning Board hearings and submitted documents in opposition to the conditional use. It criticized the hearing process and the environmental impact of Riverdale Materials' proposed facility, raising concerns about hazardous waste, contamination at the site, storm water runoff and drainage, and the apparent special treatment Riverdale Materials was receiving from the Village. At the hearings, Riverdale Materials misrepresented the environmental condition of its property, its drainage plans, and its receipt of all necessary permits to operate the site. Members of the public testified in opposition to the proposed conditional use, raising concerns that the proposed facility would endanger public health and cause property values to decline, that Riverdale Materials' facility did not have adequate drainage, that Riverdale did not need another transfer station, and that Riverdale Materials was already operating without permits and illegally dumping at the site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the Zoning Board heard substantive testimony, Jackson fired its chairperson, who had expressed some reservations about the application, and appointed new members with political connections to Jackson. Despite objection from Tri-State and other members of the public, one of the Village attorneys acted as the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   chair of the hearings without authority to do so. On November 2, 2017, the Zoning\n   Board voted four to two to recommend that the Village Board grant the conditional use. The Village Board then took up Riverdale Materials' application on November 28, 2017. At that meeting, the Village Board unanimously passed the Ordinance, allowing Riverdale Materials to operate. The Village Board did not take public comment on the application prior to voting and refused to accept written materials, including from Tri-State, for the record. Jackson strongly supported the application, with a sign at the Riverdale Materials site indicating it was another business Jackson brought to Riverdale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early 2018, Tri-State sought to schedule the spring clean-up for that year in accordance with its agreement with the Village. The Village did not respond to Tri-State's numerous attempts to schedule this event and instead advertised a May 5 cleanup conducted by Flood Brothers, another waste contractor. On February 23, 2018, Tri-State filed this lawsuit. Subsequently, at a March 27, 2018, Village Board meeting, the Village Board passed a motion directing the Chief of Staff to provide notice to Tri-State declining all potential extensions provided in the 2012 agreement with Tri-State and informing Tri-State that the agreement would therefore expire on July 19, 2019. On April 25, 2018, Jackson sent Tri-State a letter in which he complained that Tri-State representatives had harassed him and his staff and requested that Tri-State cease all communications by phone with the Village. The Village also refused to pay Tri-State's invoices from January through April 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) challenges the Court's subject matter jurisdiction.

For the political retaliation claim, Tri-State alleges it spoke out on a matter of public concern and that, in response, Defendants have declined to further contract with Tri-State for waste disposal, refused to cooperate with Tri-State to allow it to meet its contractual obligations, falsely stated that Tri-State has harassed Jackson and the Village staff, and refused to pay invoices as required. Similarly, with respect to breach\n   of contract, Tri-State claims injury because the Village has not complied with its contractual obligations and has acted to prevent Tri-State from meeting some of its own obligations. Although Defendants seize on merits arguments to negate the existence of injury with respect to these claims, the Court does not consider the merits in determining whether Tri-State has standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arreola v.

Instead, because Tri-State has alleged individualized harm it claims to have suffered because of Defendants' alleged acts of political retaliation and refusal to cooperate with it in carrying out the parties' contract, Tri-State has established an injury in fact for these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The remaining claims, which challenge the Village's adoption of the Ordinance, require closer scrutiny. Tri-State alleges that the Ordinance indirectly affects its rights because it places Tri-State at an economic disadvantage. A generalized grievance about the Village's failure to comply with statutory or constitutional obligations, without any corresponding individualized injury to Tri-State, would not suffice to establish standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foster v.

The Village argues that Tri-State has not sufficiently alleged facts to demonstrate that the Village passed the Ordinance without these conditions because of animus and without a rational basis for the action. The first amended complaint, along with the exhibits attached to it and Tri-State's response, provide at least one conceivable rational basis for the difference in treatment. Specifically, Tri-State agreed to the bond and royalties as part of a settlement of litigation between the parties over whether Tri-State had the appropriate authorizations to conduct its operations in Riverdale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 31-4. The inclusion of these terms as part of a settlement agreement suggests that nothing in the Village ordinance or state or federal law requires the imposition of such conditions on any potential waste management operator in Riverdale. And Tri-State provides nothing\n   to dispel the inference that the different treatment resulted from the negotiation of contractual terms surrounding the operation of the facilities and the Village's specific concern, at the time, with Tri-State's compliance with all permit requirements. Indeed, Tri-State has not alleged any differences in the zoning treatment of the two operations, perhaps because zoning decisions typically satisfy the rational basis requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Discovery House, Inc. v.

Instead, Tri-State must allege (1) an express policy that, when enforced, causes a constitutional deprivation; (2) a widespread practice that, although not authorized by written law or express policy, is so permanent and well-settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law; or (3) a constitutional injury caused by a person with final policymaking authority.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274046\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/729/#p737\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Tri-State argues that it has adequately alleged a widespread practice and that its injury was caused by a person with final policymaking authority, Jackson.

Tri-State did, indeed, make arguments about how the Village did not need another recycling transfer station so close to the existing one Tri-State operates. But it also highlighted concerns about the potential environmental and safety issues posed by establishing a waste management facility at the proposed site, submitting documentation to support these concerns. Tri-State also raised issues of how the Riverdale Materials site may pose financial problems for the Village and its residents. These allegations amount to more than mere criticism of the Zoning Board or Village Board before they took action to approve the ordinance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Umbehr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730211\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/668/#p679\">\n    518 U.S. at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730211\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/668/#p679\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that alleging retaliation motivated by speech on a matter of public concern as an independent contractor requires plaintiff \"to prove more than the mere fact that he criticized the Board members before they terminated him\").

Although the Village's interests in contracting\n   or evidence that it would have terminated the contract regardless of Tri-State's speech may serve as a valid defense to Tri-State's claim, Tri-State need not anticipate that defense in its pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Umbehr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730211\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/668/#p679\">\n    518 U.S. at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730211\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/668/#p679\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the county may have a defense if it can show that it \"would have terminated the contract regardless of [plaintiff's] speech\" or that \"the County's legitimate interests as contractor, deferentially viewed, outweigh the free speech interests at stake\");\n   <em>\n    Peele v.

At this stage, Tri-State need only allege that the speech served as a motivating factor for Defendants' actions, which in this case encompasses not only the notification of non-renewal but also the failure to pay invoices on time and cooperate with Tri-State in scheduling the spring clean-up. Tri-State has included allegations that these actions came soon after Tri-State's speech and contrasted with Tri-State's previous interactions with Defendants. This suffices, at this stage, to plead a First Amendment retaliation claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCarragher v.

Although legislative immunity may protect Jackson from any actions surrounding the adoption of the Ordinance, Tri-State's political retaliation claim does not allege that Jackson and the Village adopted the Ordinance in retaliation for its speech. Although Tri-State's speech concerned a legislative action, Jackson's alleged retaliatory acts-terminating Tri-State's contract, instructing Tri-State not to communicate with the Village except in writing, failing to cooperate with Tri-State to set up the spring clean-up, and failing to pay invoices pursuant to the parties' contract-do not. Nothing in the first amended complaint suggests that legislative immunity covers these later actions. Therefore, the Court cannot dismiss the political retaliation claims against Jackson based on immunity and allows them to proceed against both Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Breach of Contract Claim (Count VII)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, the Village challenges Tri-State's breach of contract claim, arguing that Tri-State has not sufficiently pleaded the elements of this claim and that Tri-State did not attach a copy of the contract as required by Illinois law. Initially, the Village's argument that Tri-State must have attached the contract to the complaint misstates federal law. Although Illinois procedure requires the plaintiff to attach the contract on which it bases its\n   breach of contract claim to the complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-606, this procedural requirement does not apply to cases in federal court,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hales v.

Even if this requirement applied, Tri-State remedied the issue by attaching the relevant contract to its response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Next, under Illinois law, a breach of contract claim consists of four elements: (1) the existence of a contract, (2) performance by the plaintiff, (3) breach by the defendant, and (4) injury to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Gallagher Corp. v.

The Village claims that Tri-State has not sufficiently pleaded facts to establish that it breached the contract or that Tri-State suffered damages. But this ignores the allegations of the first amended complaint, in which Tri-State pleads that the Village has breached the contract by failing to pay certain invoices as required by the contract and did not cooperate with Tri-State to organize the spring clean-up. Tri-State also pleads injury, claiming that the Village has not paid Tri-State as required and hired another waste management company to conduct the spring clean-up, despite that being a requirement of Tri-State's contract with the Village. Although the Village may ultimately establish that no breach occurred or that Tri-State did not incur any damages because of the alleged breaches, at this stage, Tri-State has sufficiently placed the Village on notice of its breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' motion to dismiss [25].
