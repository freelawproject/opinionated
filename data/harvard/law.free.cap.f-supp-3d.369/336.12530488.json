Mercado testified in her deposition under oath that, notwithstanding the content of the written notice of final determination, Garc\u00eda and Ayerdi \"told her that [she] could not continue working from that day on because [her] request had been denied because of the issue of the pounds; and that [she] had to apply for a position through wire and ... go through the whole application process again as a new employee with interviews and everything.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on that, \"she believed to be terminated from her job on August 10, 2015.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 47\n   </strong>\n   at 6.

In support of her request for reconsideration, Mercado submitted a medical certificate by Dr. S\u00e1nchez dated September 11, 2015.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 39-1\n   </strong>\n   at 10-11,\n   <strong>\n    39-31\n   </strong>\n   . In that certificate, Dr. S\u00e1nchez reiterated Mercado's need for periods of rest of ten to fifteen minutes after standing and sitting for two hours, and stated that Mercado could work regular, ten-hour shifts.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 39-31\n   </strong>\n   . He also stated that Mercado \"can carry or push objects under her job description.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The job description to which Dr. S\u00e1nchez referred was one provided to him by\n   Mercado that includes contradictory information about the lifting requirement, since it states both a ten-pound and a twenty-five-pound minimum lifting capability.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 39-6\n   </strong>\n   at 131-133. The record is unclear as to how Mercado obtained that job description. She alleges to have received it from Garc\u00eda, who in turn denied in her deposition of having given Mercado any job description.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 39-6\n   </strong>\n   at 131-134;\n   <strong>\n    39-8\n   </strong>\n   at 107. Nonetheless, it is uncontested that the job description that Mercado gave to Dr. S\u00e1nchez was for the position of Wholesale Trading Manager, not Mercado's Assistant Manager position, which no longer existed.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 39-1\n   </strong>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As summarized above, the job description for the Assistant Manager position proffered by the company states that the ability to lift up to twenty-five pounds is required in order to be able to perform the job's essential duties.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 39-1\n   </strong>\n   at 5-6;\n   <strong>\n    43-9\n   </strong>\n   . Even though it was Walmart's custom and practice to provide a new employee with a copy of his/her job description, the record is not clear as to whether Mercado received a copy of the Assistant Manager job description when she started working at Sam's Club.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 39-1\n   </strong>\n   at 131-137;\n   <strong>\n    52\n   </strong>\n   at 1.

On the other hand, Walmart did not produce any document or evidence of Mercado acknowledging receipt of such document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In any event, her main factual contention in this case is that irrespective of what is stated in the Assistant Manager job description proffered by Walmart, while performing as Assistant Manager at Sam's Club, she never had to lift objects heavier than ten pounds, and as such, said requirement is not necessary to perform the essential duties of the job.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 220-221, 225-226. Mercado further asserts that if she needed help lifting objects, she could ask for help from the Associates who worked under her supervision, who also had within their job description the task of lifting objects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 220-221. Mercado proffered not only her own testimony in support of that contention, but also that of Assistant Manager Juan Carlos Torres (\"Torres\").\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 39-20\n   </strong>\n   at 57;\n   <strong>\n    46\n   </strong>\n   at 20-22;\n   <strong>\n    47\n   </strong>\n   at 3-4.

As summarized above, Walmart contends that the ability to lift up to twenty-five pounds without assistance is required to perform essential functions of the Assistant Manager position, as evidenced by the job description proffered by the company and as testified by some company managers. As such, Walmart asserts that allowing Mercado to return to her position without being able to lift twenty-five pounds or more on her own is tantamount to exempting her from having to perform essential duties of the job that require such physical capability. That, in turn, would not constitute reasonable accommodation under ADA standards, according to Walmart.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 41\n   </strong>\n   at 7-11, 20-28;\n   <strong>\n    52\n   </strong>\n   at 7-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   However, Mercado testified in her deposition that she never had to lift in excess of ten pounds in her years as an Assistant Manager, for which the requirement in question is not essential to the job. She further contends that irrespective of the lifting requirement contained in the Assistant Manager's job description proffered by the company, Assistant Managers at Sam's Club are able to ask Associates for help in lifting objects as needed, and that her averment in that respect is supported by Torres's deposition testimony. Thus, Mercado deems that Walmart unreasonably denied her request for reinstatement as Assistant Manager with a ten-pound lifting restriction, in violation of the ADA.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 46\n   </strong>\n   at 17-24;\n   <strong>\n    55\n   </strong>\n   at 2-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In short, the question of whether Mercado's reinstatement in her job as Assistant Manager with a ten-pound lifting restriction constitutes reasonable accommodation under the ADA is not one that is apt for summary disposition under Rule 56. The underlying questions of material facts call for credibility determinations and weighing of evidence, thus warranting a jury trial.

While it is uncontested that the job description for the Assistant Manager position included the ability to lift in up to twenty-five pounds without assistance as an essential requirement, there is a factual controversy as to whether that was an essential requirement in practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Walmart's Offers of Job Reassignment as Reasonable Accommodation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Walmart avers that there was no reasonable accommodation that could have enabled\n   Mercado to lift up to 25 pounds without assistance.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 41\n   </strong>\n   at 7-11;\n   <strong>\n    51\n   </strong>\n   at 7-9. Thus, it offered her reassignment to other positions as alternative reasonable accommodation after it denied her request for reinstatement to the Assistant Manager position with the ten-pound lifting restriction indicated by her treating physician.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 41\n   </strong>\n   at 20-28;\n   <strong>\n    51\n   </strong>\n   at 7-9. Specifically, Walmart offered her part-time positions as Greeter and Phone Attendant, but Mercado did not respond Walmart's follow-up multiple letters over several months about the job offers and the pending updated medical information about her lifting restriction and its prognosis. According to Walmart, its offering of reinstatement in other positions as alternative reasonable accommodation and Mercado's breakdown of the interactive process preclude any liability against it as a matter of fact and law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   It is uncontested that Mercado communicated with Walmart for the last time during her employment on April 11, 2016, when she submitted her second reasonable-accommodation request packet. Moreover, it was not until December 16, 2016, two weeks after her dismissal, when Mercado informed Walmart that she had not responded to the job offers because the positions were \"part-time and the pay per hour is much lower than what [she] was receiving [as Assistant Manager].\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 43-46\n   </strong>\n   at 1. Furthermore, around April or May 2016, Mercado had applied to the position of Home Merchandise Assistant Manager. However, the record is not clear as to whether that position was equivalent to her Assistant Manager job, and whether she was qualified for it. Additionally, the company's reasons for disqualifying Mercado for that position are not clear, either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In light of the above, the Court finds that Walmart engaged in an interactive process with Mercado to find alternative positions for her. However, if the ability to lift up to twenty-five pounds without assistance was not an essential requirement of the Assistant Manager position in practice, Mercado could have been reinstated in the Assistant Manager position with her ten-pound lifting restriction.

According to the company, it was Mercado who willfully cut off the interactive process, which in turn left Walmart with no choice but to conclude that she was not interested in returning to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Conversely, according to Mercado, she was dismissed under the pretext that she could not perform the essential duties of her job as Assistant Manager because of her ten-pound lifting restriction, even though it was common practice at Sam's Club to ask and obtain help from colleagues to lift objects when they were unable to do so on their own.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 46\n   </strong>\n   at 17-27;\n   <strong>\n    47\n   </strong>\n   ;\n   <strong>\n    55\n   </strong>\n   . In that respect, she contends that her dismissal resulted from her request of reinstatement as Assistant Manager with the lifting restriction as reasonable accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In short, the Court holds that issues of material fact preclude summary disposition as to Mercado's claim of discriminatory and retaliatory discharge, for which summary judgment is hereby DENIED as to that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

It defines just cause for dismissal, and provides a severance-payment remedy for those employees who can establish that they were wrongfully dismissed pursuant to that statute. In the instant case, the Court denies defendant's summary judgment motion regarding plaintiff's claim of disability-based discrimination and retaliation under the ADA as to Mercado's dismissal. Therefore, Walmart's motion for summary judgment is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as well regarding plaintiff's similar claim of unjust dismissal under Law 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
