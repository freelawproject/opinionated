Plaintiff, Genuine Enabling Technology, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, brought this action in this district, asserting patent infringement claims against two defendants-Nintendo Co., Ltd, a Japanese company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Nintendo of America, Inc., which is incorporated in the State of Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Nintendo of America contends that venue in this district is improper under the patent venue statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and moves for dismissal or, alternatively, transfer of the entire case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. Plaintiff responds that Nintendo of America waived its ability to challenge venue in this district by registering to do business in Delaware and by designating an agent to receive service of process here. For the reasons that follow, I will grant Nintendo of America's Motion, and transfer this case, in its entirety, to the Western District of Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that it is the owner of a patent that claims a method of data encoding and synchronization. In its Complaint for Patent Infringement, filed in this district on February 8, 2017, Plaintiff asserts infringement claims against Defendants, Nintendo Co., Ltd. (hereinafter \"Nintendo (Japan)\"), and its wholly owned subsidiary, Nintendo of America, Inc. (hereinafter \"Nintendo of America\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendants market and sell video game consoles and controllers that infringe Plaintiff's patent. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8, 19-20, 21-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As noted above, Plaintiff is a Delaware limited liability company. Nintendo (Japan) is a Japanese company. Nintendo of America is incorporated in the State of Washington,\n   but is registered to do business in Delaware and has appointed an agent to receive service of process here. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Nintendo (Japan) filed an answer, raising improper venue as an affirmative defense. Nintendo of America, however, filed the instant Motion to Dismiss or Transfer, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its Motion, Nintendo of America argues that, under the patent venue statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), venue is improper in this district, because it is neither incorporated in Delaware nor has a regular and established place of business here. Plaintiff initially responds that Nintendo of America: (1)\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   have a regular and established place of business in Delaware; and (2) waived its ability to challenge venue in this district by registering to do business in Delaware and by designating an agent for service of process in this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While the Motion was pending, Plaintiff informed the Court that, in light of a subsequent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, it would no longer argue that Nintendo of America has a regular and established place of business in Delaware, or seek jurisdictional discovery on that issue. Rather, Plaintiff would rest its opposition to the Motion solely on its argument that Nintendo of America waived its ability to challenge venue in this district. (Pl.'s 10/25/2017 Ltr., Doc. No. 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For the reasons set out below, I conclude that Nintendo of America has not waived its ability to challenge venue in this district. Accordingly, I will grant the Motion and transfer the entire case to the Western District of Washington, where venue is proper as to both Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When a plaintiff files a suit in an improper forum, \"district courts are required either to dismiss or transfer to a proper forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Lafferty v.

The Court concluded that a corporation resides only in its state of incorporation, rejecting an interpretation of \u00a7 1400(b) that would have imported the broader definition of the term found in the general venue statute, \u00a7 1391.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604310\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1514/#p1518\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, under \u00a7 1400(b), as interpreted in\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   , venue as to a domestic corporation that is a defendant in a patent infringement action is proper only: (1) in a district within the corporate defendant's state of incorporation, or (2) in a district where the corporate defendant has a regular and established place of business and has committed acts of infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As Plaintiff now concedes, Nintendo of America meets neither of these conditions, such that venue is appropriate in this district. Nintendo of America is incorporated in Washington, not Delaware, and does not have a regular and established place of business in this district. Accordingly, under \u00a7 1400(b), venue is not proper in this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Nevertheless, Plaintiff contends that a corporate defendant may waive its ability to challenge improper venue under \u00a7 1400(b), and that Nintendo of America has done so by registering to do business in Delaware and by appointing an agent for service of process in this state. In advancing this argument, Plaintiff cites a line of cases beginning with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Neirbo Company v.

But as with the Clayton Act provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    Sunbury\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff fails to appreciate Congress's diametrically opposed purposes in enacting the derivative action venue statute and the patent venue statute.

The following passage from\n   <em>\n    Crosley\n   </em>\n   is telling on this point:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The fact that declaratory judgment suits can only be brought in the home district of a patent owner\n   <em>\n    or, in the case of a corporate owner, in those foreign states only in which it has made arrangements to be served with process [i.e., where the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Neirbo\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    rule applies]\n   </em>\n   , clearly negatives the [patent holder's] assertion that the venue of such suits is\n   <em>\n    very much wider\n   </em>\n   than that permitted to patent infringement suits by [the patent venue statute] under which, as we have seen, the latter suits may be brought not only in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant but also in any other district in which the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular place of business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1154304\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/130/474/#p476\">\n    130 F.2d at 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). By noting that the\n   <em>\n    Neirbo\n   </em>\n   rule does not render the scope of permissible venues for a patent declaratory judgment suit \"very much wider than that permitted to patent infringement suits by [the patent venue statute],\" the court suggests that the\n   <em>\n    Neirbo\n   </em>\n   rule does not apply to the latter, only to the former.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1154304\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/130/474/#p476\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Crosley\n   </em>\n   does not support Plaintiff's position that the\n   <em>\n    Neirbo\n   </em>\n   rule applies in patent infringement actions, and, in fact, suggests the opposite conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, the Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the patent venue statute as \"the exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement proceedings,\" and has rejected interpretations of that statute that would expand its scope and thereby undermine its purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland LLC\n   </em>\n   , 137 at 1518.
