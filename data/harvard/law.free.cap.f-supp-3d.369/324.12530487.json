(\"Sandulli Grace\"), and John Becker, a lawyer for that firm and against Massachusetts Coalition of Police (\"MassCOP\") (collectively \"Defendants\"). She alleges that Sandulli Grace and Becker committed legal malpractice (Counts I and II), and that Sandulli Grace is vicariously liable for the malpractice of Becker (Count III). She also alleges violations of Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 93A, \u00a7 1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Count IV) against Sandulli Grace. In addition, she brings a claim for breach of contract against MassCOP (Count V). All claims are brought by an assignment from Uxbridge Massachusetts Coalition of Police, Local # 123 (\"Local\"). Defendants have moved to dismiss\n   pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the reasons stated below, both motions (Docket Nos.15 &amp; 20) are\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      denied\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are taken from Plaintiff's complaint (Docket No. 2) and assumed to be true for the purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 30, 2015, Plaintiff obtained a judgement against Local (\"the underlying litigation\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCrohan v. Uxbridge Police Association Local 123\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273774\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/253/385/\">\n    253 F.Supp.3d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. 2017). That litigation concerned the publication of a letter by Local in an effort to remove the Uxbridge Chief of Police from office. The letter contained false and defamatory statements about Plaintiff, who was an officer in the department. Local sought MassCOP's approval of the letter prior to its publication. MassCOP told Local to \"publish [the letter] if [they thought] it would work in removing the Chief from office.\" Local also attempted to contact Sandulli Grace regarding the letter, but Sandulli Grace did not respond. After the letter was published, McCrohan brought suit against Local, and Local requested that MassCOP defend and indemnify them, and MassCOP agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   John Becker, an attorney at Sandulli Grace, P.C. represented Local in the underlying litigation. MassCOP paid for Sandulli Grace's services and exercised control over Sandulli Grace throughout the underlying litigation. Neither Becker, Sandulli Grace, nor MassCOP informed Local of any conflicts resulting from Sandulli Grace's dual role as counsel for Local and MassCOP. Sandulli Grace did not inform Local of possible third-party contribution or indemnification claims until Local was unable to pursue them. After the verdict, Sandulli Grace filed an appeal on Local's behalf but, at MassCOP's direction, did not pursue it, and dismissed the appeal without consulting Local. In addition, when Local obtained new counsel, Sandulli Grace withheld relevant documents from Local's new attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Standard of Review\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A defendant may move to dismiss, based on the complaint, for a \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.

Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Sandulli Grace failed to properly advise Local of conflicts of interest caused by Sandulli Grace's dual representation of Local and MassCOP, did not inform Local of viable third-party claims, and withheld documents critical to prosecuting those third-party claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    <em>\n     a. Judicial Estoppel\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Sandulli Grace argues that Plaintiff's malpractice claims should be judicially estopped because they are inconsistent with her position in the underlying litigation. \"Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that precludes a party from asserting a position in one legal proceeding that is contrary to a position it had previously asserted in another proceeding.\"\n    <em>\n     Blanchette v.

Sandulli Grace argues that prevailing in the instant litigation requires Plaintiff to argue that Sandulli Grace \"should have presented the case differently or pursued an appeal,\" which is contrary to Plaintiff's success in the underlying litigation. (Docket No. 19, at 6).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    \"Because of its equitable nature, the circumstances under which judicial estoppel may appropriately be invoked are probably not reducible to any general formulation of principle.\"\n    <em>\n     Otis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276619\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/443/634/#p648\">\n     443 Mass. at 640\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=824%20N.E.2d%2023\">\n     824 N.E.2d 23\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). However, estoppel generally contains \"two fundamental ... elements: First, the position being asserted ... must be 'directly inconsistent,' meaning 'mutually exclusive' of, the position asserted in a prior proceeding ...

The second factor is clearly satisfied. Plaintiff prevailed in the underlying litigation by convincing the court to accept her prior position.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The first factor, however, is not met here. Plaintiff does not argue she should not have prevailed in the underlying litigation, or that Sandulli Grace should have argued the underlying litigation differently. Local's position, assigned to Plaintiff, is that the MassCOP was jointly and severally liable with Local for defaming Plaintiff, and that Sandulli Grace failed to adequately advise Local. (Docket No. 26, at 8). A finding that MassCOP was jointly and severally liable for that defamation is not contrary to the underlying judgment.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sandman v.

Third-Party Claims\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Under Massachusetts law, joint liability exists where \"two or more wrongdoers negligently contribute to the personal injury of another ... so that in effect the damages suffered are rendered inseparable\"\n    <em>\n     Feneff v.

Where joint liability exists, damages may either be shared amongst the joint tortfeasors through contribution, or one tortfeasor may indemnify the other for damages. Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 231B, \u00a7 1\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    provides for a right of contribution amongst joint tortfeasors. In addition, a right of indemnification can arise from (1) an express agreement, (2) a contractual\n    right implied by the nature of the relationship between the parties, or (3) \"a tort-based right ... where there is a great disparity in the fault of the parties.\"\n    <em>\n     Araujo v.

Plaintiff claims Sandulli Grace failed to advise Local of viable claims for contribution or indemnification from MassCOP. (Docket No. 2, at 42). Sandulli Grace asserts that Local had no viable contribution or indemnification claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <em>\n     i.

Mass. Gen.

While MassCOP is correct that Local never paid its pro rata share of the original judgment, it is plausible that Local had a viable contribution claim which they were prevented from pursuing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Conclusion\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    For the reasons stated above, Sandulli Grace's motion to dismiss (Docket No.15) is\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      <em>\n       denied\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    .

Mass. 2016) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff's allegations do not plausibly suggest a theory by which MassCOP would be directly liable to her. \"The elements of a defamation claim include (1) a false and defamatory communication (2) of and concerning the plaintiff which is (3) published or shown to a third party.\"\n     <em>\n      Dorn v.

Thus, the third prong of the defamation claim would not be met.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-72\">\n     Plaintiff argues that MassCOP's is liable because it ratified the letter prior to publication. Ratification is the \"confirmation and acceptance of a previous act, thereby making the act valid from the moment it was done.\"\n     <em>\n      Ratification\n     </em>\n     , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Ratification is primarily a concept of agency law, and frequently involves a principal authorizing an agent's independent action.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Dempsey v.

There is no allegation that Local was an agent of MassCOP. Under Plaintiff's theory, MassCOP ratified the letter by stating that Local could \"publish [the letter] if [they thought] it would work.\" (Docket No. 2, 14-15). The letter had not been published when MassCOP made this statement, so it is unclear what tort MassCOP would have ratified.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-73\">\n     Because Plaintiff has alleged a plausible theory of indemnification, I will not address whether it is plausible that a contractual right is implied by the nature of the relationship between the parties.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
