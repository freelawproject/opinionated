In tandem, the Court shall summarize the relevant proceedings in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed this suit on February 2, 2018, against a number of public entities and current or former officials in New Jersey, as well as a private attorney. Plaintiff's thirty-eight count Complaint pursues a variety of causes of action under federal and New Jersey law that allegedly \"arose from an attempt of Plaintiff to expose fraudulent documents that have been used on August 8, 2011, to steal Plaintiff's private property at: 51 Hillcrest Blvd, Warren, NJ.\" Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 3. The Complaint is not a model of clarity. As best the Court can discern, however, Plaintiff objects to an alleged series of actions purportedly stemming from his opposition to a real estate development called Sleepy Hollow in Warren, NJ.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5, 31-56.

Bohn, filed a motion to dismiss the claims against him. Although Defendant Bohn raised several grounds for dismissal, the Court determined that Rule 12(b)(3) was sufficient and granted his motion on August 21, 2018, due to improper venue. Mem. Op.,\n   <em>\n    Gage v.

When Defendants did not answer or otherwise respond to Plaintiff's purported service of the Complaint, Plaintiff requested entry of default, which the Clerk entered on March 19, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Thomas I. Gage's Proof of Service of Summons and Compl. to Defs., ECF No. 8; Aff. in Supp. of Default, ECF No. 10; Default, ECF Nos. 10, 11. Even before the Clerk entered that default, Plaintiff had moved for entry of default judgment on March 14, 2018. Pl.'s Mot. Only upon entry of default did the Court begin to hear from the public entities and officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On behalf of the apparently misidentified \"City of Watchung,\" counsel to the Borough of Watchung, \"a municipal corporation of the State of New Jersey,\" sent the Court a letter dated March 23, 2018, that objected to the entry of default and raised jurisdictional and other bars to this lawsuit. Watchung Opp'n at 1. The Court construed this letter-which indicates that a copy was sent to Plaintiff-as an opposition to a default involving defendant \"Watchung\" and placed it on the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. The letter suggested,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Plaintiff had not properly effected service on this Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court ordered Plaintiff to \"1) show cause as to whether he has properly served Defendant Watchung, or 2) cause process to be properly served upon Defendant Watchung and proof of service to be filed with the Court, or establish good cause for the failure to do so.\" 2d Min. Order of Aug. 21, 2018. The Court also instructed Plaintiff to show cause as to why his claims against this Defendant, as well as the other defaulting Defendants, should not be dismissed for improper venue as the Court had done for claims against Defendant Bohn.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court construed Plaintiff's subsequent briefing as an attempt to respond to both show-cause orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. &amp; Opp'n at i.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 22, 2018, the State of New Jersey's Office of Attorney General filed a motion to vacate the entry of default against Defendants Porrino, Schutta, and Soriano, and to dismiss the claims against them. Mot. to Vacate Default and to Dismiss Pl.'s Compl.\n   <em>\n    with Prejudice\n   </em>\n   Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) on Behalf of Defs. Christopher S. Porrino, Geoffrey D. Soriano, and Det. Michael C. Schutta, ECF Nos. 18, 18-1. Upon receiving this motion, the Court instructed Plaintiff that in lieu of showing cause why venue should lie against these State Official Defendants-as the Court had the previous day ordered-Plaintiff should simply respond to their motion, which would give him an opportunity to address their improper venue arguments. Order, ECF No. 19. The Court has since received Plaintiff's opposition, as well as a reply from the State Official Defendants. Pl.'s Resp. &amp; Opp'n; State Officials' Reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As part of his response to the Court's show-cause order about improper venue, Plaintiff purported to address venue as to Defendants Somerset County and Somerset County Jail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. &amp; Opp'n at i. The Court eventually received a letter, dated February 5, 2019, from counsel to the County of Somerset and the Somerset County Jail arguing that Plaintiff had not shown venue to be proper. Somerset Opp'n at 2. As it had with the Borough of Watchung, the Court interpreted this letter as an opposition to a default involving \"Somerset County\" and \"Somerset County Jail\" and allowed its filing on the docket.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Although this letter indicates that a copy was sent to Plaintiff, Plaintiff has not filed a response with the Court, nor does the Court see any need to prompt such a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Briefing having concluded, the pending motions are ripe for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
