That usually comes in the form of a letter so if you could have your office working on that letter....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   To which AUSA McMahon responded, \"sure.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Later that day, the Court held a conference in chambers, with all parties present.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the conference, Beaulieu's attorney, Cimino, stated that Beaulieu refused to testify because he was fearful of potential prosecution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cimino referred specifically to contradictions between her client's testimony and a Federal Bureau of Investigation Form 302 (\"Form 302\"), memorializing a January 3, 2018 interview\n   between an agent and Beaulieu.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Form 302 stated that Beaulieu identified Defendants Winans and Tuesno in photographs related to armed bank robberies and that the Defendants attempted to recruit Beaulieu for the bank robberies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cimino stated, \"what I think that he could potentially face would be charges of lying to a federal agent or perjury. I don't know that obstruction of justice would necessarily lie, but I can't rule out that, or whatever the government may choose to do, as a result of what I know my client would say versus what is memorialized in the 302.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later in the conference, Cimino again reiterated that \"[t]he issues I delved into with him with respect to what his testimony would be vis-\u00e0-vis what was memorialized in the 302 has really been the focus on my concerns for my client.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court then clarified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [s]o if [Beaulieu] has this complete statutory immunity - well, let's play this out - and that is his only concern against self-incrimination, then he can certainly get on the stand. And if he explained whatever reason why - if he has changed his testimony, he's immune from any kind of prosecution right? If he has some explanation as to why he signed then and maybe has a change of heart, he would have an opportunity to do that. And [the United Stated] would have the opportunity to cross-examine him on that issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In further response, the United States stated that it had guaranteed Beaulieu informal immunity through a letter from the United States Attorney's Office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The United States agrees that no part of your testimony in this proceeding will be used directly against you in any legal proceeding.

It certainly is not his desire to get up on-burning desire to get up on the witness stand, because, as the government has rightfully identified, one of the defendants is his cousin and one is a-they grew up together since they were very small boys. So to the extent that he doesn't really-he does not want to take the witness stand against those people, that is true, Judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In response to Beaulieu's request, the United States stated that it could not seek a court order granting formal immunity without the consent of the United States Department Justice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court agreed to recess the proceedings and allow the United States to seek approval from the Department of Justice, and then allow the United States to call Beaulieu as a witness again the following day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before recess, AUSA McMahon further clarified that \"Please note that immunity - it's not a license to lie. And the immunity doesn't cover lying. So if [Beaulieu] doesn't tell the truth, he opens himself up to a perjury or a false statement prosecution. It's not a license to lie.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, Cimino, stated \"Well, I've advised him as to the language that was in the letter that we were presented, Judge, which did contemplate perjury or false statements to a law enforcement officer ... and obstruction. So I have gone over those with him.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cimino did not raise the existence of another letter granting immunity without these exceptions with the Court at that time, although now Beaulieu claims there was such a letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court informed Beaulieu that after being given formal immunity through a court order, he would no longer be able to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and that he would be in violation of a court order if he refused to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court further informed Beaulieu that despite the protections of formal immunity, he would still be sworn to tell the truth while testifying in court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court informed Beaulieu that he could face consequences for criminal contempt, perjury, or making a false\n   statement if he violated a court order compelling him to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 26, 2017, trial reconvened, and the United States informed the Court that it had received authorization, by letter from the Department of Justice, to seek court ordered formal immunity for Beaulieu.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States then called Beaulieu back to the stand to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, Beaulieu refused to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court advised Beaulieu again that he could be held in contempt of Court for his refusal to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beaulieu stated that he had discussed the ramifications of his decision not to testify with his attorney and understood the consequences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   His attorney confirmed that this discussion occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court ordered Beaulieu to testify pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206002\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, Beaulieu violated the order and refused to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court set a hearing for May 15, 2018, for Beaulieu to appear and show cause why he should not be held in criminal contempt for his failure to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because Beaulieu refused to testify, the United States asserted that Beaulieu was an unavailable witness pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 804.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the United States sought to admit the aforementioned Form 302, memorializing a January 3, 2018 interview between an agent and Beaulieu.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States argued that the Form 302 could be admitted without Beaulieu's testimony pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(6) because Winans, a defendant in the underlying criminal case, had wrongfully caused Beaulieu's unavailability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the United States argued that several days earlier, Winans had threatened Beaulieu in the presence of Deputy United States Marshal Maurice Lightfoot (\"Lightfoot\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States called Lightfoot to the stand to testify regarding the interaction between Winans and Beaulieu.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lightfoot testified that on Monday, April 22, 2018, Winans and Beaulieu were both detained in the cell block of the courthouse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Lightfoot, Winans said upon seeing Beaulieu: \"[Beaulieu] why you out here ratting and lying on people?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lightfoot further testified that Beaulieu responded that \"[He] just mad because [I] beat two murder charges.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lightfoot testified that after this interaction, he separated\n   the prisoners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on this testimony, the Court concluded that the United States had not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Winans wrongfully caused-or acquiesced in wrongfully causing-Beaulieu's unavailability as a witness such that the Form 302 would be admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(6) and did not allow it into evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Form 302 stated that Beaulieu identified Defendants Winans and Tuesno in photographs related to armed bank robberies and that Winans and Tuesno attempted to recruit Beaulieu for the bank robberies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 10, 2018, the Court issued an Order requiring Beaulieu to appear before this Court on May 15, 2018, to show cause why he should not be held in criminal contempt for his failure to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court appointed Duane Evans, Acting United States Attorney, to prosecute the matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the May 15, 2018 hearing, the Court informed the parties that a person held in contempt is entitled to a jury trial if the offense is treated as a felony, rather than a petty offense, measured by whether the defendant faces a potential sentence of more than six months imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court inquired whether the United States intended to seek a term of imprisonment of more than six months if Beaulieu is convicted of contempt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States stated that it intends to seek a sentence of more than six months imprisonment if Beaulieu is convicted of contempt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of this position, the United States cited several cases, including a Fifth Circuit case, where contemnors were sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years for refusing to testify and analogized the facts of those cases to the one presently before the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, counsel for Beaulieu did not dispute the contempt charge, but responded that \"in the defendant's eyes, this was-does not rise to the level of a serious offense with respect to the conduct by my client,\" and thus he should not be subject to a sentence of more than six months if convicted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court stated that refusal to testify under oath is not a \"light matter\" and thus, because the United States had provided grounds demonstrating that Beaulieu could be facing a sentence of more than six months if convicted, Beaulieu was entitled to a jury trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 21, 2018, the Court issued a written Order, citing facts and authority, finding it appropriate to treat this matter as a felony, rather than a petty offense, and directed the Clerk of Court to assign a criminal action number for this matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court further ordered that a status\n   conference be held on June 14, 2018 at 4:00 p.m. for the purpose of scheduling a trial date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the status conference, counsel for Beaulieu argued once again that this matter not be set for trial by jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the Court granted leave for the parties to submit further briefing on whether Beaulieu's refusal to testify should be treated as a petty offense or felony offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 28, 2018 Beaulieu filed a memorandum regarding the issue of the seriousness of the contempt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 12, 2018 the United States filed an opposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 23, 2018 the Court issued an order again finding that the alleged contempt could be found to be a felony offense and set a jury trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 10, 2018, the Court granted defense counsel Cimino's motion for leave to withdraw as counsel of record for Beaulieu and appointed new defense counsel Charles Marshall (\"Marshall\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 26, 2018, Marshall sent an email to the Court stating that he \"believes recusal is appropriate in this case under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20455\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455\n

telephone conference for September 27, 2018 to inquire whether the request for recusal was based on extrajudicial information the Court might have inadvertently been privy to.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hearing none, the Court told Marshall that, if he believed recusal is appropriate, he should file a motion so the issue could be fully addressed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 1, 2018, Beaulieu filed a Motion to Recuse Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\"

filed an opposition to the motion on October 10, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 15, 2018, with leave of Court, Beaulieu filed a reply brief in further support of the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 19, 2018, the Court denied the motion to recuse, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"[i]n conclusion, Beaulieu presents no evidence of extrajudicial knowledge and no evidence that the Court cannot serve as an impartial decision-maker in this case.

[d]isobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    166\n   </footnotemark>\n   The elements of contempt are: \"(1) a reasonably specific order; (2) violation of the order; and (3) willful intent to violate the order.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    167\n   </footnotemark>\n   Evidence of contempt\n   \"must show both a contemptuous act and a willful, contumacious, or reckless state of mind.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    168\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Beaulieu's argument that a contempt conviction requires a \"bad purpose\" beyond disobeying a court order is derived from the Fifth Circuit pattern instruction for \"willfully\" which states, in part, that one who acts willfully, acts with \"bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    169\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the pattern instructions also state that \"willfully ... means that the act was committed voluntarily and purposely, with the specific intent to do something the law forbids.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    170\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taken in context, the \"bad purpose\" referred to in the statute is a voluntary decision to disobey the law. Therefore, Beaulieu's interpretation of the instruction is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   However, the Court need not even rely on the aforementioned pattern instruction in this case. First, the pattern instructions acknowledge that \"this definition is not accurate in every situation\" and that \"the term 'willfully' has 'defied any consistent interpretation by the courts.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    171\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the Fifth Circuit has not relied on the pattern instructions in similar criminal contempt contexts, instead the Fifth Circuit has explained that \" 'willfulness' in the context of the criminal contempt statute at a minimum requires a finding of recklessness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    172\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit quoted the\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   definition of reckless, which is \"a gross deviation from what a reasonable person would do.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    173\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the United States need not prove that Beaulieu acted with a \"bad purpose,\" beyond the purpose of defying the Court's Order, in this case. The United States does not need to prove that Beaulieu intended to obstruct justice as a result of his defiance, the United States must merely prove that Beaulieu's defiance was willful, which in this context means at least reckless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    174\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   At this time, the Court will deny the United States' instant motion to the extent the motion seeks to preclude Beaulieu from arguing that he did not act willfully in this case. As discussed above, the elements of criminal contempt are: (1) a reasonably specific order; (2) violation of the order; and (3) willful intent to violate the order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    175\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beaulieu may argue that he did not act willfully in this case. However, Beaulieu is cautioned that the Court remains the decider of law in this case, and the Court will instruct the jury on the correct contempt standard and interpretation of the term \"willfully.\" If Beaulieu attempts to erroneously present the law to the jury, the United States may raise further objections at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Judicial Notice\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The United States argues that a \"total immunity letter\" never existed in this case and that the Court should take\n   judicial notice of this alleged fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    176\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"total immunity letter\" refers to the alleged letter from the United States Attorneys' Office granting Beaulieu immunity without exception for perjury, obstruction of justice, or making a false statement, referenced in Cimino's affidavit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    177\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the instant motion, the United States argues that Cimino's claim has been expressly refuted through denials in the affidavit of then-Criminal Chief AUSA Sullivan,\n   <footnotemark>\n    178\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the sworn statement of AUSA McMahon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    179\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the United States argues that this Court has recognized that all the immunity discussions took place \"under the gaze of the Court,\" and the Court has not found evidence of the letter referenced by Cimino.\n   <footnotemark>\n    180\n   </footnotemark>\n   In opposition, Beaulieu argues that this factual issue is contested because the parties have presented \"dueling affidavits\" on this issue, and that determination of the issue will require a credibility determination between the two witnesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    181\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 201 provides that a court \"may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute\" because it \"is generally known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction\" or \"can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    182\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Fifth Circuit has stated that it is not appropriate to take judicial notice of contested facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    183\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the parties dispute the existence of a \"total immunity letter.\" Cimino has presented a sworn affidavit that a \"total immunity letter\" existed, whereas AUSA Sullivan and AUSA McMahon have presented sworn affidavits stating that such a letter did not exist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    184\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the existence of a \"total immunity letter\" is a contested fact that is appropriately resolved by the jury in this case. Finally, the Court finds that even if it were to take judicial notice of this contested fact, it would not serve as a conclusive determination for the jury, and thus denies the motion in this regard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    185\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Also the Court notes that to the extent that the US argues that evidence of the alleged existence of a total immunity letter should be excluded under FRE 401 as irrelevant, it has not explained how such evidence is irrelevant. Furthermore, the US has not shown that the probative value of this evidence would be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\n   confusing the issues, or misleading the jury under FRE 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Trial Subpoenas\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Beaulieu originally filed a motion for trial subpoenas for AUSA McMahon, AUSA Sullivan, and Agent Rayes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    186\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, in Beaulieu's opposition to the instant motion, Beaulieu stated that he does not intend to call Ms. Sullivan or Agent Rayes and trial and withdraws those subpoenas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    187\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beaulieu's counsel also stated at the Court's pre-trial conference that he withdraws the subpoena for AUSA McMahon. Therefore, the motion requesting subpoenas will be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V. Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For these reasons, the Court will deny the United States' Motion in Limine. The Court will deny the United States' request to prohibit Beaulieu from pursuing a \"good faith\" defense because Beaulieu may argue that he did not act willfully in his defiance of the Court's Order. However, Beaulieu is cautioned that the Court is the decisionmaker regarding issues of law in this case. The Court will also deny the United States' request to take judicial notice that a \"total immunity letter\" never existed because this is a disputed issue of fact best resolved by a jury at trial. Furthermore, Beaulieu has agreed to withdraw the subpoenas requested in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the \"Motion in Limine for Court to Take Judicial Notice that 'Total Immunity Letter' Never Existed, to Prohibit 'Good Faith' or 'Reasonable Belief' Defense, and to Quash Subpoenas\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    188\n   </footnotemark>\n   is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   because Beaulieu may argue that he did not \"willfully\" disobey the Court's Order and the existence of a \"total immunity letter\" remains a contested issue of fact for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the \"Motion for Issuance of Trial Subpoenas\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    189\n   </footnotemark>\n   is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   due to Beaulieu's agreement to withdraw his request for subpoenas.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Rec.

The former, as noted above, are creatures of statute and their issuance, by a court order that conforms to the statute, supersedes the Fifth Amendment privilege. In contrast, an informal immunity agreement is just that: an agreement between witness and government in which both parties receive mutual benefits. A witness who testifies under an informal immunity agreement is not threatened with contempt for his failure to testify, but instead with losing the benefit of the bargain he or she struck with the government. Witnesses with informal immunity agreements therefore do not abdicate their Fifth Amendment privilege when entering into the agreement; it is not until they testify that they give up the privilege. Indeed, informally immunized witnesses cannot later preclude the use of their testimony in a subsequent trial, save in accordance with their agreement with the government.\") (internal citations
