On that same date, Plaintiff pleaded guilty to a charge of Manslaughter While Armed, for which he was sentenced to a period of incarceration of 7 \u00bd to 25 years, of which he served 10 years. June 22, 2016 Consent Order, ECF No. 9-1, at 1. For most of the subsequent 36 years, Mr. Harris \"receiv[ed] either inpatient care while residing within St. Elizabeths or outpatient care while living in the community[.]\" Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 8. Plaintiff notes his classification as a \"forensic\" patient, which is terminology used by St. Elizabeths when an individual is \"being treated by a mental health services facility for reasons related to his involvement in the criminal justice system.\" Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Harris has been granted several conditional releases since his commitment began, and he was returned to inpatient care most recently on October 15, 2014, following his conviction for Possession with Intent to Distribute a Controlled Substance (Cocaine) and Unlawful Possession of a Firearm, and his sentence of 36 months' incarceration, which was to be served in a facility operated by the Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") and followed by five years of supervised release. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 46-50; June 22, 2016 Consent Order, ECF No. 9-1, at 1.

Events Leading to the Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff filed his Complaint on April 4, 2018. Plaintiff's Complaint indicates that, on January 17, 2017, St. Elizabeths recommended that the Superior Court issue an order conditionally releasing Plaintiff to live in the community, on the basis that he would not pose a danger if released. Compl., ECF No.1, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 55. The D.C. Superior Court scheduled a hearing for April 5, 2017, to consider that recommendation. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 56. On April 5, 2017, the DOC picked up Plaintiff at St. Elizabeths and transported him to and from the D.C. Superior Court. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 61. Plaintiff alleges that \"the DOC removed [his] shoelaces and belt and subjected him to five-point restraints\" before he rode in a van \"with Class \"A\" patients, seated on a bench facing a metal screen dividing male and female patients,\" and when he arrived at the Courthouse, he was \"placed in a holding cell.\" Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 63-65.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore,\n   \"Mr. Harris' restraints remained in place and his belt and shoelaces were not provided to him\" even when \"appearing in court.\" Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 66. At that hearing, the court granted the Government's request for continuance and scheduled another appearance for May 3, 2017. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 68. Mr. Harris, through counsel, complained about the April 5, 2017 transport and requested that St. Elizabeths transport him to his May 3, 2017 hearing, but that request was denied. Compl, ECF No. 1, \u00b6 69. Mr. Harris was conditionally released from St. Elizabeths on May 3, 2017. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiff's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants in this case - the District, DBH, St. Elizabeths, and DOC - \"subject[ ] patients under the care and custody of St. Elizabeths to unwarranted and unconstitutional restraint when transporting patients to and from St. Elizabeths and D. C. Superior Court to attend court hearings about the status of their commitment at St. Elizabeths.\" Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 1. In Count I, Plaintiff alleges that the practice whereby forensic patients are placed in restraints during transport and put in a holding cell while awaiting a court hearing constitutes \"an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment[.]\" Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 91. In Count II, Plaintiff alleges that the way in which he was transported by the DOC to and from the D.C. Superior Court, on April 5, 2017, and placed in a holding cell \"violat[ed] [ ] his Fifth Amendment right to adequate medical care and to be free of unwarranted bodily restraint.\" Compl, ECF No. 1, \u00b6 109. In Count III, Plaintiff alleges that the way in which he was transported by DOC to and from the D.C. Superior Court, on April 5, 2017, \"constitute[s] a deprivation of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment[.]\" Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 117. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief because he \"remains subject to being returned to St. Elizabeths for mandatory treatment and has no other adequate remedy to prevent future injury ... \"Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 92, 109, 118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Defendants attempt to distinguish the cases cited by Plaintiff insofar as \"the record in [\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In Re Ballay\n   </em>\n   ] supported an inference that an inmate or former patient's mental state rendered it likely that the question presented would arise again\" whereas in this case, the Court would \"have to infer that plaintiff is likely to violate the conditions of his release in a manner that will subject him to recommitment at St. Elizabeths.\" Defs' Reply, ECF No. 13, at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Based upon Plaintiff's lengthy history at St. Elizabeths - during which he has been granted several conditional releases since his commitment - and the fact that he was conditionally released and is subject to recommitment for violation of the conditions of his release or a deterioration of his mental health, this Court finds it reasonable to infer that Plaintiff is likely to violate the conditions of his release and be subject to recommitment at St. Elizabeths.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 45 (\"After being conditionally released from St. Elizabeths and re-committed on multiple occasions for failing to meet the conditions of release[,]\" Plaintiff was conditionally released by Order dated June 5, 2007, but he was subsequently incarcerated, then recommitted, and again conditionally released by Order dated May 3, 2017);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 11, at 26 n.8 (noting that the conditions of Plaintiff's release are \"highly restrictive\" and require Plaintiff to (1) participate in therapeutic activities such as structured activities at a community-based day treatment program at least three days per week and/or have approved employment at least three days per week, attend psychotherapy at least once a month, and attend AA/NA meetings weekly; and (2) comply with all requests for information on treatment made by the Forensic Outpatient Department or the Hospital; and (3) refrain from consuming alcohol, using marijuana or illegal drugs, and getting arrested, and Plaintiff must take all his medications). Accordingly, this Court finds that Plaintiff has standing to pursue his claim for prospective injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

While Defendants suggest that this Court should substitute the District of Columbia in place of the four official-capacity Defendants, they identify no reason why it should be done in this case where the District of Columbia is not itself already named as a defendant. Furthermore, Defendants do not argue that the official-capacity Defendants may not be sued. Accordingly, Defendants' request to substitute the District of Columbia for the four official-capacity Defendants shall be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   A separate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Court's consideration focused on the following documents: (1) Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, and for Compensatory Damages (\"Compl.\"), ECF No. 1; (2) Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Complaint and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in support thereof (\"Defs.'
