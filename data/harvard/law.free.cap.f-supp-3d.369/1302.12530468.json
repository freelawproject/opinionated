In count one, she alleges Carnival breached a non-delegable duty; in count two, she claims Carnival was negligent in twenty-seven different ways relating to the zipline excursion; and in count three, she again alleges Carnival was negligent, but under an \"apparent agency or agency by estoppel theory.\" (Am. Compl., ECF No. 17.) Counts four and five are brought against Defendant Lost Mayan Kingdom Adventure Park only. Carnival now asks the Court to dismiss all three of the claims against it, arguing Bailey has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. (Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 20.) After careful review, the Court\n   <strong>\n    denies in part and grants in part\n   </strong>\n   Carnival's motion (\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 20\n   </strong>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Bailey embarked on a week-long cruise aboard a Carnival ship in May 2017. At some point, Carnival promoted, vouched for, and recommended a zipline tour excursion operated by Lost Mayan. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18.) Carnival's website repeatedly described the zipline tours as \"Carnival Excursions\" and assured they are \"worry free.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21.) Carnival enticed its passengers to sign up for \"Carnival Excursions\" by vouching for the insurance and safety standards of \"[its] Shore Excursion\" and the prompt return of passengers enjoying those excursions to the ship once their tours had concluded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 32.) In contrast, Carnival actively discouraged its passengers from booking non-Carnival excursions by disparaging them and maintaining that Carnival was unfamiliar with their insurance and safety records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.) Carnival also disavowed having any control over the timeliness of passengers' returns to the ship by any independent tours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While onboard, Bailey, in reliance on Carnival's representations that its excursions, operators, and excursion equipment were safe, insured, reputable, and reliable, entered into an \"excursion contract\" with Carnival for the Lost Mayan zipline tour, which was to take place during a port stop in Mexico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 16, 23.) Carnival subcontracted with Lost Mayan who operated the zipline tour that Bailey signed up for. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unfortunately, as she approached the end of her zipline ride, \"the line did not stop, but smashed into a barrier.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) As a result, Bailey suffered serious injuries to her left ankle, including several fractures which required surgery.

Carnival's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Carnival asks the Court to dismiss counts one, two, and three, all of which allege claims against Carnival alone. Based on the analysis that follows, the Court denies Carnival's motion, in large part, and grants it only to the limited extent described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Bailey's Breach-of-a-Non-Delegable-Duty Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Bailey's breach of a non-delegable duty claim relates back to Bailey's initial complaint.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the outset, Carnival submits Bailey's claim, in count one, that Carnival breached a non-delegable duty, is barred by the parties' contractual statute of limitations. According to Carnival, this count, included in Bailey's amended complaint (filed beyond the limitations period), does not relate back to her initial complaint (filed within the limitations period). (Def.'s Mot. at 6.) While Bailey agrees she filed her amended complaint beyond the limitations period, she maintains it nonetheless relates back to her initial complaint. (Pl.'s Resp. at 4.) After review, the Court agrees with Bailey and finds the new claim presented through the amendment indeed arose out of the conduct, transactions, and occurrences set out in her initial complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In her original pleading, Bailey alleged she \"purchased a zipline tour to be conducted on behalf of Carnival by ... Lost Mayan\" and that both Carnival and Lost Mayan \"were required to use reasonable care ... for [her] safety.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 14, ECF No. 1, 3-4.) Through this initial complaint, Bailey went on to allege Carnival was negligent in twenty-seven different ways. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16(a)-(aa).) All but two of these twenty-seven allegations specifically referenced either the zipline excursion or Lost Mayan itself. In count two of the initial complaint, Bailey further alleged, as she does in her amended complaint, that Carnival was also negligent under an apparent-agency\n   or agency-by-estoppel theory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-24.) Now, in her amended complaint, through her breach-of-a-non-delegable duty claim, Bailey contends Carnival, \"[b]y promoting, vouching for, contracting for[,] and profiting from the excursion ticket contract, Carnival owed ... Bailey the non-delegable duty to provide her with a reasonably safe excursion.\" (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 31.) As can be seen from the examples that follow, many of Bailey's contentions regarding Carnival's breaches, under this amended count, echo the contentions she laid out, under her negligence claim, in her initial complaint:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-22\"><strong><em>Beaches alleged in amended</em></strong> <strong><em>Corresponding breaches alleged</em></strong> <strong><em>complaint, count one. (Am. Compl.</em></strong> <strong><em>within original pleading:</em></strong> <strong><em>at \u00b6 33.)</em></strong> a. \"Failing to select a reasonably safe - \"Failing to provide a safe excursion\" excursion operator\" (Compl. at \u00b6 16(a).) b. \"Failing to ensure that the zip-line - \"Failing to provide an excursion with operated by [Lost Mayan] was proper equipment and personnel\" reasonably equipped and maintained\" (Compl. at \u00b6 16(b).) - \"Failing to properly ... inspect ...

Lost Mayan.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 16(r).) d. \"Failing to warn passengers purchasing excursion tickets from Carnival that there are real and - \"Failing to adequately warn Plaintiff significant dangers on tours and of the dangers that would be excursion[s], including the fact that encountered during the subject many other passengers have been excursion\" (Compl. at \u00b6 16(e).) killed or injured while on such zip-line excursions.\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(B), \"[a]n amendment to a pleading relates back to the ... original pleading when[ ] ... the amendment asserts a claim ... that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out-or attempted to be set out-in the original pleading.\" Carnival complains Bailey's new, breach-of-a-non-delegable-duty claim, \"relies on new, distinct conduct separate from that required to recover on her initial claims.\" (Def.'s Mot. at 6.) Carnival supports its argument by pointing to \"new factual allegations related to the 'excursion ticket contract'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   and to oral modifications made to such 'contract' that were not included in her initial Complaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Pl.'s Am. Compl.).) According to Carnival, Bailey's mere mention \"that she 'purchased a zipline tour to be conducted on behalf of Carnival by ... Lost Mayan,' \" in her original filing, in no way gave Carnival any notice that she would be relying on any \"contract,\" relating to the excursion, never mind \"any oral modifications made to [that] contract.\" (Def.'s Mot. at 6.) Carnival insists Bailey's reliance on these modifications amounts to her \"plead[ing] new distinct conduct separate from that which was contained within her initial Complaint\" and that \"entirely different\" allegations must be proved to support her new claim than were plead in her original pleading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court finds Carnival's argument misses the mark. Bailey's new claim is not \"premised upon 'new distinct conduct' ... which prevents this claim from relating back to the date the original claim was filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Hajtman v. NCL (Bahamas) Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-22429-CIV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%201803630\">\n    2008 WL 1803630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 21, 2008) (Moore, J.) Indeed, Bailey's \"original complaint gave notice to the defendant of the claim now being asserted.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517535\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/989/1129/#p1131\">\n    989 F.2d 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1131 (11th Cir. 1993). In both versions of the complaint, Bailey seeks to hold Carnival responsible for the same alleged accident where the zipline \"did not stop, but smashed into a barrier.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 12; Am. Compl. at \u00b6 12.) Nothing about the issues Carnival points to in Bailey's new claim, seeking to hold Carnival responsible for injuries she sustained on the Lost Mayan zipline, should surprise Carnival. Carnival has not convinced the Court that Bailey \"would have to prove completely different facts than would otherwise have been required to recover on the claim[s] in [her] original complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517535\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/989/1129/#p1131\">\n    989 F.2d at 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, its contention that her amended complaint does not relate back, on these grounds, fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Inexplicably, however, or perhaps for some strategic reason the Court cannot divine, Carnival did not express any limitations concerns regarding the amended-complaint claims that Carnival \"fail[ed] to have any emergency medical treatment and/or evacuation plan in the event that passengers were injured on the excursion\" or \"fail[ed] to timely provide medical treatment and/or transport and/or evacuation for passengers injured on the excursion.\" (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 33(e)-(f).) These alleged breaches, regarding medical treatment, do not relate back to the initial complaint and therefore appear to be time barred. As a result, the Court orders Bailey to show cause why the claims premised on these breaches should not be dismissed as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Bailey's claim that Carnival breached a contractually-established non-delegable duty survives dismissal.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Bailey premises her breach-of-a-non-delegable-duty claim on both a contractually-established, as well as a tort-based, non-delegable duty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.) According to Bailey, this non-delegable duty required Carnival to provide Bailey with a safe excursion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33, 34.) Carnival argues, in essence, it had no duty to ensure Bailey's safety while she participated in the zipline excursion, claiming this would impermissibly broaden the duty of care owed by a shipowner to its passengers-in effect rendering the shipowner the all-purpose insurer of its passengers' safety while participating in off-ship excursions. In countering, Bailey relies primarily on her allegation that Carnival contractually ensured Bailey's safety while she participated in the ziplining tour. In considering\n   the allegations presented in Bailey's amended complaint, the Court finds Baily has sufficiently alleged Carnival's breach of a contractually established non-delegable duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To begin with, the Court agrees with other courts in this district that an \"express provision guaranteeing safe passage is not required to state a cause of action for breach of a shore excursion contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Witover v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4330991\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/161/1139/#p1146\">\n    161 F.Supp.3d 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1146 (S.D. Fla. 2016) (Lenard, J.) (quotations and alterations omitted). Further, where an excursion contract, entered into by a shipowner and a passenger, is alleged to include some sort of guarantee or assurance, a duty may be sufficiently alleged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lienemann v. Cruise Ship Excursions, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 18-21713-CIV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206039993\">\n    2018 WL 6039993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 15, 2018) (Lenard, J.) (denying dismissal for failure to state a claim where the passenger alleged the shipowner \"promise[d] ... its contracted-for excursions utilized the best local providers at every p[o]rt\" and \"vouch[ed] for the safety/insurance record of the party with whom it independently contracted\") (quotation altered for clarity);\n   <em>\n    Witover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4330991\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/161/1139/#p1146\">\n    161 F.Supp.3d at 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding passenger's allegation that shipowner orally \"guarantee[d] ... the excursion was handicapped accessible ... sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Carnival maintains Bailey failed to sufficiently allege that Carnival ever contracted with Bailey to provide a safe excursion. (Def.'s Mot. at 8.) And, in fact, says Carnival, the language of the parties' ticket contract itself \"clearly dispels any notion of such a contractual duty.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lastly, Carnival complains that although Bailey alleges Carnival orally modified the excursion contract, \"she fails to allege what oral modification there was and how it relates to any duty owed by Carnival.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Carnival's contentions are directly belied by the allegations Bailey presents in her complaint. Notably, Bailey alleges Carnival actively promoted, recommended, and, most importantly, vouched for the Lost Mayan zipline tour. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 16.) In fact, says Bailey, Carnival pointedly assured her that the tour was \"safe, insured, reputable, and reliable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.) According to Bailey, Carnival's website even characterized the tour as one of \"Carnival['s] Excursions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.) These allegations sufficiently plead the existence of a contractually created duty. Whether Bailey will ultimately be able to prove her theories regarding how Carnival breached the non-delegable duty arising out of this alleged contract, of course, remains to be seen. But at this stage of the litigation, the Court finds count one indeed states a claim sufficient to proceed past the motion to dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On the other hand, the Court agrees that Bailey has not sufficiently alleged a tort-based non-delegable duty. And, in fact, Bailey does not present any opposition to this contention. The Court therefore finds Bailey has failed to state a claim that Carnival breached any tort-based non-delegable duty. The Court thus dismisses any such claims, with prejudice, from Bailey's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Bailey's negligence allegations are, mostly, sufficient to survive Carnival's challenge.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Carnival next urges the Court to dismiss the negligence claims Bailey alleges in count two for three reasons. First, says Carnival, the only duty a shipowner owes a passenger once she leaves the ship is the \"duty to warn of known dangers in places where passengers are invited or reasonably expected to visit.\" (Def.'s Mot. at 10.) Thus, Carnival argues, the Court should dismiss any negligence claim not\n   premised on a duty to warn. As far as Carnival's argument goes, the Court disagrees. Although \"generally the duty to warn is the most relevant duty regarding off-vessel excursions, a cruise ship might have additional obligations under the 'reasonable care' standard, if, for example, there is an agency relationship between the cruise ship and the excursion operator.\"\n   <em>\n    Pucci v.

And, \"[w]hile this issue has not been dispositively addressed by the Eleventh Circuit,\" that court has nonetheless \"stated that the duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances\n   <em>\n    includes\n   </em>\n   a duty to warn of known dangers beyond the point of debarkation in places where passengers are invited or reasonably expected to visit.\"\n   <em>\n    Ferretti v.

The Court does not otherwise find persuasive the sources Carnival relies on for the contrary position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Next, Carnival submits Bailey has failed to sufficiently plead notice of the risk-creating condition. On the one hand, the Court certainly agrees that certain allegations are deficient. For example, Bailey's contention that \"the conditions existed for a sufficient length of time so that Carnival ... should have learned of them and corrected them\" is far too vague and conclusory to, on its own, demonstrate constructive notice. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 39.) Likewise, Bailey's claim that \"Carnival is aware of numerous other lawsuits and claims arising out of zip-lining excursions such as Lost Mayan\" is similarly lacking in specifics or supporting factual allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) To be sure, the Court agrees with Carnival that neither of these conclusory allegations, without more, would suffice. However, Bailey also alleges \"Carnival knew of the ... conditions causing Plaintiff's accident through prior adverse comment cards submitted by passengers with whom Carnival had previously contracted for the [zipline tour].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) If true, this allegation means that at least two other passengers who went on the Lost Mayan zipline tour expressly informed Carnival of the very condition that Bailey claims caused her injuries. This is at least sufficient to nudge Bailey past dismissal regarding Carnival's notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, Carnival asserts Bailey failed to state a claim for negligent selection and retention of an independent contractor. In order to set out such a claim in this kind of case, a plaintiff \"must allege that the [tour] company was incompetent or unfit to perform the work, that [the cruise line] knew or reasonably should have known of the particular incompetence or unfitness, and that such incompetence or unfitness proximately caused [the plaintiff's] injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Gayou v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 11-23359-CIV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202049431\">\n    2012 WL 2049431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (S.D. Fla. June 5, 2012) (Scola, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"The relevant inquiry is whether [the cruise line] diligently inquired into [the tour operator's] fitness.\"\n   <em>\n    Smolnikar v. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5914091\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/787/1308/#p1319\">\n    787 F.Supp.2d 1308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1319 (S.D. Fla. 2011) (Jordan, J.). Carnival points to the following specific allegations as falling far short of stating a negligent-selection-and-retention claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (a) Failing to provide a safe excursion;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (b) Failing to provide an excursion with proper equipment and personnel;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (c) Failing to properly and adequately inspect, investigate, screen, select[,] and retain ... its tour operator ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (d) Failing to adequately monitor, supervise and audit the ongoing operations of its tour operator partner ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 37.) The Court agrees none of these allegations succeed in stating a claim for negligent hiring and retention. Nowhere within the complaint does Bailey present any factual support for the notion that Carnival was aware of any \"particular incompetence or unfitness\" or \"that such incompetence or unfitness proximately caused [her] injuries.\" To the extent, then, that Bailey seeks to attach liability to Carnival for negligent hiring and retention, such claims are dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Bailey has sufficiently pleaded the negligence claims she premised on apparent agency.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In count three, Bailey alleges negligence against Carnival based on apparent agency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so she lists several representations Carnival made, regarding its relationship with Lost Mayan. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 41.) She then says that, based on these representations, she decided to go on the zipline tour rather than stay onboard or tour the port on her own. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.) Carnival argues this claim should be dismissed for a number of reasons. As set forth below, the Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"[A]pparent agency liability requires finding three essential elements: first, a representation by the principal to the plaintiff, which, second, causes the plaintiff reasonably to believe that the alleged agent is authorized to act for the principal's benefit, and which, third, induces the plaintiff's detrimental, justifiable reliance upon the appearance of agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Franza v. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314342\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1225/#p1252\">\n    772 F.3d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1252 (11th Cir. 2014). Bailey has sufficiently alleged all three elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Bailey alleges a number of representations Carnival made that she claims led her to believe Lost Mayan was Carnival's agent. For example, she points to the \"series of internet, brochures and other media ... which advertise the availability and safety of various Carnival excursions, which were presented as ... integral\n   [to] the cruise ship experience\"; Carnival's \"market[ing] the ... excursion on its website by guaranteeing the best price and offering [ ] 110% of the price difference for a better price for any excursion '[it] offer[s]' \"; and \"Carnival ... crew members ... promoted, advertised, explained, coordinated and supervised ... the subject zip-line excursion.\" (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 41(a)-(c).) Bailey has set forth allegations of specific undertakings by Carnival that, if proved, could establish the requisite manifestations by the principal, causing a third party like Bailey to reasonably believe that Lost Mayan was Carnival's agent. Moreover, even if the complaint merely pleaded that \"Carnival held out the owners and/or operators of the zip-line excursions as its apparent agent[s]\" and that \"Carnival represented to ... Plaintiff[ ] that the operator of the zipline excursion was acting for the benefit of Carnival\" (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 41), a claim for apparent agency would not necessarily be foreclosed, if supported by underlying facts. \"An apparent agency relationship may be created by silence where the principal knowingly permits the agent to act as if the agent is authorized, or by acting in a manner which creates a reasonable appearance of an agent's authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Gayou\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202049431\">\n    2012 WL 2049431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court is also not persuaded by Carnival's argument that the language on Bailey's ticket (describing the excursion operators as \"independent contractors\" and disclaiming any liability) or on Carnival's website (same) forecloses any apparent agency liability. If the Court were to consider these documents at this stage of the litigation-which it appears it should not-the Court would not, in any event, find them sufficient to support dismissal of this count. The language Carnival relies on presents factual issues that the Court declines to consider at the motion-to-dismiss stage of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As set forth above, Carnival's motion is denied in part and granted in part (\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 20\n   </strong>\n   ). The Court dismisses Bailey's claims (1) that Carnival breached a tort-based non-delegable duty; and (2) for negligent selection and retention of an independent contractor. Additionally, Bailey must show cause, on or before\n   <strong>\n    March 25, 2019\n   </strong>\n   , why her breach-of-non-delegable duty claims, premised on the breaches she alleges in paragraphs 33(e) and 33(f), should not be dismissed as untimely. Unless Bailey can show that these allegations relate back to her original pleading, the Court will dismiss the claims based on those allegations as time barred. If Bailey concedes that these claims should be dismissed, she must file a notice to that effect immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Carnival must file its answer to the amended complaint\n   <strong>\n    on or before April 1, 2019\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Done and ordered\n   </strong>\n   at Miami, Florida, on March 18, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The Court accepts Bailey's allegations, as set forth below, as true for the purposes of evaluating Carnival's motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     Brooks v.

Other than arguing Bailey is limited solely to a duty-to-warn theory of liability, Carnival does not otherwise flesh out this threadbare argument. And while Carnival may indeed be correct about many, or at least some, of Bailey's claims, the Court will not itself undertake piecing together the argument on Carnival's behalf. Instead, Carnival will have to address each individual breach either through a motion for summary judgment or at trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The Court notes Bailey did not address Carnival's argument regarding claims focused on Carnival's negligent hiring and retention.
