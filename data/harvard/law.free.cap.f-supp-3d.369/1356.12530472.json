PANNELL, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On March 8, 2019, Plaintiffs and Defendant (\"the Parties\") filed their Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class and FLSA Collective Action Settlement, accompanied by Plaintiffs' Unopposed Motion for Approval of Attorney's Fees, Costs, and Service Payments from Settlement, seeking\n   final approval of the parties' Settlement Agreement and Limited Release (\"Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28-1. In support, Plaintiffs filed declarations from Plaintiffs' counsel (\"Class Counsel\"), as well as from the Settlement Administrator, RG/2 Claims Administration (\"RG/2\" or \"Settlement Administrator\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter came before the Court on March 20, 2019 for a Final Approval Hearing pursuant to the Court's Preliminary Approval Order dated December 10, 2018, as rescheduled by this Court's Order dated December 18, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 32, 33. The Court reviewed all of the filings related to the Settlement and heard argument on the motions for final approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After careful consideration of the presentations of the Parties, the Court concludes that this Settlement provides a fair, reasonable, and adequate recovery for Settlement Class Members (\"Class Members\"), the net amount of which Class Counsel believes approximately compensates them for more than 100% of their allegedly unpaid overtime premium amounts for their maximum possible recovery periods, and a significant portion of maximum possible additional liquidated damages, interest, and, as applicable, waiting time penalties. The Settlement constitutes an excellent result for the Settlement Class under the circumstances and challenges presented by the Action. The Court specifically finds that the Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and a satisfactory compromise of the Settlement Class Members' claims. The Settlement fully complies with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) and, thus, the Court grants Final Approval to the Settlement, certifies the Settlement Class, and awards the fees and costs requested by Class Counsel as well as the requested Service Awards for the Class Representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The present evidentiary record is more than adequate for the Court to consider the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the Settlement.

No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 27, 2016, Defendant filed its Answer and moved to transfer venue to Utah district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 5. Plaintiffs opposed that motion, and this Court\n   denied transfer of venue by Order dated July 12, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties filed their Joint Preliminary Report and Discovery Plan on July 5, 2016, presenting disputed positions on issues such as bifurcated discovery and the propriety of Defendant taking pre-certification discovery of Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By Order entered July 13, 2016, the Court set a schedule for Plaintiffs to move for conditional certification of a FLSA collective action and issuance of notice, denied bifurcated discovery, and ordered that discovery would commence 30 days after the date the Court addresses the conditional certification motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 3, 2016, the parties filed a Joint Proposed Case Management Statement and Stipulation for Stay and Conditional Certification, in which the parties stipulated to conditional certification of a FLSA collective action and a stay in order to allow the parties to engage in mediation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 25, 2016, the Court entered an Order conditionally certifying this case to proceed as a collective action, ordering issuance of Notice, and administratively closing the case during the notice and mediation period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Notice Administrator, RG/2, distributed Notices pursuant to the required notice and opt-in process, and by the conclusion of that process approximately 260 individuals had submitted Consents to join the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Beginning in late 2016, the parties began preliminary settlement discussions. As a result of negotiations in advance of the mediation, the parties agreed to negotiate at mediation a potential hybrid class/collective action settlement. Prior to the mediation, the parties entered into a tolling agreement as to certain state law class action claims in lieu of Plaintiffs filing (and Defendant having to answer) an amended pleading to add those state law claims before mediation, and requiring extensive pre-mediation exchange of information, payroll records, and pertinent documents. During informal pre-mediation discovery production, Defendant provided to Class Counsel full payroll records, bonus-related and other policy and employment documents, identification of potential state law class members, and other information and records necessary to fully assess the regular rate violation claims at issue. Class Counsel's review of the discovery enabled Plaintiffs to gain an understanding of the evidence related to central questions in the case, and the strengths and weaknesses of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Head Decl. \u00b6 13. Furthermore, Class Counsel's review of the documents produced by Defendant also prepared Plaintiffs to engage in well-informed settlement negotiations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties then conducted an in-person mediation on April 28, 2017, with nationally renowned wage and hour class/collective action mediator Steven G. Pearl, Esq., in Costa Mesa, California. The Parties signed a term sheet at the conclusion of that full-day mediation, memorializing their agreement in principle to a hybrid FLSA collective action and eight state class action settlement. After extensive additional negotiations, the Parties ultimately executed a final signed Agreement in late October, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On November 29, 2018, the Parties filed their joint motion to reopen the case, accompanied by Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint asserting eight state law class claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 26, 26-2. The Court granted that motion to reopen the case and permit the filing of the First Amended Complaint by Order dated December 3, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 29, 2018, the Parties also filed their joint motion for preliminary settlement approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28. The Court granted the parties' motion for preliminary settlement approval and certified the Rule 23 settlement classes by Order entered December 20, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 32.

No. 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The approved Settlement Administrator then issued Court-approved settlement Notice to the eligible class and collective settlement members, which included details on how to object, opt-out, or claim an additional offered FLSA payment, in addition to notifying Class Members of the Final Approval Hearing set for March 20, 2019. The settlement Notice also informed all Class Members that Plaintiffs would request approval of service payments from the Court, the specific amounts of which were specified in the Settlement Agreement\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that has been posted on the Settlement Administrator's notice website listed in the Notice since December 21, 2018. The Notice also informed all Class Members that Plaintiffs would request approval of attorney's fees in the amount of 33% of the $ 925,000 Settlement Fund, in addition to advanced litigation costs as awarded by the Court, both of which terms were specified in the Settlement Agreement posted on the Notice website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pursuant to the Court's Order, the period for filing timely objections ended on February 9, 2019. There were no objections filed within the Court-ordered objection period, and there have been no objections filed to date. RG/2 issued the required CAFA notices, and there have been no objections from any government officials.
