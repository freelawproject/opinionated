KELLY, United States District Judge\n   Missouri Coalition for the Environment routinely submits requests under the Freedom of Information Act for records relating to a Clean Water Act permit program run by the Army Corps of Engineers. It uses those records to comment on permit applications and keep track of permits issued in Missouri. This case is about how the Corps has responded to Missouri Coalition's FOIA requests for records relating to\n   <em>\n    pending\n   </em>\n   permit applications. Under those circumstances, the Corps has withheld all otherwise responsive records, claiming that they were exempt from disclosure because they were \"pre-decisional\" and part of the agency's \"deliberative process.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Missouri Coalition challenged those responses, arguing that the Corps was withholding non-agency records-such as those submitted by the permit applicant-to which the claimed exemption did not apply. And in two instances, Missouri Coalition brought a FOIA case seeking the withheld records, and the Corps eventually released them. But the Corps continued to withhold non-agency records in response to Missouri Coalition's requests, and so it brought this action. Missouri Coalition alleges that the Corps employs a \"policy or practice\" that violates FOIA, and it seeks both declaratory judgment and an injunction to prevent the Corps from relying on that purported policy or practice in response to future requests. The Corps, for its part, does not dispute that the prior withholdings identified by Missouri Coalition were unlawful, but it denies that it ever employed a policy or practice as alleged. Rather, it insists that its withholdings were caused by the isolated mistakes of individual employees that it has since rectified. For that reason, it maintains that Missouri Coalition is not entitled to the equitable relief sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties have cross-moved for summary judgment. For the reasons explained below, Missouri Coalition's motion will be granted, and the Corps' motion will be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The group advocates for the preservation of Missouri's wetlands and water bodies, among other environmental causes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.

To support its claim that these denials were merely one-off mistakes, the Corps relies mainly on Levins's declaration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s MSJ at 9. In that declaration, he asserts that an informal review of the St. Louis District's FOIA procedures \"indicated that, during the transition of paralegals [in 2016 and 2017], the District had not been applying the Exemption 5 Deliberative Process Privilege as uniformly or in the same manner as it had before the departure of the primary FOIA paralegal in the Fall of 2016.\" Levins Decl. \u00b6 4. The Court has no reason to doubt that conclusion. But the St. Louis District applied Exemption 5 to non-agency documents related to a pending Section 404 permit as early as 2013, three years before the paralegal turnover purportedly began.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Ex. A at 5-11; Pl.'s Facts Stmt. \u00b6 41. Indeed, that denial prompted MCE's first lawsuit against the Corps on this issue.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Ex. A at 5-11. And for the two St. Louis District requests made in 2017, when the \"transition of paralegals\" was occurring, the letters explaining why the Corps was withholding records under Exemption 5 were signed\n    <em>\n     by Levins\n    </em>\n    , and in one instance\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    MCE brought the request to Levins's attention and sought clarification about his response.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Ex. E at 4-5; Pl.'s Ex. F at 4-11. Moreover, neither Levins's declaration nor Bouchard's offers any similar explanation for the identical responses to requests made to the Little Rock District, where at least four different employees were involved in two separate decisions to improperly withhold application files under Exemption 5.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Ex. B at 4, 8, 15-17; Pl.'s Ex. C at 4-5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    In fact, it is remarkable what Levins's and Bouchard's declarations do not say. Upon close reading, they never dispute MCE's claim that the Corps followed a policy or practice of applying Exemption 5 to non-agency documents in application files for pending permits. They both merely state that, upon review, they determined that they had improperly applied Exemption 5 to prior requests and were taking corrective action as a result.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Levins Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; Bouchard Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. Indeed, even in the Levins declaration on which the Corps so heavily relies, he states only that the Corps determined that it had not been applying Exemption 5 \"as uniformly or in the same manner as it had\" before the personnel transition; he does not deny that the Corps has a policy or practice of applying Exemption 5 to non-agency records. Levins Decl. \u00b6 4. Beyond those declarations, it is also telling that the Corps has provided\n    <em>\n     no examples\n    </em>\n    of times when it\n    <em>\n     did\n    </em>\n    release non-agency records in application files for pending Section 404 permits. If, as the Corps now claims, the improper withholdings under Exemption 5 were merely isolated mistakes, examples of times when it released the application files for pending permits should abound. But the Corps offers none.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    To discount the weight of MCE's evidence, the Corps contends that the St. Louis and Little Rock Districts must be treated separately, and that MCE must show that each district independently had a policy or practice that violated FOIA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Opp'n at 2-5. Applying that framework, the Corps argues, MCE has only provided two instances of this alleged practice in Little Rock and three in St. Louis, hardly sufficient to demonstrate a pattern.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524281\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/108/#p135\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But the Court fails to\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    why MCE's allegations must be partitioned as the Corps insists. MCE does not limit its claim for relief to just those two districts in its complaint, and instead specifically alleges that the Corps as a whole has employed the unlawful policy or practice at issue in this suit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54, 61, 63. And surely, a plaintiff need not proffer instances of an alleged policy or practice in every single Corps district to show that a policy or practice exists. As it happens, MCE submitted its requests to the St. Louis and Little Rock Districts, and it is those districts that applied this alleged policy or practice to its requests. If anything, the fact that MCE received unlawful responses from two different Corps districts only further evidences that the Corps maintained a policy or practice and that the decisions to withhold the records at issue were not isolated mistakes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    At bottom, MCE has provided considerable evidence of a policy or practice by the Corps to improperly withhold non-agency documents related to pending Section 404 permits, and the Corps has offered scant evidence to rebut that showing. The Court can reasonably draw no other conclusion than that the Corps follows a policy or practice of unlawfully applying Exemption 5. Accordingly, MCE is entitled to summary judgment on its claim that the Corps maintains a policy or practice that violates FOIA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Appropriate Remedy\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    MCE seeks two forms of equitable relief: (1) a declaratory judgment that the Corps follows a policy or practice of unlawfully withholding non-agency documents in pending Section 404 permit application files under Exemption 5 and (2) an injunction prohibiting the Corps from employing that policy or practice in the future.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 63-64.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Given the Court's conclusion that the Corps has employed the above policy or practice in violation of FOIA, MCE is, at a minimum, entitled to a declaratory judgment. MCE represents that it will continue to file FOIA requests seeking those types of documents,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Navarro Decl. \u00b6 6, and the Corps' adherence to the unlawful policy, despite multiple lawsuits and administrative appeals questioning its validity, at the very least warrants that relief.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Payne\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">\n     837 F.2d at 494\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"The Secretary's inability to deal with the [agency] officers' noncompliance with the FOIA, and the Air Force's persistent refusal to end a practice for which it offers no justification, entitle Payne to declaratory relief.\");\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"Payne has an undeniable right to the [records at issue,] ... and it is entitled to a judgment in support of its claim.\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     President v.

Indeed, the Corps does not appear to contest that a declaratory judgment is unwarranted upon a finding that it maintained an unlawful policy or practice.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Opp'n at 7 (arguing only that \"granting MCE prospective injunctive relief for future FOIA requests is not warranted\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    MCE contends that an injunction is also necessary to ensure that the Corps will not improperly withhold application files for pending permits when MCE requests them in the future.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s MSJ at 19; Pl.'s Reply at 7-8. But the Corps insists that the record here, particularly Levins's and Bouchard's supplementary declarations affirming their positions on the proper application Exemption 5, shows that an injunction is unnecessary to ensure that it will not wrongfully deny MCE access to Section 404 permit application files in the future.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s MSJ at 12-13; Def.'s Opp'n at 7-12.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The Court agrees with the Corps on the propriety of injunctive relief. Even if an agency maintains an unlawful policy or practice such that a FOIA plaintiff is entitled to declaratory relief, the heightened remedy of injunctive relief is not necessarily appropriate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Muckrock\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524281\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/108/#p135\">\n     300 F.Supp.3d at 136-37\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"When injunctive relief is sought [on a policy-or-practice claim], 'the necessary determination is that there exists some cognizable danger of recurrent violation, something more than the mere possibility which serves to keep the case alive.' \"\n    <em>\n     Judicial Watch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517659\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/770/#p777\">\n     895 F.3d at 783\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Further demonstrating the Corps' good-faith efforts to comply with FOIA, when MCE questioned whether Levins's and Bouchard's initial declarations sufficiently addressed MCE's dispute over how the Corps had been employing Exemption 5, both filed supplemental declarations clarifying their districts' positions that the specific documents MCE identified in the complaint are not exempt under Exemption 5.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    2d Levins Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5; 2d Bouchard Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    And while they cannot speak to the other three Corps districts in Missouri, absent any suggestion to the contrary, the Court assumes that those districts will also comply with the judgment of the Court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ctr. for the Study of Servs. v.

MCE, for its part, points to the prior lawsuits it filed in 2013 and 2014, arguing that the Corps' continued practice of improperly applying Exemption 5 even after settling those suits reflects a lack of good faith.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Reply at 7-8. But it does not argue that the Corps tried to skirt its obligations under those settlements.

For whatever reason, the Corps does not address that request in its briefing. And nothing in the record describes that request, what it specifically sought, what was released, and on what basis. Without more, Plaintiff's mere mention of that instance in a footnote does not raise a \"genuine\" dispute of material fact, in light of the considerable evidence provided by MCE that the Corps employed a consistent practice of improperly applying Exemption 5.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-70\">\n     The parties also dispute whether Levins's and Bouchard's assurances implicate the Court's jurisdiction over MCE's policy-or-practice claim.
