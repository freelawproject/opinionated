SCRIVEN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS CAUSE\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court for consideration of Plaintiff's Motion for Final Summary Judgment, (Dkt. 38), Defendant Mark Nelson's response in opposition thereto, (Dkt. 40), and Plaintiff's reply in support of its motion. (Dkt. 42)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 8, 2016, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (\"Nationwide\") issued a Certificate of Liability Insurance to \"Josh Cooper DBA: Cooper Speed - Strength School,\" which provides liability insurance coverage to \"Josh Cooper DBA: Cooper Speed - Strength School\" from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2020. The insurance policy purports to guarantee payment of damages that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury and property damage to which the insurance applies. It also provides that Nationwide would have a duty to defend against suits seeking damages covered under the policy. The policy provides that the insurance applies only to \"individual and group instruction of fitness, dance or exercise directly conducted by you, as reported to the company.\" (Dkt. 41-1 at 8) It also excludes \"instruction of sports skills activities.\" (Dkt. 41-1 at 6) It does not define either activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the coverage period, Mark Nelson (\"Nelson\"), on behalf of his minor son, filed a state court action seeking damages from Josh Cooper (\"Cooper\") and the Cooper Speed-Strength School, Inc. (\"the School\") for an incident involving his son at the School. The underlying complaint describes an unfortunate chain of events in which the minor-plaintiff was injured while engaging in an agility drill devised and prepared by Josh Cooper, a skills trainer, and the Cooper Speed-Strength School, Inc. The complaint explains that the minor was running alongside the skills trainer toward a set goal, when the skills trainer ran into a plate glass window. The window shattered on impact, and a jagged piece of glass caused severe cuts to the minor's hand and arm. On behalf of the minor, Nelson alleges a negligence claim against Cooper and the School, among others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nationwide filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment asserting that, as a matter of law, the allegations in the underlying complaint do not implicate the subject insurance policy and, thus, do not give rise to a duty to defend Cooper or the School. It contends that the insurance policy covers only Josh Cooper, individually, and only for damages arising from fitness, dance, and exercise instruction conducted directly by Cooper. Nationwide claims the conduct that allegedly caused injury involved agility drills, which Nationwide characterizes as a sports skills activity, which is expressly excluded under the Policy, and claims further that the activity was not conducted directly by Cooper. It also disclaims a duty to defend Cooper's business entity, Cooper Speed-Strength School, Inc. because it asserts that the Policy does not cover the School at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Nelson claims that the policy covers both Cooper and the School due to an endorsement that adds the School as an additional insured. Nelson also asserts that the language in the underlying complaint does not allege that Cooper or the School was involved in \"sports skills training,\" but rather alleges general fitness training, which is expressly covered under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To prevail on this motion, Nationwide must show that there is no reading of the underlying complaint that invokes any basis for coverage under its insurance policy. The applicable standard of proof, referred to as the \"eight corners doctrine,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   requires Nationwide to demonstrate that a comparison of the four corners of the complaint with the four corners of the policy reveals no scenario in which coverage would be provided under the policy, thereby vitiating the insurer's duty to defend. This it cannot do. Regardless of whether they are true, the broad allegations in the Underlying Complaint facially implicate the insurance provisions providing coverage for both Josh Cooper and the Cooper Speed-Strength School, Inc. and triggering Nationwide's duty to defend. Thus, for the reasons stated herein, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Nationwide's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    1. Insurance Policy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nationwide issued under its \"Fitness Instructors\" program Policy No. 6B RPG 5861300 (\"Insurance Policy\") to \"Sports, Leisure &amp; Entertainment RPG DBA: Fitness Instructor\" for the policy period from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2020. (Dkt. 41 at \u00b6 1; Dkt 41-1 at 1) The named insured on the Insurance Policy was designated \"Sports, Leisure &amp; Entertainment Risk Purchasing Group and its enrolled member fitness or dance instructors whose names are on file with the company and for which an appropriate premium has been paid and to whom a certificate of insurance has been issued.\" (Dkt. 41 at \u00b6 5; Dkt 41-1 at 3) Thus, in order to be insured under the Insurance Policy, a member of the risk purchasing group would need to be issued a certificate of insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 8, 2016, Josh Cooper (\"Cooper\"), through his retail agent Vincent Ruilova, submitted a final summary of the renewal application (\"Application\"), which appears to be a summary of an online application for coverage under the Insurance Policy. (Dkt. 41 at \u00b6 5; Dkt. 26-2) Under the section titled \"Terms &amp; Conditions,\" the Application states, \"This program only provides coverage for your individual\n   operations as an instructor,\" and the Policy \"does not extend coverage for activities conducted by employees or anyone else assisting or performing on your behalf.\" (Dkt. 41 at \u00b6 6; Dkt. 26-2 at 2) Notably, the Insurance Policy issued does not contain a similar provision, and indeed, contains provisions suggesting otherwise. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 41-1 at 56 (noting that sponsors, co-promoters, and owners, managers, and lessors of premises are insured for \"liability for 'bodily injury', 'property damage' or 'personal and advertising injury' caused, in whole or in part, by your acts or omissions or the acts or omissions of those acting on your behalf\"); Dkt. 41-1 at 35 (providing coverage for \"you and your fitness/dance business entity\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the same date, on behalf of Nationwide, a Certificate of Liability Insurance was issued providing coverage under the Policy for \"Josh Cooper DBA: Cooper Speed - Strength School.\" (Dkt. 41 at \u00b6 8; Dkt. 26-3) The Policy's Commercial General Liability Coverage affords both Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability Coverage and Legal Liability to Participants Coverage, subject to certain terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions. (Dkt. 41 at \u00b6 9; Dkt. 41-1) The Insurance Policy contains a number of endorsements and amendments, which purport to either add, limit, or exclude the coverage under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The relevant coverage provisions under the Insurance Policy are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1. The Commercial General Liability Coverage Form provides, in part, that \"[Nationwide] will pay those sums that the Insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking those damages.\" (Dkt. 41-1 at 19)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   2. The Insurance Policy defines \"bodily injury\" as \"bodily injury, sickness, or disease sustained by a person. This includes mental anguish, mental injury, shock, fright, humiliation, emotional distress or death resulting from bodily injury, sickness or disease.\" (Dkt. 41-1 at 31)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   3. An endorsement entitled \"LEGAL LIABILITY TO PARTICIPANTS\" (\"Legal Liability to Participants Endorsement\") that modifies the Commercial General Liability Coverage Form provides, in pertinent part, that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Nationwide] will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \"bodily injury\" to any \"participants.\" [Nationwide] will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking those damages. However, [Nationwide] will have no duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking damages for 'bodily injury' to which this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any 'occurrence' and settle any claim or suit that may result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (Dkt. 41-1 at 47) The endorsement defines \"participants\" as \"[a]ny person who is participating in athletic or recreational activities, and/or training programs conducted by you.\" (Dkt. 41-1 at 48)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The pertinent exclusions and limitations under the Insurance Policy are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1. The \"DESIGNATED OPERATIONS\" exclusion (\"Designated Operations Exclusion\") provides: \"This insurance does not apply to the operations in the Schedule of this endorsement, regardless of whether\n   such operations are conducted by you on your behalf or whether the operations are conducted for yourself or for others.\" (Dkt. 41-1 at 6) The Schedule in the Designated Operations Exclusion lists,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]nstruction of sports skills activities\" and \"[o]wnership, operation or management of a fitness, dance or sports facility\" among the \"designated operations\" to which the insurance does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   apply. (Dkt. 41-1 at 6)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2. The \"LIMITATION OF COVERAGE TO DESIGNATED PREMISES, ACTIVITES OR OPERATIONS\" (\"Designated Activities Limitation\") endorsement provides, in pertinent part: \"All coverages are modified as follows: This insurance applies only to: ... [t]he activities or operations shown in the Schedule.\" (Dkt 41-1 at 8) The Schedule in the Designated Activities Limitation lists the following \"Activities and Operations\": \"Individual or group instruction of fitness, dance or exercise directly conducted by you, as reported to the company\" as the \"Designated Activities\" to which the insurance\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   apply. (Dkt. 41-1 at 8)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Therefore, the policy provides that the insurance applies only to \"individual or group instruction of fitness, dance or exercise directly conducted by you, as reported to the company,\" but excludes \"ownership, operation or management of a fitness, dance or sports facility\" and \"instruction of sports skills activities.\" (Dkt. 41-1 at 6, 8)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Moreover, the Insurance Policy explains that \"[t]hroughout this policy the words 'you' and 'your' refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy.\" (Dkt. 41-1 at 19)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Additionally, the Insurance Policy contains several provisions describing who is insured under the policy. First, as noted above, the named insured on the Policy is designated as \"Sports, Leisure &amp; Entertainment Risk Purchasing Group and its enrolled member fitness or dance instructors whose names are on file with the company and for which an appropriate premium has been paid and to whom a certificate of insurance has been issued.\" (Dkt. 41 at \u00b6 5; Dkt 41-1 at 3) The Parties agree that the certificate of insurance pertinent to this case was issued to \"Josh Cooper DBA: Cooper Speed - Strength School.\" (Dkt. 41 at \u00b6 8; Dkt. 26-3) The Insurance Policy defines \"insured\" as \"\n   <em>\n    any person or organization qualifying\n   </em>\n   as such under Section II - Who is An Insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The section entitled \"WHO IS AN INSURED\" was amended multiple times by endorsement. Not all of the amendments contain an effective date and therefore it is unclear which provisions were in effect at the time the Underlying Action was initiated. One endorsement entitled \"POLICY CHANGES\" (\"Policy Changes Endorsement\"), which has an effective date of January 1, 2016 states, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Section II - Who is an Insured, is replaced with the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Section II - Who is an Insured\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1. If you are designated in the declarations as:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   a. An individual, you and your fitness/dance business entity\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   [sic] an insured, but only with respect to your conduct of business of which you are the owner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Dkt. 41-1 at 35) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    2. Underlying Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On or about September 23, 2016, Nelson filed a lawsuit against the School, styled\n   <em>\n    Mark Nelson, as parent and natural guardian of D.N., minor v. Cooper Speed-Strength School, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , in the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County, Florida, Case No. 16-CA-008970 (\"Underlying Action\"). (Dkt. 41 at \u00b6 18) On or about November 9, 2016, Nelson filed an Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial (\"Underlying Complaint\") in the Underlying Action adding Cooper, among others, as a defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the Underlying Complaint, Nelson, no doubt aware of the policy coverage provisions, expressly alleges that before or during July 2016, Nelson's minor son, D.N. \"began participating in individual or group instruction for\n   <em>\n    fitness\n   </em>\n   .\" (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6) (emphasis added) D.N.'s instructional sessions included agility drills which were conducted at the School, which according to Nelson, \"held itself out to the public as a sports training center which provided athletes with the highest levels of athletic performance training.\" (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8) On or about July 24, 2016, D.N. participated in an agility drill involving \"a game in which participants would try to throw a football into a 'goal' made from a tractor tire, while other participants or trainers would try to block or prevent the person with the football from reaching the goal.\" (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6 10) \"While D.N. was carrying a football and running toward the goal, a trainer ran ahead or parallel to him.\" (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6 11) \"The trainer failed to stop as both he and [D.N.] ran near the goal, and the trainer ran into the plate glass window at the end of the room.\" (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6 12) The window shattered and \"[a] jagged piece of glass caused severe cuts to [D.N.]'s right hand and arm, causing him to suffer serious injuries.\" (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Based on these factual allegations, the Underlying Complaint alleges one count of negligence against the School, one count of negligence against Cooper, one count of negligence against Devin Valencia, the trainer who ran with D.N. during the agility drill with D.N., and one count of negligence against WMI Sunstate Center, LLC, the property owner of the building in which the School operated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 41-2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In the negligence count against the School, Nelson alleges that the School \"had a duty to supervise the agility drill and conduct it with care for the safety of participants, including [D.N.].\" (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6 17) According to Nelson, the School, through its officers and agents, committed negligent acts including but not limited to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   a) Allowing the agility drill to be conducted in a relatively small indoor space, rather than outdoors, in violation of its own internal policies;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   b) Placing the goal close to the plate glass window, which posed a safety hazard to participants;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   c) Failing to place a soft barrier in front of the plate glass window so people taking part in the agility drill would not run into the plate glass and shatter it;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   d) Failing to replace the plate glass with a type of safety glass which would not shatter and spray shards on impact;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   e) Failing to supervise [D.N.] and take reasonable steps to ensure that he would not be exposed to hazards as a result of taking part in agility drills in a relatively small indoor space;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   f) Failing to enforce its own policies or safety procedures regarding where\n   and when agility drills could be safely conducted;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   g) Failing to create and implement reasonable safety standards and procedures to prevent harm from inappropriate use of indoor spaces;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   h) Failing to warn minor children and their parents that activities involving running would be conducted in close proximity to hazards such as a plate glass window; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   i) Failing to provide protective gear or clothing to [D.N.] to prevent reasonably foreseeable injuries such as injuries from flying broken glass.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6 18)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As to Cooper, the Underlying Complaint alleges that he had a duty to either \"(1) conduct the agility drill in a reasonably safe manner or (2) supervise the agility drill to ensure that it was conducted by his subordinate employees or agents with reasonable care for the safety of participants, including [D.N.].\" (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6 36) The negligent acts asserted against Cooper are nearly identical to those against the School, the differences being (1) the allegations against Cooper substitute the pronoun \"it\" for \"his\" and (2) the following alterations to subsection (e) and (f):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   e) Failing to supervise\n   <em>\n    the Strength School employees and agents, along with [D.N.]\n   </em>\n   , and failing to take reasonable steps to ensure that [D.N.] would not be exposed to hazards as a result of taking part in agility drills in a relatively small indoor space.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   f) Failing to enforce his own policies or safety procedures\n   <em>\n    , or Strength School's own policies or safety procedures, regarding\n   </em>\n   where and when agility drills could be safely conducted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6 37) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Nelson asserts that D.N. \"suffered bodily injury, resulting pain and suffering, disability, disfigurement, scarring, emotional distress, mental anguish, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, expense of hospitalization, medical and nursing care and treatment, and loss of the ability to earn money.\" (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 33, 39, 45)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Despite these broad allegations, Nationwide seeks entry of summary judgment that it does not have a duty to defend Cooper or the School in the Underlying Action because the claims asserted and damages sought are expressly excluded by the Designated Operations Exclusion and the Designated Activities Limitation.

Fla. Sept. 29, 2010). By the express terms of the Application, the completion of the contract is not effectuated until and unless there is \"receipt of premium payment.\" Thus, the Court finds that the last act necessary to complete the instant Insurance Policy was the receipt of the premium payment from either the insured to the insurer or insurer's agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Parties, however, do not provide the Court with the location where the premium payment was received. Nelson provides only the location from which the payment was sent (Florida) and contends that Florida law should therefore apply. Nationwide details only the location where the Policy was \"issued for delivery\" (Indiana), and claims that Indiana law should apply. Thus, it is unclear which state's law should apply in this case. However, the Parties acknowledge that the laws in both states on the interpretation of an insurance policy are similar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 38 at 9 n.2 (stating that the rules for interpreting an insurance policy under Indiana law \"are substantively the same under Florida law\"); Dkt. 40 at 4 (affirming that \"even if Indiana law does apply to this issue, it is similar to - and at least as favorable to an insured - as is Florida law\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court finds that the laws of the two states are sufficiently similar that analysis under either would yield the same result. It appears that the only significant difference is whether the Court may look beyond the pleadings in the action and the terms of the contract (the so called \"eight corners\") to determine an insurer's duty to defend.

Duty to Defend Cooper in the Underlying Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As to its duty to defend Cooper, Defendant argues that the claims made and damages sought in the Underlying Action are expressly excluded by the Designated Operations Exclusion and the Designated Activities Limitation in the Insurance Policy. The Designated Operations Exclusion excludes coverage for \"[o]wnership, operation or management of a fitness, dance or sports facility\" and \"[i]nstruction of sports skills activities.\" (Dkt. 41-1 at 6) The Designated Activities Limitation endorsement provides that the Insurance Policy only applies to \"[i]ndividual or group instruction of fitness, dance or exercise directly conducted\n   <em>\n    by you\n   </em>\n   , as reported to the company.\" (Dkt 41-1 at 8) (emphasis added). According to Nationwide, because the Underlying Complaint alleges that the\n   School holds itself out to be a sports training center, and that D.N. \"was injured while participating in a training session conducted by an unidentified trainer - not by the Named Insured, Cooper,\" coverage for the Underlying Action is excluded under both the Designated Operations Exclusion and the Designated Activities Limitation endorsements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Regarding the Designated Activities Limitation, Nationwide contends that the Underlying Action is not covered because the instruction underlying the negligence claim was conducted by a skills trainer, not Cooper. However, contrary to Nationwide's assertions, the Underlying Complaint, does allege that Cooper, himself, was negligent in the instruction of the agility drill. Indeed, Nelson alleges that Cooper had a duty to either \"(1) conduct the agility drill in a reasonably safe manner or (2) supervise the agility drill to ensure that it was conducted by his subordinate employees or agents with reasonable care for the safety of participants, including [D.N.].\" (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6 36) Further, Nelson alleges that Cooper breached his duty by,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   a) Allowing the agility drill to be conducted in a relatively small indoor space, rather than outdoors, in violation of his own internal policies;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   b) Placing the goal close to the plate glass window, which posed a safety hazard to participants;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   c) Failing to place a soft barrier in front of the plate glass window so people taking part in the agility drill would not run into the plate glass and shatter it;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   d) Failing to supervise the Strength School employees and agents, along with [D.N.], and failing to take reasonable steps to ensure that [D.N.] would not be exposed to hazards as a result of taking part in agility drills in a relatively small indoor space;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   e) Failing to enforce his own policies or safety procedures, or Strength School's own policies or safety procedures, regarding where and when agility drills could be safely conducted;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   f) Failing to provide protective gear or clothing to [D.N.] to prevent reasonably foreseeable injuries such as injuries from flying broken glass.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6 37) ) As demonstrated, the allegations against Cooper do not merely involve Cooper's supervisory capacity, but instead allege direct oversight in connection with the agility drill. The Underlying Complaint alleges that Cooper \"plac[ed] the goal to close to plate glass window,\" \"fail[ed] to place a soft barrier in front of the plate glass window,\" and \"failed to provide safety gear or clothing to [D.N.]\" in preparation for the agility drill. (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6 37) These allegations assert that Cooper took an active role in the instruction of the alleged fitness exercise, particularly in the devising and preparation of the drill, which can rationally be seen as part of the instruction of the drill. Therefore, these allegations fit within the limitation of the Designation Activities Limitation endorsement because, as alleged in the complaint, the activity was \"individual and group instruction of fitness, dance, or exercise conducted\" at least in part, directly by Cooper.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, (...

Thus, the Designation Activities Limitation does not remove Nationwide's duty to defend Cooper in the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Nationwide also contends that the Designated Operations Exclusion excuses its duty to defend Cooper in the Underlying Action because it excludes coverage for \"[o]wnership, operation or management of a fitness, dance or sports facility\" and \"[i]nstruction of sports skills activities.\" (Dkt. 41-1 at 6) With respect to the \"[o]wnership, operation or management of a fitness, dance or sports facility\" portion of the exclusion, the Court finds that the exclusion does not apply because the Underlying Complaint contains allegations against Cooper that assert negligence in the instruction of the particular activity in which D.N. was involved. Nelson alleges that Cooper failed to properly conduct the exercise in a safe manner and his failure resulted in D.N.'s injury. As explained above, these allegations are not merely assertions that Cooper was negligent in the general ownership, operation, management of the facility. Thus, the Designated Operations Exclusion will not preclude the duty to defend on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Moreover, the Court finds that the Designated Operations Exclusion does not preclude the duty to defend Cooper in the Underlying Action based on its exclusion of the instruction \"sports skills activities.\" The Insurance Policy provides no definition of \"sports skills activities\" and does not attempt to distinguish instruction of \"sports skills activities,\" which is excluded under the policy, from instruction of \"fitness\" or \"exercise,\" which is covered under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \"If a word or phrase is not defined in the policy, then the court should construe the word or phrase according to the meaning a person of ordinary intelligence would reasonably give it.\"\n   <em>\n    Timber Pines Plaza, LLC v.

If not ambiguous standing alone, it is certainly ambiguous in a policy that purports to include fitness activities as covered activities and to exclude sports skill activities from coverage, without defining either. The term can be read to include only those activities that involve the practice of a particular sport. For instance, practicing jump shots for basketball or practicing swings in baseball. However, \"sports skills activities\" is susceptible to a broader construction. It could encompass any \"exercise\" or \"fitness\" activity that has a residual effect on a person's ability in a sport. For example, lifting weights for strength in wrestling or running sprints for speed in football, or, as in the case in point, practicing agility skills that can have cross-over application in any sport and in fitness in general. Because the term \"sports skills activities\" is ambiguous in the Insurance Policy it must be construed in favor of the insured\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As explained, the more narrow construction of \"sports skills activities\" would include only those activities that involve the practice of a particular sport. Because this interpretation would limit the exclusion to a narrower set of activities and hence, provide more coverage to the insured, the Court adopts this construction. This ambiguity is highlighted by the allegations in the Underlying Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Underlying Complaint alleges that D.N. \"aspired to develop\n   <em>\n    speed and strength\n   </em>\n   to improve his skills as a baseball player.\" (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6 5) (emphasis added) \"As part of that effort, [D.N.] began participating in individual and group instruction for\n   <em>\n    fitness\n   </em>\n   .\" (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6 6) Of course, baseball training could be considered distinct from general fitness training for speed and strength that has a residual effect on a person's athleticism in baseball. The Underlying Complaint does not allege that D.N. sought baseball training from the School. Moreover, the Underlying Complaint alleges that the injury D.N. sustained occurred during \"agility drills,\" which can be best interpreted as a drill designed to improve the participant's agility, not the practice of any particular sport. Notably, using a football for improving baseball agility would suggest even more strongly that the activity had more to do with fitness and not a particular sport skill. Thus, the Court finds that the conduct alleged in the Underlying Complaint is not\n   narrowly \"sports training activity\" as Nationwide contends. Moreover, it is at least uncertain whether an \"agility drill\" with crossover benefit is a \"sports training activity,\" and not \"individual ... instruction of fitness\" as contemplated by the policy, and that uncertainty must be resolved in favor of the insured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Indem.

Fla. 2018) (stating that insurance provisions must be construed in favor of the insured \"when a genuine inconsistency, uncertainty, or ambiguity in meaning remains after resort to the ordinary rules of construction\"). In fact, Nationwide itself characterizes the Underlying Complaint as alleging \"fitness and exercise instruction.\" (Dkt. 42 at 3) (\"It is undisputed that the claims made and damages alleged by Nelson in the Underlying Lawsuit resulted from fitness or exercise instruction ....\") Hence, the Court finds that the Designated Operations Exclusion does not bar Nationwide's duty to defend Cooper in the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Duty to Defend The School in the Underlying Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Parties additionally dispute whether the Insurance Policy covers the School.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nationwide contends that the Policy covers only Cooper because the Certificate of Insurance was issued to \"Josh Cooper DBA: Cooper Speed - Strength School.\" (Dkt. 41 at \u00b6\u00b6 5,8; Dkt. 26-3; Dkt 41-1 at 3) Nationwide asserts that the \"d/b/a\" or \"doing business as\" designation of the School merely constitutes a fictitious name and not a separate legal entity. (Dkt. 42 at 4) Thus, according to Nationwide, the School is not an additional Named Insured. Nelson contends that the \"d/b/a\" designation is not without legal significance and that the description of the Named Insured should be construed to include the School as a named insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   However, as Nelson points out, even if the Court were to accept that the School is not a\n   <em>\n    named\n   </em>\n   insured, the Policy Changes Endorsement in the Insurance Policy would nonetheless include the School as an insured. The Policy Changes Endorsement has an effective date of January 1, 2016 and provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Section II - Who is an Insured, is replaced with the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Section II - Who is an Insured\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   1.

Courts have construed policies containing similar language to cover the additional insured for both the acts of the named insured and for the additional insured's own actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amerisure Ins.

App. 2014) (noting that in the landlord-tenant context, a provision listing a lessor as an additional insured provides coverage to that lessor so long as the underlying complaint bears more than a \"isolated connection\" to the premises leased to the named insured lessee). Here, because Nationwide makes no argument that this endorsement does not pertain to the School, it has failed to demonstrate that it has no duty to defend the School under this provision of the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Nationwide argues that irrespective of whether the School is an insured under the policy, coverage for the School in the Underlying Action is nonetheless excluded because the Designated Activities Limitation restricts coverage to \"individual and group instruction of fitness, dance, or exercise\n   <em>\n    directly conducted by you\n   </em>\n   .\" (Dkt 42 at 2-3) (emphasis added) It follows, according to Nationwide, that because \"you\" and \"your\" are defined under the Insurance Policy as the \"Named Insured,\" coverage is limited only to direct conduct of the Named Insured, in this case, Cooper. The Court finds this argument unpersuasive. The Court acknowledges that the Insurance Policy provides that \"[t]hroughout this policy the words 'you' and 'your' refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations,\" but it also expressly states that \"you\" and \"your\" includes \"any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy.\" (Dkt. 41-1 at 19) Notably, the Insurance Policy then defines \"insured\" as \"any person or organization qualifying as such under Section II - Who is An Insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, \"you\" and \"your\" can reasonably be interpreted to refer to a Named \"Insured,\" or more specifically, a named \"person or organization qualifying as [an insured] under Section II - Who is An Insured.\" Because the School, pursuant to the Policy Changes Endorsement, is such an entity, \"you\" and \"your\" can also reasonably be read to include the School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \"An insurance company, as drafter of the policy, has the obligation of spelling out in clear, unambiguous language exactly who is covered by the policy and who is to be excluded.

Here, even if it is not clear that the School is a named insured, by virtue of the Policy Changes Endorsement, it is at least ambiguous whether \"you\" and \"your\" refer only to Cooper or to Cooper and the School. \"Insured\" is a word within the phrase \"Named Insured,\" and the Insurance Policy defines the word \"insured\" to include the School. The Court will not allow Nationwide to split hairs on these two significant terms where it has failed to expressly delineate any distinction between the two. Thus, if there is any ambiguity, the Court resolves this ambiguity in favor of the insured and finds that the both Cooper and the School are insureds under the Insurance Policy, and that to the extent the words \"you\" and \"your\" are used throughout the Policy, it refers to both Cooper and the School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Thus, the Designated Activities Limitation limits coverage under the Insurance Policy to \"individual and group instruction of fitness, dance, or exercise directly conducted by\" Cooper or the School.
