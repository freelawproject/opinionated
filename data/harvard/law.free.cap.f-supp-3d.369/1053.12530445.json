The Court grants the motion for summary judgment of Defendant Republican National Committee (\"RNC\"), denies Peterman's partial motion for summary judgment on the merits, and denies Peterman's motion to compel as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the spring of 2017, Peterman contracted with the Montana Democratic Party (\"MDP\") to take photographs on March 18, 2017 at the Mansfield-Metcalf Dinner, an annual Democratic fundraising event. (Doc. 28 at 4.) For a $ 500 fee, Peterman photographed the event. (Doc. 28 at 4.) Several of the photos feature Rob Quist, a singer-songwriter and then-Democratic candidate for Montana's lone seat in the House of Representatives. (Doc. 33-2.) One of the photos (referred to as the \"Work\") shows Quist neck-up from behind, his cowboy hat slightly illuminated, with three stage lights in the distance. (Doc. 1-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Peterman edited the photos and shared them with the MDP on March 21, 2017. (Doc. 28 at 5.) Peterman retained ownership of the pictures, granting unrestricted royalty-free licenses to the MDP and the Quist Campaign for no additional fee. (Doc. 28 at 6.) As licensees, both the MDP and the Quist Campaign posted the Work to Facebook without including any photographer attribution or copyright information. The MDP posted the Work without a caption and as part of a series of images\n   from the Mansfield-Metcalf Dinner, and the Quist Campaign posted the Work as a stand-alone image, captioned with an invitation to a public lands rally. (Doc. 33-7 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 9, 2017, Peterman learned that an independent expenditure unit of the RNC had issued mailers appropriating the Work and criticizing Quist to bolster the campaign of his Republican opponent, Congressman Greg Gianforte. The vendor that prepared the mailer on the RNC's behalf had downloaded the photo as a high-resolution image directly from the Quist Campaign's Facebook page. (Doc. 33-5.) No copyright information or photographer credit was included on the Facebook post, and the parties agree that it would have been reasonable for the RNC to assume that the Quist Campaign owned the Work. (Doc. 40 at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The mailer includes three images of Quist, all of which the RNC's vendor found on the Quist Campaign's Facebook page.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the front panel, next to the address block, Quist stands in front of a microphone holding a guitar and wearing a bolo tie, leather vest, and what appears to be the same cowboy hat worn in the Work. (Doc. 28-1.) A treble clef appears at the top of the panel, with the words \"Tell Liberal Rob Quist: / It's Time to Face the Music\" over the adjacent music staff. (Doc. 28-1.) Inside the mailer is a photoshopped image of Quist playing guitar and singing, dressed in the same outfit and hat as on the front panel, accompanied by current House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi on accordion. (Doc. 28-1.) At the top of the page, a treble clef precedes a staff over which is written \"Liberal / Rob Quist / Music to Nancy Pelosi's Ears.\" (Doc. 28-1.) Text appears in the same style at the bottom of the page, with music notes in place of the treble clef. (Doc. 28-1.) There, the text reads, \"Rob Quist &amp; Nancy Pelosi / Singing the Same Tune.\" (Doc. 28-1.) Finally, the Work covers the back panel. (Doc. 28-1.) It is cropped slightly, and light streams down from the stage lights, a variation from the original. (Doc. 28-1.) The same treble clef and staff cover the bottom left corner of the panel, reading, \"For Montana Conservatives, / Liberal Rob Quist / Can't Hit the Right Note.\" (Doc. 28-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 12, 2017, Peterman registered the Work with the Copyright Office. (Doc. 28 at 6.) She filed her Complaint on May 16, 2017, alleging copyright infringement and intentional interference with economic advantage. (Doc. 1.) On March 19, 2018, this Court granted in part and denied in part the RNC's motion to dismiss, dismissing Peterman's claim for intentional interference with economic advantage and allowing the copyright infringement claim to proceed.

The RNC argues that it is nonetheless entitled to summary judgment because the evidence establishes the affirmative defense of fair use. In the alternative, the RNC seeks partial summary judgment on the issues of willfulness and the measure of damages, contending that Peterman cannot recover more than a single award of statutory damages. Peterman does not address the statutory damages issue, ostensibly conceding that she is not entitled to an award of statutory damages for each individual mailer. Instead, she argues that she is entitled to partial summary judgment as to fair use and that the issue of willfulness should proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court agrees with the parties that there is no genuine dispute of material fact bearing on the fair use inquiry. Because it finds that the relevant factors weigh in favor of fair use, it grants the RNC's motion for summary judgment and does not reach the remainder of the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[T]he fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction ... for purposes such as criticism[ ] [or] comment ... is not an infringement of copyright.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20107\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The question is whether the appropriation of the original leads to a \"new creation,\" either through changes to the work itself or through placement of the work in \"a different context.\"\n   <em>\n    Wall Data Inc. v.

The RNC made two minimal alterations to the Work,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   cropping it to fit the mailer and adding a soft stream of light from the three stage lights shining at Quist. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Doc. 28-1.) These alterations are not, on their own, sufficiently transformative to find for the RNC. The cropping is irrelevant. The RNC merely did away with black space in the image so that it would fill the back panel of the mailer. The added glow of light is somewhat closer to transformative, but it is too subtle to alter the function of the Work. Indeed, to the degree that the addition alters the Work, it intensifies the feeling of the original, playing up Quist's background as a musician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   More significantly, the RNC added a treble clef and text critical of Quist to the bottom-left corner of the image, repeating a visual theme used throughout the mailer. On its own, this alteration would not be enough to render the use transformative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its Order on the RNC's motion to dismiss, the Court did not have the entire mailer before it-only the back panel appropriating the Work. At that stage of litigation, the Court determined that this addition was not sufficiently transformative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court now has the mailer before it, and the RNC's context-based argument requires further examination. The mailer uses Quist's musicianship to criticize his candidacy, subverting the purpose and function of the Work. With the addition of the treble clefs and text throughout, the mailer attempts to create an association between Quist's musical background and liberal political views. In the context of the mailer, the image from the Mansfield-Metcalf Dinner is tied to the images of Quist on the front and interior panels; Quist even appears to be wearing the same clothes throughout, suggesting that Quist is giving a single musical performance. On the front panel, a serious-looking Quist holds his guitar. In the center of the mailer, he and Pelosi are playing side by side. On the back panel, Quist is isolated on stage, lights shining down, conveying a sense of stark emptiness and suggesting that there is no connection between the musician and the unseen audience. In this context, the image takes on a new meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In light of the mailer's clearly critical messaging, the Court finds that the RNC's use \"alter[ed] [ ] the expressive content or message of the original work.\"\n   <em>\n    Seltzer v. Green Day, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071822\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/1170/#p1177\">\n    725 F.3d 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1177 (9th Cir. 2013). Although the RNC \"ma[de] few physical changes\" to the Work, \"new expressive content or message is apparent,\" satisfying the transformation inquiry.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071822\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/1170/#p1177\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The question is not, as both parties suggest to some degree, what Peterman and the RNC subjectively intended to convey through Peterman's creation and the RNC's use of the image. Peterman argues at length that her intent was not to advance Quist's candidacy but only, in her words, \"to highlight [Quist's] duality as a political candidate and performing artist.\" (Doc. 38 at 16.) She claims that the RNC shared Peterman's intent because it, too, wanted to associate Quist's musicianship with his candidacy. Although the Court is skeptical of Peterman's asserted indifference to whether her photo (licensed royalty-free to the Quist campaign) depicted Quist positively, there is, perhaps, a factual dispute as to whether Peterman was motivated by her political beliefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   However, that factual dispute is not material and does not affect the analysis under the first factor, which focuses on the \"purpose and character of the\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   ,\" not the creator's purpose in creating the original work.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20107\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (emphasis added.)

With Peterman's permission and pursuant to an agreement that Peterman would receive no additional fee for their use of the Work, the Quist Campaign and the MDP made the Work available for download on Facebook without including any photographer attribution or copyright information. It is unclear how the Work could conceivably have any future commercial value to Peterman. The Work has no recognizable value outside of Quist's congressional campaign, and that value has been fully realized by Peterman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Peterman's own arguments demonstrate the relative strength of the RNC's position on this factor. Peterman argues that \"[i]t is possible [she] lost additional revenue from customers who might have licensed her images but did not do so because should could not guarantee the images' exclusivity. In addition, the Montana Democratic Party may not hire [her] in the future to shoot their events because she cannot guarantee her images' exclusivity.\" (Doc. 38 at 24.) However, the Copyright Act does not exist to protect artists' general reputations. No artist can guarantee exclusivity; every copyrighted work is subject to fair use.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing that exclusive rights in copyrighted works are subject to \u00a7 107 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   What is more, the Supreme Court has considered and rejected the argument that the fourth factor is satisfied when the original work loses value due to criticism.

Thus, even in the unlikely situation that the Work's value to Peterman had decreased because of the RNC's use, any decrease in value is not displacement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Thus, the fourth and most important factor of the fair use inquiry supports a finding of fair use. Weighing the four factors of the test, the Court determines that the undisputed facts establish that the RNC is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The third factor-the amount and substantiality of the portion used-weighs against fair use. The second factor supports neither party, as the original work was both creative and freely available online. However, the other two factors are determinative. The RNC's use was moderately transformative and wholly noncommercial, and it performed a different market function than did the original.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Because RNC is entitled to summary judgment on its fair use defense, the Court does not reach the issue of willfulness, and it denies as moot Peterman's motion to compel, which is relevant only to that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 31) is GRANTED, and Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 37) is DENIED.

The other two images are not at issue in this litigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The RNC argues that its good faith belief in the legality of its action and First Amendment free speech principles should be discussed within the first factor. Good faith is relevant-if at all-to a fair use defense only to the degree that a party \"abuse[s] ... the good faith and fair dealing underpinnings of the fair use doctrine.\"\n    <em>\n     Perfect 10\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/#p1163\">\n     508 F.3d 1146\n    </extracted-citation>\n    n.8 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Monge\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496994\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/1164/#p1173\">\n     688 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1173 n.6. Peterman has not argued that RNC's bad faith estops it from raising the fair use defense, and so the RNC's good faith is not at issue. The First Amendment is incorporated into the \u00a7 107 factors, as discussed elsewhere in this Order, and does not present an additional layer of protection for unauthorized uses of a copyrighted work.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    pp. 1062-63 &amp; n.4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The RNC did not itself design the mailer, using services provided by a vendor, Majority Strategies, which is not a party to this lawsuit. The Court refers to the RNC for the sake of simplicity, as RNC's potential liability for issuing the mailers designed by Majority Strategies is not at issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The RNC asks the Court to go several steps further, arguing that its use of the Work to further a political message is entitled to First Amendment protection above and beyond that built into the Copyright Act. However, the fair use defense is itself a \"built-in First Amendment accommodation,\" and the RNC cites to no precedent supporting its position that the First Amendment demands an additional layer of protection.\n    <em>\n     Eldred\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190981\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/186/#p219\">\n     537 U.S. at 219\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190981\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/186/#p219\">\n     123 S.Ct. 769\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Harper &amp; Row\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206269\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/539/#p560\">\n     471 U.S. at 558\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206269\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/539/#p560\">\n     105 S.Ct. 2218\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[T]he Framers intended copyright itself to be the engine of free expression.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Peterman suggests that the Court should turn a blind eye to the use of the photo by the MDP and the Quist Campaign because she owns the Work and they merely had a license to use the Work.
