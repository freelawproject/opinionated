(individually, \"BNY,\" \"U.S. Bank,\" and \"Citi\"; collectively \"Defendants\") for Breach of Contract, violation of the Streit Act, and violation of the Trust Indenture Act (TIA). Compl., ECF No. 1. On September 30, 2016, the Court dismissed the Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction holding that Plaintiff lacked standing to sue Defendants. ECF No. 38. On October 14, 2016 Plaintiff sought reconsideration. ECF No. 39. The Court granted reconsideration in part, permitting Plaintiff to amend its complaint to resolve the standing issue.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      ECF No. 47. Plaintiff filed its Amended Complaint on December 8, 2017. ECF No. 51. Defendants have now moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint. ECF No. 64. For the reasons outlined below, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is\n      <strong>\n       GRANTED\n      </strong>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      <strong>\n       BACKGROUND\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      <strong>\n       I. Securitization Generally\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      This matter stems from conduct of a Trustee of Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS). To create RMBS, mortgage loans are pooled together in a trust, which issues securities that represent interests in cash flows on a pool of mortgages. Am. Compl. \u00b6 39, ECF No. 50. The securitization process begins when an acquirer of mortgage loans (a \"sponsor\" or \"seller\"), such as Countrywide, sells a large pool of such loans to a depositor, which is typically a special-purpose affiliate of the sponsor.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 40. The depositor then conveys the pool of loans to a trustee, in this case BNY, pursuant to a Pooling and Service Agreement (\"PSA\").\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 41. Each securitization contains \"tranches\" of interests in payments made by borrowers on the loan.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      Each tranche has a different level of risk and reward, and its rating is issued by a nationally recognized credit agency.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 44. The most senior tranches have higher ratings and are entitled to payment in full first, but, junior tranches, which have lower ratings and are paid after senior tranches, offer higher potential rewards.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      Any shortfalls in principal and interest payments are allocated first to junior tranches.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      As payments from mortgage borrowers are the source of funds to pay certificate holders, the credit quality of the security turns on the credit quality of the underlying loans.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 45.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      The trust is tasked with issuing certificates representing tranches, which are then sold to an underwriter who re-sells the certificates at a profit to investors.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 41. The sponsor earns profit based on the excess of the proceeds of the sale of certificates to the underwriter over the cost of purchasing the mortgage loans.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      The PSA for each trust requires a \"servicer\" to manage the collection of payments on the mortgage loans.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 42. \"The servicer's duties include monitoring delinquent borrowers, foreclosing on defaulted loans, monitoring compliance with representations and warranties regarding loan origination, tracking mortgage documentation, and managing and selling foreclosed\n     properties.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      The trustee is responsible for delivering monthly remittance reports to holders of certificates, which describe the performance of underlying loans and compliance with the PSA.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 43. The servicer provides data for these reports.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      <strong>\n       II. Plaintiff's Allegations\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      At bottom, Plaintiff alleges that BNY abdicated its duties as the trustee to certificateholders such as Plaintiff in five different ways, running afoul of both the PSAs and relevant federal law.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 2. First, BNY allegedly failed to ensure that key documents for the loans were included in the mortgage files and to create an exception report identifying incomplete mortgage loan files.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 10. As a result, Defendant BNY did not ensure that the rights, title, and interest in the mortgage loans were perfected and properly conveyed, and the sponsor was not required to substitute compliant loans for the loans with incomplete files or to repurchase the loans that ultimately caused Plaintiff significant losses.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      In support of its allegations, Plaintiff notes that BNY admitted publicly that it was aware of Countrywide's pervasive failure to deliver complete mortgage files, and that BNY commenced foreclosure actions between 2005 and 2008, which highlighted pervasive document delivery issues.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6\u00b6 86-88.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-17\">\n      Second, BNY purportedly failed to notify certificateholders of any breach of mortgage loan representations that BNY discovered, which would materially and adversely affect certificateholders.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 11. Plaintiff notes that BNY was \"presented with a large number of defaulted loans that were originated by the Sponsors ... and foreclosures were often commenced in BNY Mellon's name.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 97. Review of these fillings should have led BNY to learn that \"borrowers either (i) did not qualify for the loans because they did not have the ability to repay the loans; (ii) were victims of predatory lending; or (iii) were given a loan that did not comply with state or federal law.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      Plaintiff also alleges that BNY received notice of widespread Sponsor breaches from monoline insurers,\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      and that BNY was aware of trading downgrades and the high level of defaults.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 100-111. Plaintiff claims that had BNY provided adequate notice \"the obligated parties would have been required to cure the breaches or repurchase mortgage loans that did not comply with the applicable underwriting guidelines, and that ultimately caused a significant portion of Plaintiff's losses.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      Plaintiff asserts that BNY knew or should have known that these breaches had occurred, and was also required to notify servicers when servicers breached the PSAs, which would have triggered the servicer's obligation to cure the breach.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 11.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-18\">\n      Third, BNY allegedly did not prudently exercise all available remedies once it had notice of both servicers numerous defaults and Events of Default under the PSAs, as well as breaches of mortgage loan representations and warranties.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 12. Plaintiff claims that BNY notified Countrywide that many of the mortgage files for loans underlying the relevant securities had document exceptions and these exceptions were not cured; but, even after this notification, Countrywide and other sponsors did not substitute or repurchase the loans.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 132. Plaintiff also asserts\n     that BNY knowingly accepted false certifications from servicers who were required under the PSA to certify annually that they met their obligations under the PSAs and applicable federal regulations.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 135. Accordingly, Plaintiff concludes that had BNY \"acted prudently, it would have issued repurchase demands years ago and, if necessary, commenced litigation forcing the Sponsors (or other obligated party) to repurchase defective loans or pay for losses.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 12.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-19\">\n      Fourth, BNY supposedly failed to provide accurate certifications and remittance reports, which were required under the PSAs and applicable federal law.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 13. Plaintiff notes that BNY regularly made remittance reports available to certificateholders, but did not disclose any breaches it was aware of.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 140. As a result, BNY mislead certificate holders and caused Plaintiff injury.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 13.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-20\">\n      Fifth, BNY purportedly failed to take steps to protect Plaintiff once it became aware of failures by servicers to cure problematic loans underlying relevant securities.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 14. Plaintiff asserts that servicers engaged in improper foreclosure practices wherein borrowers were charged improper and excessive fees, which were ultimately paid by certificateholders \"because when a defaulting borrower's home is foreclosed ... the Servicers deduct their fees ... and any servicing advances from sale proceeds before any funds are transferred\" to the trust.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 145-147. Plaintiff claims BNY was or should have been aware of these \"widespread servicing abuses\" and, had they investigated, would have discovered that \"the serious servicing abuses impacted the loans in the Covered Trusts.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 148.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-21\">\n      Accordingly, Plaintiff asserts three causes of action: (1) breach of contract for BNY failing to meet its obligations under the PSA; (2) violation of the Streit Act for BNY failing to \" 'use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent [person] would exercise or use under the circumstances of [their] own affairs' \"; and (3) violation of the TIA to provide certificateholders with notice of defaults within 90 days of becoming aware of such defaults and acting prudently to protect the rights of certificateholders during the period in which the default remains uncured.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-23\">\n      On March 11, 2010, Plaintiff sold the relevant Certificates as part of a resecuritization transaction, SSGM 2010-S1 (the Trust), and suffered over $ 440 million in losses.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 152. The sale was made pursuant to a Trust Agreement between Plaintiff, Wilmington Trust Company (the Owner Trustee), and Citibank N.A. (the indenture trustee).\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      In granting Defendants' previous Motion to Dismiss, the Court held that after the sale, Plaintiff's claims travelled with the securities to the resecuritized trust and thus Plaintiff no longer had standing to bring the claims it asserted.\n      <em>\n       FDIC v. Citibank N.A.\n      </em>\n      , No. 1:15-CV-6560,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208737356\">\n       2016 WL 8737356\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2016). The Court then granted Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to resolve the standing issue through ratification by the Trust pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(a)(3). ECF No. 47. In July 2017, Wilmington Trust sent Citibank an \"Issuer Order\" requiring Citibank to endorse Wilmington's ratification of this lawsuit. Am. Compl. \u00b6 24, ECF No. 50. Citibank, however, refused to sign the ratification without first receiving indemnity.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at \u00b6 26-27.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-24\">\n      <strong>\n       STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-25\">\n      \"When considering a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed R.

R. Civ. P. 17(a)(3). Accordingly, Plaintiff sought to receive ratification of its lawsuit from the real party in interest: the Resecuritization Trust.

Plaintiff, relying on its interpretation of the Indenture Agreement and on principles of equity, requests instead that the Court \"either (1) hold that the ratification of the Owner Trustee is sufficient because the Owner Trustee represents the real party in interest or because Citi is prevented from relying on its own failure to follow the Issuer Order with no legitimate rationale for refusing to do so, or (2) order Citi to endorse the ratification of the Owner Trustee as contractually required (the equitable remedy of specific performance).\" Pl.

In support of its position Plaintiff argues,\n      <em>\n       inter alia\n      </em>\n      , that Citibank provided no justification for its decision to not ratify the lawsuit, including why the indemnity it is guaranteed under the Indenture is inadequate; that the Indenture requires Citibank to perform its contractual duties notwithstanding receipt of indemnity; and that under the \"prevention doctrine\" Defendants cannot take advantage of a condition precedent (i.e., a signed ratification), the performance of which Defendants can render impossible (per Citibank's refusal to sign), to avoid Citibank's duty to follow Wilmington Trust's order to ratify the lawsuit.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 4-9.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-32\">\n      \"The district court has discretionary authority to determine whether ratification is appropriate in a given case.\"\n      <em>\n       Motta v.
