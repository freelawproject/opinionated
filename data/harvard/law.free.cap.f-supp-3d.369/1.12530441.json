After granting partial summary judgment to each party on their initial cross-motions for summary judgment, the parties continue to dispute whether EPA has conducted an adequate search, sufficiently justified the withholding of 80 records under FOIA's Exemption 5, and segregated non-privileged information for disclosure. Pending before the Court are EPA's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Def.'s 2d MSJ\"), ECF No. 37, and CBD's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Pl.'s 2d XMSJ\"), ECF No. 38.

The plaintiff takes issue with EPA's approach, contending, first, that \"EPA failed to provide a 'reasonably detailed affidavit, setting forth the search terms and the type of search performed, and averring that all files likely to contain responsive materials (if such records exist) were searched,' \" Pl.'s 2d Opp'n at 21, and, second, that EPA should have used \"the names of the listed species that EPA assessed, including the American burying beetle, whooping crane, Canada lynx, and Indiana bat, and the names of the 16 states where Enlist Duo is approved for use,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Contrary to CBD's contention, EPA has provided detailed information regarding\n   the search terms selected and used, and explained why those terms and the locations, or custodians, searched \"were reasonably calculated to locate any communications concerning the two refined risk assessments at issue in Plaintiff's FOIA requests.\" Fifth EPA PIRIB Decl. \u00b6 13; Decl. of Earl Ingram, Jr. (\"First EPA PIRIB Decl.\") \u00b6 24, ECF No. 16-2 (setting forth EPA's search terms). EPA explains that the \"search utilized the very terms that were common to both FOIA requests.\" Def.'s 2d Reply at 7. Using these terms, EPA's supplemental search \"identified 51,871 potentially responsive documents, of which only 201 were identified as responsive and not accounted for in previous productions.\" Fifth EPA PIRIB Decl. \u00b6 13. This huge volume of search returns, EPA posits, means \"if anything, these terms were overbroad as reflected by the fact that the search results produced far more potentially responsive documents than were identified to be actually responsive.\" Def.'s 2d Reply at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As for CBD's suggestion that EPA should have used\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   search terms, CBD has waived this claim. EPA \"has been in discussions with Plaintiff concerning the search parameters for the requests at issue in this case since December of 2014.\" Fifth EPA PIRIB Decl. \u00b6 12. Nonetheless, according to EPA, \"[a]t no point has the Plaintiff raised concerns with the search terms used in any of the Agency's searches up to this point.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In support of its first cross-motion for summary judgment, CBD claimed only in the most conclusory fashion that \"EPA failed to apply pertinent search terms,\" Pl.'s 1st Opp'n at 3, even though EPA's precise search terms were stated on the record in EPA's original summary judgment motion, filed in November 2016,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   First EPA PIRIB Decl. \u00b6 24; Fifth EPA PIRIB Decl. \u00b6 4.

Indeed, prior to this second round of summary judgment briefing, the parties submitted two joint status reports, which identified the issues remaining in dispute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2017 JSR; 2018 JSR, and CBD never raised any issue with EPA's search terms. CBD's belated challenge to EPA's search terms at this procedural juncture is far too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In any event, CBD \"does not explain how [additional proposed] terms should have been integrated into the search or why Plaintiff believes doing so would have increased the search results,\" Def.'s 2d Reply at 8. As discussed above, EPA avers that its search revealed far more records than were responsive to CBD's request and, thus, ironically, simply \"adding the name of a particular state to the existing search string\" would only narrow the results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, searching for a generic term, as suggested by the plaintiffs, such as \" 'Dow' without any limitation in EPA's search would have generated an even greater number of non-responsive records because Dow AgroSciences engages with EPA on many other different pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides matters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 n.5. These obvious, common sense explanations for not adopting different terms, such as those proposed by CBD, amply explain the reasonableness of the search terms employed by EPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Accordingly, EPA has adequately explained the selection of the terms used to search for responsive records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Search of Ten Additional Custodians\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   With respect to the ten individuals identified by the plaintiff as copied on relevant\n   emails but not included in EPA's initial search of custodians,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Biological Diversity\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272850\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/279/121/#p129\">\n    279 F.Supp.3d at 141-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , EPA represents that the supplemental search included nine of the ten individuals, but that the agency \"has no record of the remaining individual ever working at EPA and, therefore, could not search that individual's records.\" Def.'s 2d Mem. at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fourth EPA PIRIB Decl. \u00b6 6 n.2; Def.'s Resp.

Moreover, EPA explains that \"many of the individuals identified by Plaintiff were copied on emails circulated broadly across the Office of Pesticide Programs concerning meetings that may have mentioned Enlist Duo as one of many topics to be discussed or in connection with the development of a press release,\" Def.'s 2d Reply at 11, and that \"EPA confirmed two were only involved with press inquiries and a public event, and 21 were not in the Environmental Fate and Effects division ('EFED') that completed the assessments at issue,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \"Of the four that worked in EFED, one was an intern and not even an employed member of the division,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , whereas \"[t]he other three were not on the EFED team that developed the risk assessments that were the subject of the Plaintiff's requests,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, EPA claims that with respect to all 26 individuals whose records CBD argues should have been searched, the agency \"properly determined that these individuals did not have a level of involvement in the development of the\n   Six- or Ten-State Risk Assessments at issue in Plaintiff's request that would render them reasonably likely to have additional responsive documents not already located by Defendant's searches.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp.

Due to the binary and scientific nature of this decision, CBD leaps to the conclusion that \"there are no policy deliberations embedded in species effects determinations that EPA made in the Addenda.\" Pl.'s 1st Opp'n at 17-18;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s 2d Reply at 2 (\"[R]ecords-generated as part of EPA's duty under Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act-are not part of a deliberative process within the meaning of Exemption 5.\"). This is a leap too far.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    While CBD is correct that EPA's decision under section 7(a)(2) as to Enlist Duo depends on a scientific assessment of toxicity risks to endangered and threatened species, this does not divest the agency's decisionmaking process of eligibility for Exemption 5 protection. EPA has described in detail the full scope of considerations implicated in the required risk assessment, starting with determining what scientific evidence would be relevant for such an analysis of Enlist Duo.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    First EPA EFED Decl. \u00b6 15 (explaining that EPA decided \"whether to include registrant-submitted information\" concerning \"the screening level ecological risk assessment\" and \"volatilization of Enlist Duo's active ingredient\");\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    (averring that EPA considered \"whether to incorporate vapor transport data into the screening ecological\n    risk assessment\"). EPA also had to determine the analytical methods and assumptions to apply to test the pesticide.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    (averring that EPA considered \"whether potential analytical methods could be employed to demonstrate\" how particular tank mixtures and spray nozzles would affect spray drift).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Further, EPA's determination of whether Enlist Duo may affect endangered species does not happen in a vacuum, but rather, depends on the parameters of the pesticide's permitted use. Once the relevant data and analytical methods have been selected, the question is not whether any amount of Enlist Duo in any location will affect endangered species, but rather, whether Enlist Duo, under its approved conditions for use, may affect endangered species. EPA therefore considered what modifications may be made to EPA's proposed registration in order \"to avoid effects to listed species,\" plus \"the technical basis for such modifications\" and the real-world \"enforceability of contemplated measures.\" Supp. Decl. of Sujatha Sankula (\"Second EPA EFED Decl.\") \u00b6 4, ECF No. 42-4. This included, for example, consideration of how \"in-field spray drift buffer setbacks on the product label\" could be used to protect endangered species. First EPA EFED Decl. \u00b6 16c.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    According to EPA, the \"deliberative discussions allow decision makers to have access to a variety of possible risk avoidance measures and ensure that such risk avoidance measures are consistent with EPA authority under FIFRA, enforceable, and practically applicable under actual field conditions.\" Second EPA EFED Decl. \u00b6 4.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    In short, multiple decisions contribute to formulating what data to collect and how, and the relevant analytical tests to conduct and under what conditions, to reach a decision under ESA's section 7(a)(2). Consequently, EPA's \"may affect\" determination under the ESA is properly considered \"deliberative\" both because determining what information to include and how to assess that information is itself deliberative, and because, as here, EPA's decisionmaking about whether, and under what conditions, to register Enlist Duo is intertwined with discussions of how to limit the terms of its registration such that the pesticide will not affect endangered species.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Other courts have reached the same conclusion that the deliberative process privilege is available for records associated with EPA's actions under ESA's section 7(a)(2).\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Sierra Club v.

Upon\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n    review, the Court determined that the introductory slides of the PowerPoint presentations generally reflect non-deliberative, factual information that should be disclosed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Heffernan v.

Specifically, since EPA has demonstrated the adequacy of its search and that Exemption 5's attorney-client privilege and deliberative process privilege protects the withheld records, the agency is granted summary judgment on Counts IV and V of the Complaint. EPA is denied summary judgment on Count VII and is directed to further segregate and disclose those portions of the documents listed above,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    Part III.C, by April 15, 2019. CBD is granted summary judgment on Count VII, but otherwise denied summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The parties are further directed to submit, by April 19, 2019, a final joint status report regarding the status of the release of segregable information as directed, upon which release final summary judgment will be entered for EPA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    An order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will be filed contemporaneously.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-101\">\n     CBD lists 79 disputed records,\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     Pl.'s 2d Opp'n at 8 n.3; Pl.'s 2d XMSJ, Decl. of Stephanie M.

EPA defends the withholding of this document.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Fifth EPA PIRIB Decl. \u00b6 17; Def.'s 2d Reply at 23; Letter from Janet Bressant, PIRIB, EPA, to Margaret Townsend, CBD (Mar. 1, 2018), Attach. at 1, ECF No. 38-13 (listing entry no. 37 as disputed as of March 1, 2018). Therefore, the Court assumes that the parties continue to dispute\n     <em>\n      Vaughn\n     </em>\n     index entry no. 37, and that the total number of records in dispute is 80. In sum, EPA withholds under Exemption 5's attorney-client privilege the records described in\n     <em>\n      Vaughn\n     </em>\n     index entries 14, 37, and 64, and under the deliberative process privilege those same entries as well as the following entries: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 36, 40, 45, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 66, 67, 68, 72, 74, 75, 76, 81, 82, 83, 84, 89, 90, 91, 92, 94, 95, 106, 107, 109, 117, 120, 122, 123, 124, 125, 129, 131, 134, 137, 138. The Court notes that entry 106 indicates partial withholding pursuant to the \"Deliberative/Attorney Client/Attorney Work Product,\" but only the deliberative process privilege is addressed in the parties' briefing. Thus, any reliance by EPA on attorney-client or attorney work product privileges is waived.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-102\">\n     These remaining withheld records include: 39 email chains; 21 draft Addenda, 11 PowerPoint presentations, one draft response to comments, and five internal agency briefing documents, described as: \"talking points for EPA staff,\" an \"informal paper for EPA staff to prepare for a meeting,\" an \"internal annotated agenda for a briefing of the Assistant Administrator,\" a \"talking points and background for EPA staff to prepare for a meeting,\" and an \"internal status report for a briefing of the Assistant Administrator.\"\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Fifth\n     <em>\n      Vaughn\n     </em>\n     Index entry nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 36, 40, 45, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 66, 67, 68, 72, 74, 75, 76, 81, 82, 83, 84, 89, 90, 91, 92, 94, 95, 106, 107, 109, 117, 120, 122, 123, 124, 125, 129, 131, 134, 137, 138.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"8\">\n    <p id=\"p-103\">\n     In an effort to minimize the decision-making process involved in EPA's \"may affect\" determination under ESA's section 7(a)(2), CBD argues that the ESA process should occur separately from its FIFRA-based decision-making, so that \"EPA cannot convert the development of scientific effects determinations in ESA assessments into an exercise of policy judgment simply because it used discretion to purportedly eliminate effects to species through modification of the registration action.\" Pl.'s 2d Reply at 6. CBD fails to explain, however, why EPA must treat these two determinations-whether Enlist Duo \"may affect\" under ESA, and the conditions for its approval to avoid unreasonable adverse environmental effects under FIFRA-as if they were entirely walled-off from one another.
