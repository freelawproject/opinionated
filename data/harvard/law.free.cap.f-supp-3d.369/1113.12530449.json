(ECF No. 15). CSAA responded with its own motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 16). For the reasons stated below, the Court denies Hunt's motion for summary judgment and grants CSAA's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to filing their cross motions for summary judgment, the parties stipulated to the material facts in this UIM insurance coverage case. (ECF No. 14). On March 3, 2013, Hunt was driving his vehicle on Veterans Parkway in Reno, Nevada, when he encountered non-party Thomas Harper driving well-below the speed limit in the left lane on a two-lane road. (ECF No. 14 at 2). Hunt began to pass Harper's vehicle in the right lane, but before he could complete his pass, Harper \"aggressively swerved to the right,\" which was an \"apparent attempt to run Hunt off the road.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Hunt managed to avoid Harper's vehicle and continued on until he reached an intersection with a stop sign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Harper had followed Hunt to the intersection, and upon arriving, both men pulled over, exited their vehicles, and approached one another on the side of the road. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Harper, \"angered and upset,\" caught Hunt by surprise with a punch to the face. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Hunt grabbed Harper as he fell to the ground, but as he did so, he fractured his ankle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Harper initially fled the scene after striking Hunt, but he returned after realizing that he had forgotten his wireless key fob. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the time of the fight, Harper and Hunt were standing near Hunt's vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Hunt was transported to the hospital and treated there for his injuries, which included an \"open reduction internal fixation of his ankle fracture.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Hunt ultimately contracted an infection in his ankle (MRSA), which required several more surgeries and procedures to successfully treat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the time of his fight with Harper, Hunt had an auto insurance policy through CSAA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Initially, Hunt filed a lawsuit against Harper in this Court (3:17-cv-00165-RCJ-WGC), seeking to recover damages for the injuries he sustained in the fistfight. Harper's\n   insurance carrier, Allstate, also filed an action in this Court (3:16-cv-00579-MMD-WGC) seeking declaratory relief from having to defend or indemnify Harper. Both of those cases were resolved via a stipulated dismissal in March 2018. To date, Hunt has incurred at least $ 676,000 in medical expenses arising out of his injuries and subsequent infection. (ECF No. 14 at 3). He filed a claim with CSAA, requesting the $ 250,000 \"each person\" UIM limit under his insurance policy, but following an investigation, CSAA denied his claim because the injuries he sustained did not fall under the purview of his auto insurance policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4). Specifically, Hunt's policy stated that he would be entitled to receive compensation from CSAA if he suffered a bodily injury: (1) \"caused by an accident\" and (2) \"arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use\" of an underinsured motor vehicle. (ECF No. 14 at 4). CSAA denied coverage because it claimed that Hunt's injuries did not arise out of the use of an automobile. (ECF Nos. 14-5, 14-6, 14-7). Following the denial of coverage, Hunt filed this lawsuit against CSAA in February 2018, alleging four causes of action in his amended complaint: (1) breach of contract; (2) bad faith; (3) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (4) tortious interference of a contract. (ECF No. 5). Before the close of discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on August 7, 2018. (ECF Nos. 15, 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because the parties have stipulated to a set of facts, there is no question of material fact in this case, making it apt for summary judgment. The success of both parties' motions turns on the definition of two phrases contained within Hunt's insurance policy - \"caused by accident\" and \"arise out of the ownership, maintenance, or use\" of a motor vehicle. If Hunt's incident with Harper was an \"accident\" and arose out of the \"use\" of his motor vehicle, then CSAA is obligated to compensate Hunt based on the terms of his insurance policy and because it did not, it will have breached the insurance contract. If Hunt's incident does not fall under the purview of both provisions, then CSAA has abided by the terms of the contract and is not obligated to compensate Hunt. Furthermore, the parties have stipulated that if CSAA prevails on its motion for summary judgment, it dispenses with all of Hunt's claims, not just the breach of contract claim that he seeks summary judgment on. (ECF No. 14 at 4). On the other hand, if Hunt prevails on his motion for partial summary judgment for his breach of contract claim, then he will be allowed to further pursue his second, third, and fourth claims against CSAA.

With these principles in mind, the Court turns to whether the injuries Hunt suffered were the result of an \"accident\" as that term is defined in his insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"Accident\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Hunt's CSAA insurance policy defines an \"accident\" as a \"sudden, unexpected, and unintentional occurrence. An intentional act, event, or happening is not an 'accident.' \" (ECF No. 14 at 4). Hunt argues that the definition of \"accident\" is written from his perspective rather than that of an omniscient observer, and because he was not expecting Harper to punch him, the fight was sudden and unexpected. (ECF No. 15 at 8). Moreover, Harper's battery, while an intentional tort, was not an \"intentional act\" for policy purposes because Hunt did not intend to be injured or battered during his confrontation with Harper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10). Hunt also asserts that CSAA \"conceded\" that the fight with Harper was an \"accident\" in a January 23, 2018 email: \"[a]t no point in time have we [CSAA] denied that the events that took place would fall under the definition of an 'accident' in the policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). In response, CSAA asserts that the term is unambiguous and should be afforded its plain meaning, which would exclude all intentional acts, regardless of who the actor is, from being deemed \"accidents.\" (ECF No. 23 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although creative, the Court rejects Hunt's interpretation of the term \"accident.\" The definition of \"accident\" within Hunt's insurance policy is clear and unambiguous; intentional acts are specifically excluded from coverage regardless of whether the policy holder or a third party is the actor. (ECF No. 14 at 4). Presumably, if the parties intended for intentional acts by third parties, such as the intentional destruction of a vehicle, to be included in policy coverage under the term \"accident,\" they would have specified as such. But they did not. The Court is not permitted to rewrite insurance contracts to provide coverage for the insured where none exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.

It is uncontested that Harper committed an intentional battery against Hunt when the two men confronted one another following Harper's alleged attempt to run Hunt off the road. This is not a situation where Harper intended to scare or frighten Hunt, but accidentally harmed him instead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins. Co. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Fire Ins. Exchange v.

Instead, the email merely states that CSAA had not, at that point, denied that Hunt's injuries were not caused by an \"accident.\" Removing the double negatives, CSAA merely stated that at that point in time, it had not reached a decision regarding Hunt's coverage. CSAA's email is essentially a non-statement and far from the definitive concession Hunt portrays it as.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because the definition of \"accident\" within Hunt's insurance policy specifically excludes intentional acts from coverage, Harper's intentional battery of Hunt is not covered under the policy. Therefore, CSAA cannot be liable for breach of contract because it correctly refused to accept Hunt's insurance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. \"Use\" of a Motor Vehicle\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Even if Hunt could demonstrate that his fight with Harper was an \"accident,\" he would still need to show that his injuries arose out of the \"ownership, maintenance, or use\" of his motor vehicle. (ECF No. 16 at 6). Hunt argues that road rage was the cause of his injuries, and because road rage necessarily involves the use of a vehicle, his injuries fall under the terms of his insurance policy. (ECF No. 22 at 6). On the other hand, CSAA argues that road rage incidents where the parties have exited their vehicles do not arise out of the \"ownership, maintenance, or use\" of their motor vehicles, and thus Hunt's injuries are excluded from coverage. (ECF No. 16 at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court agrees with CSAA. While Hunt is correct in asserting that the impetus for the fight occurred while he and Harper were driving, he sustained his injuries because of a physical assault on the side of the road, not in an auto collision. The insurance policy covers injuries that occur while the policy holder is actively using his motor vehicle; the fact that the policy holder traveled to an area by way of a motor vehicle does not automatically bring the injuries he sustained at that area into the purview of his insurance policy. For instance, someone who drives to a bar with his insured motor vehicle and suffers injuries in an ensuing bar fight cannot claim that his injuries resulted from the use of his vehicle simply because of his method of travel. Similarly, someone who develops the motivation to engage in particular conduct while driving also cannot claim that subsequent injuries arose out of the \"use\" of his motor vehicle. A ruling to the contrary would defeat the plain meaning of the word \"use,\" which the Ninth Circuit has previously stated to mean \"make use of or to enjoy.\"\n   <em>\n    Yandle v. Hardware Mut.

The District Court for the District of Hawai'i granted the insurance carrier's motion for summary judgment on the coverage issue, and the Ninth Circuit subsequently affirmed.

Between Hunt driving his vehicle and breaking his ankle, he was involved in a curbside attack by Harper in which he was punched in the face. The curbside assault, much like the stabbing in\n   <em>\n    Fernandez\n   </em>\n   , is an intervening intentional act that breaks the causal connection between Hunt's use of his vehicle and his injury.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wincor Nixdorf Inc. v.

Instead, a plain reading of both terms indicates that his fight with Harper is not covered under either of them. The Court will accordingly deny his motion for summary judgment and grant CSAA's motion for summary judgment, which will dispense with all Hunt's claims pursuant to the parties' stipulation.
