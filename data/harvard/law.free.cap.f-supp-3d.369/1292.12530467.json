DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss particular aspects of Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint raising five arguments: (1) Florida law does not prohibit PIP reimbursement to a licensed healthcare\n   clinic for medical services rendered by an independent contractor; (2) Plaintiffs' RICO and state law claims fail to state a cause of action with respect to the allegations of unlawful patient brokering and kickbacks; (3) Plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action with respect to whether the Clinic Act was violated by Dr. Keane's failures to perform his statutory duties as Quality's medical director; (4) Plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action with respect to Jorge's concealed ownership; and (5) massage therapists can lawfully render physical therapy without a physical therapy license. This Court analyzes each of these arguments, in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Florida law does not prohibit PIP reimbursement to a licensed healthcare clinic for medical services rendered by an independent contractor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants first argue that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(a) does not prohibit PIP reimbursement to a licensed healthcare clinic for medical services rendered by an independent contractor, and thus that Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint should be dismissed to the extent that it alleges Quality used independent contractors to render health care services [ECF No. 39 at 5-7]. This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This exact question has been answered by Florida's Fifth District Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reg'l MRI of Orlando, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Reg'l MRI\n   </em>\n   , the Orange County Court certified the following question to the Fifth District as an issue of great public importance: \"Can a medical provider render a medical service under Section 627.736(5)(a), when the medical service was provided through the use of an independent contractor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9161877\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/884/1102/#p1103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Fifth District answered this question in the affirmative, finding that a medical provider may use an independent contractor to lawfully render medical services under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n    Fla.

Rather, every case cited by Plaintiffs in support of their position involves illegal fee-splitting and patient brokering between two distinct entities wherein a non-medical provider is disallowed PIP benefits for its lone acts of referring a patient to a medical provider and sending the bill to the insurance company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prosper Diagnostic Centers, Inc. v. Allstate Ins.

Stat. \u00a7 817.505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(b) (\"It is unlawful for any person, including any health care provider or health care facility, to: ...

In other words, the entities for which PIP benefits have been disallowed were pure middlemen, i.e., MRI brokers, that did not provide any medical services, did not own any medical equipment, and did not employ any medical professionals. Thus, the Fifth District's decision in\n   <em>\n    Reg'l MRI\n   </em>\n   is controlling here, and Plaintiffs' allegations that Quality used independent contractors to provide medical services are insufficient to demonstrate unlawful or improper activity that would have prevented Defendants from obtaining PIP reimbursement for such medical services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint is dismissed to the extent it relies on the premise that a licensed healthcare clinic can never recover PIP benefits for medical services rendered by independent contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' RICO and state law claims do not fail to state a cause of action with respect to the allegations of unlawful patient brokering and kickbacks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants next argue that Plaintiffs' RICO claims and state law claims fail to state a cause of action to the extent these\n   counts are based upon unlawful patient brokering and kickbacks because Plaintiffs' allegations lack the required particularity under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) [ECF No. 39 at 7-9]. Plaintiffs respond that Defendants' illegal patient brokering and kickback scheme is not the actual fraud alleged in the Amended Complaint as the fraud alleged in the Amended Complaint \"is the submission of PIP charges to GEICO which misrepresented, among other things, that Quality [ ] was operating in compliance with Florida law and was eligible to collect PIP benefits in the first instance, when in fact it was not,\" i.e., mail fraud [ECF No. 41 at 11-12].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Indeed, Defendants do not contest that Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint \"adequately alleges facts supporting the predicate acts of racketeering, namely, mail fraud in the submission to GEICO of thousands of knowingly false HCFA-1500 forms.\"\n   <em>\n    Gov't Employees Ins. Co. (GEICO) v.

Likewise, Defendants also do not contest that Plaintiffs adequately allege such specific facts of mail fraud in support of their state law claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364785\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/310/125/#p130\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Defendants' argument here is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Accordingly, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' RICO and state law claims for lack of specificity as to the allegations of unlawful patient brokering and kickbacks is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs do not fail to state a cause of action with respect to allegations that the Clinic Act was violated by Dr. Keane's failures to perform statutory duties as Quality's medical director\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants also claim that Plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action to the extent Plaintiffs allege that Quality violated the Clinic Act because Dr. Keane failed to perform his statutory duties as medical director of Quality [ECF No. 39 at 9-12]. Defendants argue that the Clinic Act makes PIP reimbursement bills non-compensable only if the underlying services were unlawful at the time they were rendered.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364785\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/310/125/#p130\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants note in support of their argument that Plaintiffs only complain about Quality's billing for services rendered during Dr. Queral's time as Quality's medical director before Dr. Keane became Quality's medical director.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Thus, Defendants contend Dr. Keane's alleged failures as Quality's medical director are not germane to whether Quality was operating in violation of the Clinic Act at the time the underlying services were rendered because Dr. Queral was Quality's medical director at that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs respond that Dr. Keane's alleged failures as Quality's medical director are relevant because, if Quality is currently out of compliance with the Clinic Act, then Quality is not entitled to collect PIP reimbursements, even if Quality was in compliance with the Clinic Act at the time these PIP reimbursement bills were submitted [ECF No. 41 at 13-14]. Plaintiffs are correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20400.9935\">\n    Fla.

Clearly, the Clinic Act is more concerned with a clinic's continuing licensure and the effect thereof on a clinic's broader ability to bill for any medical services rendered (which includes charges outside the PIP context) than whether a bill for medical services qualifies specifically as a lawful PIP charge. Thus, it is logical that the Clinic Act would incentivize clinics to stay compliant with the Clinic Act in order to continue to bill or receive any amounts for medical services rendered, including for PIP reimbursements, as this addresses the broader concerns the Clinic Act was designed to address.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Notably, the limited exemptions found within\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n     Fla.

Thus, in a situation such as here, where a clinic allegedly falls out of compliance with the Clinic Act after rendering the medical services at issue due to no longer having a qualified \"medical director,\" there would be nobody responsible for conducting the required systematic reviews of clinic billings to ensure that these clinic billings were lawful charges as submitted and also nobody to \"take immediate corrective action\" if any submitted billings were found to be unlawful.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20400.9935\">\n     Fla.
