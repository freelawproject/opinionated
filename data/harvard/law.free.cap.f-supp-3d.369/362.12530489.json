Second, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant intentionally discriminates against Latinos and African Americans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 195.

Defendant also argues that Plaintiffs' claims fail on the merits because they cannot state a claim for disparate treatment or disparate impact.

However, as explained above, HUD regulations also create liability for a person's \"own conduct that results in a discriminatory housing practice\" and \"a discriminatory housing practice by the person's agent or employee.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20100.7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 100.7(a)(1)(i), (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs sufficiently allege Defendant's liability under both theories. Defendant held itself out as a company with the knowledge and ingenuity to screen housing applicants by interpreting criminal records and specifically advertised its ability to improve \"Fair Housing compliance.\" Plaintiffs allege it failed to do so by categorizing as disqualified a qualified applicant. Defendant had a duty not to sell a product to a customer which would unwittingly cause its customer to violate federal housing law and regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   By the same token, Defendant would be liable if it sold a product designed to allow its customer to circumvent the fair housing laws intentionally. Allowing a screening company to facilitate discrimination by disqualifying qualified applicants on an impermissible basis or by allowing a customer to set impermissible qualification standards with impunity would subvert the purpose of the FHA. Defendants advocate for a constrained reading. Interpreting the law in the manner proposed by Defendant is too restrictive a reading of the Fair Housing Act. Such a limited reading is inimical to its purpose and inconsistent with the Supreme Court's instruction to liberally construe the Act to achieve the important remedial purpose of eradicating insidious housing discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant next argues that it cannot be liable under the FHA because \u00a7 3604 applies only to \"individuals who deal directly with prospective buyers or tenants and are in control of the housing-related decisions.\" Defendant cites no authority to support the notion that the FHA applies exclusively to housing providers. It cites\n   <em>\n    Frederick v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A. et al.\n   </em>\n   , claiming that the case rejected\n   an \"attempt to expand the reach of the FHA beyond those providing housing.\" No. 14CV5460,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205521769\">\n    2015 WL 5521769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2015). In\n   <em>\n    Frederick\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff brought thirty-six claims against thirteen defendants claiming that they \"engaged in a conspiracy to report false information to credit reporting agencies and threaten him with injury to his credit score if he does not pay allegedly invalid debts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. Specific to his FHA claims, plaintiff claimed defendants' credit reporting scheme injured his credit score and thus made various housing opportunities unavailable to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The Court held that credit reporting practices as alleged in the complaint were not sufficiently related to the rental of housing to fall within the scope of the FHA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Frederick\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the case at bar. The\n   <em>\n    Frederick\n   </em>\n   Court reasoned that \"[t]he relationship between the challenged practice and real estate transactions is essential because the FHA prohibits discrimination in the 'sale or rental' of housing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Here, the challenged practice is directly related to the real estate transaction because it determined who was qualified to occupy a housing unit. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant's practice of automatically screening potential tenants on an impermissible basis - an arrest record - and disqualifying them for tenancy on that reason without conducting an individualized assessment of the tenant or providing the underlying documentation caused Mr. Arroyo to be denied housing. Because there is a clear relationship between the challenged practice and the attempted property rental, the Court is not persuaded by Defendant's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant's claim that only housing providers can be held liable under the FHA is further belied by the cases cited by Plaintiff. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v. Shane\n   </em>\n   , prospective homebuyers brought discrimination claims under \u00a7 3604 against the sellers, their listing agent and their listing agent's employer.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050224\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/350/39/#p41\">\n    350 F.3d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41-42 (2d Cir. 2003). The Second Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment for the sellers because there was no evidence they knew the plaintiffs' race, but vacated the grant of summary judgment as to the agent and his employer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050224\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/350/39/#p41\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050224\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/350/39/#p41\">\n    at 49-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hylton\n   </em>\n   , this Court found that a husband and wife were both liable for the husband's discriminatory refusal to rent an apartment to an African-American woman on the grounds that the wife employed the husband as her agent.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229965\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/944/176/#p191\">\n    944 F.Supp.2d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 191 (D.

The Court found that the wife owned the rental property at issue and gave her husband authority to act on her behalf which he accepted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 191. The Court also found that the final prong, understanding of the principal's control, was\n   met because the wife signed the leases and the husband discussed the actions he took with her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The same reasoning applies here. Plaintiff alleged that WinnResidential engaged Defendant to act on its behalf by conducting tenant screenings, determining whether prospective tenants meet the requirements for tenancy and sending adverse action letters. Dkt. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 36-40, 51, 54-58, 64-65. Defendant provided these services to WinnResidential.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, WinnResidential gave Defendant authority to act and Defendant accepted it. As to the final element, the Court finds that WinnResidential was ultimately in control of the final housing decision. WinnResidential chose the criteria for tenancy from Defendant's form.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. WinnResidential initially accepted Defendant's conclusion, but eventually disregarded Defendant's conclusion that Mr. Arroyo was disqualified and allowed him to move in with Ms. Arroyo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 100. For these reasons, the Court finds that Defendant can be held liable under the FHA as an agent of WinnResidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A recent decision from the Second Circuit supports the Court's conclusions. In\n   <em>\n    Francis v. Kings Park Manor, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Circuit considered \"whether a landlord may be liable under the FHA for failing to take prompt action to address a racially hostile housing environment created by one tenant targeting another, where the landlord knew of the discriminatory conduct and had the power to correct it.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520259\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/109/#p114\">\n    917 F.3d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 114 (2d Cir. 2019). Relying on the statutory text, the history of expansive readings of the FHA and relevant HUD regulations, the Circuit found that \"a landlord may be liable under the FHA for failing to intervene in tenant-on-tenant racial harassment of which it knew or reasonably should have known and had the power to address.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520259\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/109/#p114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520259\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/109/#p114\">\n    at 120-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It acknowledged that the FHA does not explicitly endorse landlord liability for tenant-on-tenant harassment, but explained that it has \"never required every last detail of a legislative scheme to be spelled out in a statute itself-especially a civil rights statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520259\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/109/#p114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520259\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/109/#p114\">\n    at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Circuit also rejected the defendant's argument that HUD regulation \u00a7 100.7 rests on the false premise that an agency relationship exists between landlords and tenants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520259\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/109/#p114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520259\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/109/#p114\">\n    at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It found that there was no risk that landlords would be liable where they lacked control over tenants because the HUD regulation only imposes liability where a landlord knew of misconduct by an agent or employee and failed to intervene or failed to intervene despite an obligation to do so under the FHA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520259\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/109/#p114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520259\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/109/#p114\">\n    at 121-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Francis\n   </em>\n   decision supports the Court's finding that screening companies can be held liable under the FHA. First, the absence of language specifically providing for screening company liability under the FHA is not determinative. Second, screening companies can be liable under \u00a7 100.7 where they knew of and had the power to correct and end a discriminatory housing practice. Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant knew that its CrimSAFE policies discriminated against minorities and disabled individuals but continued to offer them. Defendant had the power to end its discriminatory practice by modifying or discontinuing its CrimSAFE product and offering only its CrimCHECK product, but it refused to do so. For example, Defendant could have omitted arrest records from the list of screening criteria or altered its algorithm to search only for arrests which resulted in a conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court acknowledges that housing providers are often the target of FHA claims. However, as discussed herein, other entities are frequently held liable under the FHA. Nothing in the language of the\n   statute precludes Defendant's liability and the Second Circuit has extended liability beyond direct housing providers. These are logical extensions which effectuate the purpose of the FHA. As explained above, without them, a housing provider could simply use an intermediary to take discriminatory and prohibited actions on its behalf and defeat the purpose of the FHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   2. Nexus Between Defendant's Conduct and Housing Denial\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' FHA claims must be dismissed because FHA liability only exists where an individual's conduct restricts minorities' access to housing. It further claims that the relevant conduct, setting the housing-related policies, is attributable to WinnResidential only. Defendant argues that\n   <em>\n    Sabal Palm Condominiums of Pine Island Ridge Association, Inc. v. Fischer\n   </em>\n   supports the notion that it cannot be liable because it did not set the policies at issue.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204961\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/6/1272/\">\n    6 F.Supp.3d 1272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Fla. 2014). In\n   <em>\n    Sabal Palm\n   </em>\n   , the Court granted summary judgment against a condominium association for failing to allow a disabled resident a reasonable accommodation in violation of the FHA, but it granted summary judgment in favor of the association's lawyer because he did not participate in or have authority over that decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204961\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/6/1272/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204961\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/6/1272/\">\n    at 1280, 1294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant claims its role is akin to that of the lawyer. Defendant understates its role.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In contrast, the Court finds that Defendant is similar to the board member in\n   <em>\n    Sabal Palm\n   </em>\n   who voted against the accommodation and was held liable on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204961\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/6/1272/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Southern District of Florida found that \"[i]ndividual board members or agents such as property managers can be held liable when they have personally committed or contributed to a Fair Housing Act violation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204961\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/6/1272/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204961\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/6/1272/\">\n    at 1293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant's automatic tenant screening process, which fails to individually assess applicants, discriminates against Plaintiffs in the provision of housing on the basis of race and disability. Since WinnResidential's decision to deny Mr. Arroyo tenancy was based on Defendant's screening process, it follows that Defendant personally contributed to the alleged FHA violation. Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant can be held liable under the FHA under the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Sabal Palm\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant argues that it did not select the screening criteria. Although WinnResidential may have selected a subset of the criteria listed on the form, Defendant drafted the form and thereby provided\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the criteria available for WinnResidential to select. Defendant cannot downplay its role in the screening process. It was Defendant's form, Defendant's screening process and Defendant's adverse action letter that contributed to the denial of Mr. Arroyo's application. Indeed, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's adverse action letter was effectively the final decision on Mr. Arroyo's tenancy because Defendant did not provide WinnResidential any information concerning disqualifying records or any other details for the tenancy decision. Defendant was closely involved in the tenancy process unlike the defendants in the cases it cites. For example, the Multiple Listing Service (\"MLS\") in\n   <em>\n    Wheatley Heights Neighborhood Coalition v. Jenna Resales Co\n   </em>\n   . was sued in addition to brokerage firms and their employees by a group of residents who alleged that they engaged in racial steering in violation of the FHA.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993672\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/447/838/#p839\">\n    447 F.Supp. 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 839 (E.D.N.Y. 1987). The Court found that the MLS was not liable under the FHA because participating brokers did not act on its behalf or for its benefit and the control exercised by MLS was not related to the sales activities of brokers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993672\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/447/838/#p839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993672\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/447/838/#p839\">\n    at 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, there is a\n   sufficient causal nexus here because Defendant's activities were directly related to WinnResidential's tenancy decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   These arguments similarly fail as to Plaintiffs' disability discrimination claim. Defendant argues that its requirement for a conservator to submit a power of attorney before receiving another individual's tenant screening report is too far removed from any housing decision for purposes of the FHA. The Court disagrees. Plaintiffs allege that Ms. Arroyo submitted an application for Mr. Arroyo's screening report which she signed along with Mr. Arroyo's co-conservator, a certificate of conservatorship, a utility bill showing her address and mail received by her on Mr. Arroyo's behalf. Defendant still did not provide the tenant screening report. Meanwhile, WinnResidential told Ms. Arroyo that it had no knowledge of the criminal finding in Mr. Arroyo's screening report and the impact that the finding may have on resident safety. If Ms. Arroyo had the underlying information, she would have been able to make a specific accommodation request to WinnResidential. The Court finds Defendant's decision to require a power of attorney from Ms. Arroyo in addition to the documents she allegedly submitted has a sufficiently close nexus to housing availability and is wholly distinct from cases cited by Defendant involving the effect of cement grinding facilities and highways on adjacent neighborhoods.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jersey Heights Neighborhood Assoc. v.

Plaintiffs allege that this combination results in a disproportionate number of housing denials for minorities.

Plaintiffs further allege that Defendant's policies disproportionately impact disabled individuals because they are more likely to be subject to a conservatorship than non-disabled individuals. Plaintiff also alleges that these individuals lack the ability to execute a power of attorney. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that the result of these policies is that disabled individuals have a more difficult time requesting or obtaining the results of Defendant's screening reports.

First, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' racial disparate impact claim fails because the housing-related policies at issue are not attributable to Defendant. Second, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' disability disparate impact claim fails because it is not supported by statistical evidence. For the reasons articulated\n   above, the Court is not persuaded by Defendant's argument that the relevant housing policies are not attributable to it. Defendant created and provided the automated screening process to WinnResidential. It suggested the categories for which WinnResidential could screen potential tenants, made eligibility determinations and sent out letters to potential tenants notifying them of the eligibility determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendant's second argument fails because, although it is not required, Plaintiffs alleged sufficient statistical support for their claims.

Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden on a motion to dismiss by alleging that Defendant's policies have a disparate impact on disabled individuals because they are more likely to be conserved and unable to execute a power of attorney. Defendant's claim that dismissal is required unless Plaintiffs allege statistical evidence of how the policy affects the protected and unprotected group again sets Plaintiffs' bar too high. In the case Defendant cites for this proposition, the Seventh Circuit provided this context before affirming the dismissal of the disparate impact claim, \"Disparate-impact plaintiffs are permitted to rely on a variety of statistical methods and comparisons to support their claims. At the pleading stage, some basic allegations of this sort will suffice. But the amended complaint contains no allegations of the kind, nor any other factual material to move the disparate-impact claims over the plausibility threshold.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

The same cannot be said for the case at bar. Consistent with the other district courts in this circuit, the Court finds that Defendant's stated a claim for disparate impact based on disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   5. Failure to Accommodate\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendant violated the FHA by failing to accommodate Mr. Arroyo's disability. Ms. Arroyo requested the documents underlying Mr. Arroyo's tenant screening report and provided proof of her status as Mr. Arroyo's conservator. Defendant refused to accept this document and required a power of attorney even though Ms. Arroyo explained that Mr. Arroyo is conserved and does not have the ability to execute a power of attorney. To state a claim for failure to accommodate, \"a plaintiff must show (1) that the plaintiff or a person who would live with the plaintiff had a handicap within the meaning of \u00a7 3602(h); (2) that the defendant knew or reasonably should have been expected to know of the handicap; (3) that the accommodation was likely necessary to afford the handicapped person an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling; (4) that the accommodation requested was reasonable; and (5) that the defendant refused to make the requested accommodation.\"\n   <em>\n    Olsen v.

Mr. Arroyo has significant disabilities within the meaning of \u00a7 3602(h) and Ms. Arroyo notified Defendant of Mr. Arroyo's disabilities. The requested accommodation was necessary because Ms. Arroyo was trying to convince WinnResidential to reexamine Defendant's decision to disqualify Mr. Arroyo. Without proof that Defendant's report revealed a limited and dated criminal history for Mr. Arroyo, WinnResidential was unlikely to override Defendant's decision. Indeed, WinnResidential refused to do so. The accommodation was reasonable because Ms. Arroyo's role as co-conservator gave her\n   significantly more power over Mr. Arroyo's affairs than a power of attorney. Nevertheless, Defendant refused to provide Ms. Arroyo with the records underlying Mr. Arroyo's tenant screening report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendant does not address these factors in its Motion to Dismiss. It states that Plaintiffs' claim must fail because they do not allege that Defendant applied its policy differently to any non-disabled individual. Defendant cites no support that this allegation is required at the pleading stage. Defendant next argues that there is an insufficient nexus between its failure to provide the tenant screening report and housing availability. However, the Court disagrees as explained in detail above and finds that Plaintiffs stated a claim for failure to accommodate Mr. Arroyo's disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   B.

Lastly, Plaintiffs alleged that Defendant's actions cause substantial injury because they leave consumers without housing and without sufficient information to challenge housing decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendant argues that it cannot be liable because CUTPA requires that Defendant's actions were the proximate cause of Plaintiffs' harm and the alleged discriminatory decisions at issue here were made by WinnResidential. As explained above, a plaintiff alleging CUTPA violations must allege ascertainable loss proximately caused by the prohibited act. Here, Plaintiffs allege a series of ascertainable losses caused by Defendant. It is foreseeable that (1) Defendant's denial of Mr. Arroyo's housing application would result in increased expenses for the Arroyos and (2) Defendant's refusal to provide the tenant screening report would result in a deprivation of Mr. Arroyo's rights under the FCRA to a copy of his consumer report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant next claims that Plaintiffs' CUTPA claim based on its file disclosure policies fails because consumer file disclosure requests are provided free of charge under the FCRA and therefore are not in connection with trade or commerce. Trade or commerce is defined as \"the advertising, the sale or rent or lease, the offering for sale or rent or lease, or the distribution of any services and any property, tangible or intangible, real, personal or mixed, and any other article, commodity, or thing of value in this state.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2042\">\n    Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -110a(4). Defendant claims that the facts at issue here are most analogous to\n   <em>\n    Omega S.A. v. Omega Engineering, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , where the Court found that filing a trademark application or registering a domain name does not involve trade or commerce under CUTPA where the trademark and name were never used. No. 1CV2104,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%203307277\">\n    2005 WL 3307277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (D. Conn. Dec. 6, 2005). The Court disagrees. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Omega\n   </em>\n   , Defendant had a business relationship with WinnResidential. It agreed to provide\n   screening services and to send potential tenants a letter with the tenancy decision. The letter states that the tenant can request a copy of his screening report. Defendant's disclosure policy stems from its commercial relationship with WinnResidential and the services Defendant provides to WinnResidential's consumers on its behalf. Here, like in\n   <em>\n    Nastro v. D'Onofrio\n   </em>\n   , cited by Plaintiffs, Defendant's conduct is sufficiently related to their business to establish a relationship to trade or commerce.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9117201\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/263/446/#p457\">\n    263 F.Supp.2d 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457-58 (D.
