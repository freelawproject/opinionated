It is my understanding that this representation is correct. However, you did not make an additional property damage claim in your February 12, 2015 demand letter, and the property damage claim previously presented has been settled.

Secondly, to ask you if you have some property damage for which you want to make a claim? Finally, please clarify your position because I'm not clear why you are rejecting the tender of the applicable limits. If you have some other basis for rejecting Horace Mann's offer and Covenant Not to Enforce Judgment[,] please let me know because there is nothing that I am aware of from my review that Horace Mann has done to prejudice your client.
