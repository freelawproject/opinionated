Summerhays, United States District Judge\n   Presently before the court is the Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc 20] filed by Evanston Insurance Company. A hearing on the matter was held on January 28, 2019. After hearing argument from counsel, the court took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Riceland Petroleum Company (\"Riceland\"), is a named insured under Evanston Oil and Gas Industries Liability policies, for two consecutive policy periods from March 21, 2000 through March 21, 2002, and two umbrella or excess policies, for the same policy periods. See Ex. 1, 2, 3, 4 to Motion for Summary Judgment. Riceland was sued in underlying litigation entitled Van Geffen Bros., LLC, et al. v. ConocoPhillips Company, et al., currently pending in the 31st Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson Davis, State of Louisiana (\"Van Geffen litigation\"), and requested insurance coverage and defense costs from Evanston, for its exposure in the Van Geffen litigation, and under the aforementioned policies. Evanston filed the instant Complaint for Declaratory Relief seeking a determination that Evanston's policies do not provide any coverage for the alleged liability of Riceland in the Van Geffen litigation, and also, that Evanston has no obligation to defend Riceland in the Van Geffen litigation. Evanston seeks summary judgment declaring: (1) Evanston does not owe a duty to defend or indemnify Riceland in the Van Geffen litigation because the pollution exclusions of the Primary and the Umbrella Liability Policies apply to preclude coverage for the long-term, environmental pollution damage alleged by plaintiffs in the Van Geffen lawsuit; (2) the Van Geffen lawsuit does not trigger Evanston's \"Coverage D- Bodily Injury and Property Damage-Oil and Gas Limited Pollution\" endorsement in the Primary Policies, and Riceland has not met the conditions of the endorsement; and (3) there is no coverage for damage to property leased by Riceland and/or in the care, custody, and control of Riceland based on the Leased Property/Care, Custody and Control Exclusions in the Evanston Policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Van Geffen Bros., LLC, and other plaintiffs, filed a state court \"legacy lawsuit\" against Riceland and other oil and gas companies alleging pollution and environmental contamination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs in the Van Geffen case are landowners or the descendants, heirs, or assignees who claim that Riceland and other oil and gas production companies in Louisiana caused environmental contamination of their properties by pollutants over a period of several years or even decades. Their allegations include the operation or construction of various oil and gas facilities, including pits, wells, sumps, flowlines, pipelines, tank batteries, wellheads, measuring facilities, separators and injection facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Van Geffen plaintiffs also allegedly suffered damages resulting from the improper disposal of oilfield waste in unlined earthen pits, constructed by Riceland and other defendants, on or near their properties during the course of oil and gas exploration\n   and production activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The oilfield wastes deposited in these pits include such substances as naturally occurring radioactive material (\"NORM\"), produced water, drilling fluids, chlorides, hydrocarbons, and heavy metals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other toxic and hazardous substances allegedly used by Riceland and other defendants in their day to day exploration and production activities include mercury, lead based compounds, chromium based algicides, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, and various corrosion inhibitors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Van Geffen plaintiffs allege that leaks, spills, and other surface and subsurface discharges of these and other substances from wells, pipelines, tank batteries, gas plants and other equipment or facilities have polluted the surface and subsurface of the properties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   They also allege that Riceland's and other defendants' failure to timely remove or remediate this \"toxic pollution\" in the soils and groundwater of the properties has allowed the pollution to \"migrate and spread.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Van Geffen plaintiffs also allege that the pollution has now permanently damaged the drinking water and other aquifers underlying the properties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the Van Geffen plaintiffs assert various causes of action, these causes of action are all grounded in the activities of the defendants and the pollution-related damage allegedly resulting from that activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Summary Judgment Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A court should grant a motion for summary judgment when the movant shows \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

Later state court decisions have addressed the application of Doerr to environmental pollution claims. One such case,\n    <em>\n     Lodwick, L.L.C. v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7001407\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/126/544/\">\n     126 So.3d 544\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (La.App. 2 Cir. 2013) involved a legacy case with similar factual allegations to the present case. There, the court summarized the applicability of the\n    <em>\n     Doerr\n    </em>\n    reasoning to legacy lawsuits as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Doerr\n    </em>\n    , the seminal case addressing pollution exclusions, the Louisiana Supreme Court detoured from its previous stance that total pollution exclusions were intended to be read strictly to exclude coverage for all interactions with irritants or contaminants. Rather, the court narrowed its application of the exclusions and clarified that the purpose of the pollution exclusion was to exclude coverage for environmental pollution. It was also meant to strengthen environmental protection standards by imposing the full risk of loss due to personal injury or property damage from pollution upon the polluter by eliminating the option of spreading that risk through insurance coverage. In its reasoning, the court explained that pollution exclusions were born out of the environmental\n    movement of the 1970s and were shaped in response to legislation designed to prompt the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and impose cleanup costs on responsible parties. Notably,\n    <em>\n     Doerr\n    </em>\n    did not involve the type of claims for which the exclusion was designed; it was a personal injury case, not an environmental pollution case as alleged here. Thus, guided by the principles set forth in\n    <em>\n     Doerr\n    </em>\n    , we find that when long term pollution damages are alleged, such as the case with legacy lawsuits, pollution exclusions are applicable to exclude coverage. As stated in\n    <em>\n     Doerr\n    </em>\n    , this is the very purpose of a pollution exclusion.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 560-561.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <strong>\n     4.\n     <em>\n      Applying the Doerr Test to the Van Geffen Allegations.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The Court must apply the \"eight corners\" rule to the factors in the\n    <em>\n     Doerr\n    </em>\n    test by comparing the \"four corners\" of the Van Geffen petition against the \"four corners\" of the policies and \"determine whether the claims, liberally interpreted and taken as true, fall within the scope of the duty to defend.

App. 5 Cir. 2005). The plaintiffs in the Van Geffen lawsuit allege that defendants, including Riceland, are oilfield operators and producers. Louisiana courts have consistently held that oilfield operators and producers sued in legacy lawsuits fit the definition of \"polluters\" based upon the fact that oil drilling and related activities present a clear and obvious risk of pollution.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    The court concludes that Riceland clearly meets the definition of a \"polluter\" under the\n    <em>\n     Doerr\n    </em>\n    test.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      (b) Are the injury-causing substances alleged in the Van Geffen litigation \"pollutants\"?\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    In determining the second factor of the\n    <em>\n     Doerr\n    </em>\n    test, the Court must consider \"the nature of the injury-causing substance, its typical usage, the quantity of the discharge, whether the substance was being used for its intended purpose when the injury took place, whether the substance is one that would be viewed as a pollutant as the term is generally understood, and any other factor the trier of fact deems relevant to that conclusion.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    The\n    Van Geffen plaintiffs allege soil and water contamination with oilfield wastes, including NORM, produced water, drilling fluids, chlorides, hydrocarbons, and heavy metals.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    Other toxic and hazardous substances allegedly used by Riceland and others in their day to day exploration and production activities include mercury, lead based compounds, chromium based algicides, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, and various corrosion inhibitors.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Van Geffen plaintiffs allege that leaks, spills, and other surface and subsurface discharges of these and other substances from wells, pipelines, tank batteries, gas plants and other equipment or facilities have further polluted the surface and subsurface of the subject properties.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    The toxins alleged by in the Van Geffen petition are the very same toxins and pollutants that the court in\n    <em>\n     Lodwick\n    </em>\n    found to constitute \"pollutants\" within the meaning of the total pollution exclusion.\n    <em>\n     Lodwick\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7001407\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/126/544/\">\n     126 So.3d at 551-52, 554\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 560-61 ;\n    <em>\n     see also,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Grefer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8997641\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/919/758/\">\n     919 So.2d at 771\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The substances alleged in the Van Geffen lawsuit thus fall squarely within the Evanston policies' definition of \"Pollutants.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      (c) Was there was a \"discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration release or escape\" of a pollutant within the meaning of the policy?\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    As to the final factor in the\n    <em>\n     Doerr\n    </em>\n    test, the Court must consider \"whether the pollutant was intentionally or negligently discharged, the amount of the injury-causing substance discharged, whether the actions of the alleged polluter were active or passive, and any other factor the trier of fact deems relevant.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    In the Van Geffen lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege a long term discharge, release and/or escape of a pollutant caused by Riceland and the other defendants.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Van Geffen plaintiffs complain also about the day to day operations of the various oilfield companies:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n    Defendants knew or should have known that their day to day operations in the Lake Arthur Field would cause the soil, surface waters and groundwater of plaintiff's property to be contaminated with the substances described in paragraphs 7 through 11 above. Rather than remove these substances during and after oil and gas exploration and production activities, defendants chose to conceal and cover up their contamination. This concealment and cover up was routine practice and has continued to date. The defendants' failure to responsibly and timely remove or remediate this toxic pollution in the soils and groundwater of plaintiffs Property has allowed the pollution to migrate and spread. Defendants' pollution has now permanently damaged the drinking water and other aquifers underlying the Field.\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The very nature of the allegations made by the Van Geffen plaintiffs satisfy this factor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <strong>\n     5.\n     <em>\n      Riceland's Allegation that Some Causes of Action Are Not Related to Pollution.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Riceland argues that Evanston has a duty to defend because some causes of\n    action raised by the Van Geffen plaintiffs are grounded on personal injuries, namely trespass and continuing nuisance claims. A review of the Van Geffen petition reflects that all of the plaintiff's claims are based on allegations of contamination by pollution. The\n    <em>\n     Lodwick\n    </em>\n    court rejected this exact argument:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    plaintiffs make no demands for damages concerning defendants' operations other than those related to the seepage or migration of pollutants. For example, plaintiffs do not request damages for the recovery for simple surface-related disturbances such as the unauthorized removal of trees or damage to topsoil. Nor do plaintiffs seek an injunction for the removal of Oracle's stray wells that were operated beyond its mineral lease on plaintiffs' property. In fact, plaintiffs specifically describe the alleged trespass at issue as the \"continued presence of oilfield wastes on plaintiffs' lands,\" and the civil fruits that are alleged to be due are described as the unauthorized \"storage of toxic pollution and wastes in the groundwaters and soils.\" Therefore, we conclude that all of the different theories of recovery and allegations are a direct result of defendants' alleged contamination and pollution damages.\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The court finds this argument has no merit. The pollution exclusions in the Evanston policies unambiguously exclude coverage for the claims raised in the Van Geffen litigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    <strong>\n     6.\n     <em>\n      Riceland's Argument on Coverage D\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Riceland also argues Coverage D would provide apply to the Van Geffen litigation. That provision provides as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      COVERAGE D.\n      <em>\n       BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE - OIL AND GAS LIMITED POLLUTION\n      </em>\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    <em>\n     1.

We may, at our discretion, investigate any \"occurrence\" and settle any claim or \"suit\" that may result.\n    </em>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n    <em>\n     B) This insurance applies to \"bodily injury\" and \"property damage\" only if:\n    </em>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n    <em>\n     (1) The \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" is caused by an \"occurrence\" that takes place in the \"coverage territory\";\n    </em>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n    <em>\n     (2) The \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" occurs during the policy period;\n    </em>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n    <em>\n     (3) The \"occurrence\" became first known to you during the policy period and you report it to us within the policy period or 90 days after the end of the policy period.\n    </em>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Coverage D applies to an \"occurrence\" which is defined in the Evanston Policies as an accident,\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n    which is not what is alleged here. Further, Coverage D requires that the occurrence be known to the insured and reported to Evanston within the policy period or 90 days after the end of the policy period, which did not occur in this case.\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n    Riceland argues that the policy\n    is ambiguous because the word \"and\" is not included between paragraphs (B)(2) and (B)(3) meaning that all three requirements were not necessary. Under Louisiana law, when interpreting a contract, \"[a] provision susceptible of different meanings must be interpreted with a meaning that renders it effective and not with one that renders it ineffective.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    Riceland's reading of this provision, however, would lead to absurd results which would render the provision ineffective. If Riceland's argument were correct, an incident could occur years or even decades after coverage ended and the insurer would be required to provide coverage. Requiring all three conditions to be met in order to trigger coverage under Coverage D is the only reasonable interpretation of the provision. The court must interpret each provision of the policy so that each is \"given the meaning suggested by the contract as a whole.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    <strong>\n     7.\n     <em>\n      Coverage for Damage to Lease Property.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Evanston also argues that there is no coverage for damage to property leased by and/or in the care, custody and control of Riceland.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Coverage A in the Primary Policies excludes coverage for property damage to:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n    <em>\n     (1) Property you own, rent or occupy;\n    </em>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n    <em>\n     (3) Property loaned to you;\n    </em>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n    <em>\n     (5) That particular part of real property on which you or any contractors or subcontractors working directly or indirectly on your behalf are performing operations, if the 'property damage' arises out of those operations; or\n    </em>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n    <em>\n     (6) That particular part of any property that must be restored, repaired or replaced because \"your work\" was incorrectly performed on it.\n    </em>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    <em>\n     The Umbrella Policies exclude coverage for \"property damage\" to:\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n    <em>\n     a.
