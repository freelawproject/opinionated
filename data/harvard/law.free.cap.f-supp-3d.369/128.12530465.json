While the ultimate decision must be grounded in science, that does not mean that there is no place in the decision-making process for discretion and judgment calls. As defendant's\n     <em>\n      Vaughn\n     </em>\n     Index and declaration demonstrate, throughout the development of the Final Cadmium Report, staff had to make decisions about how to respond to public comments, which content to include in the final report, and\n     how to communicate the information; these decisions necessarily involved the sharing of opinions, analysis, and recommendations that did not make it into the final report.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-50\">\n     The documents reviewed by the Court did not contain pages upon pages of technical scientific data. The facts that appeared in the documents were inextricably intertwined with the deliberative discussions and process itself.

Moreover, EPA's declarant averred that the agency conducted a \"line-by-line review\" and \"released all reasonably segregable, non-exempt information to [p]laintiff.\" Gallagher Decl. \u00b6 29. The agency also maintains that \"[t]o the extent there are facts in the withheld information, those facts are an integral part of the deliberations, and the factual information contained therein is [inextricably] intertwined with the deliberative discussions contained in the documents.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     The\n     <em>\n      Vaughn\n     </em>\n     Index supplied by EPA provides a document-by-document justification for each of the 67 records in dispute, describing the deliberative processes involved and justifying the agency's position that no reasonably segregable material could be released.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g., Vaughn\n     </em>\n     Index at 8 (\"[A]ny factual information contained in the email chain reflects the author's selection of facts from a broad range of available information to advise the Agency decision-makers during the deliberative process concerning the deliberative process....

Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 22-28. Plaintiff argues that the agency's \"justifications ... are vague, repetitive, and fail to establish that EPA has met its burden in claiming the disputed information falls within a FOIA exemption.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 25. In support of its argument, plaintiff contends that several\n     <em>\n      Vaughn\n     </em>\n     Index entries are deficient because they do not \"establish the function and significance of a record\" but instead provide \"conclusory recitations of the elements of the deliberative process privilege test and vague assertions of harm.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     (citing the \"dozens\" of allegedly inadequate\n     <em>\n      Vaughn\n     </em>\n     Index entries).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-58\">\n     As noted previously, \"when an agency seeks to withhold information it must provide a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\"\n     <em>\n      Mead Data\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3531381,902110\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/242/\">\n      566 F.2d at 251\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . An agency can carry that burden by submitting declarations and/or a\n     <em>\n      Vaughn\n     </em>\n     Index.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

For example, the description on page 27 of the\n     <em>\n      Vaughn\n     </em>\n     Index states:\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-60\">\n     The withheld information is protected under Exemption 5's deliberative process privilege because it contains internal agency discussions reflecting staff analyses, advice, and recommendations relating to EPA's then ongoing review of public comments and evaluation of the public comment process concerning how to present data related to H.

That description provides the \"function and significance\" of the record because it explains that the document was used to develop a response to public comments concerning a specific organism. Elsewhere in the entry, defendant lists the authors, recipients, their agencies, length of the document, date, and the potential harm of disclosure.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     This information is enough for the government to justify its withholdings.\n     <em>\n      See also\n     </em>\n     Vaughn Index at 47 (\"[D]iscussing EPA's Cadmium Criteria Document as it relates to corals\" which \"reflect[s] EPA and NOAA staff analyses and opinions relating to possible content for the [Final Cadmium Report].\");\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     at 30 (describing document which \"relates to additions to a salmonid study to be considered for inclusion\" and reflects analysis and opinion on \"what content to include\" and \"how to present the discussed content\" in the final report);\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     at 43 (\"draft responses to public comments ... related to the Endangered Species Act (ESA)\").
