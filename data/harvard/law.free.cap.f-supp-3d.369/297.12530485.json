(\"Interinvest\") - and three of its senior executives - Dr. Hans P. Black (\"Dr. Black\"), Stanley T. Schmidt, and Alexander R. Black (\"Alexander Black\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alexander Black now seeks summary\n   judgment on the claims alleging a violation of the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act (\"the '34 Act\") and common law negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dr. Black is a resident and citizen of Canada. In 1980, Dr. Black founded Interinvest, an investment company in Boston, Massachusetts. Interinvest was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and was administratively dissolved on June 30, 2017. At various times, Dr. Black has served as Interinvest's Chairman, President, Chief Compliance Officer (\"CCO\"), and Chief Investment Officer. In 2014, he was Interinvest's sole shareholder, President, and Chief Investment Officer. Additionally, Dr. Black was Plaintiffs' investment adviser at Interinvest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Alexander Black is Dr. Black's son and began working for Interinvest in 2009. In March 2013, Alexander Black became the CCO of Interinvest, taking over for Stanley Schmidt. He also served as President for a period of time between 2013 and 2014. Alexander Black left Interinvest in August 2014 and has not spoken to his father since then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff Jean Stanley opened accounts with Interinvest in 2000 after she heard \"good reports\" about Dr. Black through relatives who had also invested with the company. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ms. Stanley had worked as a commodities trader and as an execution broker for a hedge fund, though she did not professionally trade securities. When Ms. Stanley first invested with Interinvest, she stated specifically that she \"had no tolerance for high risk\" and wanted a stable, relatively safe, investment strategy. Through 2010, Ms. Stanley stated that she was satisfied with how her portfolio was being managed, and that she met with Dr. Black annually to discuss her account generally, though she ultimately gave Dr. Black and Interinvest discretion to make investment decisions for her accounts. These conversations slowly decreased and ultimately stopped after 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff Loretta Clune\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   opened accounts with Interinvest in 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like Ms. Stanley, Ms. Clune had heard of Interinvest through relatives and decided to invest with the company on the recommendation of her nephew. Ms. Clune did not understand investments and her brother, John Quigley, an accountant, received copies of her monthly account statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Though Ms. Clune's accounts lost value in 2008, the decline in performance did not cause her concern because it was in line with the state of the market at the time; ultimately, Ms. Clune invested more money with Interinvest in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Interinvest's Disclosures and Form ADVs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Between 2011 and 2014, Alexander Black began participating in the preparation of Interinvest's Form ADV, the form used by investment advisors to register simultaneously with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and state-level securities authorities. During this time, Dr. Black did not initiate changes to Interinvest's Form ADV, and all changes to Interinvest's Form ADV disclosures were initiated by Alexander Black and Mr. Schmidt. Dr. Black also consistently \"denied ever getting compensation from\" any of the companies for which he served on the board. Alexander Black testified that he asked Dr. Black if he ever received compensation from those companies and Dr. Black claimed that he did not, though when pressed, Dr. Black ultimately conceded that he received stock options. Alexander Black also testified that he took the initiative to look up filings for the companies on which Dr. Black served on the board to determine whether and to what extent Dr. Black had received compensation. In this manner, he discovered that Dr. Black received $ 12,000 from one of the companies. This information was subsequently disclosed on Interinvest's Form ADV in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition, Alexander Black also testified that he and Mr. Schmidt pushed Dr. Black to disclose relevant regulatory matters. In 2011, Dr. Black disclosed to Alexander Black and Mr. Schmidt the existence of an Autorite des Marche Financiers (\"AMF\") action against a Canadian company controlled by Dr. Black that had previously operated as an investment advisory firm. This action was subsequently disclosed on Interinvest's Form ADV. Alexander Black had actual knowledge of one regulatory matter concerning Dr. Black during the time that they were employed by Interinvest, though Dr. Black was involved in two others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At some point between 2011 and 2014, Dr. Black also told Alexander Black and others that he had previously been involved in several civil lawsuits that were resolved through out-of-court settlements. Dr. Black stated that these actions were unrelated to the business of Interinvest and were instead related to currency trading losses he suffered in 2005.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Alexander Black testified that he consulted with Interinvest's counsel at Edwards, Angell, Palmer &amp; Dodge in Boston to verify Dr. Black's position that settled civil actions did not need to be reported on Interinvest's Form ADV and to determine whether any legal actions needed to be disclosed, and was told that disclosure was unnecessary. However, Interinvest's counsel did not provide a formal opinion letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Alexander Black testified that, while he was at Interinvest, he was not aware of any additional director compensation, regulatory actions against Dr. Black, or lawsuits concerning Dr. Black other than those that were disclosed in Interinvest's Form ADV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Investments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In 2012, the risk profile of Plaintiffs' investment accounts with Interinvest began to change. By March 31, 2013, stocks selling for less than $ 1.00 per share, known as penny stocks, made up 50% of Ms. Clune's stock portfolio and 43% of Ms. Stanley's portfolio. Plaintiffs' expert has testified that \"the primary cause of the damages was the transition of historically 'Balanced' accounts owned by the Plaintiffs, to high-risk accounts concentrated in a handful of Nano-cap stocks beginning in 2012.\" These penny stocks included shares in Amorfix, Tyhee Gold Corp., Wi2Wi, and Williams Creek Gold (collectively, \"the portfolio securities\"), among others. All four companies were Canadian corporations and were publicly traded on either the Toronto Stock Exchange or the TSX Venture Exchange. Dr. Black was affiliated with all four portfolio companies and served on their Boards of Directors. He also received a cash fee from Tyhee Gold Corp. and stock options in the other three corporations as compensation for his work as a director.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In December 2013, Dr. Black authorized and initiated Ms. Clune's purchases of unsecured notes in Wi2Wi, a Canadian corporation for which he was a board member. In January 2014, he did the same for Ms. Stanley. That same month, both Ms. Stanley and Ms. Clune contacted Interinvest to inquire about the purchase of Wi2Wi shares. Internal emails from Interinvest suggest the trades were explained to both Plaintiffs, though the content of those conversations is not part of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Wi2Wi notes did not appear in either Plaintiff's account until April 2014. Ms. Stanley and Ms. Clune again contacted Interinvest in July 2014 and both testified that they spoke to Alexander Black at length about their portfolios. Alexander Black does not recall speaking to Ms. Clune.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    4.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Policy Changes and Regulatory Actions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In early 2014, Alexander Black sent out a memo instructing Dr. Black that Interinvest should not be making private placement transactions without clients' express written consent. In March 2014, Alexander Black also attempted to cancel Dr. Black's corporate credit cards. He also sent another memo to employees and directors of Interinvest instructing Dr. Black to cease trading in securities of entities for which he sat on the board of directors. However, Interinvest continued to send \"Dear Friends\" emails to its clients, promoting the portfolio securities at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Around the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") began an audit or examination of Interinvest. During the audit, Dr. Black provided misleading information to the SEC. In a note dated March 14, 2014, Dr. Black led the SEC to believe that he had only been involved in one litigation matter. In April 2015, Ms. Clune received a letter from State Street Bank, the Custodian of her account, that the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities Regulation had started an enforcement action against Interinvest, Dr. Black, and Alexander Black on the basis of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , allegations of securities fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the complaint in this case on December 30, 2016. Of the four named Defendants in the case, only Mr. Schmidt\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Alexander Black remain. The case against Interinvest Corp. and Dr. Black concluded on October 3, 2017 pursuant to a default judgment issued against both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Alexander Black has filed a motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claims under the '34 Act and for negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   During a motion hearing on June 13, 2018, I allowed the parties an opportunity to file additional materials specifically regarding the question of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiffs allege that Alexander Black, by virtue of his position as CCO, had a duty to investigate and disclose information regarding Dr. Black's involvement in litigation and regulatory actions and the fact that Dr. Black received substantial compensation from various portfolio companies. His failure to do so, they allege, constitutes a violation of section 10(b) of the '34 Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The '34 Act makes it \"unlawful for any person ... [t]o use or employ, in connection with the purchase and sale of any security ... any manipulative device or contrivance,\" and gives the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") the power to promulgate rules to enforce this provision. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b). Pursuant to this provision, the SEC has promulgated Rule 10b-5, which makes it unlawful for any person \"by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce ...\" to do any of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Though not made explicit in the text of the statute, courts have consistently read section 10(b) of the '34 Act and Rule 10b-5 together to imply \"a private damages action, which resembles, but is not identical to, common-law tort actions for deceit and misrepresentation.\"\n   <em>\n    Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Broudo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891157\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/336/#p341\">\n    544 U.S. 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 341,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891157\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/336/#p341\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891157\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/336/#p341\">\n    161 L.Ed.2d 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). To succeed on a section 10(b) claim, a plaintiff must show that: (1) there was \"a material misrepresentation (or omission); (2) the defendant had \"scienter, i.e., a wrongful state of mind;\" (3) the alleged wrongful conduct occurred in \"connection with the purchase or sale of a security;\" (4) there was \"reliance;\" (5) the plaintiff suffered economic loss; and, (6) \"loss causation, i.e., a causal connection between the material misrepresentation and the loss.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891157\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/336/#p341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Alexander Black does not contest that there was a material misrepresentation that Plaintiffs relied upon; nor does he contest that the Plaintiffs suffered economic loss. Instead, his motion for summary judgment rests on his contention that the remaining three elements are not met - that the transaction was not made in connection with the purchase or sale of security; that he lacked the requisite scienter; and that there is no loss causation.

Thus, while so-called \"storm warnings\" may trigger the plaintiff's obligation to investigate, they may not trigger the statute of limitations if evidence of the fraud was intentionally kept from the plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730348\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/824/123/#p127\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Here, Alexander Black argues that the Plaintiffs' cause of action began to accrue at the latest in April 2014, when Interinvest disclosed that Dr. Black received cash compensation, stock options, and expense reimbursement from companies on whose boards he served, as well as that he had been the subject of a regulatory action by Canadian securities regulators in 2007. Indeed, some of the same information had been disclosed earlier on the 2013 ADV. Because Plaintiffs did not file suit until December 30, 2016 - some 32 months after he says the cause of action accrued under the discovery rule - Alexander Black argues the Plaintiffs' securities fraud claim is time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The facts regarding earlier disclosure are insufficient to trigger the limitations period. Though the 2013 Form ADV (and, by extension, the 2014 Form ADV) listed Dr. Black's 2007 fine in Quebec by the AMF, neither said anything more with regard to Dr. Black's disciplinary history. Moreover, neither listed any of the private suits brought against Dr. Black, or gave Plaintiffs any indication that those suits even existed. The fact that Plaintiffs' accounts contained penny stocks as early as 2011 also does not trigger the statute of limitations. In January 2014, both Ms. Stanley and Ms. Clune specifically contacted Dr. Black and sought reassurances about their investments, which they received. Plaintiffs argue that up to April 2015, they also continued to receive \"Dear Friends\" letters from Interinvest, extolling the virtues of investing in the very securities at issue in this litigation, including Amorfix Life Sciences, LakeShore Gold, Tyhee Gold, and Williams Creek Gold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs have identified sufficient facts in the record to raise the inference that a \"reasonably diligent investor\" would not have discovered the violation here earlier than December, 2014, two years before this suit was filed, even if she would have been put on inquiry notice to\n   some degree by the April 2014 Form ADV.

Indeed, the Plaintiffs argue - and Alexander Black does not contest the fact - that he was aware of unregistered and unauthorized transactions and that he encouraged Dr. Black to disclose any further involvement with the portfolio companies or in litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   While the evidence of Alexander Black's efforts within Interinvest to limit Dr. Black's misconduct is not, in and of itself, dispositive of the question of liability, it does speak to his intent to deceive or defraud. Despite having ample opportunity to do so, the Plaintiffs here have provided no evidence that Alexander Black affirmatively intended to mislead them, or that he acted in a way that constituted an \"extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.\"\n   <em>\n    Ficken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894556\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/546/45/#p47\">\n    546 F.3d at 47-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Alexander Black attested that he asked Dr. Black if he ever received compensation from these companies and Dr. Black claimed that he did not. When Alexander Black pressed Dr. Black on the compensation issue, Dr. Black finally conceded that he received stock options, after which Alexander Black independently looked at the filings for the relevant companies and disclosed information that he found on Interinvest's Form ADV. Alexander Black also affirmatively asked Dr. Black to share any legal actions that may need to be disclosed, and Dr. Black divulged that he had some legal issues in the past but that they were unrelated to the business of Interinvest. The only action disclosed to him by Dr. Black was the 2007 fine by the AMF, which was consistently disclosed in the Form ADVs. While Alexander Black's failure to investigate further may require further analysis from a negligence perspective, it was not such an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of care as to raise an inference of scienter here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Although Plaintiffs list specific amounts of compensation allegedly paid to Dr. Black from these companies in 2014 in the complaint, they fail to produce any evidence to indicate that Alexander Black had any knowledge of these amounts. Nor have\n   they provided any evidence that Alexander Black acted recklessly by failing to investigate further. Based on the evidence of record, then, I find that there is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to Alexander Black's mental state. He did not possess the requisite scienter and therefore, cannot be held liable under section 10(b) of the '34 Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    4.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loss Causation\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For the sake of completeness, I will briefly address the question of loss causation, since Alexander Black raised the issue in his original motion for summary judgment.

Plaintiffs' expert witness opines that \"[t]he primary cause of the damages was the transition of historically 'Balanced' accounts owned by the Plaintiffs, to high-risk accounts concentrated in a handful of Nano-cap stocks beginning in 2012.\" On this record, plaintiffs have demonstrated that their loss was caused by the investment decisions implemented by Dr. Black, in contravention of Plaintiffs' express instructions and statements concerning their investment goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Alexander Black's argument concerning loss causation rests on his contention that he, personally, did not make any material misrepresentations or take any investment decisions that contributed to the Plaintiffs' injury. This argument reads the loss causation requirement, and Plaintiffs' allegations, too narrowly. Plaintiffs' claims against Alexander Black rest on their contention that he should have known, by virtue of his position as CCO, about the investment decisions and the material misstatements. While his lack of actual knowledge or involvement goes to scienter, it does not demonstrate that there was no causal connection between the alleged misrepresentation and Plaintiffs' injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   At the very least, the record indicates that there is a triable issue of fact as to the causal link between Alexander Black's alleged failure to investigate and disclose information and Plaintiffs' loss. However, because I have already determined as a matter of law that Alexander Black lacks the requisite scienter, I will grant summary judgment to him on the Plaintiffs' section 10(b) claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

The negligence claim rests on the same factual circumstances as the claim under the '34 Act - Plaintiffs allege that, as CCO, Alexander Black had an obligation to supervise\n   Interinvest employees, including Dr. Black, ensure that all proper disclosures were made to Interinvest clients with respect to material conflicts of interest, compensation arrangement, and legal and regulatory events, and ensure that securities traded in client accounts were suitable for those clients and in conformity with their stated investment objectives.

Moreover, Alexander Black affirmatively asked Dr. Black to disclose any legal actions, and reported his 2007 fine by the AMF on the Form ADV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Alexander Black did not, however, conduct any further investigations into disciplinary actions involving Dr. Black, and Plaintiffs have provided evidence that Dr. Black was fined twice more by the AMF, once in March 2008 and once in July 2012. Nor did Alexander Black make any inquiries into Plaintiffs' accounts, though, as Plaintiffs argue, he was in a position to do so by virtue of his role as CCO. Taken together, these facts read in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, can be read to show that Alexander Black did not act with the \"degree of care, vigilance, and forethought\" expected of \"a person of ordinary caution and prudence\" in his position as the CCO and, ultimately, the President of an investment company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=771%20N.E.2d%20209\">\n    771 N.E.2d at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   A reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Alexander Black should have conducted a more searching inquiry into Dr. Black's past, and should have examined Plaintiffs' accounts more carefully. Consequently, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the question of duty and breach that must go to a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loss Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   As with their claim under the '34 Act, Plaintiffs, to succeed on their negligence claim, must be able to show that \"there [is] some reasonable connection between the act or omission of the defendant and the damage which the plaintiff has suffered.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Prosser and Keeton, Torts \u00a7 41, at 263 (5th ed 1984);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Delaney\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582821\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/239/\">\n    63 Mass.App.Ct. 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=825%20N.E.2d%20554\">\n    825 N.E.2d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 556-57 (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The basis for finding causation on the negligence claim is virtually identical to the basis for finding causation with respect to the claim under the '34 Act - Dr. Black and Interinvest made material misrepresentations to Plaintiffs about Dr. Black's background and relationship with certain corporations, and the investment strategy employed to manage Plaintiffs' accounts was contrary to their explicit instructions. Their loss, therefore, was proximately caused by the investment decisions implemented by Dr. Black, in contravention of Plaintiffs' express instructions and statements concerning their investment goals. Alexander Black does not contest this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Instead, his argument concerning loss causation - like his argument with respect to the '34 Act claim - rests on his contention that he, personally, did not make any material misrepresentations or take any investment decisions on those accounts. However, while Alexander Black's involvement within Interinvest goes to the existence (or lack thereof) of a duty owed to the Plaintiffs, it does not directly speak to loss causation. Indeed, Plaintiffs' claims against Alexander Black rest on the contention that he had a duty, as CCO, to investigate and prevent Dr. Black from acting to the Plaintiffs' detriment. The breach of this duty, then, caused the Plaintiffs' loss. If there was a duty, this evidence is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Consequently, as with the '34 Act claim, I find that there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to loss causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, I GRANT Alexander Black's motion [Dkt. No. 153] for summary judgment with respect to the Plaintiffs' claim under section 10(b) of the '34 Act, but DENY the motion for summary judgment with respect to the state-law negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In light of the disposition of this motion, the parties shall consult and provide a status report on or before Friday, April 19, 2019, addressing any further action - including\n   trial (with proposed trial dates) - that must be undertaken to bring this case with respect to Alexander Black to final judgment. A status conference thereon will be held on Thursday, April 25, 2019 at 2:00 p.m. in Courtroom 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Further, counsel for Plaintiffs shall file a separate status report on or before Friday, April 19, 2019, addressing whether the case against Mr. Schmidt in this court should be closed, given the pending claims brought by Plaintiffs against Mr. Schmidt in the Bankruptcy Court of the District of Vermont, which appears to be able to provide the damages for resolution on the merits Plaintiffs initially sought in this court.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 5.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    The cases against Defendants Dr. Hans P.

The motion for summary judgment before me was filed after the entry of default judgment against Dr. Black and Interinvest, and after Mr. Schmidt filed for bankruptcy relief, and concerns only the claims against Alexander Black.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Ms. Clune passed away on September 28, 2018.

Attorney Dallett wrote back to Dr. Black the same day and stated, \"I agree that, as long as these are private plaintiffs (not a regulatory authority) and assuming (i) they have not alleged any breach of the Bermuda Securities Regulations QL111.Y.[,] other investment-related statute or regulation and (ii) they are seeking only money damages, not injunctive relief, there is no reasonable basis for a \"yes\" answer under Item 11.H(2).\" These emails did not constitute a formal opinion letter and were not sent to Alexander Black.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Though Mr. Schmidt is still formally a defendant in this case, proceedings against him have been stayed in this court since May, 2017, when Mr. Schmidt filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in the District of Vermont.\n    <em>\n     See in re\n    </em>\n    Stanley T.
