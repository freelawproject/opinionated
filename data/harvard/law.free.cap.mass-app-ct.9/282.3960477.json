L. c. 60, \u00a7 35, to collect unpaid real estate taxes and unpaid water and sewer use charges on a total of fifteen parcels of real estate for a num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>ber of tax years, some going back as far as 1971.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The answers, which were not verified, alleged deliberate disproportionate and discriminatory assessment by the city and sought declaratory and injunctive relief barring the city \u2022from \u201ccollecting any real estate taxes or other monies alleged to be due.\u201d Affidavits were filed by the parties and the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted in each action. The defendants argue on appeal that summary judgments should not have entered as the entire tax was illegal and unconstitutional. We disagree and affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The city urges that the defendants have not set forth specific facts to counter the evidence supporting its motions for summary judgment, as required by Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(e), 365 Mass. 825 (1974). While it is probable that the city is correct, we do not reach that question, as we uphold the judgments on a more basic ground, also raised by the city, namely, that the defendants have not shown the extraordinary circumstances necessary to permit a challenge to the assessments other than by following the procedures prescribed by G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Since the 1965 decision in <em>Shoppers\u2019 World, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Framingham, </em>348 Mass. 366, 377 (1965), which firmly established an administrative remedy under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, for claims of disproportionate assessment, the Supreme Judicial Court has confined alternative remedies within \u201cnarrow limits.\u201d <em>Tregor </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>377 Mass. 602, 606 (1979). \u201cUnless the administrative remedy is \u2018seriously inadequate\u2019 under all the conditions of the case, it should not be displaced by an action for a declaration (see <em>Leto </em>v. <em>Assessors of Wilmington, </em>348 Mass. 144,149 [1964]), and care must be taken lest allowance of a judicial substitute disrupt unduly the orderly collection of tax.\u201d <em>Sydney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>371 Mass. 289, 294 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>(1976). Whether relief has been sought by a statutory remedy, as in <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>363 Mass. 756, 758 &amp; n.3 (1973) (G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 98), or by a declaration, as in <em>Nearis </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>357 Mass. 203, cert, denied, 400 U.S. 918 (1970), relief has been denied unless the abatement procedures are \u201cseriously inadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The court in <em>Sears </em>left open a possible challenge to a wholly void tax under G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 98. In the present actions, the city is seeking substantial amounts for unpaid sewer and water charges which have become part of the tax to be collected under G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 35, by reason of G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 42C, and G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 38A, and such charges have not been challenged. There is thus no claim by the defendants that the tax is wholly void. See <em>Collector of Taxes of West Bridgewater </em>v. <em>Dunster, </em>231 Mass. 291, 292 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Moreover, although their claim is couched in terms of invalidity, the defendants do not suggest they are not subject to any tax, that the tax is for an illegal purpose or that the assessors lack jurisdiction. The substance of their defense to these actions is that the taxes which were imposed were too high. In such circumstances we do not think the taxpayer is relieved from following the normal abatement route. See <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Glidden, </em>179 Mass. 486, 492-493 (1901), aff\u2019d, 189 U.S. 255 (1903). Even where the tax is alleged to be wholly void, if the substance of the claim is that the assessment is excessive, and if the ordinary abat\u00e9ment procedures \u201care open to . . . (the taxpayer) to seek a revaluation,\u201d G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, is the exclusive method of challenge absent extraordinary circumstances. See <em>Nearis </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>357 Mass, at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The criteria for extraordinary relief are those set forth in <em>Leto </em>v. <em>Assessors of Wilmington, </em>348 Mass. 144, 148-149 (1964).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants have not shown that the abate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ment procedures are \u201cseriously inadequate.\u201d The fact that the time period for obtaining administrative relief has run is no reason to permit declaratory relief. <em>Second Church in Dorchester </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>343 Mass. 477, 479 (1962). <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Burlington, </em>347 Mass. 320, 326 (1964). <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Division of Water Pollution Control, </em>374 Mass. 278, 288 (1978). On the contrary, the defendants\u2019 total disregard for the requirements of the tax system, including the clear method of challenge provided in c. 59, \u00a7 59, precludes any equitable relief, even without considering the drastic fiscal disruption to cities and towns were such a tardy attack permitted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It would be difficult in the circumstances of these actions to imagine any violation \u201cso great\u201d as to find \u201cequitable interference with normal assessment and collection processes\u201d \u201cseasonable\u201d within the meaning of the <em>Leto </em>decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is certainly none here.

Assessors <em>of Lynn </em>v. <em>Shop-Lease Co., </em>364 Mass. 569, 572 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>The judgments are affirmed, with double costs and with interest at twelve percent per annum on the judgments and on the amounts of interest provided for therein.

We note that in discussing the narrow limits or confines of alternate remedies in <em>Tregor </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>377 Mass, at 606 (1979), the court referred to this portion of the <em>Leto </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b305-9\"> The disruption is, of course, far greater than in an action which challenges the validity of the assessment prior to the commitment of the warrant to the tax collector. See <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Division of Water Pollution Control, </em>374 Mass. 278, 287-288 (1978); <em>California Village Corp. </em>v. <em>East Longmeadow, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 128 (1976); <em>Chomerics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Woburn, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 394 (1978), and cases cited in n.4, at 397. We do not suggest that declaratory relief may not be appropriate as a discretionary matter when seasonably sought in circumstances where novel questions, repetitive problems, or the public interest beyond the parties are involved. See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>363 Mass. 685, 688-689 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b305-10\"> See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
