Silvia (husband) appeals from a judgment entered on his motion for modification which, inter alia, orders him to make certain payments to Diane M. Silvia (Diane) for the support of their minor children. The only questions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> before us are whether the trial judge erred in precluding cross-examination relating to Diane\u2019s income and assets and in permitting testimony relating to the income of the present Mrs. Silvia. We hold that the judge erred in excluding examination as to Diane\u2019s resources but did not err in allowing evidence of the income of the husband\u2019s present wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The governing statute for the care and maintenance of minor children after divorce is G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, as last amended by St. 1976, c. 279, \u00a7 1. Section 28, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in relevant part provides that a court may from time to time \u201crevise and alter\u201d its judgment or \u201cmake a new judgment, as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.\u201d The statute refers to the \u201ccircumstances of the parents\u201d and not the circumstances of the male parent. \u201cThis means the court must look at the circumstances of the mother as well as the father . . .\u201d <em>Hursh </em>v. <em>Hursh, </em>26 Ill. App. 3d 947, 950 (1975) (similar statute containing term \u201ccircumstances of the parties\u201d). See also <em>Birge </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>280 So. 2d 482, 483 (Fla. App. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Since the statute treats each parent alike and is unambiguous in this respect, there is no need to resort to legislative history. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>372 Mass. 398, 400 (1977). Moreover, while \u00a7 28 first appeared in somewhat different form in St. 1820, c. 56, \u00a7 1, thus predating many of the other gender neutral provisions of Massachusetts domestic relations law, it is not to be construed in terms of the rules of child support applicable in former periods, rules which, we note, were not wholly clear. See e.g. <em>Dumain </em>v. <em>Gwynne, </em>10 Allen 270, 272 (1865); <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>144 Mass. 25, 27-29 (1887); <em>Tornroos </em>v. <em>R. H. White Co., </em>220 Mass. 336, 342-343 (1915). The statute is now an integral part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>comprehensive statutory<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and common law pattern which places marital and parental obligations on both husband and wife. See <em>Feinberg </em>v. <em>Diamant, </em>378 Mass. 131, 135, 136 (1979). See also <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, </em>371 Mass. 433, 437 (1976); <em>Home </em>v. <em>Home, </em>368 Mass. 120 (1975). When viewed in this context, there is no question that G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, imposes a duty of child support on the wife as well as on the husband. See <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 358, 360 (1975).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is nothing in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, which supports the conclusion of the trial judge that a mother is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>liable for support of minor children only if the father fails or is unable to provide for their support. Accordingly, Diane\u2019s assets and income, if any, must be considered in assessing the husband\u2019s petition for modification. Since the duties of child support prescribed by the statute are fully consistent with the Equal Rights Amendment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we need not consider the effect of that amendment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or of other constitutional provisions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mackenzie, </em>368 Mass. 613, 615-618 (1975). See also <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>440 U.S. 268 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The husband also argues that the judge should not have admitted evidence as to his present wife\u2019s income. The admission was proper. Although a second marriage does not relieve a spouse of marital arid parental obligations, <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>325 Mass. 573, 576 (1950); <em>Pemberton </em>v. <em>Pem-berton, ante </em>9,13 (1980), and although a second husband or wife does not share the duty to obey a support order directed toward the other spouse, see <em>Krokyn </em>v. <em>Krokyn, </em>378 Mass. 206, 215 (1979), the income and assets of second spouses are part of the circumstances relevant to the ability of parents to use their own resources to contribute to the support of their children. <em>Birge </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>280 So. 2d 482, 483 (Fla. App. 1973). <em>Aura </em>v. <em>Aura, </em>342 So. 2d 1200, 1201 (La. App. 1977). See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>13 Wash. App. 381, 386 (1975) (community property State).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">While we do not decide what circumstances other than the resources of the parties are to be taken into account, we note that in the cognate situation of separate support where the term \u201ccircumstances of the parents\u201d is also used, the Legislature has provided extensive but not exclusive guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>posts. See the third and fourth paragraphs of G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 32, inserted by St. 1977, c. 984, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-14\"> The husband appeared before the Appeals Court pro se. The record is insufficient for us to review the judgment insofar as it relates to the denial of his motion for summary judgment, his motion for costs, or his motion for revocation of a suspended sentence imposed in 1977. Since the husband\u2019s complaint for contempt was continued generally and since Diane\u2019s complaint for contempt was continued for review at a later date, there is no final judgment before us relating to these complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\"> \u201cUpon a judgment for divorce, or an action of either parent, or of a next friend in behalf of the children, after notice to both parents after such judgment, the court may make such judgment as it considers expedient relative to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children of the parties, and may determine with which of the parents the children or any of them shall remain, or may award their custody to some third person if it seems expedient or for the benefit of the children; and afterward may from time to time, upon the action of either parent, or of a next friend, revise and alter such judgment or make a new judgment, as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require. The court may make appropriate orders of maintenance, support and education of any child who has attained age eighteen but who has not attained age twenty-one and who is domiciled in the home of a parent, and is principally dependent upon said parent for maintenance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><em> Duties as to children. </em>Both parents have a duty to support their children. G. L. c. 117, \u00a7 9, as appearing in St. 1974, c. 787, \u00a7 1. G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 848, \u00a7 2. G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 4, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 848, \u00a7 3. G. L..c. 273, \u00a7 8, as amended through St. 1960, c. 791. The power of the court to order either parent to support children continues after the parents are separated, G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 37, as amended through St. 1976, c. 279, \u00a7 2, and also pending a divorce. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 20, as last amended by St. 1977, c. 609, \u00a7 3. The statute cited in the text of this opinion, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, provides for such orders after divorce. Both parents have a duty to support their illegitimate children. G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 15, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 848, \u00a7 6. They are both liable for certain willful acts of children in their custody. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85G, inserted by St. 1979, c. 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\"><em>Duties as to spouse. </em>Each spouse has a duty to support the other and may bring an action against the other for support and the support of minor children whether or not the spouses are living apart. G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 32, as last amended by St. 1977, c. 984, \u00a7 1. While an action for divorce is pending, payment can be ordered to either spouse for the other\u2019s support as well as for child support. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 17, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 400, \u00a7 21. After divorce, alimony or a portion of the estate of either spouse may be awarded to the other, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 467, and an award of alimony or an annual allowance for the spouse or children may be revised upon an action for modification brought by either party. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 37, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 495.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\"> Other States have imposed such a duty based on common law, e.g., <em>Picht </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>252 Iowa 559, 562 (1961), or statutory law, e.g., <em>Muldrow </em>v. <em>Muldrow, </em>61 Cal.
