We think the commission applied an incorrect rule of law and, therefore, reverse the judgment entered by a judge of the Superior Court which upheld the action of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">We summarize the proceedings and relevant facts as disclosed by the record. On June 14, 1976, after a hearing as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>provided by G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (a), <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the superintendent of the Belchertown State School (superintendent) found that the employee, the institution\u2019s chief power plant engineer, had acted improperly as set forth in twelve specified written charges and ordered the employee dismissed. The employee appealed to the commission pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (b), whereupon the commission modified the action of the superintendent and ordered an eighteen-month suspension. The employee appealed to a District Court pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 45, and the superintendent brought an action for relief in the nature of certiorari in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. The employee\u2019s action was transferred to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 <em>2(b), </em>upon motion of the superintendent. A judge of the Superior Court upheld the decision of the commission and the superintendent has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">A hearing officer of the commission had filed a comprehensive \u201cRecommended Decision\u201d containing more than fifty-one findings. She found that six of the charges against the employee were proved by the appointing authority in whole or in part, including \u201ccharge #3,\u201d the accusation of unethical conduct. The other charges of which the employee was found guilty are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Charge 3 arose out of an incident which occurred in May, 1973, and charged the employee with attempting \u201c to secure personal compensation in exchange for agreeing to improper utilization\u201d of the school\u2019s facilities. There was evidence that the Belchertown State School allowed contractors who obtained a permit from the town clerk to dump \u201cseptage\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at the school. The cost of such a permit was $750. The hearing officer found that the employee had granted a contractor. permission to dump septage without a permit on condition that the contractor give the employee an air conditioner for his office. The hearing officer also found that although the air conditioner was never received, the employee had consented to the exchange, and was therefore guilty of unethical conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">The employee argued before the hearing officer that all twelve charges lodged against him were stale and should be dismissed. The argument was a legal one and the hearing officer treated it as such. After quoting a passage from <em>Mayor of Medford </em>v. <em>District Court, </em>249 Mass. 465, 469 (1924),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> she concluded, \u201cThis holding is applicable here. Pursuant thereto, Charge 3, which occurred two years ago, is not timely filed.\u201d She also found that the other charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>were filed \u201creasonably within the limits allowed\u201d in the <em>Mayor of Medford </em>case, and that those charges, \u201ctaken individually ... or taken as a whole,\u201d were of a \u201ccharacter sufficiently serious\u201d to merit dismissal. Accordingly, she recommended that the appointing authority\u2019s decision of dismissal be affirmed. The commission voted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">\u201cTo acknowledge receipt of the Hearing Officer\u2019s report, to adopt the findings of fact, and to affirm the action of the appointing authority in disciplining the employee, but to modify the action to an 18-month suspension. Although Charges 3, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 12 were proven by the appointing authority, the Commission considers Charge #3, the most serious of the charges, to be stale and, therefore no basis for disciplinary action. In the opinion of the Commission, the sum of the remaining charges, namely, Charges 6, 7, 9, 10 and 12, which were proven, do not provide sufficient basis for discharge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In this appeal, the commission argues that the question whether an appointing authority has condoned an employee\u2019s past misconduct, and thereby waived its right to discipline the employee, is one of fact to be decided by the commission. This contention misses the point. We have set out at considerable length the proceedings before the commission and its extensive findings. There is not a single finding among the fifty-one adopted by the commission which relates to condonation. The hearing officer\u2019s ruling, relying on <em>Mayor of Medford </em>(see note 5, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text) indicates that her determination was a legal ruling. There is nothing in the one paragraph vote of the commission which changes that ruling into a factual determination of waiver or condonation.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The commission alternatively argues (somewhat at variance with the prior contention that the issue is a factual one) that the commission was following a consistent policy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>treating the charge as stale. This claim has no support in the record. For all that appears, the commission is here adopting a conclusive rule of staleness \u201cfor the first time in the present case, absent any prior promulgation of such a rule or even any indication that\u201d the commission applied it in other cases. See <em>Xtra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Rev., 380 Mass. 277, 282 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Treating the determination of staleness, as we must in the circumstances of this case, as a ruling of law, we think the ruling is erroneous. It is significant that G. L. c. 31 does not contain any limit of time on the preferring of charges. Contrast N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law \u00a7 75(4) (McKinney 1973), which provides for a three7year period except where the misconduct would, if proved, constitute a crime. We note also that G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 <em>2(b), </em>inserted by St. 1962, c. 779, \u00a7 1, under which it is a criminal action for a public employee to seek to \u201creceive anything of value for himself ... in return for . . . being influenced in his performance of any . . . act within his official responsibility,\u201d carries a six-year statute of limitation. G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 63. An appointing authority may await the outcome of criminal charges before preferring civil ones, <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of Brighton, </em>369 Mass. 166, 173 (1975), and we see nothing in c. 31 which requires a shorter period for civil charges as a matter of law. <em>Mayor of Medford, </em>249 Mass, at 469, does not support the conclusion of the commission or suggest a limitation period of approximately eleven months. On the contrary, the court there stressed that the character of the breach of duty, rather than the time after which the charge was brought, was the factor to be given weight (see note 5, <em>supra) </em>and expressly noted that while a long delay might, in some situations, be evidence of bad faith, the eleven-month period involved in that case was \u201cshort even for that purpose\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 469-470. In this case, the breach, involving solicitation of a bribe, is very serious and goes to the heart of the integrity expected of a public employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">We conclude that the commission applied an incorrect rule in determining that the charge was stale as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>law and could not be considered in determining the penalty. Moreover, even had the charge been stale, the commission might well have considered the charge, in its discretion, in determining the ultimate disciplinary action to be taken on subsequent charges of breaches of duty. <em>Daniell </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Me. R.R., </em>184 Mass. 337, 340-341 (1903). <em>Mayor of Medford, </em>249 Mass, at 473. See <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. 612, 619-620 (1961); <em>Lower </em>v. <em>North Middlesex Regional Sch. Comm., 8 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 536, 540 (1979). Compare <em>Trustees of State Library </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 724, 725 (1975), where the employee\u2019s previous record had not been seasonably brought to the commission\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The recommendation of the hearing officer and the vote of the commission show that but for the application of the erroneous rule of law by which charge 3 was determined to be stale, the commission\u2019s decision to modify the appointing authority\u2019s order would probably not have been made. Cf. <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Everett, </em>354 Mass. 461, 463 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Since the commission\u2019s decision was premised upon an error of law, see <em>Selectmen of Framingham </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 406 (1979), the judgment of the Superior Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court with the direction that it be remanded to the commission for a determination whether, in light of this opinion, \u201cthe action of the appointing authority was justified\u201d. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43(h). The commission shall report its supplementary decision to the Superior Court, which shall retain jurisdiction and, after appropriate further proceedings, enter a new judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-5\"> A revision of G. L. c. 31 was effected by St. 1978, c. 393. The provisions for a hearing before the appointing authority now appear in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41. In so far as it affects Carr, the substance of the current version of c. 31 does not differ from that of the earlier statute. Reference in this opinion to c. 31 will be to former c. 31 which was in effect at the time of the hearings before the appointing authority and the commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b777-9\"> The hearing officer found the employee guilty of the following: charge 6, \u201cknowingly creating a hazardous situation\u201d by turning off pumps of the septage system which caused insufficiently treated effluent to back into the water storage ponds on four occasions in May, 1975; part of charge 7, namely, a failure by the employee in June, 1975, to carry his engineer\u2019s license on his person as required, so that another engineer had to be obtained; on charges 9 and 10, \u201crefusal to perform assigned duties,\u201d in that an investigation in February, 1976, showed that the employee had failed \u201cto meet the requisite level of thoroughness\u201d in safety inspections of buildings and to review the emergency and safety capabilities of the staff, such failure constituting a \u201cconstructive refusal to perform assigned duties;\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>charge 12, \u201cabsence from duty without authority,\u201d in being in Ludlow on March 6, 1976, while he was listed as being on duty. (Charge 11 alleged other absences from duty without authority which the hearing officer found not proved. Although the hearing officer joined charges 11 and 12 the commission separated them and found that only 12 was proved.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b778-8\"> Waste materials and water which accumulates in septic tanks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b778-9\"> That case concerned the removal by the mayor of a police officer for conduct unbecoming an officer. The District Court judge held that a charge made on February 13, 1923, of conduct occurring on March 30, 1922, was too remote. The Supreme Judicial Court noted that this conclusion \u201ccannot rightly be regarded as anything other than a ruling of law. It was erroneous. No such period of limitation as less than eleven months bars conduct unbecoming a police officer from being considered as a reason for removing him. It is the character of the breach of duty which ought to have weight on the question of removal and not the period of time, within reasonable limits, after which the charge is made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The hearing officer set forth in her decision the last and penultimate sentences of the foregoing quotation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
