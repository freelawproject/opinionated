L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, inserted by St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 5, the statute concerned with medical malpractice tribunals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>The statute is set forth in relevant part in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The plaintiff has appealed from the orders of a single justice of this court denying his motion to file the required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>bond under \u00a7 60B late, allowing the defendants\u2019 motion to appeal to the full court of the Appeals Court from orders of the Superior Court denying the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, and staying all proceedings until further order of this court. The defendants appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s denial of their motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The precise issue in this case causes us to focus on that language of \u00a7 60B which requires the posting of a bond \u201cwithin thirty days of the tribunal\u2019s finding\u201d if the tribunal has adjudged the plaintiff\u2019s case an \u201cunfortunate medical result\u201d lacking \u201ca legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">A description of the procedural odyssey of this case is tedious but essential to a resolution of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>The plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court against the defendants on June 21, 1978, alleging a want of professional skill in the treatment of Alan D. Goldstein, the plaintiff\u2019s testator, by failing seasonably to diagnose a thoracic lesion as malignant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following the filing of the defendant\u2019s answer, a medical tribunal was convened on February 13, 1979, pursuant to the mandate of \u00a7 60B. The tribunal\u2019s report, which is dated February 20, 1979, and which bears the legend \u201c Copies mailed 2-20-79,\u201d determined that an unfortunate medical result had occurred and required the plaintiff to file a bond in the sum of $2,000 within thirty days of the tribunal\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The plaintiff moved for the convocation of a new tribunal on March 6, 1979, though the motion bears the date March 2, 1979. A motion to stay the posting of the bond pending action on the motion for a new tribunal hearing was also filed on March 6, 1979. This motion is dated February 27, 1979. Both motions were denied on March 15, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The plaintiff next sought relief under Mass. R.A.P. 6, as amended, 371 Mass. 914 (1976), by way of a petition filed on March 21, 1979, in the Supreme Judicial Court. The petition was transferred to this court. G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A. A single justice heard the matter and denied that part of the petition requesting a stay of the bond posting requirement on the same day. The remainder of the petition, which should for accuracy\u2019s sake be denominated a motion, sought a declaration of rights as to the procedural boundaries of a medical malpractice tribunal. This segment was denied by the single justice on March 28, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Two things occurred on March 23, 1979, in the Superior Court: the plaintiff posted security in the amount of $2,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>in satisfaction of the bond requirement, $nd the defendant filed a motion to dismiss founded on the plaintiff\u2019s failure to post a bond within thirty days of the tribunal\u2019s finding. This motion to dismiss was denied on April 3, 1979, but there followed on April 25, 1979, a second motion to dismiss predicated on the theory that the plaintiff filed security of only $2,000 whereas such security should have been $4,000 because there were two defendants. On the same day, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion for a report under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111. All three motions were denied on May 3, 1979. Notice of appeal to this court from the denial of these motions was filed on May 31, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">This is not the end of the foray into the appellate woods. The defendant then sought to invoke the aid of the first paragraph of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, seeking leave from the Appeals Court to file an interlocutory appeal from the denial of his motion to dismiss (though it is not clear to which motion to dismiss he refers). He also sought a stay of \u201call further proceedings in the case below pending appeal.\u201d This was filed on May 14, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The plaintiff countered with a motion for late filing of the bond, \u201cnun <em>(sic) </em>pro tunc to March 23, 1979.\u201d A singl\u00e9 justice of this court denied this motion on May 22, 1979, but granted the defendant leave to file a claim of appeal to the full court of the Appeals Court from the Superior Court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss. The plaintiff responded with a motion for reconsideration of the order of the single justice permitting the defendant to file an appeal to the full court and with an objection to the same order. These motions were denied and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">From the foregoing procedural underbrush, two viable issues emerge: (1) the timeliness of the bond\u2019s posting; (2) the number or amount of the bond(s) required to be posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">1. <em>Timeliness of the bond posting. </em>The plaintiff filed a bank passbook in the office of the clerk of court which represented a deposit of $2,000. The defendant does not argue that this bank book is not the equivalent of a bond for purpose of \u00a7 60B and reference to it as a bond will be made for convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>The bond was filed on March 23, 1979. The tribunal\u2019s finding was made and mailed on February 20, 1979. In the computation of time, the day of the event is disregarded but the last day of the required period is included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. Mass.R.Civ.P. 6(a). Section 60B provides that the bond shall be posted within 30 days of the tribunal\u2019s finding. The 30th day after February 20, 1979, was March 22, a Thursday.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The plaintiff correctly relies on two rules in arguing for a computation of time which will render his bond posting seasonable on the thirty-first day after the tribunal\u2019s finding. Mass.R.Civ.P. 6(d), 365 Mass. 748 (1974), provides that \u201c (w)henever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other papers upon him and the notice or paper is served upon him by mail, three days shall be added to the prescribed period.\u201d If three days are added to the thirty days mentioned in \u00a7 60B, the filing of the plaintiff\u2019s bond was seasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">There is merit to this argument when rule 6(d) is read in conjunction with Mass.R.Civ.P. 77(d), 365 Mass. 838 (1974), set forth in full in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which requires the clerk to serve notice of an order of the court on the parties by mail. Clearly, an order of the tribunal is an order within rule 77(d). <em>Hanley </em>v. <em>Polanzak, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 270, 274 (1979). <em>Hanley, </em>though easily distinguishable on its facts because there the parties never received notice of the tribunal\u2019s order from the clerk, lends an invigorating measure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>cogency to the plaintiff\u2019s position when it says that \u201cthe thirty-day period in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, begins to run when the tribunal\u2019s decision has been docketed and notice of it has been sent to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275. It follows, then, that the docketing and mailing of the notice on February 20, 1979, came within the sweep of rule 77(d) which, in turn, triggered the application of rule 6(d) which confers the additional three days. Nothing to the contrary appears in <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Glixman, </em>379 Mass. 60, 63-64 (1979), in which the court refers only to the risk of not filing the bond at all. The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Boston Univ. Hosp., </em>372 Mass. 654 (1977), is misplaced. <em>Austin </em>does not reach the issue of timeliness in posting a bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">2. <em>The number of bonds. </em>The defendant\u2019s argument that his motion to dismiss should have been allowed because the plaintiff posted only $2,000 and not $4,000, there being two defendants, is without merit. The judge was evidently satisfied with the amount of security posted by the plaintiff because he denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss which raised this issue. We do not suggest that one bond would ordinarily be sufficient for two defendants. See <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine </em>380 Mass. 186, 196 (1980), but the two defendants in the instant case are almost indistinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">To conclude, there was no error in the denial of the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The plaintiff\u2019s posting of $2,000 on March 23, 1979, constituted compliance with \u00a7 60B as to timeliness and amount. The action of the judge of the Superior Court in denying the motion to dismiss is affirmed. As we have concluded that the filing of the bond was timely, we do not consider the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the denial of his motion to file the bond late.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-16\"> See: <em>(1) Austin v. Boston Univ. Hosp., </em>372 Mass. 654 (1977) (a medical malpractice action brought in a court other than the Superior Court must be referred to a tribunal for action in accordance with \u00a7 60B; the Legislature intended \u00a7 60B to apply only to a medical malpractice action filed on or after January 1, 1976); (2) <em>Paro </em>v. <em>Longwood Hosp., </em>373 Mass. 645 (1977) (the requirement of \u00a7 60B that, as a condition for further prosecution a bond be imposed on plaintiff whose medical malpractice claim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>found to have no legal merit does not deny plaintiff equal protection or due process, nor does it constitute a legislative obstruction to a judicial hearing); (3) <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass. 573 (1978) (the procedural instructions of c. 93A, \u00a7 9, do not exempt consumer claims from the malpractice screening procedure, if they relate to medical treatment; the tribunal\u2019s standard is comparable to the test for a directed verdict); (4) <em>Salem Orthopedic Surgeons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>377 Mass.

(7) <em>Gugino </em>v. <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, </em>380 Mass. 464 (1980) (plaintiff s offer of proof sufficient, and imposition of bond in amount of $4,500 an abuse of discretion under circumstances disclosed in plaintiffs affidavit); (8) <em>Aker </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>7 Mass.

Admissible evidence shall include, but not be limited to, hospital and medical records, nurses\u2019 notes, x-rays and other records kept in the usual course of the practice of the health care provider without the necessity for other identification or authentication, statements of fact or opinion on a subject contained in a published treatise, periodical, book or pamphlet or statements by experts without the necessity of such experts appearing at said hearing. The tribunal may upon the application of either party or upon its own decision summon or subpoena any such records or individuals to substantiate or clarify any evidence which has been presented before it and may appoint an impartial and qualified physician or surgeon or other related professional person or expert to conduct any necessary professional or expert examination of the claimant or relevant evidentiary matter and to report or to testify as a witness thereto. Such a witness shall be allowed traveling expenses and a reasonable fee to be fixed by the tribunal which shall be assessed as costs.

Said single justice may, within his discretion, increase the amount of the bond required to be filed. If said bond is not posted within thirty days of the tribunal\u2019s finding the action shall be dismissed. Upon motion filed by the plaintiff, and a determination by the court that the plaintiff is indigent said justice may reduce the amount of the bond but may not eliminate the requirement thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\"> We shall refer in the singular to both defendants Edward M.

Such mailing is sufficient notice for all purposes for which notice of the entry of an order is required by these rules; but any party may in addition serve a notice of such entry in the manner provided in Rule 5 for the service of papers.
