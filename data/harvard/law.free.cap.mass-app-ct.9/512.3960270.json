Winter appeals from convictions on two indictments, each charging that \u201cbetween the first day of August [1977] . . . and the thirtieth day of September [1977]\u201d he conspired with one Salvatore Sperlinga and one Herbert T. Foster, Sr. to \u201cthreaten an injury to the person or property of another by a verbal communication with intent thereby to extort ... a pecuniary advantage, or with intent to compel said person to do an act against his will.\u201d See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 25. The answer to the defendant\u2019s motions for particulars alleges as to both indictments that \u201c[t]o the best of the Commonwealth\u2019s knowledge this offense began on or about the first day of August, 1977, and continued through the thirtieth day of September, 1977.\u201d The particulars further allege that \u201c[t]he manner and means by which th[e] crime [charged in one of the indictments] was committed were that Howard Winters, Salvatore Sperlinga and Herbert Foster conspired between and among each other to maliciously threaten an injury to Austin Griffin, and/or to the property of said Griffin, and his employer, the Disabled American Veteran\u2019s Club [DAV]\u201d and that \u201c[t]he manner and means by which th[e] crime [charged in the other indictment] was committed were that Howard Winters, Salvatore Sperlinga, and Herbert Foster conspired ... to maliciously threaten an injury to Arthur Agostinelli, Sr. and/or to the property of said Agostinelli, and his employer, Somerset Vending Company [Somerset].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These indictments were tried with two indictments against Sperlinga and two indictments against Foster, all making the same charges. Sperlinga was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>convicted on both indictments and appealed; Foster was acquitted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the oral argument of the Winter and Sper-linga appeals, Sperlinga died, and the two indictments against him are to be dismissed in the Superior Court. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>379 Mass. 917 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The evidence marshalled by the prosecution included testimony by Griffin, an officer of the DAY, Agostinelli, who had an interest in and was employed by Somerset, and one Robinson, engaged in the business of manufacturing and distributing coin operated machines, who testified to conversations with Foster and a meeting with Winter, Sperlin-ga and Foster. The Commonwealth\u2019s case also included.testimony by one DelVendo, a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of the United States Treasury Department and a member of the DAY, about conversations with Sperlinga and testimony by one Percy Sylvester, an officer of Somerset.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Griffin testified that on September 21, 1977, about 10:00 to 10:30 a.m. , he was at the DAY post<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>when two men, who were strangers to him and whom he identified at trial as Winter and Sperlinga, rang the doorbell; he let them in. From the prosecuting attorney\u2019s questioning the jury could have reconstructed the following scenario:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">Winter (in a \u201clouder than normal\u201d voice as he and Sper-linga entered the premises): \u201cWho runs this place?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACA\">Griffin: \u201cI do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">Winter: \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">Griffin: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">Winter: \u201cI\u2019m Howie Winters. It cost me a bundle of money to make these machines legal,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>and I\u2019m going to get it back. Those machines[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] are going out and mine are coming in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">Griffin: \u201cWe own those machines, we have owned them for years. We pay a Federal tax on them of $1000 a year. We spent money on those machines . . . Those are our own machines. What are you going to do about it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Griffin further testified that he then went on to tell Winter how much the machines were worth and Winter said, \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of that.\u201d Griffin also testified that: \u201cI then said to him that a decision like this I couldn\u2019t make myself. I wanted to have two weeks to get the executive board together to talk it over.\u201d He further testified: \u201cThat was Wednesday. I said, \u2018Give me a week.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">Winter: \u201cI\u2019ll give you till Friday. Get them down here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">Griffin: \u201cWe\u2019ll probably close the building up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">Winter and Sperlinga left about 11:00 a.m. Griffin testified, over objection and exception, that he was \u201cscared blue\u201d \u2014 an old fashioned expression which he explained as meaning \u201cfrightened and nervous\u201d \u2014 and that \u201c[mjentally, I haven\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep since this thing.\u201d At about noon, Griffin spoke to the treasurer of the DAY and thereafter phoned the members of the executive committee, eleven or twelve in number, for an emergency meeting the next evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">The same day at about 2:30 p.m., Winter and Sperlinga visited Somerset, which places and services coin operated machines in clubs and other establishments with which it shares the proceeds. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There they spoke with Agostinelli. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The scenario which the jury could have reconstructed was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">Sperlinga (as the door was opened to let Winter and him in): \u201cHi, we\u2019re looking for Gus.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">Agostinelli: \u201cI\u2019m Gus.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">Sperlinga: \u201cHi, I\u2019m Sal [mentioning his last name which Agostinelli did not completely catch]. This is Howie Winters. We\u2019d like to talk to you. Is there some place we can go and talk?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">Agostinelli: \u201cYes, come in, in the back room. We can talk there.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvG\">Sperlinga: \u201cYou know why we are here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apy\">Agostinelli: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4q\">Sperlinga: \u201cYou must have an idea why we\u2019re here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-11\">Agostinelli: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-12\">Winter: \u201cYou have been operating in this city long enough. It cost me a bundle to get these licenses passed. I\u2019ll give you two days to get your machines out of the city, or you\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-13\">Agostinelli: \u201cWell, I thought when you were getting licenses passed through the city, that. . . you wanted to just put them in the barrooms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay1\">Winter: \u201cThis is not for barrooms, only. This is for the whole city. I own this city. This is my city. You\u2019re all done now. You have two . . . alternatives. Either put a reasonable price on the machines and we\u2019ll buy them, or take them out and we\u2019ll install our own. If you don\u2019t, we\u2019ll send someone down to collect back dues for all the years you have been operating in Somerville. And if you don\u2019t [pay], you\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-15\">Agostinelli: \u201cYou mean to say you can come in and tell someone that he\u2019s out of business?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Winter: \u201cAs far as Somerville is concerned, you\u2019re out of business. You\u2019re all done. This is my city. I own it. We\u2019ll be back on Saturday to see you to find out what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amr\">Agostinelli: \u201cI\u2019ll not be here Saturday. My wife and I are going away for the weekend, and we won\u2019t be back until Monday.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">Winter: \u201cWell, we\u2019ll be in to see you Monday.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Agostinelli testified that during much of the conversation Winter \u201cwas actually yelling at me\u201d and \u201cshaking his finger right at my nose.\u201d Agostinelli testified, over objection and exception, that he felt \u201clike I was going to die or collapse,\u201d his \u201cstomach was turning inside out,\u201d and his \u201chead started to spin.\u201d He \u201c didn\u2019t know what was going on or what was going to happen.\u201d At the end of the conversation he let Winter and Sperlinga out, went back to his desk, lit a cigarette and shook his head. He then went into Sylvester\u2019s office \u201cshaking like a leaf.\u201d His voice was \u201c[k]ind of shaky\u201d and he was \u201cpanting.\u201d After talking to Sylvester for about ten or fifteen minutes, he returned to his desk and sat \u201c[w]ith my feet under the desk and in a prone position, trying to relax, which I couldn\u2019t do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">This testimony was corroborated by that of Percy Sylvester, whose office adjoined the room in which the meeting among Agostinelli, Winter and Sperlinga had taken place. Sylvester testified, over objection and exception, that after the meeting Agostinelli came into his office and leaned against the door frame. It could have been found that this was about thirty seconds after Agostinelli had let Winter and Sperlinga out of the premises. Sylvester testified that the following took place: \u201cHe [Agostinelli] said, \u2018Did you hear what those two guys says to me?\u2019 I says, \u2018No, what guys?\u2019 And he names them, \u2018Winters,\u2019 and it was Sperlin-der [sic] or whatever. I said, \u2018Well, what?\u2019 And he says, \u2018Well, he says if we don\u2019t get out of the business, they\u2019re going to break my legs, they\u2019re going to do other things.\u2019 I said, \u2018Forget it and go back to work.\u2019\u201d Sylvester testified that \u201che looked shook up to me, or nervous.\u201d He amplified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>this: \u201cWell, it\u2019s hard to explain to another individual. A fellow says you\u2019ve got cancer, how would you feel? About the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Robinson testified that in mid August, 1977, as a result of a telephone call from Foster, whom he had not previously known, he went to Foster\u2019s place of business in Somerville, which contained about fifty new coin operated machines. Foster told him, \u201c[W]e are taking over the city\u201d; and when Robinson asked, \u201cWho\u2019s taking over the city,\u201d Foster replied, \u201cHowie.\u201d Foster said, as put by Robinson, \u201cthat Howie was ranting and raving and he wanted the machines installed in all the barrooms, in all the clubs in the city. And he wanted to do it immediately.\u201d Robinson replied, \u201cSo what.\u201d Robinson further testified that \u201cMr. Foster wanted me to relay the message to all the other operators to get out of the city, that they were taking over the whole city.\u201d Robinson then told Foster that he was going to see Sylvester and would relay his message. Foster also said, as reported by Robinson, that \u201che had a meeting on Wednesday[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] at Winter Hill and he had to give Howie and Sal an answer;\u201d The meeting then ended, and Robinson went to see Sylvester.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In the first week in September, as a result of a call from Foster, Robinson, Foster, Winter and Sperlinga met in Chelsea. According to Robinson, Winter began the conversation: \u201cWe\u2019re taking over the machines, all the machines in the city. We\u2019ll offer you a price for your machines as they stand on location, the way they are now.\u201d Robinson further testified that \u201cMr. Winters said, in a loud voice, \u2018You\u2019re all done in this city. I own this city. I\u2019m taking it over and you\u2019re also going to back out of all the clubs.\u2019 And he said, . . . \u2018This is my city and if this doesn\u2019t happen, I\u2019m going to charge you back for all the time you and all the others have been in the city.\u2019\u201d Robinson laughed and said, \u201cYes, well, how much are you going to charge Mr. Sylvester <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>for the length of time he has been in the city?\u201d Robinson also testified that at one point in the conversation Winter \u201csaid he would get rough on me and the rest of us if we didn\u2019t back out of all the clubs in the city. And he said he could be plenty rough. . . . He said we\u2019re all done in this city and we\u2019re to get out, get out of all the clubs. He would put his own machines in the clubs.\u201d When Robinson pointed out that he was the only one in the country who was manufacturing a certain machine, Foster reached over and spoke to Winter; \u201cwith that Mr. Winters cooled down.\u201d Winter then said, \u201cWell, maybe I came on a little strong.\u201d Robinson replied, \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll relate your message to the rest of them.\u201d The meeting thereupon broke up. After the meeting Robinson again went to see Sylvester.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Subsequently, about the middle of September, Foster again telephoned Robinson, and Robinson went to Foster\u2019s place of business in Somerville. Robinson testified that \u201cMr. Foster said that Mr. Winter was hot, ranting and raving. He wanted him to take over all the clubs.\u201d Foster complained that \u201che couldn\u2019t handle the barrooms and pin-balls in the barrooms, let alone the clubs.\u201d Foster said that \u201che was caught in the middle and he didn\u2019t know how to get out of it.\u201d Robinson responded, \u201cWell, you\u2019re going to wind up in front of the grand jury. . . . [YJou\u2019re going to find yourself in a bind, just like Bobby Martinez.\u201d Foster again said that \u201che knew, but he didn\u2019t know how to get out of it.\u201d Foster Said that Winter \u201cwanted no back-talk .... He wanted an answer . . . and he wanted it immediately.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Robinson then said that he was going to see Sylvester. Foster said \u201cto tell Mr. Sylvester that he had to back out of all the clubs in the city, too.\u201d Robinson replied, \u201cI\u2019ll relay your message.\u201d After the meeting Robinson again went to see Sylvester.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Winter testified in his own behalf that on September 21, 1977, he and Sperlinga did, indeed, visit both the DAY and Somerset in an endeavor to help Foster find locations for his pinball machines. He testified that one day in the middle of August, he and Sperlinga were in a diner when Foster came in. They invited Foster to sit down with them. In the course of a conversation Foster asked whether he and Sper-linga \u201ccould give him a hand to get some locations around the city.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They both said that they \u201cwould try to get him some locations to place his pinball machines.\u201d That was the end of the conversation. Winter did nothing about the matter until September 21. That morning he again saw Sper-linga at the diner and asked him if he had done anything about getting locations for Foster\u2019s pinball machines. Sper-linga said that he had spoken to several barroom owners. Winter suggested that they visit some of the clubs \u2014 the fraternal organizations in the city \u2014 and \u201cthen we decided to go to a few of the clubs and see what we could do.\u201d They then went to the DAY which was \u201c[t]he nearest one to where we were at. . . .\u201d There they spoke to Griffin. Winter\u2019s version of the meeting with Griffin varied considerably from that given by Griffin. They then went to Post 388 of the American Legion, but the person in charge of the machines was not there. Next they went to the Moose Lodge, where the bartender told him that the person in authority was not there. The bartender then suggested that they should \u201csee a guy by the name of Gus at National Music Company. He seemed to have all the machines in all these clubs.\u201d They then left and had lunch. After lunch they went looking for the National Music Company, which they finally found (its name had been changed to Somerset), and spoke to Agostinelli. Again, Winter\u2019s version of the meeting differed from that given by Agostinelli. He and Sperlinga then parted. Winter denied any meeting with Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Winter was sentenced to nine to ten years on each of the two indictments, the sentences to run consecutively. He contends that this was double punishment in violation of his rights under the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. He also raises various evidentiary issues and asserts prosecutorial misconduct. We agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the imposition of consecutive sentences in this case was error; we reject his other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">1. <em>Double jeopardy. </em>In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977), the Supreme Court of the United States described the function of the double jeopardy clause applicable in this case: \u201cWhere consecutive sentences are imposed at a single criminal trial, the role of the constitutional guarantee is limited to assuring that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969). The double jeopardy clause is not implicated in the prosecutor\u2019s choice of charges in a single prosecution which has no relation to any previous prosecution. Such a choice is constrained by other considerations \u2014 the rules affecting joinder (see now Mass. R. Crim. P. 9, 378 Mass. 859 [1979]) and the practical availability of proof, adequate to avoid a fatal variance. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Honneus, </em>508 F.2d 566, 570 (1st Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In this case, the defendant does not argue any question relative to the indictments (see n. 2) or relative to the submission of both charges to the jury. We do not intimate that any such contentions would have availed the defendant. On the evidence, the jury could have inferred a conspiracy to threaten the DAY in view of the concerted action by Sperlinga and Winter at the DAY, and they could likewise have inferred a conspiracy to threaten Somerset in view of the concerted action at Somerset. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stasiun, </em>349 Mass. 38, 41, 50-51 (1965). See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>239 Mass. 458, 494 (1921). There was no charge of a single conspiracy embracing the separately al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>leged instances of concert reflected in the two incidents on September 21, 1977 (see n. 2). And the jury were thus properly instructed that they could not find guilt on the basis of a \u201cgeneralized conspiracy\u201d but only if they were \u201csatisfied that there were two specific conspiracies.\u201d The judge further instructed the jury: \u201cIf the government shows, for example, that defendant X in this case was conspiring ... in a general way, that\u2019s not enough to show that he conspired in the particular way with respect ... to the DAY conspiracy and the Somerset Vending conspiracy.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 604, 619 (1975), in which we approved the submission to the jury of multiple and overlapping charges of conspiracy where no over-all conspiracy was charged. See also the prior opinion in the same case by the Supreme Judicial Court, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>358 Mass. 672, 675 (1971), refusing to dismiss an indictment then containing one hundred twenty-two separate counts of conspiracy, though they set forth \u201cwhat could reasonably be viewed as a single conspiracy (or perhaps only a few conspiracies).\u201d The court, while disapproving the dismissal of the indictments by the Superior Court, left it to the lower court to require such simplification as might be appropriate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co., </em>360 Mass. 188, 371-372 (1971), in which a single conspiracy was charged, and the judge properly submitted the question whether there was a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Once the trial judge received the verdicts, his task in the first instance, ordinarily routine, was to determine the parameters set in the applicable statute (G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 7), so that he could sentence within those parameters. That statute provides a maximum sentence of ten years for conspiracy to viol\u00e1te G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 25, of which conspiracy, as we construe the charges (n.2), the defendant was found guilty.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That maximum is applicable to \u201cthe crime of conspiracy\u201d; and the \u201cunit of criminal offense\u201d <em>(United States, </em>v. <em>Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., </em>344 U.S. 218, 223 [1952]) is thus the conspiracy. We see no authority in the statute to fragment a conspiracy so that double punishment results. See <em>Kuklis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>361 Mass. 302, 306-309 (1972). The statute contemplates the possibility of \u201cany means\u201d with a single purpose and a single punishment determined on the basis of the highest penalty applicable to the felonious purpose or any of the felonious means (see n.13). An interpretation permitting fragmentation which results in punishment beyond the stated maximum is not lightly to be inferred. The question of cumulative punishments when a single statute is involved has generally been resolved \u201cin favor of lenity.\u201d <em>Heflin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 415, 419 (1959). See Note, Twice in Jeopardy, 75 Yale L.J. 262, 313-316. Compare <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>329 Mass. 445, 448-449 (1952); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>336 Mass. 718, 721 (1958) \u2014 cases in which the Supreme Judicial Court opted for an interpretation yielding the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>humane result. But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guerro, </em>357 Mass. 741, 751 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The defendant argues that the record in this case shows only a single conspiracy for which multiple punishments are not authorized. We agree. Indeed, the Commonwealth concedes in its brief that the purpose of the conspiracy was \u201cto place pinball machines in locations in Somerville.\u201d It argues, however, (in its brief) that the \u201ccrime of conspiracy consists in the agreement\u201d and that here \u201ca single broad purpose [wa]s sought to be achieved by separate criminal agreements.\u201d As far back as <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>181 Mass. 184, 191 (1902), Justice Holmes characterized a similar argument as \u201can odd perversion of the principle that the offence of conspiracy is committed as soon as the combination or agreement is made.\u201d In that case the court held that it was of no consequence that the conspiracy was general at its inception but \u201cwas enlarged with each new item that entered into the plan while it still was on foot . . . .\u201d The prosecution misses the point that \u2014 while a conspiracy, like a partnership, requires an agreement \u2014 the conspiracy is no more the mere agreement than the partnership agreement is the partnership. See Developments in the Law \u2014 Criminal Conspiracy, 72 Harv. L. Rev. 920, 988-989 (1959). The conspiracy includes the continuous combination, the \u201ccooperative design,\u201d which the agreement engenders. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>243 Mass. 472, 485 (1922). <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>239 Mass, at 493. \u201c [T]he unlawful agreement satisfies the definition of the crime, but it does not exhaust it.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kissel, </em>218 U.S. 601, 607 (1910), quoted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beal, </em>314 Mass. 210, 255 (1943). The prosecution is thus not aided by its argument that the record permits an inference that an original agreement was made to put pinball machines in Somerville by threatening the operators which was supplemented by an agreement to threaten the clubs directly.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We see nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>here but a change in tactics and means to effectuate the single continuing purpose of the combination. To be sure the change in tactics may well have called for further consultations and concurrences, but they were still \u201cembrace[d] \u201d in the overriding purpose of the continuing combination. <em>Braverman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>317 U.S. 49, 53-54 (1942). <em>Blumenthal </em>v. <em>United States, </em>332 U.S. 539, 557-559 (1947). \u201cBecause one conspiracy may have many illegal objectives, it will necessarily involve a number of sub-agreements to commit each of these sp\u00e9cified objectives. ...

The record manifests that punishment was here imposed for each of two fragments \u201cwithin a larger, unified conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ruigomez, </em>576 F.2d 1149, 1151 (5th Cir. 1978).

L. c. 275, \u00a7\u00a7 2-4 (threat to commit crime). The victims\u2019 fear confirms the capacity of the threats to create apprehension and is thus probative of the defendants\u2019 intent to intimidate. <em>State </em>v. <em>Schweppe, </em>306 Minn. 395, 401 (1975). It is a significant circumstance coloring the encounters as a whole. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De Vincent, </em>358 Mass. 592, 595 (1971). The holding in that case that \u201cthe state of mind of the person threatened is not controlling\u201d does not imply that such state of mind does not have probative value. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Compagna, </em>146 F.2d 524, 528-529 (2d Cir. 1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">(b) We cannot say that the trial judge exercised his discretion improperly in admitting in evidence Sylvester\u2019s testimony of what Agostinelli, \u201cshaking like a leaf,\u201d said as he entered Sylvester\u2019s office about thirty seconds after Winter and Sperlinga left. The cases applicable to the admissibility of excited utterances are cited and the principle is stated in <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Springfield St. Ry. Co., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 553, 556-557 (1978). We there said: \u201cPresently a statement is admissible if its utterance was spontaneous to a degree which reasonably negated premeditation or possible fabrication and if it tended to qualify, characterize and explain the underlying event. The statement need not have been strictly contemporaneous with the event. . . . The trial judge is given broad discretion in determining whether such a statement is admissible.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 229-230 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">(c) The judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motions to strike DelVendo\u2019s conversations with Sperlinga, the first on the evening of September 21, 1977, the day Griffin had been threatened, and the second two days later in the afternoon of September 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>On the evening of September 21 DelVendo sought out Sperlinga, with whom he was acquainted and who knew DelVendo to be a Treasury agent. He told Sperlinga that two men \u201centered the DAV, utilizing strong-arm tactics, demanding that the machines inside the club be removed and be replaced with their own.\u201d He suggested that Sper-linga look into the matter. Sperlinga said he would do so and would be in touch with DelVendo. During the course of the conversation Sperlinga said, \u201cWhy do you come to me with a problem like that. . . Every time something happens it seems that somebody comes to me.\u201d The judge was warranted in submitting to the jury, as he did, the question whether this conversation occurred during the pendency of the conspiracy and in furtherance of its object. No argument is, or can be, made that by the evening of September 21 Sperlinga and Winter had abandoned the conspiracy manifested in the incident at the DAV that morning. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co., </em>360 Mass, at 354-355. The jury could have found that Sperlinga\u2019s responses to what the defendant characterizes in his brief as DelVendo\u2019s attempt to frustrate the conspiracy was a temporizing effort \u201cto protect, and hence to further, the purpose of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>373 Mass. 329, 340 (1977). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>248 Mass. 19, 26 (1924). See generally Marcus, The Prosecution and Defense of Criminal Conspiracy Cases 5-33 through 5-78 (1978). In context the significance of Sperlinga\u2019s statements and his credibility presented a jury question. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beal, </em>314 Mass, at 228-229. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co., </em>360 Mass, at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Since the admissibility against Winter of the first conversation supports the denial of the defendant\u2019s motions to strike, we need not consider the second conversation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>defendant\u2019s motions to strike were acted on and exceptions were taken after both conversations were in evidence. The motions made no attempt to distinguish between them but addressed, without particularization, DelVendo\u2019s entire testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">(d) The conversation in mid September between Foster and Robinson, as a result of Foster\u2019s telephone call to Robim son, was properly submitted to the jury as evidence of the ongoing effort of the conspirators to install their pinball machines in Somerville clubs, using Robinson as an intermediary. The defendant obviously cannot and does not attack the admissibility of the conversation generally.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Rather, he points to an isolated portion of the conversation regarding Foster\u2019s plight in view of Winter\u2019s insistence on putting pinball machines in the clubs and characterizes it in his brief as \u201ccasual conversation\u201d not in furtherance of the conspiracy. In the circumstances of this case, the judge was warranted in submitting the entire conversation to the jury so that they might appraise it as a whole. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>348 Mass. 29, 59 (1964), cert, denied, 380 U.S. 913 (1965). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co., </em>360 Mass, at 308. In any event, the jury could have found that this statement underscored for Robinson, who was being asked to act as intermediary, Winter\u2019s persistence in accomplishing the purpose of the conspiracy despite the qualms of a coconspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">3. <em>Claim of prosecutorial misconduct, </em>(a) A new trial is not required by the judge\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial during Robinson\u2019s re-direct examination by the prosecutor. The mistrial was sought after the judge had sustained the defendant\u2019s objection when Robinson replied in the affirmative to the prosecutor\u2019s question whether he (Robinson) was receiving protection. The defendant did not move to strike the answer, nor did he accept the judge\u2019s offer at the ensuing bench conference to instruct the jury further. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>one of the defense counsel suggested that the question and answer be permitted to stand because \u201cI would like to examine him about connections with so-called \u2018organized crime.\u2019 Who he needs protection from.\u201d The judge replied, \u201c[T]wo wrongs don\u2019t make a right.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>374 Mass. 293, 299 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>377 Mass. 772, 778 (1979). The judge might have given specific cautionary instructions sua sponte in spite of the defendant\u2019s apparent position, which we find on this record untenable, that the effect of the question and answer was ineluctable. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>376 Mass. 156, 165 (1978). Perhaps, however, the failure of the judge to take any further action was based on his appraisal that this question and answer did not loom sufficiently large so as to create a danger that they might affect the jury\u2019s deliberations. On the entire transcript, which we have examined, we believe that there was no such risk. In this connection we note that there was no request to strike, or objection to, Griffin\u2019s testimony \u2014 elicited on cross-examination by the defendant\u2019s counsel \u2014 that Griffin was receiving protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">(b) The judge was within his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial made at a bench conference precipitated by the prosecutor\u2019s question, \u201cDid you threaten Mel-O-Tone\u201d; an objection to the question was sustained so that it was never answered. The prosecutor asked the question in the course of exploring Winter\u2019s contacts with Mel-O-Tone, a vending machine company; Winter had denied any knowledge of the vending machine business. We need not consider the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the question was admissible in the context of this case; it was obviously within the judge\u2019s discretion to exclude it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. 402, 414 (1978). But, we give weight to the judge\u2019s choice to strike the question rather than declare a mistrial <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>371 Mass. 87, 91 [1976]), particularly in view of his careful instructions in his charge \u2014 amplified by instructions given before the opening \u2014 that where, as in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>an objection to a question was sustained and the answer did not come in, the jury \u201care to disregard that particular tiny segment of the trial. It has no place in your consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">(c) The defendant in his brief complains of various instances of misconduct by the prosecutor, particularly his persistence in and return to lines of inquiry from which the judge had excluded him. However, this resulted for the most part in unanswered questions to which objections were sustained. We do not condone such conduct, but the judge did not indicate that more was necessary to vindicate his authority (see <em>Sussman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass. 692, 695-699 [1978]), and the defendant was apparently satisfied that no more was needed. He did not press further for a mistrial or raise these matters in his motion for a new trial or otherwise until his brief in this court. In these circumstances, we do not deal with these matters further.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">(d) The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, read as a whole, does not call for a new trial. It seems to us properly to emphasize the evidence of the threats that the defendant made and the fear they engendered. The prosecutor characterized the case as \u201cabout fear\u201d and as \u201cabout threats.\u201d From the evidence that neither Griffin nor Agostinelli knew Winter personally, and from their reaction to his name and presence, it was legitimate argument to ask the jury to infer that his name lent potency to the threats. From the incidents at the DAY and Somerset, as described by Griffin and Agostinelli, the jury were also justifiably asked to infer that Winter was not, as his direct testimony sought to show, an ordinary businessman and that this was not, as defense counsel argued, an attempt by Robinson and the other Commonwealth witnesses to frustrate a legitimate business undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The defendant invokes the \u201cpolicy considerations underlying the exclusion of reputation\u201d in a criminal case. The danger that a jury will reason from a propensity to commit crime to guilt of a particular charge has led to the exclusion of direct evidence, including reputation evidence, of the defendant\u2019s character. Note, ... A Reevaluation of . . . the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Rule Excluding Evidence of Propensity to Commit Crime, 78 Harv. L. Rev. 426, 435-436 (1964). But here the jury were asked to infer guilt directly from fear and threats \u2014 not from reputation and a propensity for crime.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The defendant finds a number of faults in various parts of the closing. We have examined them all and find that they do not vitiate the argument as a whole. We think it unnecessary to discuss them in detail. On the basis of our own examination of the transcript we agree with the trial judge\u2019s finding on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial: \u201cIn my opinion almost every point urged upon the jurors by the Commonwealth in its closing argument was either drawn directly from the evidence, or supported by it or reasonably inferred from it. With respect to those few instances where the Commonwealth engaged in what I would refer to as hyperbole . . ., it is my view that, in the overall context of the trial, including my general and curative instructions, the Commonwealth\u2019s remarks were not so prejudicial as to justify the granting of a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">4. <em>Conclusion, </em>(a) In Commonwealth vs. Winter, No. 79-450, the judgment on indictment no. 77-4561 is affirmed; the sentence in 77-4563 is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">(b) In Commonwealth vs. Sperlinga, No. 79-451, the judgments on both indictments (nos. 77-4566 &amp; 77-4567) are vacated; the case is remanded to the Superior Court where the indictments shall be dismissed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>380 Mass. 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>(c) In Commonwealth vs. Winter, No. 79-871, the order denying the defendant\u2019s petition to stay execution (see note 1) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-5\"> These two indictments, as supplemented by the particulars, were treated by all parties and the court as though they charged directly separate conspiracies, one to threaten Griffin and the DAV with intent to extort or compel an act against the victim\u2019s will and the other to threaten Agostinelli and Somerset. We therefore likewise treat these indictments as charging such separate conspiracies \u2022\u2014 albeit in a clumsy and roundabout way. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co., </em>360 Mass. 188, 226 (1971).

The court said, \u201cOur holding that the dismissal of the indictments was not proper should not be regarded as approval of the practice of obtaining multiple, repetitious, and overlapping indictments (or counts in indictments) where fewer indictments or counts not only would suffice, but probably would much more clearly present the charges. Multiple indictments, such as those in the present cases, impose an unnecessary burden on courts, juries, and parties. They cause unnecessary expense and confusion, and may lead to unduly long trials. We regard the practice as objectionable. Where new indictments, more simply framed, may still be obtained within the period of the applicable statute of limitations, we think the trial judge may and should require a district attorney to attempt to obtain them.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>358 Mass, at 677-678.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">As we have intimated above (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Honneus, </em>508 F.2d 566, 570 [1st Cir. 1974]), there may be circumstances in which the practicalities call for charging a number of subsidiary conspiracies, rather than an over-all conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b544-6\"> General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 25, provides a maximum penalty of fifteen years.

We need not decide whether there may be circumstances in which such evidence is admissible, as the Commonwealth argues, citing cases under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (1976), and under the Extortionate Credit Transactions Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 892 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">We cannot agree that a mistrial was required when the prosecutor asked, \u201cDo you know him [Winter] by reputation in the city\u201d and was answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The court\u2019s corrective instruction was adequate; and, as can be seen from our discussion, it cannot be said that the question was asked in bad faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
