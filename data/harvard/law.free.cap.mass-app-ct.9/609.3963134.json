L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G) from convictions on indictments charging statutory rape (nineteen counts), deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute, and extortion. He was also found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and assault and battery; these two cases were placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent. The Commonwealth\u2019s case was based primarily on the testimony of the victim, who first met the defendant on June 4, 1976, when she was fourteen years old. They met at the Cambridge home of the defendant\u2019s aunt, near whom the victim lived and for whom she did various chores. Subsequently, on June 19 in Cambridge, the defendant and the victim happened to meet; she accepted his invitation to go with him to a movie. However, he took her to the \u201cCombat Zone\u201d and thereafter to an apartment on Newbury Street. There he told her \u201cto sit on the bed . . . and he pulled me back on the bed and took my pants off.\u201d She then \u201chad sexual relations\u201d with the defendant. They spent the night in that apartment, and the next day she was taken to another apartment in \u201csome project\u201d in Boston. Subsequently, that day the defendant brought the victim to the Newbury Street area, where he spoke to a woman named Gloria and left. Gloria then told the victim \u201chow to get the men and everything\u201d and \u201chow much to charge them.\u201d Gloria also told the victim that she \u201cwas supposed to give [the money] to Brown.\u201d That evening she engaged in prostitution. On June 21, the defendant took her to an establishment \u201caround Kneeland Street\u201d and spoke with the bartender. The defendant then said to her that \u201cit was all set\u201d and left. The bartender then told her that he \u201cwas to set me up with his tricks.\u201d From there she went to various men\u2019s apartments and \u201chad sexual relations with them.\u201d She gave the money she received to the defendant. She testified that from June 19 until July 20, when she went home, with the exception of her menstrual period, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>was engaged in prostitution and slept with the defendant with whom she had \u201csexual relations\u201d (or, as put to her on cross-examination, with whom she was \u201chaving sex\u201d). We need not describe further the events during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s contentions and affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">1. The judge properly admitted the victim\u2019s testimony as to the instructions given her by the bartender and Gloria, thus implicitly finding that each of them was acting in concert with the defendant \u2014 at least in connection with the charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. On her testimony, the judge was amply justified in so finding. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tivnon, </em>8 Gray 375, 381 (1857). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>345 Mass. 251, 255 (1962). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>362 Mass. 455, 477 (1972). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>French, </em>357 Mass. 356, 391 (1970), vacated as to death penalty sub nom. <em>Limone </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>408 U.S. 936 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>363 Mass. 601, 609 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">2. We do not believe that trial counsel was inadequate (as defendant\u2019s new counsel contends in his motion for a new trial) in failing to file a motion for a directed verdict because the victim used the phrase \u201csexual relations\u201d rather than something more detailed. Without repeating the circumstances which we have set out above, we believe that the jury could, as they did, find beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim and the defendant engaged in natural sexual intercourse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coderre, </em>360 Mass. 869 (1971). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hollis, </em>170 Mass. 433, 435, 436 (1898); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>500 S.W.2d 76, 76-77 (Ky. 1973). Contrast <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Croteau, </em>158 Me. 360, 364-366 (1962) (\u201c\u2018Sexual relations\u2019 ought not to be treated as synonymous with sexual intercourse\u201d; we do not intimate that in the circumstances of that case we would reach the same result). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, post </em>812 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>3. Defense counsel\u2019s closing did not indicate incompetency. He sought to undermine the victim\u2019s credibility by emphasizing her opportunities to leave the defendant, apparently hoping that this might reflect sufficiently on her testimony generally so as to impel the jury to find the defendant not guilty of statutory rape as well as the other charges. The strategy to minimize the statutory rape charge cannot be faulted. From our examination of the transcript it appears that defense counsel had few cards to play and did as well as could be expected in the circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunker, </em>363 Mass. 792, 795-798 (1973); <em>Dunker v. Vinzant, </em>505 F.2d 503, 503-505 (1st Cir. 1974), cert, denied, 421 U.S. 1003 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 888 (1979). Contrast <em>Matthews v. United States, </em>449 F.2d 985, 992 (D.C. Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">4. It does not aid the defendant to characterize as inadequacy of counsel the failure of trial counsel to object and except to the extortion charge. (The defendant does not tell us just which part he finds objectionable and why.) Our review in a case where no exception has been taken and the matter is raised for the first time on a motion for a new trial, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>358 Mass. 506, 508-512 (1970), is \u2014 where the issue is tendered \u2014 to ascertain if there exists \u201ca substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 561-564 (1967). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 232 n.18 (1980). Although the case has not been argued in these terms, we have examined the testimony and the entire charge and find no such risk. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>380 Mass. 314, 321 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">5. There is no factual basis in the record before us for the defendant\u2019s claim in his motions for a new trial and to dismiss that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23 (statutory rape), and G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7 (deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute), are enforced against males and not against females. The judge who presided at the motion for a new trial suggested near the close of the hearing that he would be prepared to \u201cmake factual determinations either by stipula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>tion or by listening to evidence.\u201d The defendant, however, made no attempt to present facts which \u201craised a reasonable inference of selective prosecution,\u201d thus placing the burden on the Commonwealth to rebut that inference. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>376 Mass. 885, 894-895 (1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 22 (1977). The observations of the motion judge about the statutory rape statute is no substitute for the factual presentation he suggested. The factual predicate for the defendant\u2019s claim is not a matter of judicial notice. <em>Nantucket </em>v. <em>Beinecke, </em>379 Mass. 345, 352 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\"> That was the theory on which the case was submitted to the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peets, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 916 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
