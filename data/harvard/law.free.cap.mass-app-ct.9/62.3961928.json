G. L. c. 231A.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">On February 19, 1977, the plaintiff was injured in the performance of his duty as a police officer. On the following day he applied to the Metropolitan District Police Line of Duty Board (L.O.D. Board) to be placed on line-of-duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>status under G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 63B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This status would give the plaintiff leave with pay for the duration of his temporary incapacity; that leave would not be charged against his accumulated sick leave. The L.O.D. Board granted him line-of-duty status on March 1, 1977, and from time to time voted to extend it. On December 13, 1977, the L.O.D. Board informed the plaintiff that it had found his disability to be permanent and advised him to apply to the State Board of Retirement (S.B.R.) for accidental disability retirement under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7. At the same time the L.O.D. Board extended the plaintiff\u2019s line-of-duty status to March 13, 1978, so that his regular pay would continue through at least part of the time that the S.B.R. would take to process his application. The plaintiff\u2019s accumulated sick leave maintained his usual salary until April 8, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The plaintiff initiated this action on April 12, 1978, seeking a declaration that the L.O.D. Board was required to continue line-of-duty payments until the S.B.R. should act on his request for retirement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A judge of the Superior Court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The judgment declared that the plaintiff was entitled to line-of-duty payments from the date they were terminated until the date the S.B.R. acted upon his \u201cpetition for retirement\u201d and that his account should be credited with the sick leave that he had used after March 13, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>This case calls for an interpretation of the scope of G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 63B, inserted by St. 1948, c. 653. We note at the outset that the legislative history of \u00a7 63B affords us no assistance<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that there are no decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court or of this court concerning this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The plaintiff would have us hold that the Metropolitan District Commission (commission), acting through the L.O.D. Board, was not authorized to terminate his line-of-duty status by finding that his incapacity was permanent after it had initially found that it was temporary. The defendants contend that the plain words of the statute authorized the commission to find that the plaintiff\u2019s incapacity was no longer temporary and, consequently, that his line-of-duty status should be terminated. We agree with the defendants\u2019 analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Section 63B is silent as to who should evaluate the temporary incapacity for service of an officer injured in the line of duty. It does, however, expressly limit the commission\u2019s authority to make payments to an officer to that period during which he is temporarily incapacitated from injuries suffered in the line of duty. We are of the opinion that the commission as the employing agency necessarily has the authority under \u00a7 63B to determine whether an officer is so incapacitated. The plaintiff does not question the commission\u2019s power in that respect but contends that the power to determine permanent incapacity resides only in the S.B.R. Section 63B is silent as to any authority to make a determination of permanent incapacity. We conclude, however, that a necessary corollary of the power to make an initial finding of temporary incapacity is that the commission is also empowered to reevaluate a given case and determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>whether an officer\u2019s temporary incapacity continues. Should it find that an officer\u2019s incapacity is permanent, it could not properly continue to make payments under \u00a7 63B.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We note that G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, as amended through St. 1977, c. 646, \u00a7 2, provides a system of compensation for city or town police officers and firefighters such as that which the plaintiff urges us to read into \u00a7 63B. That is, once an officer is found to be temporarily disabled, he is granted leave with pay, which continues until he is certified fit or until he is \u201cretired or pensioned in accordance with law.\u201d This procedure closes any hiatus between payments under leave with pay and payments under a retirement system. No such procedure is included in the plan enacted in \u00a7 63B. Had the Legislature intended to include such a procedure in \u00a7 63B, it could easily have done so, as it did when it later enacted \u00a7 11 IF.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s basic argument is that we should construe \u00a7 63B and G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, as parts of a common scheme so that the payments under \u00a7 63B must continue until the S.B.R. determines an officer\u2019s incapacity to be permanent and retires him. Although \u00a7 7 does restrict the grant of accidental disability retirement to cases where the disabling injury was sustained in the performance of duty, as does \u00a7 63B, the plaintiff\u2019s contention flies in the face of the retro-activity provisions in \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Also there is no cross reference between these sections or the chapters in which they ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>pear. Desirable as it might be to amend \u00a7 63B so that it would operate in the same manner as \u00a7 111F or to join \u00a7 63B with \u00a7 7 so that \u00a7 7 would control on questions of permanent disability, it is for the Legislature to do so and not for us. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Brookline Housing Authy., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 705, 708 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a new judgment is to enter declaring that the commission had the power to find the plaintiff\u2019s disability to be permanent and to discontinue payments under \u00a7 63B.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b83-6\"> The relevant part of \u00a7 63B, inserted by St. 1948, c. 653, reads: \u201cThe commission shall, subject to appropriation, indemnify a metropolitan district police officer ... for expenses or damages sustained by him while acting as a police officer . . .; and such damages shall include loss of pay by reason of absence from duty on the part of such officer because of temporary incapacity caused by injury suffered through no fault of his own while in the actual performance of duty . . . .\u201d The commission\u2019s responsibilities under this section have been delegated to a \u201c Line of Duty Board \u201d created in 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\"> The S.B.R. granted the plaintiff an accidental disability pension on September 28, 1978. Retirement payments were made retroactive to April 8,1978, pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(2), thus meshing its determination under c. 32, \u00a7 7, with the L.O.D. Board\u2019s determination under \u00a7 63B. The plaintiff is entitled to no more.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b84-7\"> The relevant legislative history consists of notations in the journals of the Senate and House of Representatives charting the progress of 1948 House Docs. No. 421, 2249 and 2332, through the process of enactment, in the course of which the only amendment of the part of \u00a7 63R quoted in note 2 was the addition of the words \u201csubject to appropriation.\u201d See 1948 House Journal at 103, 659, 704-705, 1325, 1447, 1501-1502, 1564, 1658, 1737,1764,1773,1827 and 1845; 1948 Senate Journal at 117,1136,1177, 1193, 1250, 1269-1270, 1311 and 1321.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\"> A bill was filed in the House in 1973 (Doc.

It was reported to the Senate Ways and Means Committee, which reported it out as part of a study order (Doc. No. 1784). That order failed to pass, and the entire package of bills died on prorogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\"> The provisions of G.
