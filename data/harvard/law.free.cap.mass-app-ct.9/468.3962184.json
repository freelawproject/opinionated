The defendant was charged as the intruder and was indicted, tried, and convicted of assault with intent to rape (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 24, as amended by St. 1974, c, 474, \u00a7 4) and breaking and entering a dwelling in the nighttime (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 14). He has appealed and presents two issues: (1) that it was error to deny his motion for directed verdicts, and (2) that it was error to admit evidence of certain fresh complaints. At trial the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>defendant did not question that the victim had been attacked by someone intent on rape. Rather, the defendant\u2019s position at trial and on appeal has been that she was mistaken in identifying him as her attacker. We summarize the facts that could have been found on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The victim was awakened at about 1:30 a.m. on April 17, 1978, by the sound of someone breaking in her front door. She arose from her bed and started toward the kitchen. The apartment was illuminated by a light which she had kept burning through the night. Before she reached the kitchen she was grabbed by an intruder, who demanded that she have sex with him. He threw her to the floor and throttled her. Her attacker left without having violated her sexually. The episode lasted less than ten minutes. After the intruder had left, she telephoned her son Fred; he arrived shortly and called the police. She was removed to a hospital in an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">About 10:30 that evening four Lowell police officers went to the home of the defendant\u2019s parents and asked for him. The woman who had admitted them pointed to a closet and told the officers, \u201cHe is hiding in there.\u201d The officers asked the defendant several times to come out; when he did, they arrested him and informed him of his rights. Before leaving with the police, the defendant asked the people in the apartment to \u201cfind out from Fred what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Fred and Yvonne Hilliard, the victim\u2019s son and daughter-in-law, managed the building in which the victim\u2019s apartment was located. On April 15, 1978, in the course of her duties as building manager, Yvonne had shown several vacant apartments to the defendant and two female companions. One of the apartments shown was located above the victim\u2019s. The intruder entered the building on the night of the incident by the back door to that upstairs apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The victim was the only identifying witness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She had known the defendant, who was related to her daughter-in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>law, for many years. Portions of the victim\u2019s testimony concerning the identity of her attacker are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>To withstand a motion for a directed verdict, the evidence, taken most favorably to the Commonwealth, must be sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find each essential element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). If the evidence is sufficient to avoid a directed verdict, the jury decide the weight to be given it. <em>Commonwealth v. Medeiros, </em>354 Mass. 193, 197 (1968), cert, denied sub riom. <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>393 U.S. 1058 (1969). The victim\u2019s identification testimony was varied. Asked if she knew who her assailant was, her responses ranged from the negative to twice asserting that she did, naming him as \u201cPaul.\u201d On one of those two occasions she appears to have pointed to the defendant. On both occasions she added, \u201cIt looked like Paul,\u201d or, \u201cIt looked like him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The defendant argues that the total effect of the victim\u2019s testimony is only that her attacker \u201clooked like\u201d or resembled the defendant. He concedes that questions of identity are ordinarily for the jury but contends that for a case to be submitted to a jury the witness must testify to more than a mere resemblance. <em>United States v. Luck, </em>447 F.2d 1333, 1337 (6th Cir. 1971) (identification evidence held insufficient where four eye-witnesses testified that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>resembled one of the robbers). He argues that where the sole identifying witness is unsure and his testimony is not corroborated, the court must direct the verdict. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>427 F.2d 957, 961 (5th Cir. 1970) (After viewing defendant in a lineup and his picture in a photographic array, the witness could only say, \u201cHe looks more like the man who robbed me than any of the others.\u201d Held insufficient without corroborating evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Although we accept the principles underlying the decisions in these and in other cases cited by the defendant, they are not helpful to him, as their facts differ materially from those in the case before us. Here the witness twice identified the defendant as her attacker, though in each instance the positive identification was followed with a statement that \u201cit looked like\u201d the defendant. That this evidence may have been \u201cinconsistent and contradictory does not render [it] insufficient; all [the] statements are entitled to be considered as probative evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. 402, 410-411 (1978). Accord, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>436 F.2d 1166, 1168 (9th Cir. 1970), cert, denied, 402 U.S. 912 (1971). The jury heard the testimony, observed the victim and could hear her and note the inflections of her voice. Their members were thus in a much better position than we are to determine what part of the victim\u2019s testimony was believable. It was for the jury to determine the credibility of her testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra </em>at 411. They could have found that the victim\u2019s reservations were \u201ccompatible with a candid and conscientious approach\u201d toward her duty as a witness. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>436 F. 2d at 1168. They were entitled to consider that some witnesses \u201cverbalize their assurances of being correct with more positiveness than others,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>563 F.2d 1361, 1363 (9th Cir. 1977), cert, denied, 434 U.S. 1021 (1978), and to have in mind that the victim was eighty-two years old, nervous, and uncomfortable in her role.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We also note in passing that when a victim of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>crime identifies a photograph as being that of an attacker, the witness is saying no more than that the visage portrayed \u201clooks like\u201d the criminal\u2019s, yet such identifications may be admitted at trial as substantive proof of identity. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. 426, 458 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Evidence was also admitted at trial that the defendant hid when the police came to arrest him and that he had asked those present at his arrest to \u201cfind out from Fred what\u2019s going on.\u201d The jury could have found the first circumstance to indicate a consciousness of guilt. As there was no evidence before the jury that the police told the defendant that he was being arrested for assaulting the victim, the jury could have found that his reference to the victim\u2019s son, Fred, indicated that the defendant was involved in the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The victim\u2019s statements at the hospital on the evening of the seventeenth as related by her son (\u201cWell, she said, it looked like Paul. I\u2019m almost sure it was Paul\u201d); by her granddaughter (\u201cShe said that it did look like Paul Bishop,\u201d and that it was \u201cPaul Bishop\u201d); and by a police officer (\u201cShe said it was Paul Bishop, who she has known since he was a little boy\u201d) were admitted as fresh complaints over the defendant\u2019s general objection and exception. Before the testimony was given, the judge properly instructed the jury on the purpose of such evidence and the restrictions on its use. The fresh complaints presented nothing that had not already come in through the victim\u2019s testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 391-397 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lund, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 884, 885 (1977). Moreover, the judge\u2019s jury charge contained clear instructions on fresh complaint which were, if anything, more favorable to the defendant than those to which he was entitled.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have no doubt that the jury understood and followed them. There was no error. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>After the police officer testified to the victim\u2019s complaint, he was asked if he saw Paul Bishop in the courtoom. He said that he did and pointed to him. The defendant\u2019s attorney did not object; the question called for nothing more than for the officer to identify the defendant as Paul Bishop.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-9\"> The victim made a statement positively identifying the defendant as her assailant to a police officer in the presence of Cynthia Morin, both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>whom testified at trial to that identification. That evidence was not offered as an extrajudicial identification, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. 426, 458-459 (1978), but only as evidence of a \u201cfresh complaint.\u201d The judge gave appropriate limiting instructions as .to the effect of such evidence. This evidence therefore was not before the jury for its truth as to the question of identity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\"> On direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">\u201cQ: Now, this individual that came into your room, could you describe him, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">Mrs. Hilliard, do you know the individual who came into your room that night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">A: He was tall, with black hair and mustache.

It can\u2019t be bootstrapped by the corroboration if it is missing in the first place in Mrs. Hilliard\u2019s testimony. So you are going to have to analyze Mrs. Hilliard\u2019s testimony, and if that establishes in your mind beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime charged, including identity, then and then only may you consider the corroborating evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
