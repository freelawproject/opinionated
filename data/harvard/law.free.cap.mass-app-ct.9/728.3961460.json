Gino appeals from this judgment in so far as it: (a) awarded custody of the couple\u2019s four minor children (ages five to eleven) to Marie; (b) ordered Gino to pay Marie, as alimony and for maintenance of the children, the sum of $200 per week; and (c) ordered him to convey to Marie all his right, title, and interest in the marital home in Framingham. We have before us, for purposes of determining these issues, a transcript of the evidence and the judge\u2019s detailed findings of fact as to the \u201cwelfare of the children\u201d <em>(Masters </em>v. <em>Craddock, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 426, 428 [1976]) and as to her consideration of each of the mandatory factors enumerated in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 400, \u00a7 33. <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>371 Mass. 420, 423 (1976). <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>372 Mass. 398, 401 (1977). <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 672, 674 (1979). We turn directly to the challenged orders, examining them under the familiar rule that we will not reverse the orders of a probate judge in the areas of custody and support unless the judge\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 52(a) (1975). <em>King </em>v. <em>King, </em>373 Mass. 37, 40 (1977). <em>Prindle </em>v. <em>Fisk, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 843, 844 (1974). <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 736, 737 (1975). <em>Daigle </em>v. <em>Daigle, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 847 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">1. <em>Custody. </em>Gino argues that the judge erred in awarding custody of the children to Marie, who had been voluntarily hospitalized for short periods for emotional problems and whose therapist testified during the hearing that she had a \u201cpredisposition\u201d to depression. He does not claim (nor could he on this record) that Marie\u2019s problems, or the fact that she has sought help for them, render her unfit as a parent. <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 647, 649 (1973) (father\u2019s neurosis, for which psychiatrist is treating him, \u201cdoes not impair his ability to function properly as a responsible parent\u201d). He argues instead that a probate judge must award custody to the superior of two fit parents, and that he is the superior custodian by virtue of Marie\u2019s latent condition and his greater emotional stability. While it is true that in determining the question of custody \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>rights of the parents shall ... be held to be equal\u201d (G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31), the statutory focus remains that \u201cthe happiness and welfare of the children shall determine their custody and possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Obviously, the comparative emotional health of the parents is only one of several factors which can affect the well being of their children. See generally Annot., Mental Health of Contesting Parent as Factor in Award of Child Custody, 74 A.L.R.2d 1073 (1960). That is especially the case where, as here, the findings indicate that all professionals regard the mother as a fit and suitable parent, she has been the children\u2019s primary caretaker for most of their lives, and they live with her in a settled environment. See <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>337 Mass. 625, 627-628 (1958); <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 372, 377 (1974); <em>Prindle </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. at 844. In addition to her own observations of the parents during their testimony (see <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 736, 737 [1975]), the judge had the benefit of the reports and testimony of a psychologist who was appointed to investigate the custody and visitation arrangements for the children. The psychologist talked with the parties, their counsel, the children, and the current therapists of both the husband and the wife. Both therapists also testified on behalf of their respective clients. There is ample evidence in the record to support the judge\u2019s comprehensive subsidiary findings, and we see no purpose in attempting to summarize them. <em>Masters </em>v. <em>Craddock, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. at 428. In our opinion, on the evidence before her, the judge could permissibly conclude: (a) that Marie is dealing successfully with her emotional problems; (b) that of the two parents \u201cshe despite her problems can offer the children more room for growth\u201d; (c) that Ci\u00f1o has an \u201cobsession with keeping control over the life of his wife and children\u201d which causes much of her stress; and (d) the the welfare of the children will best be served by granting custody to their mother, with liberal and specific rights of visitation for the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">2. <em>Support. </em>Gino contends that the $200 per week support payments ordered by the judge for his wife and chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>dren were clearly excessive because the award constitutes approximately thirty-seven percent of his gross weekly income and because Marie is also employed part-time and earning $141.70 per week gross income. Before making this order, the judge carefully considered the needs of the children, including the desirability that their mother only work part-time. She also considered the disparity between the couple\u2019s education and future earning capabilities, and all of their assets and liabilities. We cannot say that the judge abused her discretion in concluding that Gino, who lived with his mother and thus had modest personal needs, could and should provide the amounts ordered toward the needs of his family. See Ginsburg, Predictability and Consistency in Alimony and Support Orders, 22 B.B.J. (No. 9) 23, 25 (1978). To the extent that the judge pondered income tax consequences, the order also reveals an allocation of tax burdens in a manner as favorable to the husband as to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">3. <em>Conveyance of the marital home. </em>Gino argues that the judge did not consider the significant tax impact inherent in ordering him to convey to Marie his interest in their house in Framingham, which the parties purchased as tenants by the entirety for $18,500 in 1967 and which they stipulated had a fair market value of $40,000 in 1979. The gravamen of the husband\u2019s complaint is that, because of the appreciation in the property\u2019s value and the fact that such a forced transfer is a taxable event (see generally Freedman, ABC\u2019s of the Tax Aspects of Divorce, 22 B.B.J. [No. 9] 9, 14-15 [1978]), he will be subject to a substantial taxation. As previously discussed, the judge considered each of the mandatory factors set forth in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. She analyzed the parties\u2019 respective financial resources, including major retirement benefits to which Gino will become entitled at age fifty-seven. Her order encompasses \u201call substantial assets jointly owned and any separate property representing accretion during the marriage, [and is clearly] based on a comprehensive analysis of all major elements of contribution by the spouses during the marriage.\u201d <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. at 673, quoting <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Put</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number><em>nam, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 17 (1977). Accord, <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>371 Mass, at 423; <em>King </em>v. <em>King, 373 </em>Mass, at 40. Moreover, the judge\u2019s order specifically allocated to Gino the majority of the liquid assets of the parties, including proceeds in the amount of $1,540 from a term certificate and the shares from a stock fund valued at $6,750 on the date of the hearing, minus a $600 deduction towards Marie\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. This amount should provide him with sufficient funds to pay whatever capital gains taxes are assessed as a result of the order. Because there was no attempt to introduce evidence concerning \u201ctax consequences to the husband of the judge\u2019s property assignment. . . the judge\u2019s order cannot be plainly wrong, as alleged, for failure to consider such tax consequences.\u201d <em>Rice v. Rice, 372 </em>Mass, at 402 n.4. The equitable property division ordered by the judge was within her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Finally, we note that our consideration of this appeal has been aided considerably by the judge\u2019s comprehensive and thorough analysis of the issues. Her memorandum of decision reflects both conscientious scholarship and a balanced sensitivity to the delicate rights involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
