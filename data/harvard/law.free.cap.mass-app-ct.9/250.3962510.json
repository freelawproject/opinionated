The owner answered, counterclaimed and asserted a cross claim against the architect. One of the five counts of the substitute complaint names Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency (MHFA) as a party defendant and seeks to reach and apply to the satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claims against the owner monies which the plaintiff alleges are due the owner from MHFA under the provisions of a mortgage loan agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>between those parties. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3(6), as appearing in St. 1972, c. 1114, \u00a7 62. MHFA moved to dismiss the action as to it, and its motion was allowed after hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The plaintiff thereupon filed a motion that the court \u201c[f]ind that there is no just reason for delay\u201d and that it \u201c[cjertify that its order allowing the . . . motion to dismiss was and is a final judgment under Mass.R.Civ.P. Rule 54(b) [365 Mass. 821 (1974)] as to the rights of plaintiff and\u201d MHFA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This motion was allowed by the judge who had allowed the motion to dismiss. He thereafter approved a form of judgment which purports to dismiss the action as to MHFA and contains a statement that it is a \u201cfinal judgment pursuant to Mass.R. Civ.P. 54(b).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff has appealed from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>We are met at the outset by MHFA\u2019s contention that we should dismiss the appeal because the judge abused the discretion committed to him under the provisions of Mass.R. Civ.P. 54(b). That rule was taken verbatim from Fed.R. Civ.P. 54(b). It is clear under the latter rule that an abuse of discretion by a lower court in acting under rule 54(b) is reviewable by an appellate court. <em>Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Mackey, </em>351 U.S. 427, 436, 437 (1956).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we entertain MHFA\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">There is nothing in the record in this case to suggest that any hardship or injustice will result if the plaintiff is required to try its case against the owner and the architect before securing appellate review of the order allowing MFHA\u2019s motion to dismiss. See <em>Gass </em>v. <em>National Container Corp., </em>271 F.2d 231, 233 (7th Cir. 1959); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Westmoreland Farm, Inc., </em>403 F.2d 939, 941 (2d Cir. 1968). Contrast <em>Gas-A-Car, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Petrofina, Inc., </em>484 F.2d 1102 (10th Cir. 1973). Our resolving the questions sought to be raised by the appeal will not simplify, shorten or expedite the trial of any of the other claims still pending in the Superior Court. See <em>Panichella </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R.R., </em>252 F.2d 452, 455 (3d Cir. 1958); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Westmoreland Farm, Inc., </em>403 F.2d 939, 942 (2d Cir. 1968); <em>Gumer </em>v. <em>Shearson, Hammill &amp; Co., </em>516 F.2d 283, 286 (2d Cir. 1974); <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. </em>v. <em>Philadel</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>phia Elec. Co., </em>521 F.2d 360, 364, 365, 367 (3d Cir. 1975); <em>United Bank of Pueblo </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. </em>&amp; <em>Indem. Co., </em>529 F.2d 490, 492 (10th Cir. 1976). As neither the owner nor the architect is a party to the appeal, neither would be bound by our resolution of those questions. See <em>Panichella, supra, </em>at 455. And, of course, those questions would all become moot if the jury should return verdicts for the owner. See <em>Panichella, supra </em>at 455; <em>Campbell, supra </em>at 943; <em>Allis-Chalmers, supra </em>at 364; 10 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2659 (1973); Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 54.6 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The judge did not follow the desirable practice of stating the reasons for his certification that there is no just reason for delay. See <em>Gumer, supra </em>at 286; <em>Allis-Chalmers, supra </em>at 364. We conclude that the certification was improvident <em>(Gumer, supra </em>at 285) and made for no better reason than the accommodation of counsel. See <em>Panichella, supra </em>at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The appeal is dismissed; the judgment entered on March 14, 1979, is vacated, and the order allowing MHFA\u2019s motion to dismiss is to be restored to its interlocutory status under the second sentence of Mass.R. Civ.P. 54(b). <em>Panichella, supra </em>at 445-456. <em>Gass </em>v. <em>National Container Corp., </em>271 F.2d at 233-234.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-6\"> The motion appears to have been framed under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), but was probably converted into a motion under Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), by reason of the judge\u2019s consideration of affidavits which set up facts not appearing on the face of the substitute complaint. See the fourth sentence of Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b). Nothing in this case turns on which rule was operative in the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\"> Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974), reads as follows: \u201cJudgment Upon Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties. When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\"> We assume for the purpose of decision in this case that the recited actions of the judge complied with the mechanical requirements of rule 54(b).
