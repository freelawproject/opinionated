In the instant case the statement of facts is approved by the trial judge, though signed only by the attorney for the appellant. No attack is made on the correctness of the statement, and no effort made to show that the same was never agreed to by the attorney for the State in the lower court. Two authorities are cited in support of the State\u2019s motion, both of which we have examined. Pollock v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep., 265 was cited, and holds the contrary of the State\u2019s contention here, as .Judge Ramsey in that case allows a statement of facts to be considered which is not signed by either counsel in the lower court, and is merely marked \u201cApproved, T. A. Bledsoe, Judge.\u201d Nor is there any certificate of said judge that there was a disagreement between counsel for the parties in that case. In the other case cited in support of the motion, it appears upon examination that no statement of facts was filed within the time allowed by law. We believe the correct rule to be other than that as stated in the motion. Trimble v. State, 1 Texas Crim., App., 121; Pollock v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep., 265; Serop v. State, 69 Texas Crim. Rep., 399, 154 S. W. Rep., 557; Miles v. State, 200 S. W. Rep., 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The other ground of the State\u2019s motion is well taken and the purported .statement of facts will be stricken from the record because the same appears to be made up wholly of questions and answers. Hawkins v. State, 77 Texas Crim. Rep., 520, 179 S. W. Rep., 448; Stephens v. State, 77 Texas Crim. Rep., 30, 177 S. W. Rep., 92; Mooney v. State, 73 Texas Crim. Rep., 121; King v. State, 82 Texas Crim. Rep., 745, 198 S. W. Rep., 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Appellant\u2019s first bill of exceptions is to the court\u2019s action in admitting as part of the res gestae the statement of one Asa Thomas to the effect that appellant had shot deceased- The statement of facts having been striclc\u00e9n out we are unable to say whether such evidence comes within the rule of <em>res gestae </em>or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">We are of opinion that the court should have given the law substantially as set forth in appellant\u2019s special charges Nos. 3 and 4. The facts stated in said bills, as approved by the trial court, show that deceased had just shot the sister of appellant while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>she was standing in the front door of appellant\u2019s home, and that deceased at once started into the house where said assaulted sister was and that appellant then shot him, all transpiring in a moment\u2019s time. The main charge of the court below did not submit self-defense either of appellant or another and the said special charges Nos. 3 and 4 are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\">Special charge No. 3: \u201cYou are further charged:'a reasonable apprehension of death or great bodily harm to a near relative of a person will excuse a party using all necessary force to protect the life or person of said near relative, and it is not necessary that should the actual danger provided he acted upon a reasonable apprehension of danger as it appeared to him from his standpoint at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u201cIf from the evidence you believe the defendant killed said Major Bass, but further believe that at the time of so doing the deceased had made an attack upon Bettie Hardin, a sister of defendant which from the manner and character of it and the relative strength and situation of the parties, caused defendant to have a reasonable expectation or fear of death or serious bodily injury to said sister, and that acting on such reasonable expectation or fear the defendant killed the deceased, then you should acquit him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Special charge No. 4: \u201cYou are further charged that if you believe from the testimony, that the deceased Major Bass, at the time of the killing was attempting to do serious bodily harm to the sister of defendant, Bettie Hardin, and the defendant shot and killed the said Major Bass in order to prevent' serious bodily harm to his said sister, Bettie Hardin, you will find the defendant not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Under the just provision of our law our citizens are permitted, in proper cases, to defend the person of another against real or apparent danger under substantially the same rules governing the defense of one\u2019s own person, and when the evidence raises that issue the trial court cannot ignore same. If, as stated, in said bill of exceptions, the deceased had in fact shot appellant\u2019s sister, and at once advanced toward the place where she was and while so advancing was himself shot by appellant it becomes at least a question of fact for the jury under appropriate instructions as to whether the shooting by appellant under such circumstances was justifiable. This court, through its presiding judge, said, in May-hew\u2019s case, 144 S. W. Rep., 229: \u201cThe law is that whatever he may do for himself he may do for another, under such circumstances, and this to be viewed from his standpoint.\u201d See also authorities cited in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">As appears by this record, we can see no error in refusing appellant\u2019s special charge No. 5, as there appears nothing herein to cause appellant to think deceased was making an unlawful attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>upon him, and therefore nothing to give him the right to a charge on self-defense as applied to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\">We can find nothing in the record making it material evidence that deceased had a bottle of whisky in his pocket when he was shot, and hold that the trial court did not \u25a0 err in excluding testimony of that. fact. In the absence of a statement of facts, which is referred to in that part of his bill of exceptions complaining thereof, we can see no error in allowing the evidence of the witness Wash Hardin as to what Bettie Hardin told him after the killing. If a sufficient predicate were laid the evidence was admissible for the purpose of impeaching said witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">This disposes of the errors complained of, and for the reason that the court below declined to give the substance of the law applicable to defense of another, the judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded for another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AIE\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">March 12,' 1919.</p>\n<author id=\"b96-8\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ACe\">In a former opinion of this court the statement of facts in this case was striken out upon motion of the State, said motion containing two grounds, with one of which this court did not agree. The State has filed this motion for a rehearing asking that we either modify our holding in the original opinion declining to sustain the motion of the State to strike out the statement of facts on the ground that it was not properly authenticated, or else that we expressly overrule certain decisions which are cited and discussed by the able assistant Attorney General in his motion for rehearing and which it is contended are not in line with that portion of our original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Again inspecting the purported statement of facts in this case, we observe that it begins with the words;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">\u201cSTATEMENT OP PACTS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">\u201cState of Texas vs No. 3231 Milton Thomas</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">In the District Court, Ninth Judicial</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b-AmPX\">District, San Jacinto County, Texas,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">Special July Term, 1918\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">We also note that at the end of said purported statement appears the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-15\">\u201cI, J.

Rep., 87 in which will be found a very similar authentication to that in the instant case, and this court there approves the rule laid down in the Lozano case, 81 S. W. Rep., 37, and after discussing them, expressly overrules those cases holding to the contrary, most of those discussed in the State\u2019s motion for rehearing being overruled in said opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-16\">We have- found many forms of authentication of statements of fact upheld by this court and the Supreme Court, the general conclusion being that the main object of our statutes and decisions on this subject is to secure to appellants and to the appellate courts a correct presentation of the facts and testimony in the trial courts, to attain which object a substantial compliance with the statutes is necessary; but to prevent the defeat of which object, the question as to what is a substantial compliance must be left to the sound judgment of the appellate courts. No hard and fast rule as to such authentication has been found, but we suggest that it is always safest to follow the plain path pointed out by our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">Believing our former opinion correct in principle and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>decisions contrary thereto were disposed of in t'he Brown Case, supra, the motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
