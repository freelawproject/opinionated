He introduced several witnesses who gave negative testimony controverting his possession of the pistol at the time in question, and introduced two small boys, one eight years of age, who testified that they saw the transaction and that the instrument which, the appellant had was not a pistol but was a monkeywrench.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">There are several bills of exceptions complaining of the admission of testimony, and some complaint of the exclusion of evidence. We have examined these bills and they - disclose no error. We desire to remark in connection with them, however, that it was stated in an early case, Buchannan v. State, 24 Texas Crim. App., 195, that <em>\u201cA </em>bill of exceptions taken to the exclusion of testimony must disclose the relevancy and materiality of the proposed testimony. Inferences will not be indulged to supply the omission of such essentials.\u201d Citing Luttrell v. State, 14 Texas Crim. App., 147; Sutton v. State, 16 Texas Crim. App., 490; Counts v. State, 19 Texas Crim. App., 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">This rule holds good with reference to the admission of evidence. The bill to require- consideration must be so drawn that the court on its examination may be able to decide, not only what the action of the court was, but the subject of it and its relation to the case. Vernon\u2019s Crim. Stats., vol. 2, p. 542, note 29 and cases collated.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">There are some bills reserved to the argument of the State\u2019s counsel. One of these objects to the remark, \u201cAnd the defendant says he did not have a gun, because he had a ring-tail monkey wrench.\u201d Another: \u201cAnd this negro comes into court and brings these little boys, and has them to testify that way, to protect himself.\u201d In another bill the remarks were: \u201cAnd that same little boy, God help him, \u25a0 riding, around with the negro, he used that little boy to come here into court, he subpoenaed him into court to cover his own guilty acts\u2014it is debauchery of childhood.\u201d Another : \u201cShame on you for bringing a little, innocent boy into this court, and hiding behind him.\u201d Another: \u201cThis little boy may be sleeping with this old \"negro because they are from the North and don\u2019t know any better.\u201d None of these remarks appear to have been outside of the record, and with the exception of the reference to the fact that the little boy was from the North and did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>know any better, we discern no impropriety. Certainly none of them were such as to be so obviously injurious and prejudicial to the appellant that they might not have been withdrawn had a special charge in writing been requested of the court. Branch\u2019s An. P. C., 362 and cases cited; and taken in connection with the fact that the lowest penalty was assessed and there was ample evidence to show the guilt of the appellant, we are of the opinion that there is nothing in the record which authorizes the court to reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">It is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
