The record is before us without any statement of facts or agreement of counsel or any other manner by which this court may be guided in determining its decision of this case. It has been often held by this court that the contents of the application \u00e1re but pleading and that if nothing further be presented the application will be dismissed. See Ex parte Thomas, 65 Texas Crim. Rep., 537; Ex parte Clark, 198 S. W. Rep., 954; Ex parte Robertson, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-17\">There being nothing before us except the application for this writ which alleges that applicant was placed in jail following an adjudication that he was in contempt of the District Court of Red River County for refusing to answer certain questions before the grand jury of that county, we are unable to decide what the facts were upon which such judgment was rendered, and the presumption being that proper facts were before the court and in favor of the regularity of the court\u2019s action, the application will be dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>and the relator will be remanded to the custody of the sheriff of Red River County.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\n<em>Remanded to custody.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">April 16, 1919.</p>\n<author id=\"b255-8\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AIF\">At a former day of this term application for habeas corpus presented by relator was ordered dismissed and relator remanded because there were no facts on file from which the court could determine the correctness of the rulings of the trial court on the matters complained of. Appellant was sent to jail for refusing to answer certain questions before the grand jury. Relator now files a motion for rehearing in which he states that he is now filing a statement of facts. An examination of the record fails to disclose any such facts filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Motion for rehearing overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
