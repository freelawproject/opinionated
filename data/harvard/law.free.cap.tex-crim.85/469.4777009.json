As his business increased his means of conveyance proved inadequate, and the company bought and put him in charge of the auto truck for the purpose of carrying on their business and increased his wages until it reached $110 per month. The only pay that he. received was for his services as solicitor and salesman; that he was not paid anything as a chauffeur or for driving the auto truck; that he drove it himself, and had no chauffeur to assist him in his work. The evidence is uncontroverted that he received- no pay from his employers for driving the auto truck as a means of carrying on their business in soliciting and delivering their goods to customers. This was the State\u2019s evidence. The defendant introduced no testimony, but the State used him as a witness without his objection, as it did the controlling agent of the Texas Oil Company\u2019s business in El Paso. He was convicted under the theory that these facts placed him within the requirements of the law, and that he should obtain a license as chauffeur to operate the auto truck under the circumstances mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The act under which this conviction occurred was passed by the Thirty-fifth Legislature at its General Session, beginning on page 474 of the published edition of the acts of that session. Section 14 of the act, found on page 477, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">\u201cNo person shall employ for hire as a chauffeur of a motor vehicle any person not licensed as in this Act provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">\u201cNo person shall allow a motor vehicle owned by him or under his control to be operated by any chauffeur who has no legal right to do so, \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Section 25 of said Act provides that, \u201can application for a license to operate a motor vehicle as a chauffeur (and by 1 chauffeur \u2019 is meant any person whose business or occupation is that he oner ates a motor vehicle for compensation, wages, or hire),\u201d etc. This definition as well as the provisions of this act seem to apply to those who are-known as chauffeurs and who operate motor vehicles as such chauffeur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>for compensation, wages or hire. This is the legislative definition, and by this the court should be governed. It would seem from reading the definition of \u201cchauffeur\u201d that in order to bring him within that class he must operate the motor vehicle as such for compensation, wages or hire and it would further seem this would apply directly to the fact or relation of driver of the vehicle for compensation, wages or hire, and would seem to exclude the idea that the vehicle was used as an incident to carry on the business. If appellant was driving the auto truck for a stipulated sum or wages, or part of the profits that might arise from the use of the vehicle, when used for others, he might be within the definition given by the Legislature, but the relation, however, seems to be direct, that the chauffeur must operate the vehicle as such and for the purpose of so making money and should as chauffeur receive compensation for operating it. The writer does not understand that where a party is employed in soliciting orders and delivering goods as in this case, that his services and the use of the vehicle in delivering the goods would constitute him a \u201cchauffeur\u201d within this definition. Such seems to be the accepted idea wherever the matter has been discussed. We find in Vol. 11 of Corpus Juris on page 747, that a chauffeur is defined to be \u201cthe driver of an automobile; one who operates and propels an automobile one who drives or operates an automobile as a private servant or as a licensed public driver; a professional expert in the, operation of automobiles; a man who drives an automobile for0hire; any person operating a motor vehicle as machanic, employee, or for hire.\u201d The above is the general definition stated in the text. Under that will be found this statement in the note: \u2018 \u2018 The accepted meaning of the word \u2018chauffeur\u2019 in every State where the term is used in a motor vehicle statute is a paid operator or employee, and includes in it the idea of compensation for the operation of the vehicle. In some of the States, such as Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, the clear distinction is made between the license of an \u2018operator\u2019 and the license of a \u2018chauffeur,\u2019 and in other States, such as Connecticut, Rhode Island, District of Columbia, Delaware, and.Maine, where the law provides that all operators shall be licensed, the word \u2018chauffeur\u2019 is not used at all in the statutes, but the more inclusive word \u2018operator\u2019 is used. . . . \u2018as far as the automobile industry and users of motor vehicles are concerned,\u2019 it would only be by a strained and unnatural construction and foreign to the accepted usage that the term \u2018chauffeur\u2019 could be made to include operators other than employees for hire. The \u2018National Association of Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 and the \u2018American Automobile Association\u2019 use.the word \u2018chauffeur\u2019 to mean \u2018an operator for hire,\u2019 and it is the opinion of the court that the word, as we believe we have shown, has always been used in that sense in dealing with motor vehicle legislation,\u201d citing Commonwealth v. Cooper, 37 Pa. Co., 277, 282, 285.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>So it would seem from a reading of the Texas statute, viewed in the light of the general acceptation of the term \u201cchauffeur,\u201d that where a license is required of the chauffeur for hire or wages,, it has a direct relation to his employment to run the vehicle itself for hire and not as an incident to the delivery of the goods, wares and merchandise of his employer. The employment in the latter case is to take orders and deliver the goods, not to run the' auto, the auto being used as an incident for the purpose of soliciting orders and delivery of the goods. The chauffeur as contemplated by the statute has a direct relation to the hire for operating of the vehicle, while in soliciting and delivering goods it is an incident to his employment as a means of carrying on the business for which he receives no direct pay, as in this ease. We are of opinion, therefore, appellant should not have been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\">The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
