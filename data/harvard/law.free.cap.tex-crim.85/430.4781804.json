The proposition that the fact that appellant was a common prostitute could not be established by proof of her reputation as such or of the reputation of the house in which she lived, is sound. Arnold v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 480; Leatherman v. State, 49 Texas Crim. Rep., 486; 14 L. R. A., (N. S.) 692. In support of the allegation that the house she kept was a disorderly one, evidence of its general reputation as such, while not sufficient alone to establish the fact, was admissible. Forbes v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 26; Ramey v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 200; Golden v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 143; O\u2019Brien v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 432; Branch\u2019s Crim. Law, sec. 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">There are some objections to the court\u2019s charge, but the rule in misdemeanor cases requires that omissions in the charge should be supplied by requested charges. This, the bill preserved, shows was not done except in the instance in which the court was requested to exclude from the consideration of the jury evidence of several witnesses to facts which were admissible and relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">Finding no error, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
