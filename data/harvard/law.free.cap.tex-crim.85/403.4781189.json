Nothing, however, is disclosed which would have made him subject to challenge for cause. He was excused on peremptory challenge. -No objectionable juror was forced on appellant, and he failed to exhaust his peremptory challenges. There is no error shown. Hudson v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 338; McKinney v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The venireman referred to in bill No. 2 having been excused upon peremptory challenge, and the court having offered to restore the challenge to appellant, the bill discloses no error, even though the juror had been subject to challenge for cause. Such opinion as he had was formed from hearsay, and in testing his qualification the court followed the procedure designated in subdivision 13 of Art. 692, C. C. P., Cannon v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The appellant, on cross-examination, was asked if he shot in self-defense when he shot deceased while he was crawling on his hands and knees and begging the appellant not to continue to shoot him. The eyewitnesses for the State testified that the shooting took place under these circumstances, and appellant claimed that all the shots fired by him were in self-defense. We think the cross-examination was germane and not subject to objection. Wharton Crim. Ev., Sec. 429; Weaver v. State, 68 Texas Crim. Rep., 214, 150 S. W. Rep., 785; Crockett v. State, 40 Texas Crim.

Caldwell v. State, 12 Texas Crim. App., 316. See Jones v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">In the recent case of Wilson v. State, 210 S. W. Rep., 802, the opinion is expressed that the words \u201cbefore the trial begins\u201d in the statute, touching suspended sentence, meant before both parties had announced ready for trial. If it were not so however, the appellant having been convicted of murder, and the suspended sentence law not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>applying to that offense, the holding of the trial court, that his application for the submission of that issue came too late, could have resulted in no harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The appellant was a tenant upon the farm of J. S. McDaniel, whose son, Bud McDaniel, was killed. The age of the appellant was fifty-seven years, and his son, Goldie Moore, a youth about seventeen or eighteen years of age, had been severely whipped by the deceased a few days prior to the homicide. This son, according to the testimony, had been an invalid and his mind was feeble. The cause of the assault upon him appears to have been his alleged misconduct towards the sister of the deceased. This appellant claimed, prior to the homicide, was a false charge maliciously fabricated. The appellant was incensed at the deceased, and went to Dallas and procured a pistol, and some ten minutes before the homicide, which occurred in the town of Rockwall, he, according to testimony which he denied, referred to the deceased as a \u201c God damned thieving son-of-a-biteh, \u201d and.said, \u201cI will see him; I will tell him so .when I see him.\u201d Appellant claimed that he obtained the pistol to leave with his wife on his contemplated absence in eastern Texas, and that he-brought it to Rockwall on the occasion of the homicide for the purpose of having a scabbard made for it. He said that he saw the deceased and a companion step off a platform or gallery, and that he was carrying the pistol in a pasteboard box; that immediately upon seeing them he took the pistol out of the box and loaded it with cartridges which he had in his possession. He claimed he was not expecting trouble with the deceased and did not arm himself, for the purpose of trouble, but for the purpose of defending himself, and said after he saw deceased walking before him he did not know what he was going to run up against. He said he had not made up his mind to kill deceased, but had turned the matter of assault on his son over to the court; that he was angry about it, and said: \u201cI saw him stop and I went right on, did not halt more than a minute when I slipped my shells in my gun; I hadn\u2019t made up my mind to kill him, I loaded the gun to defend myself after I asked \u25a0 him if he beat up my boy; I couldn\u2019t help asking him the first time I saw him. I was going to shoot him if he made any \u2018resent.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t aiming to shoot until he made a pass and said, \u2018I can get you too;\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t have shot him if he hadn\u2019t resented it. I didn\u2019t know whether I hit him at all. I didn\u2019t know what he was after on the ground. When I shot the first time he went down like he was after something. I was shooting Him to protect myself.\u201d He described the homicide by saying: \u2018\u2018I walked up and said to deceased, \u2018Bud, did you get satisfaction out of Goldie Moore?\u2019 to which deceased replied, \u2018I did,\u2019 and came up and says: \u2018I can get it out of you,\u2019 and made a lunge at me and I shot him; it looked like he had a knife or something coming toward me and I shot him and he went down on the ground and kept running toward me and ! didn\u2019t know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>but what he was fixing to come at me and I shot him again, twice more. \u2019 \u2019 Upon being asked if he would have fired except in defense of his life, he said: \u201cWhy, of course, I was mad and that is the cause of my doing it, to protect myself, to save my own life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The State\u2019s testimony, as developed from several witnesses, is illustrated by the following quotation from one of them: \u201cBud McDaniel, Mr. G. I. Trotter and I were standing together, kinder in a row; . . . Mr. Trotter was \u2018 cutting up \u2019 and Bud was standing laughing at us. When I first saw Mr. Moore he was coming off the walk. Not a word was said about the defendant. Bud McDaniel was not looking in the direction from whence the defendant came. The defendant walked up in about six or eight feet of us, I suppose, and said: \u2018Bud, I guess you got satisfaction out of the boy,' and when he said that he shot, and Bud threw up his arm like that, and fell and caught on his hands and knees and went running off, saying \u2018For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t kill me; he- was running on his hands and knees and the defendant was following him and when he shot him the s'eeond time Bud was saying \u2018For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t do that. \u2019 When the appellant said \u2018 I \u2022 guess you got satisfaction out of the boy,\u2019 McDaniel made no reply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Appellant insists that if it be conceded that appellant\u2019s question and manner were reasonably calculated to provoke the difficulty that his disclaimer of intent to do so would preclude the right to submit the issue to the jury. It is true that to justify the submission of the issue the words and acts of the appellant must have been reasonably calculated to bring about a difficulty and the appellant must have had the intention to do so in order that he might have an excuse for billing or injuring the deceased. We do not think, however, that the appellant\u2019s statement of his conclusion that he had no intention to kill or to provoke the difficulty was conclusive. The jury was authorized in deciding what his intention was to take into consideration his conduct and his relation to the deceased. The expression of the court in McCraw\u2019s case, 49 S. W. Rep., 227, is pertinent. Judge Brooks writing the opinion, says: \u201cWhile the act of provocation must be confined to the time when the homicide was committed, yet we do not understand by this that we cannot look back to the facts transpiring before this\u2014the course of conduct of the parties, and their former conversations, in order to shed light upon it and render significant some act or declaration done at the t\u00fane of the homicide.\u201d The court, with the acquiesence of appellant, submitted the issue of self-defense. He relied on it in his testimony. His reliance upon it was based upon the fact that he testified that deceased responded to his inquiry about getting satisfaction out of the boy, by an assault or a threatened assault and that the appellant thought that he had a knife or some instrument to injure him with. The assault which he described, came, from his standpoint, in immediate response to the words he used to the deceased and the jury in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>determining whether they were reasonably calculated to provoke the deceased, had before them the avowed intention of the appellant to kill the deceased if he resented or made any move in response to the language that he used to him. They had before them the fact that the appellant, as soon as he saw the deceased, loaded his pistol, approached deceased and accosted him in the manner which he described; that five or ten minutes previously he had used in the presence of a witness, words denouncing the deceased and threatening to denounce him to his face; the anger and resentment of the appellant developed not only from his own admissions,, but from the testimony of other witnesses, his expressed belief that a wrong had been done him in the assault upon his son and that it was founded upon malicious and false accusations against his son. In the light of these and other facts, which were before the jury, we are not prepared to say that the trial court would have been justified in deciding as a matter of law that there was no intent upon the part of the appellant to provoke the deceased to assault him or that he did nothing reasonably calculated to do so. Neither are we prepared to say that the jury, in passing upon the subject, was without regal basis for the conclusion which they formed. There are many cases supporting the view expressed in the quotation from McCraw\u2019s case <em>supra, </em>among them Bateson v. State, 46 Texas Crim. Rep., 46; Barstado v. State, 48 Texas Crim. Rep., 255; Cornelius v. State, 54 Texas Crim. Rep., 186; Tardy v. State, 47 Texas Crim. Rep., 444; Taylor v. State, 47 Texas Crim. Rep., 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\">Under the evidence of bystanders who described the acts and conduct of the deceased and the circumstances attending the homicide, we think the question, whether appellant\u2019s mind was in a condition rendering him incabable of cool reflection, was for the jury, and that the court would not have- been justified in eliminating the issue of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The question, \u201cWas McDaniel looking in the direction of Moore?\u201d does not suggest the answer desired, and the bill complaining that it was leading discloses no error. Coates v. State, 2 Texas Crim. App., 19; Moore v. State, 49 Texas Crim. Rep., 502; Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C. Sec. 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The bill complaining of the admission of the evidence of the witness Underwood, failing to set out the evidence, we are unable to pass upon its materiality. See Vernon\u2019s Texas Crim. Stats., Vol. 2, p. 537, subdivision 21, and eases listed. The receipt of it in rebuttal, though out of its order, was a matter within the. discretion of the trial judge. Graham v. State, 57 Texas Crim. Rep., 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Complaint is made of the charge on manslaughter in that it was unduly restrictive of appellant\u2019s right of self-defense. The reference in the charge on manslaughter of self-defense was not an attempt upon the court to define the law of self-defense, but to direct the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that they should keep the law of self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>defense and the facts touching it in mind for appellant\u2019s benefit. The law of self-defense both, on real and apparent danger, was fully given to the jury in other and distinct paragraphs of the charge, and the complaint made that the charge on manslaughter resulted in undue restriction of appellant\u2019s right of self-defense is not sustained, we think, by the <em>record; </em>but assuming that the issue of self-defense was raised by the facts, we think it is sufficiently submitted, taking into consideration the charge as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">All the bills of exception have been examined and considered, though some of them are not discussed. They relate to the application of questions of practice, and we deem a detail review of them unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Perceiving no error committed by the trial court which would authorize a reversal of the judgment, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
