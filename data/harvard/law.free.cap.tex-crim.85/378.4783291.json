The allegations are as follows: \u201cJesse Dickerson, an adult male, did unlawfully commit an aggravated assault in and upon the person of one Mary Loo Dickerson, the said-then and there being a female.\u201d It does not specify that Mary Loo Dickerson was a female. We are of opinion this is not sufficient. I Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., 252, et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-22\">The complaint, also, does not show to have been sworn to; at least there is no jurat of the officer attached to the complaint. It is signed by R. A. Davenport. Following the signature is this language: \u201cSworn to and subscribed by R. A. Davenport, before me, on this 18 day of October, 1918.- County Attorney of Ellis County, Texas.\u201d There is marked on the complaint the following: \u201cW. H. Fears, Assistant County Attorney, Ellis County. Filed October 18, 1918. Rush Hickman, County Clerk, Ellis County, Texas. \u2019 \u2019 The name of the county attorney is left blank and thereby fails to allege or show that the county attorney of Ellis county took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the affidavit or swore the affiant. The assistant county attorney\u2019s name appearing upon it does not show that he took the affidavit. Without a complaint sworn to there is no basis for the information. This defect can be taken advantage of on the appeal in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"AIc\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\">ON REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">May. 28, 1919.</p>\n<author id=\"b429-8\">DAVIDSON, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AAhW\">On a former day of the term the judgment herein was reversed. The State has filed a motion for rehearing, insisting that the reversal was erroneous and should be set aside and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">The charging part of the complaint is as follows: \u201cone Jesse Dickerson, an adult male, did unlawfully commit an aggravated assault in and upon the person of one Mary Loo Dickerson, the said-then and there being a female.\u201d The contention of appellant was that this did not sufficiently allege that the \u201cthen and there being a female\u201d referred to Mary Loo Dickerson. Upon a more careful review of this question the court is of the opinion that the complaint is sufficient to charge that the statement \u201cthen and there being a female\u201d referred to Mary Loo Dickerson. The word \u201csaid\u201d preceding the blank may be treated as surplusage, but if not, then the expression \u201cthen and there being a female\u201d would refer to the last preceding name mentioned in the complaint. Under that view of it this allegation would be sufficient to show that Mary Loo\"Dickerson was referred to by the expression \u201cthen and there being a female. \u2019 \u2019 From that viewpoint of it, we are of opinion the reversal should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">It is also contended that the former opinion was in error in holding that the complaint did not show it was sworn to before W. H. Fears, Assistant County Attorney. Without repeating the complaint, it is signed by R A. Davenport, Affiant, and recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-13\">\u201cSworn to and subscribed by R A. Davenport, before me, on this 18 day of October, 1918.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-14\">County Attorney of Ellis County, Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-15\">W. H. Fears, Assistant County Atty. Ellis County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-16\">Filed Oct. 18, 1918. Rush Hickman,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-17\">Co. Clerk, Ellis Co., Texas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-18\">The majority of the court is of the opinion that this sufficiently shows that the affidavit was taken by W. H. Fears, Assistant County Attorney of Ellis County. The writer is inclined to the opinion that it does not show that W. H. Fears took the affidavit. He re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>gards it as an endorsement on the complaint that W. H. Fears was Assistant County Attorney and not that he took the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">For the above reasons the judgment of reversal is set aside, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
