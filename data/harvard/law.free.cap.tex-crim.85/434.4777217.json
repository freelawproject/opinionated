Buckley v. State, 70 Texas Crim. Rep., 550; Elliott v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 1; Webb v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">It is only when proof of the collateral offense is such as that the jury might use it improperly to convict or that it might reasonably result in harm to appellant that it is necessary to limit the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>for which such evidence was introduced. Carroll v. State, 58 S. W., 340; Purcelly v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App., 1; Bailey v. State, 69 Texas Crim. Rep., 474; 155 S. W. Rep., 536; Leeper v. State, 29 Texas Crim. Rep., 63; Gilbert v. State, 57 Texas Crim. Rep., 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We do not see how the jury could have considered the evidence as to the former threat testified to by the prosecuting witness and his father for any other purpose other than to show that the threat in the instarl case was seriously made.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">There being no other errors seriously complained of, and none apparent in the record the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
