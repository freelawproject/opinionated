Breath, quite an essential element to human existence, has with the advent of the advertising profession, received notoriety (as might be expected) by having the unfortunate consequences of \u201cbad\u201d breath presented to the public in an <em>in terrorem </em>way. These titans, from motives possibly altruistic, but more probably financial, have sought to alleviate this unfortunate bodily affliction by manufacturing a product which will change breath from \u201cbad\u201d to \u201cgood\u201d. The evils of bad breath have been dramatized to us as causing potential young lovers to find each other quite unacceptable until, by the use and alchemy of breath fresheners, the evil is cured and a happy courtship is commenced or renewed. All this is accomplished by dentifrices which \u201ccleanse the breath while cleaning the teeth\u201d, mouth sprays which achieve the same result, and candy confections.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-16\">The defendant-appellee, Warner-Lambert Company (defendant), for some time has sold cylindrically packaged breath mints known as \u201cClorets\u201d and \u201cCerts\u201d. Beech-Nut, Inc., plaintiff-appellant (plaintiff), sells the well-known cylindrically packaged confection \u201cLife Savers\u201d. If \u201cLife Savers\u201d is excluded as a possible breath mint, defendant with its \u201cClorets\u201d and \u201cCerts\u201d is said to account 'for over 98% of the breath mint market.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-17\">Believing that such a seeming monopoly should be corrected, plaintiff decided to enter the breath mint market and, also, to capitalize on its \u201cLife Savers\u201d popularity by adding some breath freshening ingredients to a confection labeled \u201cBREATH SAVERS\u201d. This product was in the high-impulse-low-price category and was to be sold from display racks usually found on counters of the vendors. Three geographically different market areas, covering nine states, were selected for test marketing, and large sums of money (estimated at over $1,-000,000) were expended by plaintiff on development, packaging, and promotion of its \u201cBREATH SAVERS\u201d. The results were good and plaintiff plans to proceed to market this product on a national b\u00e1sis.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Seeing its field about to be invaded, defendant was not slow in its counterattack. It brought forth, in a very short time, its own breath mint product which it labeled \u201cBREATH PLEASERS\u201d. Naturally, the invaded plaintiff took umbrage at the counter-sally, and commenced legal action. The suit, for trademark infringement and unfair competition, originated in Supreme Court, New York County, and a preliminary injunction was sought against defendant\u2019s potential marketing of its \u201cBREATH PLEASERS\u201d. Before there was any hearing in Supreme Court, New York County, the suit was removed by defendant to Federal district court. There the suit came before the trial court upon plaintiff\u2019s motions to remand to the State court and for a preliminary injunction. The court denied both motions. Plaintiff appeals to this Court from the order denying these motions, reported at 346 F.Supp. 547 (S.D.N.Y. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Although the trial court optimistically believed that the remand motion \u201cIf not quite abandoned, is no longer pressed with vigor\u201d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this phase of the action has gathered renewed strength on appeal: well over one-half of plaintiff\u2019s brief on appeal is devoted to the district court\u2019s failure to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Despite considerable doubt created by the language of the statute as to whether Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)) covers mere trademark infringement and unfair competition, the many cases decided since its enactment leave no doubt that, as construed by the courts, the claims advanced here may properly be brought under this section.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the claims set forth in the complaint could have been brought under Section 43(a) \u2014 hence, \u201cremoval was not improper.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">As to the denial of a preliminary injunction, we have previously stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-13\">[t]he award of a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, and will not be granted except upon a clear showing of probable success and possible irreparable injury. Clairol, Inc. v. The Gillette Co., 389 F.2d 264, 265 (2d Cir. 1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">The district court found that there was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-15\">a substantial prospect that plaintiff will eventually fail rather than succeed in its claim of trademark infringement. 346 F.Supp. at 549.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">In addition the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-17\">[TJaking everything together, the court concludes that plaintiff will probably lose the case at the end and should not have at this stage the extraordinary remedy it seeks. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-18\">To determine whether Judge Frankel erred in this determination, we turn briefly to the merits of plaintiff\u2019s case. The essential and primary element in any action based upon common law infringement, unfair competition, or violation of the Lanham Act is deception. Plaintiff bases its claim of deception primarily upon imitation of packaging. The names themselves \u201cBREATH SAVERS\u201d and \u201cBREATH PLEASERS\u201d are quite dissimilar except for \u201cBreath\u201d, as to which plaintiff possesses no exclusive rights. In the field of \u201cbreath fresheners\u201d, there are already many candies or mints which claim to obtain this praiseworthy objective under such titles as \u201cBreath Sweet\u201d, \u201cBreath Allure\u201d, \u201cChlorophyll Breath Mints\u201d, \u201cBreath Buds\u201d, \u201cBreathlets\u201d, \u201cBreath Takers\u201d, \u201cBreath Beads\u201d and \u201cBreathgards\u201d. Nor is the fact that the competing \u201cBreath Savers\u201d and \u201cBreath Pleasers\u201d are both wrapped in cylindrical packages, determinative \u2014 so are many candies.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>The colors of the three flavors are quite similar, but there can be no monopoly on color.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">In testing for likelihood of confusion in the impulse-purchaser market, a court must disregard minutia of differences and look to the overall appearance of the package as seen by a potential purchaser. Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co. v. Houston Ice &amp; Brewing Co., 250 U.S. 28, 39 S.Ct. 401, 63 L.Ed. 822 (1919). Such a purchaser in all probability will not discuss before purchase the merits of the product with the sales clerk and inquire whether the mint with \u201cMH2\u201d will be more efficacious in solving his temporary problem than the mint produced under \u201cFormula KG40\u201d. He wants to eliminate bad breath as quickly as possible. On the counter he sees packages in display racks bearing the name \u201cBREATH SAVERS\u201d in large white letters against a blue or green background. Only upon close inspection will he see in small type the legend, \u201cThe Breath Mint From Life Savers\u201d. However, once he knows the source, he will naturally associate this breath mint with the well-known' \u201cLife Savers\u201d. And if he finds the product pleasant and effective, he may become a regular customer. \u201cBREATH PLEASERS\u201d on the other hand will catch the potential purchaser\u2019s eye with its large yellow lettering, also against a blue or green background. Even were defendant\u2019s name known to the purchaser through the purchaser\u2019s knowledge of defendant\u2019s various pharmaceutical products, he would not know that the Warner-Lambert Company was the manufacturer of \u201cBREATH PLEASERS\u201d because its name does not appear on the package as displayed; nor is the buyer reminded that \u201cBREATH PLEASERS\u201d come from the same manufacturer as \u201cCerts\u201d or \u201cClorets\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">In short, we agree with Judge Frankel that the two products\u2019 names and packages are sufficiently different so that a purchaser desirous of obtaining a product manufactured by \u201cLife Savers\u201d would not be deceived into believing that the \u201cLife Savers\u201d company was the source of \u201cBREATH PLEASERS\u201d. The product \u201cBREATH PLEASERS\u201d is in competition with \u201cBREATH SAVERS\u201d, but not in that type of unfair competition which would warrant the granting of a preliminary injunction ; if there is unfair competition here, plaintiff will have a full opportunity to develop this at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-18\">. 346 F.Supp. 547, 548 (S.D.N.Y.1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">. <em>See </em>Federal-Mogul-Bower Bearings, Inc. v.
