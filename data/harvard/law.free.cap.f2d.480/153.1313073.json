Triple \u201cAAA\u201d Company produces and markets a soft drink similar in color and taste to Coca-Cola. Jack Cahill, doing business as Cahill\u2019s Dairy Maid, sold the Triple \u201cAAA\u201d beverage to the public under the names \u201cTac\u00f3la\u201d and \u201cTacola-Cola.\u201d Coca-Cola Company, owner of valid registered trademarks for the brand names \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d and \u201cCoke,\u201d brought suit against Cahill for unfair competition and trademark infringement, alleging that Cahill substituted and \u201cpassed off\u201d Triple \u201cAAA\u201d \u2019s beverage when Coca-Cola was asked for. Triple \u201cAAA\u201d was subsequently made a party defendant. A consent judgment was entered against Ca-hill, and the only contest now is between Coca-Cola and Triple \u201cAAA.\u201d The triable issue is framed by the amended complaint, in which Coca-Cola contends that Triple \u201cAAA\u201d \u2019s very use of the brand names \u201cTac\u00f3la\u201d and \u201cTacola-Cola\u201d is deceptive, is unfair competition, and causes confusion with the trademark \u201cCoca-Cola.\u201d Coca-Cola sought appropriate injunctive relief against use of the brand names \u201cTac\u00f3la\u201d and \u201cTacolaCola\u201d in connection with the sale of any beverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-19\">Jurisdiction is well founded on the Lanham Trade-Mark Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051, et seq., and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338. On the trial of the case the court granted permanent injunctive relief against Triple \u201cAAA\u201d \u2019s use of the words \u201cTa-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>cola\u201d and \u201cTacola-Cola\u201d based on the finding that the words are confusingly similar to \u201cCoca-Cola,\u201d that users of Coca-Cola would be deceived by their use as beverage names, and that Triple \u201cAAA\u201d \u2019s marketing of the names constituted trademark infringement and unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">We agree with the findings and conclusions of the trial court, for the reasons so well stated in its published opinion. <em>See </em>Coca-Cola Company v. Cahill, 350 F.Supp. 1231 (W.D.Okl.1972).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
