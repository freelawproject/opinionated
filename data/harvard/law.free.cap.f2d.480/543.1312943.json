Appellants alleged that they were members of a class composed of \u201cmunicipal employees of the City of El Paso, Texas, who are not defined as \u2018veterans\u2019 \u201d under the challenged provision. In response to appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to allege facts showing that appellants were personally affected by the challenged provision, appellants sought and obtained leave to amend their complaint. Their amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>complaint, however, alleged only that the representatives of the class had \u201cactually suffered from the Defendants\u2019 alleged discriminatory actions.\u201d Subsequent to the filing of this amended complaint, the trial court heard argument on and granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The judgment of dismissal is affirmed on the ground that appellants failed to allege facts showing that they were personally affected by the challenged provisions.
