A decree was entered enjoining the awarding of any contract based upon the bid procedures followed and in question in the ease. The Bureau of Reclamation and the two Bureau officials, all named defendants, have appealed. Appellants after appeal filed a motion to stay the injunction order. To grant such stay, this Court concluded, would be tantamount to a decision of the ease on the merits. By agreement of the parties and at the suggestion of the court, the matter has been expedited for argument and submission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ease on its merits without the necessity of following the usual procedure of submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">During the pendency of the appeal, the appellants filed a motion to vacate the judgment and remand the case with instructions to dismiss the complaint for mootness. In their motion to vacate judgment and remand the cause, appellants argue the case is moot since the district court ordered issuance of bids based on the November 27 and November 30 wage determinations. Appellants\u2019 position is that as these determinations expired on March 26, 1973, and no Bureau action was taken by that time, the court\u2019s judgment no longer has any force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">We do not accept the Bureau\u2019s argument. The court\u2019s judgment is not limited to Bureau action taken under the two modified determinations. It is directed toward the Bureau\u2019s arbitrary and capricious application of the Davis-Bacon Act. This Act requires the Bureau to accept modified wage determinations received less than ten days before opening bids if there is a reasonable time to notify bidders of the modification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court was alarmed at the Bureau\u2019s stunning disregard of the Act\u2019s mandates. The court felt, and we agree, the Bureau was more concerned with its own interests than the interests to be protected under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">It is apparent the district court\u2019s order is directed toward the Bureau\u2019s arbitrary conduct, for the order expressly compels the Bureau to follow the mandates of the Davis-Bacon Act. This order is as relevant now as at the time it was established, and thus we must deny appellants\u2019 motion. Local 74, United Bhd. of Carpenters v. NLRB, 341 U.S. 707, 71 S.Ct. 966, 95 L.Ed. 1309 (1951) ; NLRB v. Denver Bldg. &amp; Const. Trades Council, 192 F.2d 577 (10th Cir. 1951); NLRB v. United Bhd. Carpenters, 184 F.2d 60 (10th Cir. 1950), cert. denied, 341 U.S. 947, 71 S.Ct. 1011, 95 L.Ed. 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\"> On the basis of the issues presented and the facts as found after an evidentiary hearing, the trial judge made all-inclusive conclusions of law. Int\u2019l U. of Operating Eng., Local 627 v. Arthurs, 355 F.Supp. 7 (W.D.Okla.1973). We, of course, are bound by the findings of fact unless, after a consideration of all the evidence, we must conclude such findings of fact to be clearly erroneous. We have carefully considered all of the record before us and are compelled to accept the findings of fact made.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Likewise, we are in agreement with the conclusions of law set forth in the court\u2019s opinion. They fully cover the principles of law applicable to the issues presented and to the facts, as found.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">Therefore, on the basis of, and for the reasons stated in the trial court\u2019s opinion, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">However, there remains in the case the final disposition of the contempt proceedings ; therefore, with our affirmance of the portion of the case here reviewed, we remand the case for such further proceedings deemed appropriate by the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-19\">. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.7(b) (1); 37 Fed.Reg. 21,139, October 5, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
