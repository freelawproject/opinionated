Palacio, 5 Cir., 1973, 477 F.2d 560. In that case we held there was no merit to the claim that the jury system in the Southern District of Florida (the same District involved here) is unconstitutional. <em>Palacio </em>cites three other cases of this Circuit which support the constitutionality of the jury system for the Southern District of Florida, namely, United States v. Pentado, 5 Cir., 1972, 463 F.2d 355; United States v. Blair, 5 Cir., 1972, 470 F.2d 331; United States v. Gooding, 5 Cir., 1973, 473 F.2d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">In <em>Gooding </em>we held that the Jury Plan of the Southern District of Florida was constitutional and that the district court was not obliged to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issues raised since \u201cit could take judicial notice of the passage of time and the mathematically calculable effect of a given time lag in temporarily excluding certain qualified jurors from the opportunity for jury service.\u201d 473 F.2d at 430.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor do we think there is any merit to the assertion that the one-year residence requirement in the Plan and provided for in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1865, renders the Plan unconstitutional. We do not think it can fairly be asserted that new residents are a distinguishable or cognizable class. It is not necessary that the trial court receive evidence on this issue since only a question of law is involved which we resolve adversely to defendant\u2019s contentions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-16\">We have considered the additional contentions of defendant and find them to be without merit. Thus there is no merit in defendant\u2019s contention that the jury could not infer intent to distribute hashish from the fact of possession of 188 pounds thereof, <em>see </em>United States v. Mather, 5 Cir., 1972, 465 F.2d 1035. The district court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress fingerprints and palm prints, <em>see </em>United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>States v. McNeal, 5 Cir., 1972, 463 F.2d 1180. The contention that there was no republication of Schedule I relative to controlled substances, as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812, is refuted by reference to Federal Register, Vol. 37, No. 93, May 12, 1972, pp. 9545-9557, showing republication of the schedules of controlled substances. The statute under which defendant was convicted, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), is not unconstitutional, as contended by defendant, <em>see </em>United States v. Nelson, 5 Cir., 1972, 458 F.2d 556; United States v. Lopez, 5 Cir., 1972, 459 F.2d 949; United States v. Lopez, 5 Cir., 1972, 461 F.2d 499; United States v. Lane, 5 Cir., 1972, 461 F.2d 343; United States v. Mather, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Leisner, 5 Cir., 1972, 469 F.2d 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-12\">. The Jury Selection and Service Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861 et seq., has now been amended to include the 18 to 21 age group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-13\">. We held this case under submission for several months considering whether we should await the determination of several cases pending in the Southern District of Florida which attacked the constitutionality of the Jury Selection Plan of that District on the same basis asserted here. However, the decisions set forth herein and especially the supervening decisions of United States v. Gooding, <em>supra, </em>and United States v. Palacio, et al., <em>supra, </em>make it unnecessary that we remand it for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
