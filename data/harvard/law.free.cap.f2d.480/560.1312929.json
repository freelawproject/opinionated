Respondents have filed no response to this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-21\">Upon review of the record filed with this Court by Petitioner it appears that Respondents failed to file timely objections to the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s Decision, as required under Section 10 (c) of the Act and under Sections 102.46 and 102.48 of the Rules and Regulations of the National Labor Relations Board, Series 8. Respondents have failed to show this Court any extraordinary circumstances which might excuse this failure, and they are therefore precluded under Section 10(c) of the Act from raising any objections to Petitioner\u2019s Order before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>It is therefore ordered that said application for summary entry of judgment enforcing Petitioner\u2019s Order be and the same is hereby granted and that said Order be and the same is hereby enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
