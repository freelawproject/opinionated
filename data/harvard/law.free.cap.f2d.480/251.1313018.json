Appellants are oyster farmers who sought to recover against appellee, the Humble Pipe Line Company, for damages to oysters, oyster reefs, and oyster leases resulting from oil emanating from one of Humble\u2019s twelve-inch pipelines submerged in Baratar\u00eda Bay off Saturday Island in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. Humble admitted the spillage had occurred but alleged that the spill was caused solely by an \u201cunknown marine vessel\u201d coming into contact with and rupturing the pipeline. The case was tried to the court, and at the conclusion of appellants\u2019 case, the United States District Judge entered comprehensive findings of fact and conclusions of law and dismissed the actions pursuant to Rule 41(b), F.R.Civ.P. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">Appellants seek to prevail under any of three alternative theories of liability, which they label (1) strict liability, (2) <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>and (3) negligence. Before analyzing the trial court\u2019s treatment of these theories, we reiterate that this is a non-jury case in which extensive findings of fact were entered below. Accordingly, any review of the application of those theories of liability must take place within the context of those factual findings, and our first inquiry must be whether those findings can withstand appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">The court below specifically found, inter alia:</p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">(1) On December 5, 1969, an oil slick occurred in the area of Saturday Island in Barataria Bay;</p>\n<p id=\"b318-17\">(2) Investigation proved that the oil slick was coming from the Humble pipeline;</p>\n<p id=\"b318-18\">(3) The pipe itself was in excellent condition;</p>\n<p id=\"b318-19\">(4) The pipeline had been constructed in accordance with a permit issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1955 and had been maintained in conformity with all requirements and specifications of the Corps;</p>\n<p id=\"b318-20\">(5) The pipeline carried only crude oil and a mixture of distillate;</p>\n<p id=\"b318-21\">(6) The leak occurred at a point near a passageway or unofficial channel that no prudent boat operator would have navigated with a vessel having a draft in excess of six feet;</p>\n<p id=\"b318-22\">(7) A 110-foot section of the pipe was damaged with parallel creases, two of which contained small ruptures through which the oil escaped;</p>\n<p id=\"b318-23\">(8) The oil leak resulted from the ruptures, which were in turn caused solely by contact with protrusions from an unknown marine vessel that plowed the mud cover off of the pipeline; and</p>\n<p id=\"b318-24\">(9) The oil leak did not result from any negligence on the part of Humble in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the placement, maintenance, or operation of the pipeline.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Thus, the District Judge concluded, albeit not <em>in haec verba, </em>that the unknown marine vessel constituted an intervening and superseding cause of the oil spill, <em>i. e., </em>that the damages were in no way caused or contributed to by any negligence on the part of Humble but were caused solely by the intervening force.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Findings of fact are measured on appellate review by the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P. <em>See also </em>McAllister v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 19, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20; United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 1948, 333 U.S. 364, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746. We have previously said of this test,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">\u201cThe question is not simply whether the reviewing court would have found otherwise but whether the trial court could permissibly find as it did. The reviewing court should upset a finding only when it \u2018is convinced on the whole record that the finding does not reflect the truth and right of the case.\u2019 Wright, Federal Courts \u00a7 96, at 432.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Movible Offshore, Inc. v. M/V Wilken A. Falgout, 5 Cir. 1973, 471 F.2d 268, 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Our scrutiny of the instant record does not leave us \u201cwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>See </em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 1948, 333 U.S; 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed.2d 746, 766; Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Jahre, 5 Cir. 1973, 472 F.2d 557 (Jan. 30, 1973). To the contrary, we find in the instant record plenteous evidence from which the trial judge could permissibly make these findings, and we reject any suggestion that these fact-findings were \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-17\">Operating within the framework of the facts as found by the trial judge, we turn now to a consideration of the trial court\u2019s disposition of the three theories of recovery advanced by appellants. First, appellants urge that this is a case in which Louisiana would apply a rule of \u201cstrict\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d liability and hold Humble liable for the damages caused by the escape of its oil regardless of negligence. Seeking to establish a liability analogous to that created in the classic case of Rylands v. Fletcher,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellants insist that the Louisiana cases applying Articles 667 through 669 of the Louisiana Civil code require that \u201cliability without fault\u201d be imposed here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of this theory, appellants argue that the defendant\u2019s activity need not be \u201cultra-hazardous,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the defendant\u2019s lack of negligence is irrelevant,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the presence of any \u201cintervening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>cause\u201d does not bar liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In reply, Humble argues that \u201cliability without fault\u201d is not a proper theory by which to hold oil companies liable to oyster-men,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that in any event the doctrine applies only where the defendant\u2019s activity is \u201cultra-hazardous,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that if negligence is lacking on the part of the defendant, \u201cintervening cause\u201d bars liability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The treacherous footing awaiting those who seek either to impose or to avoid liability for damages caused by escaping oil has generated much scholarly analysis. <em>See, e. g., </em>Keeton &amp; Jones, Tort Liability &amp; the Oil &amp; Gas Industry, 35 Texas L.Rev. 1 (1956); Keeton &amp; Jones, Tort Liability &amp; the Oil &amp; Gas Industry II, 39 Texas L.Rev. 253 (1961). <em>See also </em>Green, Hazardous Oil &amp; Gas Operations: Tort Liability, 33 Texas L. Rev. 574 (1955). It appears that Louisiana law regarding liability for oil pollution is particularly fugacious, <em>see generally </em>Robertson, Tort Liability for Oil &amp; Gas Operations in Louisiana, 14th Annual L.S.U. Institute on Mineral Law 49 (1967), but we find that we need not immerse ourselves completely in an extended review of the refinements of that jurisprudence. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that all other conditions that would call for \u201cliability without fault\u201d are present, we find that Louisiana would not impose liability where (1) the oil company was not negligent, and (2) the calamity was caused solely by a superseding and intervening event.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">The \u201cintervening cause\u201d limitation on Louisiana\u2019s doctrine of absolute liability clearly appears in Town of Jackson v. Mounger Motors, <em>supra </em>note 8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-15\">\u201cWhen the principle [of absolute liability] is applicable, strict liability results from the uses of the property which cause harm to the neighbor, the resulting damage itself constituting \u2018fault\u2019 even in the absence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>showing of negligence by the offending neighbor .... [But] it is \u2018not applicable to occurrences of an unusual nature directly occasioned by human error\u2019, especially that of an intervening stranger, Arrington v. Hearin Tank Lines, La.App. 2 Cir., 80 So.2d 167, at page 173.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">98 So.2d at 699</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">\u201cFurthermore, even when the doctrine is applicable, a recognized limitation thereof is that liability does not extend when the damage results from an independent, intervening agency which was unforeseeable by a reasonable person . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Appellants\u2019 reliance on Brantley v. Tremont &amp; G. Ry., <em>supra </em>note 5, is misplaced. In that case the defendant\u2019s activity was a <em>concurrent cause </em>with the intervening event, but Terre Haute Plantation, Inc. v. Louisiana &amp; A. Ry., <em>supra </em>note 8, firmly established that where the <em>sole cause </em>of the damage is the intervention into defendant\u2019s lawful activities of some outside agency or force, liability will not be imposed where defendant was in no way negligent in allowing or failing to prevent the intervention. Here, both the existence of such an intervening cause and the absence of any negligence on the part of Humble were found as matters of fact. Having refused to overturn those fact-findings, we hold that the trial court correctly ruled that \u201cliability without fault\u201d was thus unavailable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">Appellants\u2019 second theory of recovery rests on their argument that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>justifies pinioning liability on negligence that should have been inferred from the mere fact that an oil spill occurred. Louisiana requires that three factors be shown before this doctrine may be invoked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">\u201cIt is now well established in our jurisprudence that in order for the principle or rule of res ipsa loquitur to apply, it must be shown (1) that the circumstances attending the accident were such as to create an inference of negligence on the part of the defendant; (2) control and management of the instrumentality responsible for the damage or injury was vested exclusively in the defendant; and (3) plaintiff was not in a position to know the particular circumstances which caused the instrumentality concerned to operate to his injury whereas defendant, being in such position, possessed superior knowledge or means of information regarding the cause of the mishap. Dorman v. T. Smith &amp; Sons, 223 La. 29, 64 So.2d 833.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">Murphy Corp. v. Petrochem Maintenance, Inc., La.App.1965, 180 So.2d 716, 724. The parties devote much of their briefing to the question of whether these factors were or were not satisfied in the court below, but we need not address that issue because we find that <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>has no relevance to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">The doctrine of res <em>ipsa loquitur </em>is little more than an evidentiary technique that allows an injured person, who would not otherwise be able to do so, to show a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence. Thus, when the doctrine\u2019s initial factors are shown and defendant is the person who had exclusive control of an instrumentality that injured plaintiff in a way that ordinarily would not have occurred unless there was negligence on the part of defendant, the burden shifts to defendant to disprove the inference of negligence or to show that he did not cause the damage. <em>See </em>Watkins v. Gulf Refining Co., <em>supra </em>note 2.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Negligence is nonetheless the basis for imposing liability, Langlinais v. Geophysical Service, Inc., La.Sup.Ct.1959, 237 La. 585, 111 So.2d 781, and defendant may clearly avoid an adverse judgment by satisfying the trier of fact that his action or inaction did not cause the harm. Hoyt v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Amerada Petroleum Corp., La.App.1953, 69 So.2d 546, 547-548.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The rule is merely evidentiary, and it may be overcome either by proof that defendant was not negligent or by proof that defendant\u2019s behavior was not a cause of the injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u201cAs this court has often said, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is a rule of evidence, the applicability of which is to be determined in each case at the conclusion of the trial. When the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is applicable to a case, the accident which has caused plaintiff\u2019s damages makes out a prima facie case of negligence by the defendant, and the burden is then on the defendant to show absence of negligence on its part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Day v. National U.- S. Radiator' Corp., La.Sup.Ct.1961, 241 La. 288, 128 So.2d 660, 664. Furthermore, although it is said that the applicability of the doctrine should normally await the conclusion of the trial, e. <em>g., </em>Langlinais v. Geophysical Service, Inc., <em>swpra, </em>it ceases to apply at whatever point defendant convinces the fact-finder that defendant\u2019s negligence was not responsible. Here, the trier of fact found that (1) the negligence of an unknown marine vessel was the sole cause of the oil spill, (2) Humble was not a cause of the loss, and (3) Humble was not negligent. Those findings are not clearly erroneous and Humble has thus carried its burden of showing that it was not responsible, which it did by showing that someone else was to blame. Without suggesting what the result might be were these three fact findings not present, we hold that <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>is of no avail to appellants on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In the light of these same fact-findings, appellants\u2019 final theory of liability, ordinary negligence law, obviously must also fail. It is hornbook law that in order to recover for negligence, plaintiffs must prove that defendant was negligent. That negligence was alleged, but the trier of fact has conclusively determined that Humble was not negligent. That finding not being clearly erroneous, there the journey ends. Movible Offshore, Inc. v. M/V Wilken A. Falgout, 5 Cir. 1973, 471 F.2d 268, 272-273.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">We have considered each of appellants\u2019 remaining points of error and conclude that each is without legal merit. The fact that the oil on these troubled waters was floating from Humble\u2019s line is a raw fact that does not by itself establish tortious culpability. The trial court having thoroughly shelled the facts from the allegations, Humble\u2019s ownership of the pipe that was punctured is the only fact upon which the oystermen rely. Standing alone, it cannot shore up the factual deficiencies in this case. There is no doubt that these appellants were in fact injured through no fault of their own. But within the context of the findings of fact entered below, there is equally no doubt that appellants have failed to bring themselves within the borders of any theory that will allow them to cast the legal responsibility for those losses on Humble.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\">.
