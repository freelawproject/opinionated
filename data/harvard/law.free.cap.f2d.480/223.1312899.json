CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AAh\">Plaintiffs appeal from the district court\u2019s refusal to issue a preliminary injunction forbidding defendant, a former employee,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-26\">from soliciting orders from the same customers Garcia solicited for plaintiff for selling welding products directly competitive with those he sold for plaintiff, for a period of two years from August 13, 1971, the date of ter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>mination of Garcia\u2019s employment with plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">We reverse, for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 4, 1972 alleging that they are corporations engaged in the production and marketing of welding and soldering alloys and related products; that Garcia was hired on September 14, 1966, after entering into an employment contract<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which he agreed that for a two-year period following termination of the agreement he would not work for any competitor in the same territory he covered for American Eutectic, during the last two years of his employment and within a 50 mile radius thereof; and that he agreed to maintain Eutectic\u2019s \u201ccustomer lists and identifications\u201d and other business secrets confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Plaintiffs originally prayed for injunctive relief prohibiting Garcia from disclosing confidential customer information, from calling upon Eutectic\u2019s customers, and from employment in competition with plaintiffs for a period of two years from the date he left Eutectic. However, on April 27, 1972, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, limited to the narrower issue of enjoining Garcia from soliciting customers as set forth above. The defendant opposed the motion on its merits and moved to dismiss the complaint. The matter was submitted on a record consisting of the pleadings, affidavits, depositions, and live testimony at a hearing held May 31, 1972. The district court, 353 F.Supp. 850, rendered its decision some seven months later, denying \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment requesting a preliminary or permanent injunction\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>and also denying \u201cdefendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment requesting a dismissal.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appealed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u2022 1292(a) from \u201cthe Order denying Preliminary Injunction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The defendant, Garcia, was hired by Eutectic on September 14, 1966 as a salesman of welding materials. He was by then an experienced salesman, having worked in 1961 for Sears, Roebuck at Santurce selling household appliances, then for a Mr. Otero as a razor salesman, and finally for E. Leon &amp; Company as a salesman of building materials. After a three-week training period at Eutectic\u2019s New York office, he returned to Puerto Rico and began selling Eutectic\u2019s products in the Northeast area.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Garcia was given a number of \u201ccustomer cards\u201d containing the names of Eutectic customers and additional data such as whom to contact, what the customer had previously ordered, and what the customer\u2019s special needs were. In the course of his employment, Garcia made periodic calls upon Eutectic customers to sell the company\u2019s welding products and to consult with and advise customers on welding problems. In this manner, he gained an intimate knowledge of the customer\u2019s needs and specialized requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In 1968 Garcia was promoted to District Supervisor. He was then responsible for Eutectic\u2019s sales throughout Puerto Rico. He supervised two other salesmen, to whom he distributed all his customer cards except the most lucrative 20%; these he continued to service personally. In January 1971, Garcia became Regional Manager. Although his duties remained essentially what they had been as District Supervisor, Garcia was the highest-ranking Eutectic employee in Puerto Rico, with three salesmen under him.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">On August 13, 1971, Garcia resigned from Eutectic to join a competitor, Anibal L. Arsuaga, Inc.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As an ALA welding salesman, he now calls upon a substantial number of former Eutectic customers and undersells his former employer. Although Eutectic\u2019s sales in Puerto Rico had not declined eight months after Garcia began working for ALA, plaintiffs fear that Eutectic\u2019s sales will decline in the future because Garcia will take more and more of his former customers to ALA; Eutectic is exposed to a loss of customer goodwill due to Garcia\u2019s defection; and confidential data such as Eutectic\u2019s pricing policies will be used to benefit the competition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">The party challenging a denial of a preliminary injunction \u201cmust show either a clear error of law or an abuse of discretion by the district court in denying the injunction.\u201d Automatic Radio Mfg. Co. v. Ford Motor Company, 390 F.2d 113, 115 (1st Cir. 1968), cert. denied 391 U.S. 914, 88 S.Ct. 1807, 20 L. Ed.2d 653 (1968). Appellants have, in our judgment, made such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">The terms of the contract provide that it is to be governed by the law of New York. Under New York law, as under the law generally prevailing in the United States, a restrictive employment covenant is enforceable to the extent reasonable,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201c[W] ill generally be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>found to be reasonable where it simply protects the legitimate interests of the employer, imposes no undue hardship on the employee, and is not injurious to the public.\u201d Solari Industries, Inc. v. Malady, 55 N.J. 571, 264 A.2d 53, 56 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">The instant case presents a near-classic situation for enforcement. <em>See </em>Restatement of Agency, 2d \u00a7 396, Illustration 1, p. 224; Service Systems Corp. v. Harris, <em>supra. </em>Defendant salesman, having obtained an intimate knowledge of Eutectic\u2019s customers and their needs in the course of his employment, is exploiting his knowledge for the benefit of a competitor in violation of contract. Limited in duration, the restriction sought to be enforced would not prevent him from using his skills as a salesman, except to the narrow extent needed to protect Eutectic from obviously unfair competition. Whether the full range of restrictions in the contract are reasonable need not concern us. The only issue is the reasonableness of the requested injunction; even an overly-broad covenant is enforceable to the limited extent reasonable. Karpinski v. Ingrasci, supra; Premier Industrial Corporation v. Texas Industrial Fastener Company, <em>supra; </em>Solari Industries, Inc. v. Malady, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The only aspect of the court\u2019s opinion requiring more extended consideration is its ruling that, although New York law is otherwise applicable, the public policy of the forum, as expressed in Article II \u00a7 16 of the Constitution of Puerto Rico,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> precludes relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\"> Puerto Rico is not bound by the policies of other jurisdictions, and we give great weight to the district court\u2019s interpretation of its constitution. But we discover no facial inconsistency between the language of Article II \u00a7 16 and the narrow relief here sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">Plaintiffs merely ask that for a limited time Garcia not solicit orders for competing products from the same customers he solicited while working for them. It was through his employment with Eutectic that Garcia became familiar not only with its customers but with its prices and products, and was thus placed in a particularly advantageous position both to undersell Eutectic and woo its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">We are unaware of any Puerto Rico authority construing the constitutional \u201cright of every employee to choose his occupation freely and to resign therefrom\u201d as guaranteeing to employees a right to disregard employment contracts prohibiting misuse for a limited period of time of customer contacts obtained during former employment. By way of analogy, the even more sweeping language of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution is not thought to confer a right to publish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>book copyrighted by another. One might suppose that Article II \u00a7 16 of the Constitution of Puerto Rico merely enunciates a principle analogous to the common law rule set forth in Wilson v. Clarke, 470 F.2d 1218, 1221 (1st Cir. 1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">Bargains between employers and employees which place restrictions upon an employee\u2019s exercise of a gainful occupation after leaving the employer are, and were at common law considered to be, void as in restraint of trade. Restatement of Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 513-515. Sherman v. Pfefferkorn, et al., 241 Mass. 468, 474, 135 N.E. 568, 570 (1922). Exceptions are made, however, if the restriction is reasonable, \u201cand not wider than is necessary for the protection to which the employer is entitled . . ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Any doubt we might have whether Puerto Rico has adopted this \u201crule of reason\u201d is resolved by the case of Oliver Exterminating Services Corp. v. Felix Garcia Franco, (Superior Court of Puerto Rico, San Juan Part, Civil 63-5032, decided January 27, 1965), writ of revision denied by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, April 12, 1965 in case R-65-37.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In <em>Oliver, </em>the employee held a university degree in civil engineering, and had taken graduate courses relating to the control of insects and rodents. After nineteen years with the Health Department as a sanitary engineer, he left government service and obtained employment as the general manager of an exterminating firm. He was in constant touch with the firm\u2019s clients, and utilized liis contacts at the Health Department to the advantage of his firm. After an unsuccessful attempt to buy out his employer, he attempted to recruit some of his fellow-workers to staff a new, competitive firm which he was planning to organize. He subsequently became President of this new corporation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">As soon as Garcia presented his resignation, he contacted numerous clients of his former employer, informing them that he was now actually offering his services to Puerto Rico Exterminating Co., Inc., asking them to cancel their old contracts and. sign new contracts with the firm for which he was working. Many of these clients showed themselves to be receptive to Garcia\u2019s insinuations, cancelled their old contracts and became clients of the new corporation. Also, one of the employees of Exterminating Services of Puerto Rico, Inc. abandoned his employer and followed Garcia to the new organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">In upholding a restrictive clause in the employment agreement forbidding the employee from directly or indirectly approaching the firm\u2019s clients to sell them services related to extermination and from working in any form of the extermination business in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, Judge Moreda stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">As a general rule, these clauses are valid if same prove to be reasonable. Reasonable as far as the employer, with regard to the employee and with respect to the public in general.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Judge Moreda listed some 46 factors which might be considered in deciding if an employment restriction were reasonable. Examining these factors and applying them to the undisputed facts of the present case, we conclude that the restrictions sought to be enforced are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">The relief sought is limited to what is reasonably necessary for the protection of Eutectic\u2019s legitimate business interests. Although Garcia\u2019s employment contract forbade him from working for any firm which dealt in competitive products, the requested preliminary injunction would merely prevent him from soliciting welding orders competitive with Eutectic\u2019s product line from customers he had called on for Eutectic. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Garcia could solicit others,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or since ALA deals in many other product lines, Garcia could continue to work for ALA selling non-welding materials. As a further alternative, with his extensive sales experience he could work as a salesman for another concern. As Judge Moreda observed in <em>Oliver:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">Though he may suffer some inconveniences, there is no founded fear that we may be condemning him to hunger and misery and the danger does not exist that he would become a social burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">We similarly believe that the plaintiffs have proven that if the injunction is not conceded their business would suffer irreparable damage upon revealing that the defendant has tried and is continuously trying to take their clients, having been successful in various occasions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\"> It is immaterial that the defendant was not shown to have \u201cdivulged trade secrets or confidential information,\u201d or that he was \u201cprivy to any confidential data\u201d (other than its customers cards and lists). No showing of such wider harm, nor of executive-suite intrigue, was needed to warrant the injunction sought, preventing Garcia, for a relatively short time, from using his knowledge of Eutectic\u2019s customers to Eutectic\u2019s disadvantage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Eutectic does not have to submit to irreparable harm before it can obtain preventive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">This proceeding was brought on February 4, 1972. It was taken under advisement by the district court on June 15, 1972. For reasons unclear no opinion on the issue of preliminary relief was rendered until January of 1973. If plaintiffs are to win anything but a phyrric victory, they must receive relief without further delay. We remand with instructions to issue a preliminary injunction forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">Not later than one month after the date of this opinion, the district court shall hold a further hearing and shall determine whether or not, under all the circumstances, the continuation of injunctive relief beyond August 13, 1973 is warranted under principles stated in Premier Industrial Corporation v. Texas Industrial Fastener Company, 450 F.2d 444, 448 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">.
