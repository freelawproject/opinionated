Both appeals revolve around the same basic question \u2014 whether compliance with Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure constitutes \u201ccommencement of an action\u201d sufficient to toll the South Dakota statute of limitations. Plaintiffs brought an action to recover for personal injuries incurred on October 5, 1968, while operating a Volkswagen on a South Dakota highway. The defendants were the manufacturer, Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft; the importer, Volkswagen of America, Inc.; and the regional distributor, Import Motors of Chicago, Inc. The complaint was filed on October 4, 1971, one day prior to the running of the South Dakota statute of limitations, in the office of the clerk of the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota. However, the defendants were not personally served with process until after the applicable statute of limitations had run. Each of the defendants moved for summary judgment alleging that the period of limitations had not been tolled by the filing of the complaint in the federal district court. For under South Dakota law an action is \u201ccommenced\u201d when either the summons is served on the defendant or the summons is delivered to the sheriff with the intent that it actually be served.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>knowledged that if the action could be deemed \u201ccommenced\u201d under the federal rules the applicable period of the statute of limitations would be tolled. However, the trial court felt bound by Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &amp; Warehouse Co., 337 U.S. 530, 69 S.Ct. 1233, 93 L.Ed. 1520 (1949), and Groninger v. Davison, 364 F.2d 638 (8 Cir. 1966),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and granted summary judgment to Volkswagen of America and Import Motors, 347 F. Supp. 129. The court denied Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that Rule 4(i) (1), Fed.R.Civ.P., governed service on the foreign corporation and since South Dakota had no comparable provision for such service, the filing of the complaint tolled the statute against this foreign corporation. In denying the motion, the district court granted a certificate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) enabling Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft to appeal along with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">We find that Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs both appeals and order the reinstatement of the action against all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">The <em>Ragan </em>case involved a diversity suit brought to recover damages for personal injuries occurring in Kansas. The complaint was filed within the applicable Kansas statute of limitations. However, the summons was not served on the defendant until after the time period had expired. The Kansas statute of limitations provided that an action would be deemed commenced at the time the summons was served. The Supreme Court held that even though the plaintiff had complied with Rule 3 of the Federal rules, the action was nevertheless barred. The Court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-8\">\u201cWhere local law qualifies or abridges it, the federal court must follow suit. Otherwise there is a different measure of the cause of action in one court than in the other, and the principle of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins is transgressed.\u201d Ragan v. Merchants Transfer Co., 337 U.S. at 533, 69 S.Ct. at 1235.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">Some sixteen years later in Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965), the Court was faced with a direct conflict between Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(1) and a state law governing service of process. A diversity suit -was timely filed in the Massachusetts federal district court. Service of process was made pursuant to Rule 4(d)(1) by leaving copies of the summons and complaint with the defendant\u2019s wife at his residence. The defendant urged that the action should be dismissed since the service of process was contrary to state law which required \u201cin hand\u201d delivery of the summons to the defendant. The federal district court, relying on <em>Ragan </em>and Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945), granted summary judgment to the defendant. On appeal the Supreme Court reversed. This time the Court did not apply the state law and through Chief Justice Warren wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-10\">\u201c[I]t cannot be forgotten that the <em>Erie </em>rule, and the guidelines suggested in <em>York, </em>were created to serve another purpose altogether. To hold that a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure must cease to function whenever it alters the mode of enforcing state-created rights would be to disembowel either the Constitution\u2019s grant of power over federal procedure or Congress\u2019 attempt to exercise that power in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Enabling Act.\u201d Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. at 473-474, 85 S.Ct. at 1145.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Some courts have taken umbrage in the <em>Hanna </em>language to believe that <em>Ragan </em>was overruled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Several commentators have joined in this belief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Other courts, such as our own, have disagreed and under circumstances on all fours with <em>Ragan </em>have reluctantly felt compelled to apply the law of <em>Ragan</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Undoubtedly the total demise of <em>Ragan </em>would not sadden anyone \u2014 perhaps only because of the harshness of the rule to the individual case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">However, it is not the prerogative of this court to overrule <em>Ragan. </em>And there should be little doubt as to the verity of Judge Vogel\u2019s observation in <em>Groninger: Hanna </em>did not overrule <em>Ragan. </em>The Supreme Court, although perhaps tenuously in the eyes of many, still sought to distinguish <em>Ragan </em>in <em>Hanna. </em>The Court made direct reference to the fact that <em>Ragan </em>did not involve a federal rule as broad as the state rule with which it purportedly clashed,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 380 U.S. at 470, 85 5. Ct. 1136, and the Court additionally observed that following Rule 4(d)(1) did not involve, as it did in <em>Ragan, </em>\u201ca situation where application of the state rule would wholly bar recovery . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 85 S.Ct. at 1143. Thus we reaffirm, as we did in <em>Groninger, </em>that for us to ignore <em>Ragan </em>would abdicate our trust as an inferior federal court bound by higher law. However, contrary to the defendants\u2019 urging, this does not conclude the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-16\">It is recalled that <em>Hanna </em>distinguished <em>Ragan </em>on the ground that Federal Rule 3 was not broad enough to cover the particular problem involved in <em>Ragan. </em>Federal Rule 3 does not attempt to specify that filing tolls the controlling statute of limitations. On the other hand the Kansas statute in <em>Ragan </em>did specifically address itself to the manner of tolling the period of limitations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>The significance of this relates to our reading of <em>Ragan </em>that Rule 3 was not controlling since the Kansas commencement of action statute was so intimately bound up with the rights and obligations created by the state statute of limitations that the state law governed under <em>Erie </em>principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">In this regard, the <em>Ragan </em>Court specifically considered the fact that under Kansas law the commencement of actions was an integral part of the statute of limitations. <em>Ragan, supra, </em>337 U.S. at 532, 534, 69 S.Ct. 1233, 93 L.Ed. 1520. In the instant case it is urged that the South Dakota statute on commencement of action is <em>not </em>an integral part of the statute of limitations. Although contained in the same chapter along with the statute of limitations,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the South Dakota statute defining when an action is commenced does not refer to the limitations statute. We deem it significant that the South Dakota Supreme Court has held that the commencement of actions statute is a general statute. Thus in Taylor v. McCarty, 68 S.D. 510, 4 N.W.2d 816, 817-818 (1942), the South Dakota Supreme Court specifically observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-6\">\u201cSDC 33.0202 [commencement of action statute] appears as part of a chapter of our Code dealing with the limitations of actions. Similar provisions have been construed by other courts as only fixing the time of commencement of the action for the purpose of applying the statute of limitations. See Wait\u2019s New York Practice Simplified, 4th Ed., Vol. 1, p. 717; H. L. Spencer Co. v. Koell, 91 Minn. 226, 97 N.W. 974. However, in the case of Tabour Realty Co. v. Nelson, et al., 56 S.D. 405, 228 N.W. 807, the quoted statute was interpreted as a rule of general application in fixing the commencement of actions. That interpretation has been adopted by the Legislature through enactment of the South Dakota Code of 1939 (In re Gooder\u2019s Estate, S.D., [68 S.D. 415], 3 N.W.2d 478), and we are not at liberty to reconsider its construction.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">Even though one may conclude that the South Dakota commencement statute is not an integral part of that state\u2019s statute of limitations, the question remains whether this should constitute a material difference. The defendants urge that it does not since <em>Ragan </em>stressed that \u201cwhere one is barred from recovery in the state court, he should likewise be barred in the federal court,\u201d 337 U.S. at 532, 69 S.Ct. at 1234, and consequently, it is immaterial whether or not the \u201ccommencement\u201d provision was or was not intended to be an integral part of the statute of limitations. Cf. 2 Moore, Federal Practice \u00a7 3.07[4.-3-l] at 779 (2d ed. 1970).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-11\">In applying <em>Ragan </em>and its analysis of <em>Erie </em>and <em>Guaranty Trust, </em>we adhere to Chief Justice Warren\u2019s admonition in <em>Hanna </em>that the \u201cout-come determination\u201d test cannot be read without reference to the twin-aims of Erie: (1) discouragement of forum shopping and (2) avoidance of inequitable admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>istration of the laws. 380 U.S. at 468, 85 S.Ct. 1136.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">When Federal Rule 3 and the South Dakota commencement statute are examined as \u201chousekeeping rules\u201d it is obvious that we are dealing only with a <em>mode </em>of enforcing state-created rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is little or no encroachment on state policy when we adopt one rule over the other. The <em>manner </em>in which the tolling statute operates is primarily designed to put litigants on notice that suit is being filed. As Justice Black observed in Goldlawr, Inc. v. Heiman, 369 U.S. 463, 467, 82 S.Ct. 913, 916, 8 L.Ed. 2d 39 (1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-5\">\u201cWhen a lawsuit is filed, that filing shows a desire on the part of the plaintiff to begin his case and thereby toll whatever statutes of limitation would otherwise apply. The filing itself shows the proper diligence on the part of the plaintiff which such statutes of limitation were intended to insure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">When considered in this light there is little likelihood that the federal rule would cause a plaintiff to choose the federal court. Compare Byrd v. Blue Ridge Cooperative, Inc., 356 U.S. 525, 536-540, 78 S.Ct. 893, 2 L.Ed.2d 953 (1958). Under South Dakota law, at the time of filing the complaint in federal court the limitation period was still running in the state court. Cf. Sylvestri v. Warner &amp; Swasey Co., 398 F.2d 598, 606 (2 Cir. 1968). All that was necessary under state law to toll the statute would have been to deliver the summons to the sheriff in the county wherein the defendant corporations were doing business with the intent that the summons actually be served within sixty days. See SDCL Ann. \u00a7 15-2-31. Surely this additional act is not so substantial to motivate the plaintiff to choose one forum over another. As has often been said, federal diversity actions can never be identic to those carried out in state form. See Atkins v. Schmutz Manufacturing Company, 435 F.2d 527, 536 (4 Cir. 1970). However, even where the facts might favor the choice of the federal forum, pragmatism requires recognition of Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s observation that \u201clitigants often choose a federal forum merely to obtain what they consider the advantages of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or to try their cases before a supposedly more favorable judge.\u201d Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. at 475, 85 S.Ct. at 1146, 14 L.Ed.2d 8. Moreover, we note that <em>Erie </em>was borne out of the equal protection problems generated in Swift v. Tyson, 41 U.S. (16 Pet) 1, 10 L.Ed. 865 (1842).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This constitutional concern was intrinsically coupled with the vital recognition of the necessary bridling of encroaching federalism in areas of state policy. As Mr. Justice Harlan stated, the primary concern in <em>Erie </em>was the choice of rule which \u201cwould substantially affect those primary decisions respecting human conduct which our constitutional system leaves to state regulation.\u201d Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. at 475, 85 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>1146.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Supreme Court in Byrd v. Blue Ridge Cooperative, Inc., 356 U.S. 525, 78 S.Ct. 893, 2 L.Ed.2d 953 (1958), lent further explication to this principle. An injured workman sued in tort in federal court and the defendant pleaded immunity because the plaintiff allegedly was a statutory employee under workmen\u2019s compensation law. The basic issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled in federal court to have the factual issue presented to a jury or following state law, tried solely to a judge. Mr. Justice Brennan observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-5\">\u201cWe find nothing to. suggest that this rule [that the defense immunity of a statutory employer was a matter to be decided by the court] was announced as an integral part of the special relationship created by the statute. Thus the requirement appears to be merely a form and mode of enforcing the immunity . . . and not a rule intended to be bound up with the definition of the rights and obligations of the parties.\u201d Byrd v. Blue Ridge, 356 U.S. at 536, 78 S.Ct. at 900.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">The defendants have not pointed to, nor have we found, any state policy expressed in South Dakota similar to that found by the court of appeals in Merchants Transfer &amp; Warehouse Co. v. Ragan, 170 F.2d 987 (10 Cir. 1948), where the Kansas statute of limitations was construed to be integrated with the rule relating to commencement of actions. Cf. Isaacks v. Jeffers, 144 F.2d 25 (10 Cir. 1944), cert, denied, 323 U.S. 781, 65 S.Ct. 270, 89 L.Ed. 624. Consequently, application of Rule 3 to the South Dakota statute of limitations does not alter \u201cthe mode of enforcement of state-created rights in a fashion sufficiently \u2018substantial\u2019 to raise the sort of equal protection problems to which the <em>Erie </em>opinion alluded.\u201d Hanna v. Plumer, <em>supra, </em>380 U.S. at 469, 85 S.Ct. at 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">We conclude that it is only when a state legislates a rule regarding the commencement of action as an integral part of the statute of limitations that a state policy making a mode of enforcing a state-created right intrinsically material to the right involved becomes clearly discernible and substantial. It is only then that <em>Erie </em>principles as set forth in <em>Ragan </em>must govern the litigation. Cf. Cities Service Oil Co. v. Dunlap, 308 U.S. 208, 212, 60 S.Ct. 201, 84 L.Ed. 196 (1939).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>Having found SDCL Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 15-2-30 and 15-2-31 not to be so intrinsically related to the rights flowing from the state statute of limitations, we conclude that pursuant to the dictates of Hanna v. Plumer, <em>supra, </em>Rule 3 must control the manner of tolling the statute of limitations. In accord, Chappell v. Rouch, 448 F.2d 446 (10 Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">The judgment in 72-1625 is reversed and the actions are ordered reinstated; the judgment in 72-1670 is affirmed for the reasons stated herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">.

Southern Pacific Co., 283 U.S. 91, [51 S.Ct. 383, 75 L.Ed. 857]. \u2018When, because the plaintiff happens to be a non-resident, such a right is enforceable in a federal as well as in a State court, the forms and mode of enforcing the right may at times, naturally enough, vary because the two judicial systems are not identic.\u2019 Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, <em>supra, </em>326 U.S. at 108, [65 S.Ct. at 1469] ; Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 555 [69 S.Ct. 1221, 3229, 93 L.Ed. 1528].\u201d Hanna v.

The concern of <em>Erie </em>was with discrimination against citizen-defendants. <em>Rag-an </em>similarly involved a citizen-defendant. Here, however, as in Sylvestri v. Warner &amp; Swasey Co., 398 F.2d at 606, we are dealing with non-resident defendants and it is difficult to assess any discrimination against the citizen-plaintiffs by reason of allowing the action to proceed in the federal court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">. Thus, even by here applying Buie 3 the federal court is still governed by the time-periods' set forth in the state statute of limitations. See Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">. Of course, the troublesome question is what difference does it make whether a state reads two rules together to reach a given result or legislates one rule which embodies the two to reach the same result. We recognize merit to Professor Moore\u2019s criticism of the approach taken here. See 2 Moore, Federal Practice \u00a7 3.07 [4.-3-1] at 779 (2d ed. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">Yet we think his <em>Erie </em>answer based on \u201coutcome\u201d too simplistic in view of <em>Byrd </em>and <em>Hanna. </em>It would have caused less consternation to all if Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s views in <em>Hanna </em>would have been adopted by the majority, but the fact remains they were not. In <em>Hanna </em>the Court recited language of the Fifth Circuit which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">\u201c \u2018One of the shaping purposes of the Federal Buies is to bring about uniformity in the federal courts by getting away from local rules. This is especially true of matters which relate to the administration of legal proceedings, an area in which federal courts have traditionally exerted strong inherent power, completely aside from the powers Congress expressly conferred in the Bules. The purpose of the <em>Erie </em>doctrine, even as extended in <em>York </em>and <em>Ragan, </em>was never to bottle up federal courts with \u201coutcome-determinative\u201d and \u201cintegral-relations\u201d stoppers \u2014 when there are \u201caffirmative countervailing [federal] considerations\u201d and when there is a Congressional mandate (the Buies) supported by constitutional authority.\u2019 Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co. v. Wright, 322 F.2d 759, 764 (C.A. 5th Cir. 1963).\u201d 380 U.S. at 472-473, 85 S.Ct. at 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-16\">Thus, perhaps our approach runs counter to the \u201cintegral-relations\u201d stoppers con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>cern of the Fifth Circuit. However, to adopt this reasoning in the present case without further analysis would require us to say that <em>Manna </em>overruled <em>Ragm, </em>which, as we have said, we refuse to do. Nevertheless, we feel a determination must be made in every case as to whether the state has taken a rule of practice and substantially intertwined that rule with the basic right of recovery. When this is so, the rule cannot be viewed as affecting only the mode of relief, and the \u201ccountervailing considerations\u201d of a desired uniform practice in a federal court must yield to \u201cthe policy of uniform enforcement of state-created rights and obligations.\u201d Cf. Byrd v. Blue Ridge, <em>supra, </em>356 U.S. at 537-538, 78 S.Ct. at 901.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
