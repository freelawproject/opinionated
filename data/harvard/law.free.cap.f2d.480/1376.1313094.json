The appealed claims are directed to both method and apparatus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-21\">In the analysis apparatus a chemical reagent is automatically added to each discrete liquid sample to produce a color reaction indicative of the partic\u00falar constituent in the sample to be tested, and the samples with the intervening portions of segmentizing medium are passed through the sight passageway of a flow cell as a continuous stream. The sight passageway forms part of a colorimetric analysis apparatus. Leading segments of the liquid samples, which are arranged in duplicate one following another, perform, along with the segmentizing medium, a cleansing function and each following segment has a volume at least equal to that of the sight passageway. When the sight passageway of the flow cell is fully occupied by the liquid sample to be analyzed, a recorder for the analysis, which receives its input from the colorimeter, is made operational.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-22\">Representative claims, for the purpose of dealing with the rejections, are as follows (emphasis ours):</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-23\">34.

Appellants admit, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>the prior art of record establishes, that the <em>general </em>apparatus for performing appellants\u2019 method invention is known. Appellants contend, however, that the prior art apparatus and method always provided for what is called \u201cventing\u201d of the segmentizing medium, or \u201cdebubbling,\u201d just prior to passing the successive liquid samples through the sight passageway in the flow cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-5\">Although there is some dispute about the teachings of the Skeggs \u2019149 patent, the general nature of the invention and the prior art practice of venting or debubbling is illustrated by reference to a portion of Fig. 3 of that patent:</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-7\">Skeggs \u2019149 discloses automatic apparatus adaptable to blood analysis having sample-feeding apparatus similar to appellants\u2019.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Liquid samples flowing through a tube in a continuous stream, the samples being separated in the tube by air as a segmentizing medium, are supplied to a colorimeter, which, with a recorder, translates color changes into a record of the amount of a given ingredient in each sample. On the way to the colorimeter a reagent is mixed with each sample to produce a color reaction which can be measured by the colorimeter. The reagent-treated samples with the segmentizing medium, air, interspersed therebetween, together flow as a segmented liquid stream \u201cinto a fluid line 70 leading to a transparent plastic flow cell 71 provided with an <em>open chamber.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.) \u201cA communicating duct 73 leads from the lower end of <em>open chamber 72 </em>to a horizontal cylindrical passage 74\u201d (emphasis ours) wherein the photometric analysis is performed by recording the variations in light received by the phototube from the light source 32. Venting of the segmentizing air medium from the stream is claimed in claim 10 of Skeggs \u2019149. The open chamber 72 in the above figure is the point at which this venting takes place. Presumably the dots shown in the open chamber are the draftsman\u2019s way of representing rising bubbles of the segmentizing medium, which is a gas entrained in a liquid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-10\">Relating this to the invention here, appellants\u2019 discovery is that it is desirable to <em>omit </em>the prior art step of venting the air or other gas, i. e., \u201cdebubbling\u201d the segmented stream of fluid samples. Appellants argue that they were the first to discover the advantages of omitting the debubbling step. They contend that the prior art cited by the Patent Office nowhere suggests that venting or debubbling can be dispensed with.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-11\">Appellants\u2019 brief explains the advantages of not debubbling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1445-12\">2. Prior to the invention of Appellants, it was generally the practice to vent or \u201cdebubble\u201d the segmentizing medium just prior to passing the successive liquid sample [s] through a sight passageway included in the flow cell. * * * The practice of such venting or \u201cdebubbling\u201d resulted in the leading and trailing portions of adjacent liquid samples becoming contiguous. As a result, intermixing <em>occurred </em>between such contiguous portions or successive liquid samples while passing from the \u201cdebubbling\u201d apparatus. The passage of such intermixed portions resulted in contamination of the sight passageway of the flow cell. To alleviate the problem an uncontaminated portion of a successive adjacent liquid sample, therefore, had to be passed to \u201cwash\u201d the sight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>passageway before meaningful analysis could be effected on the remaining uncontaminated portion of such successive samples. As a result, the processing rate of the liquid samples was limited and, also, the initial volume of a liquid sample required for analysis was excessive. These limitations of the prior art apparatuses were due directly to the intermixing of successive liquid samples when moving between the \u201cdebubbler\u201d portion of the apparatus and through the sight passageway of the flow cell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1446-4\">3. The present invention overcomes these prior art limitations and provides for a substantially increased processing rate and, also, a significant reduction in the initial volume of samples required for analysis. These results are achieved by maintaining the integrity of the individual liquid samples in the continuous stream while passing through the sight passageway of the flow cell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1446-5\">With this as background, we continue with a description of the other Skeggs reference, \u2019141.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-6\">The question with respect to Skeggs \u2019141 is whether or not it discloses venting. The Patent Office view is that no venting is shown. We disagree. The following portion of Fig. 8 shows the flow cell and related parts. It is described as a \u201cdiagrammatic representation\u201d :</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-8\">We agree with the solicitor that the stream passing through line 218 is an air-segmented liquid stream. The question is whether the flow cell 220 is so constructed as to vent the air from the stream before the sample is analyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-10\">Skeggs \u2019141 contains, in addition to what the above drawing shows, the following statement (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJF\">The colored mixture flows into the flow cell 220, <em>which preferably is of the type illustrated and claimed in the copending application of Andres Ferrari, Jr., </em>Serial No. 516,300, filed June 17, 1955, and assigned to the assignee hereof. The flow cell 220 is mounted in a holder 226 provided with a light passageway 228 having a constricted opening 230 adjacent one arm of the flow cell 220. Light passing from the light source 232 through the restricted light aperture 230 is transmitted through the colored mixture in the flow cell 220 to a photoelectric device or photo tube 234.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1446-11\">Does this disclose a vented flow cell, though no venting is mentioned in the above quotation ? We think it does. Appellants have not conclusively wrapped up their proofs as they might have because, as correctly noted by the solicitor, they did not include the Ferrari patent in the record in this court, but their brief points out that the Ferrari application is now patent No. 2,983,184, issued May 9, 1961, and they quote from the disclosure of this patent, which is incorporated by reference into Skeggs \u2019141, as follows (omissions and insertions ours for clarity):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1446-12\">* * * as the dialyzate is discharged * * * into [the] flow cell * * *, the air present between adjacent segments of said dialyzate freely escapes into the atmosphere since [the] inlet opening * * * of said cell is open thereto. Thus it will be apparent that no air can be trapped into the liquid column * * * which is subjected to the light beam.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1446-16\">We do not consider that this disclosure, incorporated into Skeggs \u2019141, is to be ignored merely because the Ferrari patent has not been included in the record in this court. There is no reason to doubt the accuracy of appellants\u2019 quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>tion from Ferrari. We note particularly two factors indicating its reliability: it is consistent with Seggs \u2019141 Fig. 8 and it has not been challenged by the solicitor who had ready access to the Ferrari patent. Furthermore, the same allegations of venting in the flow cell of Skeggs \u2019141 were made before the board, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-5\">The flow cell 220 is of the type more particularly described in the A. Ferrari, Jr. patent No. 2,983,184, filed on July 15, 1955 * * * The flow cell 220 includes an open ended, or vented, mixing chamber wherein the continuous stream of liquid samples directed along conduits 216 and 218 is discharged, so as to purposefully vent the air bubbles. The liquid samples, now contiguous, intermix * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A72\">We simply have to disagree with the board\u2019s conclusions that \u201cSkeggs T41 does not mention the venting present in Skeggs \u2019149\u201d and that \u201cThe drawing in Skeggs \u2019141 does not appear to require such venting.\u201d These statements are inconsistent with the whole disclosure of Skeggs \u2019141, which includes the description of the structure of the Ferrari flow cell, \u201cdiagrammatically\u201d shown in Fig. 8, incorporated by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-6\">Obviousness of an unvented system as claimed by appellants therefore cannot be predicated on the disclosures of the specifications of Skeggs \u2019149 or \u2019141. The board admitted that venting is \u201cpresent in Skeggs \u2019149.\u201d The board and the solicitor are clearly wrong in suggesting that the flow cell of Skeggs \u2019141 is unvented. One other basis for finding obviousness is argued, predicated on a difference which exists between claims 9 and 10 of Skeggs '149. Claim 10 reads (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-7\">10. Apparatus for analyzing liquid samples containing a crystalloid constituent and a noncrystalloid constituent, <em>comprising </em>a dialyzer having a diaphragm and an inlet and an outlet at one side of the diaphragm for the passage of a stream of sample-containing liquid through the dialyzer at said side of the diaphragm, said dialyzer also having an inlet and an outlet at the other side of said diaphragm for the\u2019passage of streams of liquid into and out of the dialyzer at said other side of the diaphragm to form a stream of liquid containing the crystalloid substance which is diffused through the diaphragm from said first mentioned side thereof means for treating the liquid of said last mentioned stream for colorimetric analysis thereof, a colorimeter flow-cell to receive the treated liquid, tubes leading to and from the dialyzer for conducting the liquids to and from the dialyzer and to the flow-cell and means for introducing air into the tubes leading to the dialyzer for forming segmented streams of fluid composed of alternate segments of liquid and air passing through said tubes and the dialyzer and through the connections of the latter to said flow-cell, <em>and a vent for the escape of the air from said stream of treated liquid received in said flow-cell whereby an uninterrupted column of liquid is provided in the cell for colorimetric analysis of said liquid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1447-9\">Claim 9 of the patent is substantially identical down to the emphasized clause, which is omitted in claim 9. Based on this difference, and a similar omission of venting in other claims such as 20 and 22, the Patent Office argues that <em>a comparison of claims</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-10\">* * * would clearly suggest to the plant engineer that the flow of segmented streams \u201cto said flow cell\u201d encompasses flow thereof through such cell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1447-12\">We cannot agree. We do not believe that, either as an abstract principie or as applied to the facts of this case, the omission of the vent in one or more claims of Skeggs \u2019149 coupled with the inclusion of the vent in another claim itself would suggest to one skilled in the art and that venting may be dispensed with. The specification of Skeggs \u2019149 just does not support such a construction; the air-segmented stream \u201cpasses into a fluid line 70 leading to a trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>parent plastic flow cell 71 <em>provided with an open chamber 72 </em>(Emphasis ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-5\">As to the major part of the argument of the solicitor, we do not find the difference between claims 9 and 10 to suggest or indicate to one of ordinary skill in the art that \u201cthe flow cell in question can at the option of the designer or \u2018plant engineer\u2019 be vented or not.\u201d The practice, time out of mind, has been that claims may be drafted as broadly as the prior art will allow, and that appears to be all that Skeggs has done in patent '149. The mere omission of claim limitations does not suggest omission of steps or parts. Furthermore, claim 9 still reads on apparatus containing venting means because of the word \u201ccomprising.\u201d In re Halley, 296 F.2d 774, 49 CCPA 793 (1961); Swain v. Crittendon, 332 F.2d 820, 51 CCPA 1459 (1964). Compare the discussion of reliance upon the <em>absence </em>of limitations in claims in another context in In re Cole, 326 F.2d 769, 51 CCPA 919 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-6\">Accordingly the rejection of claims 34, 37-40, 42, 43, and 48-50 under \u00a7 103 is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-7\">\n<em>The \u00a7112 Rejections</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AEvr\">\u201cInert Fluid\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-8\">Claims 34, 37-40, 43, and 44 describe the segmentizing medium as an \u201cinert fluid.\u201d The board affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection of these claims saying, \u201cAs to the * * * term [fluid], the specification provides no antecedent basis or description of such fluids and therefore does not support the claims.\u201d The board noted that \u201cadditional structure is necessary to'adapt the disclosed contribution to employ fluids other than air.\u201d Th'e board further noted that the term \u201cfluid\u201d is \u201cso broad as to include inoperative fluids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-10\">The solicitor states that the \u201cBoard\u2019s rationale makes it clear that it regarded 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, paragraph 1 as the proper statutory basis of its rejection,\u201d and particularly argues that appellants fail to <em>describe </em>their invention in their specification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The solicitor, explaining the basis of this rejection on the facts of this case, takes the position that \u201cwhere the description of the invention is narrower than the scope of protection sought by the claims * * * the claims may be rejected under Section 112, paragraph 1, even though the term \u2018fluid\u2019 embraces both \u2018liquid\u2019 and \u2018gas\u2019 * * * and even though it \u2018would not encompass undue experimentation to arrive at a satisfactory method and structure to employ liquid and gases other than air\u2019 * * As the solicitor notes in his brief,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1448-14\">The important point here is that appellants did not recite the use of \u2018fluid\u2019 broadly as a segmenting medium in describing their invention. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1448-15\">Insofar as the term \u2018fluid\u2019 in claims 34, 37-40, 43- and 44 encompasses liquids, there is no <em>description </em>thereof in appellants\u2019 specification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1448-16\">We cannot agree with the broad proposition, apparent in the above quoted language, that in every case where the description of the invention in the specification is narrower than that in the claim there has been a failure to fulfill the description requirement in section 112. Each case must be decided on its own facts. The question which must be answered is whether the application originally filed in the Patent Office clearly conveyed in any way to those skilled in the art, to whom it is addressed, the information that appellants invented the analysis system with an inert fluid as the segmentizing medium. See In re Ruschig, 379 F.2d 990, 54 CCPA 1551 (1967). If it did, then appellants have made a written description of their invention within the meaning of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>Let us look at the description of the invention in the original application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">The segmentizing medium serves the functions, appellants\u2019 specification tells us, of \u201cseparating one [liquid] sample from another in the apparatus and for washing the conduits and the flow cell * * The essential function of separating discrete samples from each other is performed because the medium takes the shape of the supply lines and the flow cell through which it passes, while to some extent resisting any force which may tend to change its volume. This quality is precisely that of a \u201cfluid\u201d generically and of a \u201cliquid\u201d in particular. The \u201cwashing\u201d function of the segmentizing medium appears to us, indeed, to be better performed using liquid rather than gas, and the Patent Office has given us no facts which would justify a conclusion that one skilled in the art would not find the disclosure to inherently teach that it is the very characteristics of <em>fluids </em>which are needed in a segmentizing medium here. We note also that the prior art Kessler patent No. 3,047,367, issued in 1962, made of record by appellants here and before the examiner, shows the use of a <em>liquid </em>segmentizing and cleansing medium instead of \u201cair or other inert gas\u201d in a system entitled \u201cAutomatic Analysis With Fluid Segmentation.\u201d In that patent it is stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1449-7\">In accordance with the present invention and pursuant to one of the objects thereof, the use of air or other inert gas as the cleansing agent is dispensed with and replaced by a liquid, in order to obviate certain difficulties which may be encountered when air or other compressible fluids are employed as the cleansing agents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1449-8\">We believe that the use of an inert <em>fluid </em>broadly in this invention would naturally occur to one skilled in the art reading the description of the use of air or other gas <em>as a segmentizing medium </em>to separate the liquid samples. While fluid is a broader term, encompassing liquids, as noted by the solicitor, the specification clearly conveys to one skilled in the art that in this invention the characteristics of a fluid are what make the segmentizing medium work in this invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-10\">This is not a case where there is any unpredictability such that appellants\u2019 description of air or other inert gas would not convey to one skilled in the art knowledge that appellants invented an analysis system with a fluid segmentizing medium. In other cases, particularly but not necessarily, chemical cases, where there is unpredictability <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in performance of certain species or subcombinations other than those specifically enumerated, one skilled in the art may be found not to have been placed in possession of a genus or combination claimed at a later date in the prosecution of a patent application. See, for example, In re DiLeone (DiLeone II), 436 F.2d 1033, 58 CCPA 934 (1971), and In re DiLeone (DiLeone I) 436 F.2d 1404, 58 CCPA 925 (1971), where Judge Baldwin, in dissent, stated at 436 F.2d at 1406-1407, 58 CCPA at 929:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1449-11\">In the case before us, the Patent Office tribunals, and in particular, the examiner \u2014 who must be presumed by us to be skilled in the pertinent art in the absence of evidence to the contrary \u2014 have disputed the fact that the scope of appellants\u2019 invention would be obvious from the language of the description. Keeping in mind the well-known unpredictability of the chemical sciences, I find that the examiner\u2019s objections were reasonable. Beyond asserting that they are entitled to the broad claims they are .seeking, appellants have not contradicted this position. Feeling, as I do, that the description requirement should serve to assure that one of ordinary skill in the pertinent art will in fact, be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>taught by a specification disclosure, I conclude that the disclosure before us does not adequately describe the subject matter being claimed. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1450-4\">Here, however, where the broader concept of using \u201cinert fluid\u201d would naturally occur to one skilled in the art from reading appellants\u2019 description of the use and functions of the segmentizing media specifically described, we see no basis for denying appellants the claims which recite the segmentizing medium broadly as an \u201cinert fluid.\u201d The alternative places upon patent applicants, the Patent Office, and the public the undue burden of listing, in the case of applicants, reading and examining, in the case of the Patent Office, and printing and storing, in the case of the public, descriptions of the very many structural or functional equivalents of disclosed elements or steps which are already stored in the minds of those skilled in the arts, ready for instant recall upon reading the descriptions of specific elements or steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-5\">We are not saying that the disclosure of \u201cair or other gas which is inert to the liquid\u201d sample <em>by itself </em>is a description of the use of all \u201cinert fluid\u201d media. Rather, it is the description of the <em>properties and functions </em>of the \u201cair or other gas\u201d segmentizing medium described in appellants\u2019 specification which would suggest to a person skilled in the art that appellants\u2019 invention includes the use of \u201cinert fluid\u201d broadly. The Kessler patent is only some additional evidence of the knowledge of one skilled in the automatic sample analysis art, and as such it supports appellants\u2019 position that to such persons appellants\u2019 description conveys the idea of using inert fluids broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-6\">A hypothetical situation may make our point clear. If the original specification of a patent application on the scales of justice disclosed only a 1-pound <em>\u201clead </em>weight\u201d as a counterbalance to determine the weight of a pound of flesh, we do not believe the applicant should be prevented, by the so-called \u201cdescription requirement\u201d of the first paragraph of \u00a7 112, or the prohibition against new matter of \u00a7 132, from later claiming the counterbalance as a \u201cmetal weight\u201d or simply as a 1-pound \u201cweight,\u201d although both \u201cmetal weight\u201d and \u201cweight\u201d would indeed be progressively broader than \u201clead weight,\u201d including even such an undisclosed, but obviously art-recognized equivalent, \u201cweight\u201d as a pound of feathers. The broader claim language would be permitted because the <em>description of the use and function </em>of the lead weight as a scale counterbalance in the <em>whole disclosure </em>would immediately convey to any person skilled in the scale art the knowledge that the applicant invented a scale with a 1-pound counterbalance weight, regardless of its composition. Likewise, we find in the facts here a description of the use and function of the segmentizing medium which would convey to one skilled in the sample-analysis art the knowledge that applicants invented a sample analyzer with an inert <em>fluid </em>segmentizing medium.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-9\">Turning to the precedents, in In re Reynolds, 443 F.2d 384, 58 CCPA 1287, (1971), this court quoted with approval the following from the opinion in Technicon Instruments Corp. v. Cole Instruments, Inc.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 255 F.Supp. 630 (N.D.Ill. 1966) , aff\u2019d, 385 F.2d 391 (7th Cir. 1967) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-12\">By disclosing in a patent application a device that inherently performs a function, operates according to a theory, or has an advantage, a patent applicant necessarily discloses that function, theory or advantage even though he says nothing concerning it. The application may later be amended to recite the function, theory or advantage without introducing prohibited new matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>We agree with that statement, whether, as here, in the context of an ex parte rejection under the description requirement of the first paragraph of \u00a7 112, the right to make a count in an interference, Woofter v. Carlson, 367 F.2d 436, 54 CCPA 917 (1966), the right to rely upon a prior application under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 which complies with the requirements of the first paragraph of \u00a7 112, In re Lukach, 442 F.2d 967, 58 CCPA 1233 (1971), or a new . matter rejection of the claims as discussed in Technicon.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See In re Welstead, 463 F.2d 1110, 59 CCPA 1105 (1972), a new matter case citing Fields v. Conover, 443 F.2d 1386, 1391-1392, 58 CCPA 1366, 1372-1374 (1971), as involving the written description requirement in another context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-5\">The board also rested the alleged failure of the specification to describe the invention on possible inclusion of inoperative embodiments of the invention using \u201cinert fluids\u201d which it conceived. The board stated (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-6\">The term \u201cinert fluid\u201d emcompasses <em>colored </em>materials <em>adherent </em>to the walls of the sight tube, thus to render appellants\u2019 process inoperative, as well as liquid <em>wetting agents, </em>which appellants disclose * * * must be absent for proper operation. Thus, not only does the specification fail to support the method and apparatus claimed, where a fluid other than air is to be introduced, but the noted term is <em>so broad as to include inoperative fluids. </em>Appellants\u2019 specification, in its failure to provide antecedent basis for \u201cinert fluid,\u201d renders it impossible for one skilled in this art to determine what classes of fluids are useful and which are not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-8\">We can see no basis for either the board\u2019s premise that the use of the word fluid makes the claim so broad as to include inoperative fluids, or the board\u2019s conclusion that somehow any lack of antecedent basis for \u201cinert fluid\u201d makes it impossible to determine what classes of fluids are useful in the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-9\">The use here of any particular \u201cliquids\u201d which would be inoperative, such as the examples given by the board\u2014 \u201ccolored materials,\u201d materials \u201cadherent to the walls of the sight tube,\u201d and \u201cliquid wetting agents\u201d \u2014 -would be predictably inoperative in the invention and thus would never be selected by one skilled in the art. As we have said before, it is almost always possible to so construe a claim as to have it read on inoperative embodiments. In re Cook; 439 F.2d 730, 734, 58 CCPA 1049, 1054 (1971), but the alternative of requiring an applicant to be so specific in his claims \u201cas to exclude materials known to be inoperative and [which] even those <em>not </em>skilled in the art would not try\u201d would result in claims which would fail to comply with 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, second paragraph, because they would be so detailed as to obscure, rather than to particularly point out and distinctly claim, the invention. In re Myers, 410 F.2d 420, 56 CCPA 1129 (1969), quoted with approval in In re Anderson, 471 F.2d 1237 (CCPA 1973). We therefore cannot agree with the board that the rejection under the first paragraph of \u00a7 112 is any more sustainable because the broader term \u201cfluid\u201d includes some \u201cliquids\u201d which might not work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-10\">\u201cInert Gas\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-11\">Claims 47-50 have been rejected under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, paragraph one, on the ground that insofar as the term \u201cinert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>gas\u201d used in these claims covers the use of gases other than air<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as the segmentizing medium, the specification allegedly does not enable one skilled in the art to \u201cmake and use\u201d the invention. The specification shows the segmentizing medium as air which is aspirated from the atmosphere surrounding the apparatus. The Patent Office position is that the use of an inert gas other than the air is not taught by the specification in a manner which would enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-4\">Appellants maintain here, as they did before the Patent Office, that the Skeggs\u2019 '149 patent suggests that any medium, liquid or gas, can be introduced along a\u2019 pump tube by connecting the upstream side of the pump tube to the source of the medium. This Skeggs reference, as appellants point out, shows a series of openings for incoming fluid lines which lead either to a source of liquid or air, and appellants tell us that \u201cit would not encompass undue experimentation to arrive at a satisfactory method and structure to employ liquid and gases other than air.\u201d We find ourselves in agreement with appellants. See In re Borkowski, 422 F.2d 904, 57 CCPA 946 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-5\">The rejections of claims 34, 37-40, 43, 44, and 47-50 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 are accordingly reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-6\">The decision of the board is reversed as to all claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1445-8\">. Skeggs '149 issued to Technicon International, Ltd., a New York Corporation, and Skeggs \u2019141 issued to Technicon Instruments Corporation, a New York corporation, which appears to be prosecuting the present application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1448-11\">. The board may have also treated the rejection of these claim's under \u00a7 112 under the \u201cenablement\u201d section of the first paragraph, but the solicitor has narrowed the rejection by his argument to the \u201cdescription\u201d requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1449-12\">. As we pointed out in In re Cook, 439 F.2d 730, 734, 58 CCPA 1049, 1054 (1971), it is the predictability or the unpredictability \"of the elements, be they chemical or mechanical, which is determinative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1450-7\">. The case involved, interestingly enough, the validity of the two Skeggs \u2019149 and \u2019141 patents, inter alia, which were cited as \u00a7 103 references here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1451-12\">. The paragraph of the above <em>Technicon </em>quotation concludes with the sentence: In any event, the fact that the Patent Office allows such an amendment without objection thereto as new matter (within the meaning of Title 35 U.S.C., \u00a7 132) is entitled to an especially weighty presumption of correctness. We note that here, too, the Patent Office made no new matter rejection of the language of the preliminary amendment reciting the segmentizing medium as an \u201cinert fluid.\u201d See MPEP 608.04(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1452-10\">. For the purposes of considering this ground of rejection it is not necessary to decide whether the claim language \u201cinert gas immiscible with said liquid samples\u201d means a chemically \u201cinert\u201d gas or only a gas which is inert with respect to the liquid sample. At least once in the original specification the segmentizing medium is described as \u201cair or other gas which is inert to the liquid transmitted * * *. The solicitor states that \u201cair is not inert.\u201d For present purposes, the enablement rejection relates specifically to the use of a gas other than atmospheric air, because it cannot be merely aspirated from the surrounding atmosphere; it does not matter whether it is chemically an inert gas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1452-8\">BALDWIN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A-c-\">(dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-9\">I would affirm the rejection of claims 34, 37-40, 43 and 44 under the first paragraph of section 112 of the statute. The critical term in these claims, \u201cfluid,\u201d is a generic term, which for our purposes may be considered to be made up of two major subgeneraliquids and gases. I agree that the appellants\u2019 specification adequately, describes the genus of gases which meet the other claimed criteria, <em>i.e., </em>gases which are \u201cinert to the sample liquid,\u201d which is how I interpret the recitation \u201cinert gas.\u201d However, I cannot agree that the specification contains an adequate description of the genus \u201cfluid\u201d under any reasonable standard. In the first place, only the subgenus \u201cinert gases\u201d is described, and it is apparent that one skilled in this art would not infer \u201cinert fluids\u201d from a description of \u201cinert gases\u201d alone. Secondly, it cannot be questioned that any other members of the \u201cgenus\u201d (in this case there being only one, <em>viz. </em>\u201cinert liquids\u201d) is anywhere disclosed or implied in the specification. Thus description of the genus cannot be inferred from the supplied descriptions of its member species. The final possibility is a description of the genus itself, either <em>in ipsis verbis, </em>which clearly is not present here, or implied, such as through a complete description of the properties which define the genus, which the majority contends exists in this case. I submit that the majority is in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-12\">The following exerpt is sufficiently representative of the contents of the specification concerning the segmentizing medium (emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1452-13\">The primary object of the present invention is to improve the precision of quantitative analysis of the samples of liquid. We have discovered that this important object can be accomplished by utilizing as much as possible liquid conduits, such as Teflon tubing, which have non-wetting surfaces instead of wettable surfaces, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>by washing the flow cell between the passage of successive samples there-through with one or more <em>bubbles of air or other gas which is inert to the liquid, transmitted </em>through the conduits and through the flow cell, whereby contamination of one sample by another is prevented or is negligible. Further, the sample liquid which is transmitted through the flow cell during the analysis operation, at which time a record of the analysis is made, has a volume at least as large and preferably larger than the volume of the flow cell, so that there is no <em>air </em>in the flow cell when the liquid analysis operation is being performed. More specifically, while one or more <em>segments or bubbles of the air or other gas </em>are introduced into the liquid stream for separating one sample from another in the apparatus and for washing the conduits and the flow cell, it is unnecessary to remove said <em>bubbles </em>before transmission of the treated liquid samples through the flow cell, since the segmentation of the liquid stream by <em>air bubbles </em>is such that a sufficient volume of the treated sample liquid is devoid of <em>air bubbles </em>to enable its analysis as it flows through the flow cell. By reason of the provision of a volume of non-segmented treated liquid sample sufficiently large for analysis, namely, a volume of treated liquid sample at least as large as the volume of the flow cell, blending of segments of the same liquid sample and the need for removal of a comparatively large number of <em>air bubbles </em>are obviated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1453-5\">Throughout the specification, only inert gas and, more often, air, which is used in the preferred embodiment, are mentioned as segmentizing mediums. There is no further discussion of the properties which those mediums have which make them useful. Thus the two properties relied on by the majority as delineating the properties of a \u201cfluid,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>(1) the ability of the medium to take \u201cthe shape of the supply lines and the flow cell through which it passes\u201d and (2) its ability to resist \u201cany force which may tend to change its volume,\u201d are never disclosed or discussed in the specification at all. True enough, the inert gases described by appellants inherently would possess the first property mentioned, and presumably even the most compressable of gases would qualify as having the second property \u201cto some extent,\u201d as broadly phrased by the majority. But what the majority is saying is that the description requirement as to \u201cinert fluids\u201d is satisfied in this case, even though that genus is not specifically described by name, because it is impliedly described by the properties which define it, even though those properties are not specifically described by naming them, because those properties are impliedly described \u2014 by what? \u2014 by the fact that the members of the subgenus which <em>is </em>specifically described inherently possess those properties. What about those properties inherently possessed by gases which are strikingly different from those of liquids and would suggest that liquids would <em>not </em>be useful, such as density and viscosity?</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-7\">More importantly, what kind of mental gymnastics are we going to force the skilled in the art to go through in order to determine what is described in a patent specification? The statute directs the specification to the skilled in the art, and that has two effects on the requirements for its content. Of course it establishes that the intended reader is not a babe in the woods, and that therefore the specification need not be burdened with those details which are already generally known in the art. But the intended reader is <em>no more </em>than one skilled in the art. He is not some master of law or logic who can be expected to inveterately expand each nuance contained in a specification into pyramids of disclosure. It \u25a0 is a general level_of specialized knowledge which is required of him, not genius.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-8\">As to the majority\u2019s speculation that the washing function of the segmentizing medium would be \u201cbetter performed using liquid rather than gas,\u201d it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>only not supported by the record, but is also contrary to the implications of the only pertinent teachings in the record. Kessler, <em>whose invention it was to use a liquid segmentizing medium rather than a gas, </em>states as follows (emphasis supplied) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-4\">In accordance with the present invention and pursuant to one of the objects thereof, the use of air or other inert gas as the cleansing agent is dispensed with and replaced by a liquid, in order to obviate certain difficulties which may be encountered when air or other compressible fluids are employed as the cleansing agents. In this connection, it will be understood that in most instances, <em>the use of air as the cleansing agent is to be preferred because it is highly effective for this purpose </em>and is readily available, without cost, from the ambient atmosphere. However, in certain processes, <em>e. g., </em>in spectral-flame analyses, the compresibility of air or other inert gas may result in pulsations of the liquid introduced into the spectral flame and thus cause the flame to flicker or be unsteady. This objectionable result is eliminated pursuant to this invention, since liquid is incompressible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1454-5\">In the final analysis, I believe that support for the majority\u2019s position reduces to the existence of the Kessler patent, which, I agree, is <em>some </em>evidence that the knowledge that liquid segmentizing mediums can be used was part of the general level of skill in this art. The question becomes whether this evidence is enough on the facts of this case to establish that the use of liquid segmentizing mediums was generally known in this art. If it is, then appellants are entitled to claims directed to the use of fluids (or for that matter to liquids, which as a practical matter is the same thing here) even though appellants never mentioned those embodiments in their specification as filed, at least insofar as the description requirement is concerned. Of course, it must <em>generally </em>known \u2014 the statute directs the specification to those skilled in the art, not just to one or two practitioners who might happen to know it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-7\">Before us we have appellants\u2019 specification, which is very strictly limited to \u201cair or other gas inert to the sample liquid.\u201d The segmentizing medium is nowhere described as a \u201cmedium\u201d or a \u201cfluid.\u201d The specification is so strictly limited as to give rise to an implication that appellants considered such a limitation important. The record before us contains twenty-five patents, twenty-four of which have disclosures which are limited to air, or other inert gas in a manner similar to appellants\u2019 disclosure. To me that indicates that the only segmentizing medium which would \u201cnaturally occur\u201d to one skilled in the art reading appellants\u2019 specification is air, or other gas inert to the liquid samples. The mere existence of the Kessler patent, which states that the preferred segmentizing medium is gaseous in all but a few special cases, is not enough to overcome what the other evidence indicates is the general knowledge of those skilled in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-8\">I would therefore affirm the rejection of claims 34, 37-40, 43 and 44.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
