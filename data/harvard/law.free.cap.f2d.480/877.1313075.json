Opposition is predicated upon appellant\u2019s registration No. 746,123, issued Mar. 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>1963, of DURAGOLD for bronze gold pigment for decorative uses and likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Neither party took testimony, appellant relying solely on its prior registration, the date of which antedates appellee\u2019s asserted date of first use. Accordingly, the only issue for our disposition is whether appellee\u2019s mark ETERNAGOLD so resembles appellant's mark as to be \u201clikely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">In a prior case earlier this term we affirmed the dismissal of an opposition by the same appellant as here, based upon the same registration of DURAGOLD, to the registration of the term EVERGOLD. Claremont Polychemical Corp. v. Atlantic Powdered Metals, Inc., 470 F.2d 636 (CCPA 1972). In that case we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-6\">We have considered the marks in their entirety as well as the dictionary definitions of the prefixes DURA and EVER, which we may indeed do \u201cto determine the ordinary significance and meanings of words,\u201d <em>Hancock </em>[v. American Steel &amp; Wire Co., of New Jersey, 203 F.2d 737, 40 CCPA 931 (1953)], supra, and find no error in the conclusion of the board that concurrent use of EVERGOLD and DURAGOLD on the goods named would be unlikely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d). The prefixes EVER and DURA are very different in sound and appearance and both are suggestive or descriptive of alleged properties of the goods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">While we also noted in that case that \u201cprior decisions involving <em>other </em>marks and <em>different </em>goods are of little value as precedents\u201d and \u201cEach case must be decided on its own facts,\u201d we think that the above statement from the prior ease represents more than mere <em>stare decisis </em>and applies equally well to the facts here. We note that the reasons for the appeal given by appellant in its Notice of Appeal and the \u201cErrors Relied Upon\u201d in its brief are substantially identical to those given in the previous case. The dictionary definition of \u201ceternal,\u201d from which ETERNA is derived, is reproduced in the margin<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and further supports our conclusion. The goods here are apparently identical to those in the prior case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">The decision of the board is affirmed. Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-14\">. The Petition of Appeal states that appellant has complied with the provisions of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 142 and 143, which pertain to appeals in patent rather than trademark cases. However, we have construed the appeal as if filed pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(a), the provision governing appeals to this court in trademark cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b943-27\">. Digested at 171 USPQ 814 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b944-9\">. <em>\u201cEternal </em>* * * Of infinite duration; everlasting; \u2014 in different contexts : without beginning; or end; without beginning; without end. Often, in Scriptural connections or allusions, <em>eternal </em>implies a state or quality other than mere duration; as the <em>eternal </em>life is a life of celestial bliss.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (1932).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b944-16\">. Appellee\u2019s application originally specified \u201cmetal powder,\u201d the same goods specified in its application in the prior case. In response to the examiner\u2019s assertion that the recitation of goods was indefinite, appellee revised the description of goods to the present recitation to \u201cmore specifically * * * cite the type of goods to which the applicant applies its mark.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b944-13\">BALDWIN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ADX\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">I cannot agree that there would be no likelihood of confusion as to source when these marks are considered in conjunction with the goods on which they are used.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-15\">While I dissented in the previous DURAGOLD ease, Claremont Polychemical Corp. v. Atlantic Powdered Metals, Inc., 470 F.2d 636, 637 (CCPA 1972), I fully accept the majority decision therein as the law governing that ease. Nevertheless, I would not extend that decision to cover the facts of the present case, in which it has been made clear that the goods are essentially <em>identical. </em>As the majority here points out, in the previous case the goods were described merely as \u201cpowdered metal.\u201d There were no indications in that case as to what the. powdered metal was, what it was used for, or what channels of trade were involved. It being clear in the present case that the goods are both metal pigments, the previous case, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>involved <em>another mark </em>on <em>different </em>goods, is of little value as a precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">It appears to me that appellee is well on its way to obtaining a family of marks, the front portion of which means durable and the back portion of which is GOLD, despite the fact that appellant had established its rights in DURAGOLD, for the identical goods, long before appellee had used its marks. The damage to appellant\u2019s rights in DURAGOLD are clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">I would reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
