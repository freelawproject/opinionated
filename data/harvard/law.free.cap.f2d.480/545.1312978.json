App. \u00a7 451, et seq., is whether the district court erred in finding lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-16\">The trial court 341 F.Supp. 339, found that some of the constitutional issues presented by appellants had already been authoritatively adjudicated adversely to the appellants\u2019 contentions thereby obviating the necessity of additional litigation. In other respects, the court found the claims to be political questions and, therefore, non-justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-17\">A district court is required to request the convocation of a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282 where there is a challenge to the constitutionality of a federal statute, unless the constitutional attack is \u201c \u2018essentially fictitious,\u2019 Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U.S. 31, 33 [82 S.Ct. 549, 551, 7 L.Ed.2d 512] (1962), \u2018wholly insubstantial,\u2019 <em>ibid., </em>\u2018obviously frivolous,\u2019 Hannis Distilling Co. v. Baltimore, 216 U.S. 285, 288 [30 S.Ct. 326, 327, 54 L.Ed. 482] (1910), \u2018obviously without merit,\u2019 Ex parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 32 [54 S.Ct. 3, 4-5, 78 L.Ed. 152] (1933),\u201d Goosby v. Osser, 409 U.S. 512, 93 S.Ct. 854, 35 L.Ed.2d 36 (January 17, 1973); or unless \u201cits unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the question sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy,\u201d Ex parte Poresky, <em>supra,, </em>290 U.S. at 32, 54 S.Ct. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-18\">We have concluded that several of the counts presented by the appellants have already been conclusively adjudicated by the Supreme Court adversely to appellants and, therefore, were properly dismissed \"by the district court. Count I, claiming a taking of appellants\u2019 property without due process of law is foreclosed by Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>755-758, 68 S.Ct. 1294, 92 L.Ed. 1694 (1948); Count II, claiming involuntary servitude, by Arver v. United States, 245 U.S. 366, 38 S.Ct. 159, 62 L.Ed. 349 (1918) ; Count IV, claiming an unconstitutional deprivation of various First and Fifth Amendment rights, by United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1969); Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"> Count V is non-justiciable because of mootness. Appellants claimed that the Vietnam conflict was an illegal and unconstitutional war contrary to the principles of military, national, and international law. We take judicial notice that as of this date no one subject to the Military Selective Service Act will be called to serve in Vietnam and that American participation in that conflict has been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">What remains is Count III, a claim that the Act offends the equal protection clause because it discriminates unconstitutionally between males and females. This contention has not been adjudicated by the Supreme Court, although there is a thoughtful opinion by Chief Judge Marsh of the Western District of Pennsylvania concluding that such \u201cclassifications as age and sex are not arbitrary or unreasonable, and the classifications are justified by the compelling government interest. . . .\u201d United States v. Dorris, 319 F.Supp. 1306, 1308 (W.D.Pa.1970). Guided by the stringent language of Ex parte Poresky, <em>supra, </em>which suggests that the \u201cunsoundness\u201d of the claim must result \u201cfrom previous decisions of this [Supreme] court,\u201d we are constrained to hold that this count presents an issue which is not yet foreclosed. From the district court's opinion we are unable to determine on what basis it rejected this particular count. Therefore, we will vacate the judgment of the district court and remand these proceedings solely for the purpose of considering Count III. If the district court is satisfied that plaintiffs have standing and that the constitutional attack is not insubstantial as defined in Goosby v. Osser, <em>supra, </em>it should request the convocation of a statutory court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">The judgment of the district court will be vacated with respect to Count III; in all other respects the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
