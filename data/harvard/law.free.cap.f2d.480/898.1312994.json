But in view of the highly suggestive if not descriptive character of the term \u201cVOICE\u201d as applied to tape recorders and sound reproducing devices (it is noted that the Examiner required applicant to disclaim the word \u201cVOICE\u201d apart from the mark as a whole) and the obvious and distinct differences in the other portions of the marks, it is concluded that the marks as a whole are readily distinguishable in sound and appearance and create such distinctly different commercial impressions or suggestive connotations that confusion or mistake as to the source of the products sold thereunder is not reasonably likely to occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-19\">We think that the board gave undue weight to the suggestive nature of VOICE, and to the disclaimer of that word apart from the mark as a whole. As the court said in United States Steel Corp. v. Vasco Metals Corp., 394 F.2d 1009, 1012, 55 CCPA 1141, 1144 (1968) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-20\">A disclaimer does not divide or separate portions of a mark from other portions. The mark remains as a unitary whole. The disclaimer * * * is merely of <em>legal consequences </em>of registration, not of parts of a mark.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-21\">Thus the disclaimer of the VOICE part of the mark is of no legal signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>canee in determining the likelihood of confusion of the marks <em>as a whole.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">While the board also concentrated on \u201cthe obvious and distinct differences in the other portions of the marks,\u201d in comparing appellant\u2019s VOICE-O-MATIC with appellee\u2019s VOICE MAGIC, the only-differences we find are the presence of -0-, the use of T instead of G, and a slight difference in meaning. In our opinion, those differences are not sufficient either in sight, in sound, or in meaning, to prevent a reasonable likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception, within the meaning of section 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d). While appellant\u2019s mark may be somewhat suggestive, even considered in its entirety, still appellant is entitled to prevail under the statute where there is a likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception. In re Fisher Radio Corp., 440 F.2d 1036, 58 CCPA 1158 (1971).
