Metzner, J., granting the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment. During 1962, the Internal Revenue Service made two assessments against Industrial Builders, Inc. (the taxpayer) for unpaid federal unemployment taxes. The tax liabilities were recorded on March 9, 1962 and July 20, 1962, in the office of the District Director for Puerto Rico on Form 899, \u201cCertificate of Assessments and Payments.\u201d The Service filed a \u201cNotice of Federal Tax Lien\u201d for the respective assessments in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico on May 11, 1962 and October 8, 1962. On October 29, 1962, Lorson obtained a default judgment in the same district court' against the taxpayer in the sum of $207,589, and subsequently successfully levied on its property. The Government brought this action to foreclose its two tax liens on property of the taxpayer in possession of Lorson. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">Lorson\u2019s sole argument is that no valid prior federal tax lien has been established because the Government failed to prove a demand for payment of the tax, which 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6303(a) requires. We disagree. Each filed Notice of Federal Tax Lien stated that there had been a \u201cdemand for payment\u201d of the tax due. Moreover, Form 899 recites a \u201c1st Notice\u201d on a specified date with respect to each assessment. Representations in a Form 899 Certificate of Assessment have been held in another context to be \u201cpresumptively correct.\u201d United States v. Strebler, 313 F.2d 402, 403 (8th Cir. 1963). Lorson responds that although these recitations might constitute proof that the <em>notice </em>required by section 6303(a) was sent to the taxpayer, they are insufficient to evidence the equally critical making of a <em>demand. </em>This exalts form over substance. The language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>of section 6303(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> shows that notice and demand are inextricably coupled. If Form 899 is competent to show that notice was sent, it seems entirely proper to infer, as did Judge Metzner, that such notice included a demand for payment as a matter of course. In fact, not long after the date of \u201c1st Notice\u201d of the first assessment (as indicated by Form 899) the taxpayer did make two payments, which reduced the amount due. On this record, the Government met its burden of proof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-13\">. That section provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">[T] he Secretary or Ms delegate shall give notice to each person liable for the unpaid tax, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-15\">. On this view of the case, we need not consider the Government\u2019s contention \u2014 alternatively relied on by Judge Metzner \u2014 that even if demand had not been established, this failure can be raised in defense only by the taxpayer, not by a third party like Lorson.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
