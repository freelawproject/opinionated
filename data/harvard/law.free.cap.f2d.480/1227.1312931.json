The cause of action was predicated on the failure of the United States Government, through its various agencies, to disseminate, for broadcast, weather information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-11\">Although the Government asserts that liability to individuals is precluded because the activity of the weather service in forecasting and disseminating weather information involves a duty running only to the public generally, and alternatively because the claims are based on negligent misrepresentation expressly barred by the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2680(h), we find it unnecessary to address those legal defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-13\">The judgment for the Government must be affirmed because the District Court was not clearly erroneous in finding as a matter of fact that no Government employee was guilty of any negligent act or omission, and that the activity of the Government did not constitute a proximate cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
