Gulledge began at approximately 11:00 o\u2019clock p. m., May 21, 1971, in a shopping center parking lot on Eastern Avenue, Washington, D.C. The appellants, 26 year old Henry H. Jones, Jr. and 21 year old William E. Hawkins, entered the shopping center intending to make a liquor purchase. Prior to entering the liquor store, Jones confronted six youths, all under 16 years of age, standing in the parking lot and, after brandishing a knife, ordered them to leave before he returned. The youths moved to an area in front of a bowling alley and one left to get his older cousin. When Jones returned he again confronted the youths, inquiring why they were still there. At this point the 18 year old cousin and his 21 year old friend arrived on the scene and a fight ensued. Jones and Hawkins lost and left the parking lot. The youths, intending to meet later at a restaurant, split up \u2014 three leaving in the cousin\u2019s car and three, including the deceased, on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-15\">Meanwhile the appellants met two friends with a car and related what had happened. The friends suggested looking for the youths. The four drove down Eastern Avenue to the intersection of Oglethorpe Street where they encountered Gulledge and his two friends who were identified by appellant Jones as, \u201cYes, that\u2019s them.\u201d The youths started running in various directions with Gulledge, pursued by Hawkins and Jones, fleeing toward a car parked on the street. Hawkins caught Gulledge at the rear of the car and commenced beating him. Jones then approached, holding a knife, and stabbed Gulledge four times, causing his death. When Theodore Corbett, who had been standing next to the car, tried to intervene he too was stabbed in the stomach, a wound from which he recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-16\">A Grand Jury indictment was returned in which Jones and Hawkins were jointly charged in Count One with first degree murder, a violation of 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2401.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jones alone was charged in the second count of assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>with intent to kill while armed, a violation of 22 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 501, 3202.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">At trial neither appellant disputed the basic facts, Jones relying upon insanity as a defense, and Hawkins asserting lack of intent to commit murder. The jury rejected both defenses, finding Jones guilty of both first degree murder and assault with intent to kill while armed; Hawkins was found guilty of second degree murder, a lesser included offense, under 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2403.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">The principal issue presented on this appeal, and which we think to be dispositive of it, is whether the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing and rebuttal arguments were so highly prejudicial as to require reversal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">Interspersed throughout the Government\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments were the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-8\">CLOSING ARGUMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-9\">w \u2022X\u2019 *X* \u2018X- -X*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-10\">\u201cYou can read the paper in the big cases and it always is there, isn\u2019t it, Sirhan Sirhan, Jack Ruby, Ammidown, Timm and Caldwell, when they were caught red-handed in front of an audience or bevies of people, they turn to insanity because that is their only hope.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-11\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-12\">\u201cNow, oh, he is dangerous, he is a murderer. But he is not mentally ill. Sirhan Sirhan and Jack Ruby and Ammidown, they didn\u2019t fool anybody, nor does he, has he ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-13\">\u2022X- -X- -X- -X- -X- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-14\">\u201c. . . He is not crazy, ladies and gentlemen, or insane, you know somebody passed me in the hall a moment ago and said you\u2019ll never get first degree murder\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Wait a minute let\u2019s don\u2019t talk about things like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-19\">\u201cMR. ROBINSON: I[t] was going to be an anology [sic], Your Honor. \u201cTHE COURT: No, you cannot make that analogy and the jury will disregard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-20\">\u201cMR. ROBINSON: Mr. Robinson</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-21\">[you] might think you can\u2019t get first degree murder in the case like this, because it\u2019s what somebody might say is \u2018a Saturday night special.\u2019 I mean, you don\u2019t have a $50,000 suburban house that you live in like Mrs. Ammidown, you don\u2019t have a deputy chief of the city like Heidi Ann Fletcher, a police officer got shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-22\">\u201cBut you see, ladies and gentlemen, this is the worst kind of murder, I mean its the worst. 15 years old, he never even knew Watusi Jones. Mrs. Ammidown at least knew Mr. Ammidown, there was friction. He never even knew the man that murdered him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-23\">\u2022X -X -X -X * -X-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1219-24\">At the conclusion of the Government\u2019s closing argument both defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the Government\u2019s comparison with the <em>Ammidown </em>case. This motion was denied.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-25\">REBUTTAL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-26\">\u2022X- * -X- -X -X *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-27\">\u201cHow many policemen die a year in this country in the line of duty? How many in Washington D.C. alone? How many officer Sigmons get shot down in a bank robbery by a Mr. Timm? Do we just cover them all, these deaths, with a blanket of insanity ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-28\">\u201cAnd let them all go to a nice hospital under some kind of a charade of a defense? Or do we stand up tall and we defend those men who lost their lives in the line of duty? We stand up tall. Vernon Gulledge never ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>cepted the responsibility of a policeman to die in the line of duty. Vernon just had the responsibility of growing up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-4\">\u201c. . .He was intelligent and Napoleon was a genius and he tried to wreck all of Europe. He boiled [sic] over anybody that got in his way. Hitler was a genius in his own way. But he\u2019s not a Hitler or a Napoleon, but he ran in gangs, gangs from which all the gangsters have gone to jail, and what I am saying, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the final gangster to go to jail and not to a hospital.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-6\">* -X X X X X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-7\">\u201cYou see, ladies and gentlemen, if the story that Mr. Hawkins told is true, maybe he is guilty of simple assault. I want you to look and see how fair the United States can be. We don\u2019t say he had anything to do, Mr. Hawkins had anything to do with stabbing Mr. Corbett, do we? And so you will notice our responsibility there to try to be just by not including him in the indictment for assaulting Mr. Corbett ; isn\u2019t that true ? He is not charged with assaulting Mr. Corbett. But he can\u2019t lean on his non-participation in that incident to get out of the murder he assisted in committing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-8\">X X X X X X</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-9\"> Here, as in United States v. Clinton L. Phillips,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the same Government attorney resorted to arguments clearly designed to arouse the passion and prejudice of the jury. When a defendant\u2019s sole defense is insanity, a prosecutor cannot be permitted to compare that defense to other infamous crimes where that defense has been raised and rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-10\">Once again, as in United States v. Clinton L. Phillips, <em>supra, </em>we quote from Brown v. United States, 125 U.S. App.D.C. 220, 224, 370 F.2d 242, 246 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-11\">\u201cWhile such an argument is always to be condemned as \u2018an appeal wholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case,\u2019 Viereck v. United States, 318 U.S. 236, 247, 63 S.Ct. 561, 566, 87 L. Ed. 734 (1943), and as a dereliction of the prosecutor\u2019s high duty to prosecute fairly, see Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935), in the context of current events, raising the spectre of [heinous crimes] . . . was an especially flagrant and reprehensible appeal to passion and prejudice. Although the prosecutor \u2018may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.\u2019 Berger v. United States, <em>supra, </em>295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633; Viereck v. United States, <em>supra, </em>318 U.S. at 248, 63 S.Ct. at 567.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-13\">For the reasons set forth, the judgment of conviction of Henry H. Jones, Jr. is reversed. It necessarily follows that the judgment of conviction of William E. Hawkins must also be nullified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-14\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1218-17\">. Hawkins, as an aider and abettor, under 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 105, was charged as a principal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1219-17\">. .Tones was also charged in Count Three with assault with intent to kill, a violation of 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 501, and in Count Four with assault with a dangerous weapon, a violation of 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 502. These two counts were dismissed during trial on Government motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1219-29\">. The remaining problems raised, while considered, would not warrant reversal and a discussion thereof would have no precedential value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1220-23\">. 155 U.S.App.D.C.-, 476 F.2d 538 (decided May 16, 1973) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
