The United States Attorney, on that date, moved for a continuance of the trial until June 5 because of the illness and hospitalization of one of the Government witnesses. Trial to a jury was held on June 5 and 6 and a guilty verdict on both counts was returned. The District Court sentenced the appellant to four years\u2019 imprisonment on the false information count and two years on the possession count, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">On February 21, 1972, the appellant, in the company of two other persons, entered a Morehead, Kentucky, discount store and purchased a gun. In connection with this sale, the appellant was asked certain questions by the store clerk, who was barred by law from selling a gun to a person he knew as a convicted felon. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(d)(1). One of the questions on Form 4473 of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of the Treasury Department, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(g), was \u201cHave you been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year?\u201d At trial, the clerk testified that the appellant answered this question, \u201cNo,\u201d when asked before the purchase of the gun. It is uncontroverted that the defendant had been convicted in a Kentucky state court of ut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>tering a forgery and was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Four separate grounds for reversal are urged by the appellant. He claims that he was deprived of his right to a speedy trial, that certain remarks in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument were prejudicial reversible error, that he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment and that his privilege against self-incrimination was violated by the trial judge\u2019s requiring him to testify first, if at all, in his own defense. We examine these assertions in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The appellant\u2019s initial contention is that the delay from May 10, when the trial was originally scheduled, to June 5, when it actually was held, deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The relevance of Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), to this case is uncertain. The <em>Barker </em>case was handed down June 22, 1972, more than two weeks after the trial of this case. Under the <em>Barker </em>test, if there is a \u201cpresumptively prejudicial delay,\u201d 407 U.S. at 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, then a four-factor balancing test must be used to determine if the right to a speedy trial has been impaired. Because the three week delay in this case was not presumptively prejudicial, there is \u201cno necessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the balance.\u201d 407 U.S. at 530, 92 S.Ct. at 2192. Because the <em>Barker </em>test is not applicable to this situation, we do not rule on the issue of whether it is to be applied retrospectively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">The appellant\u2019s next assertion is that certain remarks of the prosecutor were prejudicial to him. In his closing argument the prosecutor referred to the importance of the gun laws and their enforcement. During the argument, the Assistant United States Attorney made reference to the shootings of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King and Governor George Wallace. Appellant asserts error in the failure of the District Judge to strike the references and instruct the jury to disregard them.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\"> No objection was made during the trial at the time these remarks were made. It is a long-standing rule of trial practice that a defendant must object to improper statements made by opposing counsel during closing argument to preserve these objections for appeal. Crumpton v. United States, 138 U.S. 361, 364, 11 S.Ct. 355, 34 L.Ed. 958 (1891); Holden v. United States, 388 F.2d 240, 242-243 (1st Cir.) cert. denied, 393 U.S. 864, 89 S.Ct. 146, 21 L.Ed. 2d 132 (1968). The purpose of this rule is to allow the trial judge to attempt to correct the error, if any was committed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Where no objection is made then the court on appeal should intercede only where the error would \u201cseriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 392, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936); <em>Cf. </em>Silber v. United States, 370 U.S. 717, 82 S.Ct. 1287, 8 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">A review of the record in this case convinces this Court that the error, if any, in the closing argument of the prosecutor was not reversible. United States v. Benson, 389 F.2d 376 (6th Cir.) cert. denied, 391 U.S. 903, 88 S.Ct. 1652, 20 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The third assertion of the appellant is without merit and can be disposed of easily. Appellant contends that the sentence imposed by the District Court is a violation of his Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment. The sentences were both well within the limits set by Congress. The maximum punishment for the falsification count was five years\u2019 imprisonment or a $5,000 fine or both. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924. The maximum penalty for the possession count was imprisonment for two years or a $10,000 fine or both. 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a). The wide discretion in sentencing vested in the District Court was not abused. United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Appellant\u2019s fourth assertion of error revolves around the propriety of the practice of requiring a defendant, who desires to testify on his own behalf, to testify first, if at all. This practice is based on the theory that the defendant, who is entitled to be present during his trial, should not be allowed to hear his witnesses first and then tailor his own testimony to match theirs. As Professor Wigmore stated it, \u201cthe reason for this rule is the occasional readiness of the interested person to adapt his testimony, when offered later, to victory rather than to veracity, so as to meet the necessities as laid open by prior witnesses. . . .\u201d Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 1869 at 502 (3rd ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">At the time of appellant\u2019s trial and conviction, this practice was part of the law of two of the states in this Circuit, Kentucky and Tennessee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It also had been expressly approved by this Court. United States v. Shipp, 359 F.2d 185, 190 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 903, 87 S.Ct. 213, 17 L.Ed.2d 134 (1966). This same procedure was also practiced in at least one district court in this Circuit, the instant trial court, and probably in another, the Western District of Tennessee. <em>See, Shipp, supra. </em>Consequently, the defendant\u2019s counsel in the instant case was told by the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Judge before the defense was begun that \u201cIf the Defendant is going to testify, he has got to testify first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">On June 7, 1972, one day following the jury verdict in this case, the United States Supreme Court struck down the Tennessee statute which mandated that a criminal defendant testify first, if at all, in his own defense. Brooks v. Tennessee, 406 U.S. 605, 92 S.Ct. 1891, 32 L.Ed.2d 358 (1972). Speaking through Mr. Justice Brennan, the Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201c . . . a defendant may not know at the close of the State\u2019s case whether his own testimony will be necessary or even helpful to his cause. Rather than risk the dangers of taking the stand, he might prefer to remain silent at that point, putting off his testimony until its value can be realistically assessed. Yet, under the Tennessee rule, he cannot make that choice \u2018in the unfettered exercise of his own will.\u2019 Section 40-2403 exacts a price for his silence by keeping him off the stand entirely unless he chooses to testify first. This, we think, casts a heavy burden on a defendant\u2019s otherwise unconditional right not to take the stand. The rule, in other words, \u2018cuts down on the privilege [to remain silent] by making its assertion costly.\u2019 Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 614, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 1233, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965).\u201d (footnotes omitted) 406 U.S. at 610-611, 92 S.Ct. at 1894.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">An alternative holding offered by Mr. Justice Brennan was that the procedure violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">There can be no doubt that, <em>if </em>the <em>Brooks </em>decision is to be applied to the instant case, the defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination has been violated. Our inquiry, thus, must turn to the issue of retroactivity. Should the <em>Brooks </em>decision, handed down on June 7, be applied to the instant trial, which was conducted on June 5 and 6 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">The problem of retroactive application of Supreme Court constitutional adjudications in the criminal rights area is a difficult and complex one. We note at the outset of this analysis that the Constitution neither requires nor prohibits the retrospective application of a decision of the United States Supreme Court. Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 629, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965). As Mr. Justice Cardozo stated it, \u201cthe Federal Constitution has no voice on the subject.\u201d Great Northern Ry. v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co., 287 U.S. 358, 364, 53 S.Ct. 145, 148, 77 L.Ed. 360 (1932). Each case must proceed on an ad hoe basis, with the tests enunciated by the Supreme Court as the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">The retroactivity doctrine in constitutional adjudication was born in <em>Linkletter, supra. </em>The Court in that decision for the first time refused to apply a decision announcing a new principle of constitutional criminal procedure to a defendant whose conviction pre-dated the decision. In <em>Linkletter, </em>the Court refused retroactive application of the decision in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), which made the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule applicable to the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">Mr. Justice Clark, writing for the Court, noted that prospective decisions, that is, decisions limited to future application, were unknown at the common law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This was in keeping with the traditional Blackstonian view of the role of judges. According to this theory, judges do not create or fashion new law, but rather merely discover what the law has always been. Therefore, under this theory, a decision determinative of a constitutional issue or any other issue merely states what the law has always been, regardless of what interpretation had been placed on the question earlier. The <em>Linkletter </em>Court then outlined how, through the years, the legal realist school of jurisprudence had gained sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>port in Court decisions. The legal realists concede that the judge often makes law and recognizes the prior decision, later overruled, as an \u201cexisting juridicial fact.\u201d Under this theory, then, prospective decisions are permissible. The <em>Linkletter </em>opinion concedes that while all prior cases announcing prospective rules of law dealt with invalid statutes or the effect of a decision overturning common law precepts, \u201cthere seems to be no impediment \u2014 constitutional or philosophical \u2014 to the use of the same rule in the constitutional area where the exigencies of the situation require such an application.\u201d 381 U.S. at 628, 85 S.Ct. at 1737.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">A three-factor analysis was adopted by <em>Linkletter </em>to determine whether retroactive application should be given to a new. decision. \u201cIn short, we must look to the purpose of the <em>Mapp </em>rule; the reliance placed upon the <em>Wolf </em>doctrine; and the effect on the administration of justice of a retrospective application of <em>Mapp.\u201d </em>381 U.S. at 636, 85 S.Ct. at 1741. See also Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 297, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967). The <em>Wolf </em>doctrine which <em>Mapp </em>overruled had held that even though the concept of privacy, the hallmark of the Fourth Amendment, was implicit in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of \u201cthe concept of ordered liberty,\u201d the exclusionary rule of evidence, barring the fruits of searches and seizures violative of the Fourth Amendment, was not mandated on the states by the Constitution. Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 69 S.Ct. 1359, 93 L.Ed. 1782 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The three-factor, purpose-reliance-effect test delineated in <em>Linkletter </em>remains the Supreme Court\u2019s framework for the determination of retroactivity. Last term, the Court reaffirmed the continuing vitality of the three-factor analysis. Adams v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 278, 280, 92 S.Ct. 916, 31 L.Ed.2d 202 (1972). Although <em>Linkletter </em>itself gave no indication as to the relative weight to be given the factors in the analysis, later decisions have revealed that the most important factor to be considered is the purpose to be served by the new rule. Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 249, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969); Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 295, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100, rehearing denied, 393 U.S. 899, 89 S.Ct. 73, 21 L.Ed.2d 191 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The most recent pronouncement of the Court on the importance of the purpose factor was in Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 653, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 1152, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971), where the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">\u201cWhere the major purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth-finding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past .trials, the new rule has been given complete retroactive effect. Neither good-faith reliance by state or federal authorities on prior constitutional law or accepted practice, nor severe impact on the administration of justice has sufficed to require prospective application in these circumstances.\u201d (footnote omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-10\"><em>See, also </em>Ivan v. City of New York, 407 U.S. 203, 92 S.Ct. 1951, 32 L.Ed.2d 659 (1972). It is obvious, therefore, that the crucial examination in the application of the <em>Linkletter </em>test is the discovery of the new rule\u2019s purpose. If its purpose is to enhance the truth-finding mechanism it will be applied retrospectively. If there is another purpose, the entire three-factor analysis must be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">What then is the purpose of the new rule announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Brooks </em>that the defendant cannot be forced to testify first in his criminal trial defense? The Court stated that the old rule cut down on the defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination, making its exercise costly. Thus, the new rule is aimed at the protection of the defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. The privilege is not aimed at the enhancement of the fact-finding process at trial. Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 86 S.Ct. 459, 15 L.Ed.2d 453, rehearing denied, 383 U.S. 931, 86 S.Ct. 925, 15 L.Ed.2d 850 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>(1966). The classic enunciation of the policies behind the privilege against self-incrimination was set forth by Mr. Justice Goldberg, in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, 378 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 1594,12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">\u201c[The privilege] reflects many of our fundamental values and most noble aspirations: our unwillingness to subject those suspected of crime to the cruel trilemma of self-accusation, perjury or contempt; our preference for an accusatorial rather than an inquisitorial system of criminal justice; our fear that self-incriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane treatment and abuses; our sense of fair play which dictates \u2018a fair state-individual balance by requiring the government to leave the individual alone until good cause is shown for disturbing him and by requiring the government in its contest with the individual to shoulder the entire load,\u2019 8 Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton rev., 1961), 317; our respect for the inviolability of the human personality and of the right of each individual \u2018to a private enclave where he may lead a private life,\u2019 United States v. Gr\u00fcnewald, 2 Cir., 233 F.2d 556, 581-582 (Frank, J., dissenting), rev\u2019d 353 U.S. 391, 77 S.Ct. 693, 1 L.Ed.2d 931; our distrust of self-deprecatory statements; and our realization that the privilege, while sometimes \u2018a shelter to the guilty\u2019, is often \u2018a protection to the innocent.\u2019 Quinn v. United States, 349 U.S. 155, 162, 75 S.Ct. 668, 99 L.Ed. 964.\u201d 378 U.S. at 55, 84 S.Ct. at 1596.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Far from being designed to enhance the fact-finding process at trial, the privilege against self-incrimination, by allowing a defendant to remain silent at his trial when he is the witness most informed about the facts of his case, actually retards the fact-finding process. <em>Cf. </em>Schwartz, Retroactivity, Reliability, and Due Process: A Reply to Professor Mishkin, 33 U.Chicago L.Rev. 719, 729 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The inquiry does not cease, however, with the determination of what constitutional right is involved. We are mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s warning that \u201cthe retroactivity or nonretroactivity of a rule is not automatically determined by the provision of the Constitution on which the dictate is based.\u201d Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 728, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 1778, 16 L.Ed.2d 882, rehearing denied, 385 U.S. 890, 87 S.Ct. 12, 17 L. Ed.2d 121 (1966). Each rule must be examined carefully to determine its purpose. The specific rule in the <em>Brooks </em>case, permitting a defendant to testify after his other witnesses, does not enhance the fact-finding process at trial. The old rule, by the same token, did not significantly impair the fact-finding process. For example, in the instant case, the District Judge\u2019s imposition of the impermissible procedure, at most, kept one witness, the defendant, off the stand. His defense was presented by his two companions on the day of the purchase of the gun. If the defendant himself had testified, his testimony would have been open to impeachment by his prior felony conviction. The con-' cern of the <em>Linkletter </em>Court was to assure that innocent men convicted under later overruled law would not remain imprisoned. We do not think that this danger is present in this case. We emphasize that we are not denigrating the value or importance of the privilege against self-incrimination. We merely examine what the purpose of the <em>Brooks </em>rule is in order to apply the <em>Linkletter </em>test. The purpose of the <em>Brooks </em>rule, we hold, was not to enhance the fact-finding process but rather to protect the traditional right of the defendant to exercise his privilege against self-incrimination without penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">We now address the second factor in the <em>Linkletter </em>test, reliance. Before <em>Brooks, </em>two of the four states in this Circuit, Tennessee and Kentucky, provided for the \u201cfirst, if at all\u201d rule by statute. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>The Tennessee statute has been law since 1887. <em>See </em>Clemons v. State, 92 Tenn. 282, 21 S.W. 525 (1892). The earliest reference in Kentucky statutes was in 1915, \u00a7 1646. It should be noted also that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Circuit had expressly approved the practice for use in the federal district courts. <em>See, Shipp, supra. </em>Judges, both state and federal, in this Circuit were fully justified in relying on the long existence and approval of such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">A retrospective application of <em>Brooks </em>would have a considerable effect on the administration of justice. A blanket retroactive application of the new rule would put into question the convictions of all defendants in Tennessee and Kentucky state courts and the convictions of all defendants in at least some of the federal district courts in these two states. At the minimum, every prisoner would have the right to a hearing as to whether the error had been prejudicial. Whether the defendant had testified or not at his original trial, under <em>Brooks </em>his privilege against self-incrimination would have been narrowed. It should be noted that the <em>Brooks </em>defendant did not testify at all. Even if we were to adopt the contention that the retroactivity be applied only to those cases on direct appeal when <em>Brooks </em>was decided, there would be a significant effect on the administration of justice. Retrial or a hearing would be mandated for all those convictions obtained within, perhaps six months to a year prior to <em>Brooks </em>in two States and some district courts. This is particularly troublesome when it is realized that the <em>pre-Brooks </em>procedure had not significantly distorted the fact-finding process.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">It is contended that this court is bound, because of the treatment of those cases on direct appeal at the time Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), was decided, to apply the <em>Brooks </em>holding to this defendant whose case was in the direct appeal process at the time <em>Brooks </em>was handed down. This contention proceeds on two basic assumptions: 1) that <em>Brooks </em>was merely an extension of <em>Griffin </em>and because of that it is controlled by the same retroactivity decision as <em>Griffin </em>and 2) there is a distinction, for purposes of retroactivity, between cases pending in courts on post-conviction relief petitions and those in court on direct appeal. We feel that both of these assumptions are incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">We do not read <em>Brooks </em>as a mere extension of <em>Griffin, </em>which barred comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify in the trial. While both cases do rely on the privilege against self-incrimination, there are different practices involved in each of the cases. <em>Brooks </em>is not an extension of <em>Griffin </em>any more than all decisions turning on a violation of due process are extensions of any particular due process decision. At any rate, there have been other decisions founded on the privilege against self-incrimination which have not been retroactively applied, either to those on appeal or those whose convictions had become final. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), was founded on the privilege against self-incrimination and was held to be purely prospective. <em>Johnson, supra. </em>The determination of the retroactivity of <em>Brooks </em>should not hinge on whether the Supreme Court in <em>Brooks </em>cited <em>Miranda </em>or <em>Griffin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Implicit in the contention that <em>Brooks </em>must be applied to the instant case is the assumption that cases on direct appeal are different than cases before the Court on petition for post-conviction relief. While it is true that such a distinction was made in the application of <em>Griffin, compare Tehan, supra, </em>with O\u2019Connor v. Ohio, 385 U.S. 92, 87 S.Ct. 252, 17 L.Ed.2d 189 (1966), such a distinction is no longer valid in light of more recent Supreme Court decisions. Mr. Justice Harlan, in two strongly worded dissents, raised the same contentions. Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 675, 91 S.Ct. 1160, 28 L.Ed.2d 404 (1971); Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 256, 258-259, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969). The Supreme Court rejected the distinction both times,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> reiterating its rejection in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>Adams, supra, </em>where it stated that \u201cwe do not regard petitioner\u2019s case as calling for a contrary conclusion merely because his conviction is before us on direct review.\u201d 405 U.S. at 285, 92 S. Ct. at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Since <em>Griffin </em>was applied to those cases on direct appeal at the time of its decision, <em>O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>the Supreme Court at least four times has denied retroactive application of a new constitutional rule to a defendant on direct appeal. <em>Adams, supra; Williams, supra; Desist, supra; Stovall, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">We reemphasize that the purpose of <em>Brooks </em>was not the enhancement of the fact-finding process. There was a continued justified reliance on the <em>pre-Brooks </em>law in two of the four States in this Circuit. The effect of a retroactive application of <em>Brooks </em>would be major. We hold that <em>Brooks </em>is not to be applied retrospectively to trials conducted before its date of decision. We note that \u201cwe do not disparage a constitutional guarantee in any manner by declining to apply it retroactively.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>384 U.S. at 728, 86 S.Ct. at 1778.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The task of determining retroactivity of a Supreme Court decision presents a difficult problem for a Court of Appeals. This Court has undertaken this task a number of times. Sometimes we have been right. <em>See, e. g., </em>Turner v. United States, 426 F.2d 480 (6th Cir. 1970) cert. denied, 402 U.S. 982, 91 S.Ct. 1646, 29 L.Ed.2d 148 (1971), <em>accord., </em>Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971); In re Autorama Tool &amp; Die Co., 412 F.2d 369 (6th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1043, 90 S.Ct. 1349, 25 L.Ed.2d 654 (1971). Sometimes we have been wrong. <em>See, e. g., </em>Robinson v. Neil, 452 F.2d 370 (6th Cir. 1971) rev\u2019d, 409 U.S. 505, 93 S.Ct. 876, 35 L.Ed.2d 29 (1973) ; Miller v. United States, 437 F.2d 1199 (6th Cir.) vacated 402 U.S. 939, 91 S.Ct. 1637, 29 L.Ed.2d 107 (1971); Graham v. United States, 407 F.2d 1313 (6th Cir. 1969) vacated 402 U.S. 938, 91 S.Ct. 1623, 29 L.Ed.2d 107 (1971); United States ex rel. Shott v. Tehan, 337 F.2d 990 (6th Cir. 1964), vacated, 382 U.S. 406, 86 S.Ct. 459, 15 L.Ed.2d 453, rehearing denied, 383 U.S. 931, 86 S.Ct. 925, 15 L.Ed.2d 850 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">The issue of whether <em>Brooks </em>is to be applied retroactively, or only prospectively, already would have been settled with finality if the Supreme Court, at the time that opinion was announced, had made a determination as to whether that decision would be applied retroactively. <em>See </em>Mishkin, The Supreme Court 1964 Term, Forward: \u2014 The High Court, the Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, 79 Harv.L. Rev. 56, 64 (1965). It is noted that the Supreme Court at least once has addressed the retroactivity issue in the same case as the announcement of a new rule. Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 523, n. 22, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\"> In conclusion this court recognizes the doctrine of harmless constitutional error outlined in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed.2d 705, rehearing denied, 386 U.S. 987, 87 S.Ct. 1283, 18 L.Ed.2d 241 (1967), should not be used with a broad brush to justify any error by the District Court. However, we find this case particularly to be appropriate for the application of that doctrine. Even if <em>Brooks </em>is to be construed as fully retroactive, we conclude that the error in this trial was clearly harmless. The trial transcript reveals that the possession of the gun was admitted and the defense of the defendant, that he was not asked any questions by the clerk, was contradicted emphatically by the two defense witnesses, his companions at the store. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Even if it should be determined that <em>Brooks </em>should be applied retroactively, we hold that the conviction in the present case must be affirmed under <em>Chapman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-11\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6) reads as follows: <em>\u201c922.

The Supreme Court, this term, has given strong indications that the traditional <em>Linhletter </em>test for retroactivity, see discussion <em>infra, </em>may be inapplicable to the determination of the retroactivity of non-procedural decisions. Robinson v. Neil, 409 U.S. 505, 93 S.Ct. 876, 35 L.Ed.2d 29 (1973). In <em>Robinson, </em>a unanimous Court found <em>Linhletter </em>inapposite in determination of the retroactivity of Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 90 S.Ct. 1184, 25 L.Ed.2d 435, rehearing denied, 398 U.S. 914, 90 S.Ct. 1684, 26 L.Ed.2d 79 (1970), which announced new law on double jeopardy. The Court noted that the decision banning certain uses of the death penalty, Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), had been applied retrospectively, Walker v. Georgia and others, 408 U.S. 936, 92 S.Ct. 2845, 33 L.Ed.2d 753 (1972), without regard to <em>Linhletter. </em>Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707, (1969) which held the double jeopardy clause binding on the states, similarly was retroactively applied in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), without reference to the <em>Linhletter </em>analysis. This court is aware that the Seventh Circuit has already held <em>Bwher </em>retroactive. United States v. Strunk, 467 F.2d 969, 971 (7 Cir. 1972), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 412 U.S. 434, 93 S.Ct. 2260, 37 L.Ed.2d 56 (1973). It should also be noted that the Supreme Court has remanded two cases for reconsideration in light of <em>Bwher. </em>Campopiano v. United States, 408 U.S. 915, 92 S.Ct. 2487, 33 L.Ed.2d 328 (1972) ; Saglimbene v.

YOUNG, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ae74\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">I concur with the reasoning and the result of the majority opinion on the first three grounds and reach the same result on the fourth ground for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">In Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964), the United States Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment safeguards against self-incrimination are applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Subsequently, in Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), the Supreme Court reviewed whether comment by the prosecuting attorney on the defendant\u2019s failure to take the witness stand was within the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment protections. The Supreme Court, after recognizing that the decision whether the defendant should take the witness stand is one of gravest importance,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determined that a prosecutor\u2019s comments on the defendant\u2019s refusal to testify cannot stand in the face of the Fifth Amendment protections. Comment acts as a \u201cpenalty imposed by [the] courts for exercising a constitutional privilege [and it therefore] cuts down on the privilege [to remain silent] by making assertion costly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614, 85 S.Ct. at 1233. More recently, the Supreme Court was faced once again with insuring that the Fifth Amendment protections are meaningful. In Brooks v. Tennessee, 406 U.S. 605, 92 S. Ct. 1891, 32 L.Ed.2d 358 (1972), the Supreme Court reviewed, as the majority opinion correctly points out, Tennessee statutes of identical import to the Kentucky statute which the District Judge relied upon in making its \u201cfirst, if at all\u201d ruling in the present case. The Supreme Court, reaffirming its belief that the defendant\u2019s quandary whether to take the witness stand cannot be taken lightly, struck down the Tennessee statutes as unconstitutional, referring to <em>Malloy </em>and <em>Griffin. </em>This reference was not happenstance. The Court, in developing its reasoning for the <em>Brooks </em>decision, began by stating that the defendant has an absolute right \u201cto remain silent unless he chooses to speak, in the unfettered exercise of his own will, and to suffer no penalty . . . for such silence.\u201d <em>Brooks, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 609, 92 S.Ct. at 1893 citing from Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 8, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964). But although the defendant has this right, the choice to exercise it may pose serious dangers to the success of an accused\u2019s defense. For this reason, an enlightened judicial system must allow the defendant to weigh the pros and cons in deciding whether to testify. McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183, 213, 91 S.Ct. 1454, 1894, 28 L.Ed.2d 711 (1973). That decision, the Supreme Court continued, cannot be properly made at the close of the prosecutor\u2019s case, since:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-17\">a defendant may not know at the close of the State\u2019s case whether his own testimony will be necessary or even helpful to his cause. Rather than risk the dangers of taking the stand, he might prefer to remain silent at that point, putting off his testimony until its value can be realistically assessed. Yet, under the Tennessee rule, he cannot make that choice \u201cin the unfettered exercise of his own will.\u201d Section 40-2403 exacts a price for his silence by keeping him off the stand entirely unless he chooses to testify first. This, we think, easts a heavy burden on a defendant\u2019s otherwise unconditional right not to take the stand. The rule, in other words, \u201ccuts down on the privilege [to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>remain silent] by making its assertion costly.\u201d Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 614, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 1233, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">On the basis of this reasoning, I believe that <em>Griffin </em>and <em>Brooks </em>deal with the Supreme Court\u2019s assurance, originally established in <em>Malloy, </em>that a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination shall not be abridged during a trial, and not with the Supreme Court\u2019s exercise of its supervisory powers to establish the criteria so that an accused will be informed of his constitutional rights. <em>See </em>Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Since <em>Brooks </em>is a logical extension of <em>Griffin, </em>its prospectivity must be governed by <em>Griffin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The Supreme Court in determining the application of <em>Griffin </em>decided that it must be applied prospectively. Tehan v. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 86 S.Ct. 459, 15 L. Ed.2d 453 (1966). At this juncture, the Supreme Court defined prospectivity as being applicable to all cases not yet final and clearly dictated that <em>Griffin </em>was to be applied to all cases on direct appeal. O\u2019Connor v. Ohio, 385 U.S. 92, 87 S.Ct. 252, 17 L.Ed.2d 189 (1966). Between 1966 to the present time the definition of prospectivity has evolved metamorphically. Though all of the cases were found to be prospective, the time of application varies: Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966), applied Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), to all cases whose trials commenced after the date of the <em>Escobedo </em>decision; Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967), applied the rule of United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), and Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967), to line-ups conducted after the dates <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>were decided; Fuller v. Alaska, 393 U.S. 80, 89 S.Ct. 61, 21 L.Ed.2d 212 (1968), applied Lee v. Florida, 392 U.S. 378, 88 S.Ct. 2096, 20 L.Ed.2d 1166 (1968), to evidence not yet introduced at trial when <em>Lee </em>was decided; Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971), applied Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), to all searches subsequent to the date <em>Chimel </em>was decided; and in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed. 2d 484 (1972), the Supreme Court decided that its ruling should be applied in future revocations of parole. <em>Id. </em>at 490, 92 S.Ct. 2593. Prospectivity has now evolved to mean that the \u201crule\u201d enunciated by the Supreme Court shall be applied henceforth to the critical stage involving the protected constitutional right.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The majority has carefully examined the application of <em>Brooks </em>under the three-pronged test enunciated in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965). This test was also carefully examined by the Supreme Court in <em>Tehan </em>when determining the retroactivity of <em>Griffin. </em>If one accepts that <em>Brooks </em>is a logical extension of <em>Griffin, </em>one cannot come to a result inapposite to <em>Tehan. </em>Since <em>Tehan </em>applied <em>Griffin </em>prospectively then <em>Brooks </em>must be applied prospectively. But since the definition of prospectivity has evolved from \u201ccases not yet final\u201d at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>time <em>Tehan </em>was decided to \u201cfrom this day forward\u201d when <em>Morrissey </em>was decided, the ultimate application of <em>Brooks </em>must be different from <em>Griffin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">In attempting to avoid what it considers to be the ruling in <em>Tehan, </em>it seems to me that the majority opinion strains unnecessarily to disassociate <em>Brooks </em>from <em>Griffin, </em>for the result in <em>Tehan </em>is in complete accord with the remainder of the majority\u2019s opinion. <em>Tehan </em>found <em>Griffin </em>to be prospective. The majority does the same with <em>Brooks. </em>The dispute involved here is not with the application of the tests to determine retrospectivity or prospectivity but solely with the definition of prospectivity. As stated above, this definition has been altered over the past several years so that today prospectivity means something different than it meant when <em>Tehan </em>was decided. This, however, does not impair the determination made in <em>Tehan. </em>It only affects the point at which the determination is implemented. For these reasons I agree with the conclusion of the majority but eschew the extreme methods that they have chosen to arrive at it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\">. See Wilson v. United States, 149 U.S. 60, 65-68, 13 S.Ct. 765, 37 L.Ed. 650 (1893) ; United States v. Shipp, 359 F. 2d 185, 190 (6th Cir. 1966) (dissenting opinion) ; and Bell v.

For example, the Supreme Court in <em>Escobedo </em>sought to prevent certain types of in-custody interrogation by not allowing statements obtained at the interrogation into evidence at the trial. The critical stage of this protection was the trial and <em>Johnson </em>applied the rule of <em>Escobedo </em>to all trials commenced after <em>Escobedo </em>was announced. Whereas in <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert, </em>the critical time was the line-up and <em>Stovall </em>applied the rule of <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>to all line-ups conducted after <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>were announced. The critical stage that <em>Brooks </em>seeks to protect is when the state rests and the defense decides its order of witnesses. <em>Brooks </em>should apply to this \u201ccritical stage\u201d occurring after the decision of <em>Brooks </em>was announced. Since petitioner\u2019s trial was over on the day preceding the decision of <em>Brooks, </em>the critical stage had passed and <em>Brooks </em>cannot apply to his case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
