At all three trials the Government\u2019s case rested almost entirely on identification testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>ny, there being no other significant evidence to connect Fernandez with the crime. At the first trial, before Judge Bruchhausen, the jury disagreed. On the second trial, before Judge Costantino, there was a guilty verdict, but we reversed the conviction because of \u201cthe combined effect of the error in admitting the [impermissibly suggestive] photographic identification testimony, in failing to give a cautionary instruction on the danger of misidentification and in requiring defense counsel to make her objections to the charge in the presence of the jury . . .\u201d in clear violation of F.R.Cr.P. 30, United States v. Fernandez, 456 F.2d 638, 642 (2 Cir. 1972); familiarity with that opinion is assumed. The third trial took place before Judge Travia, and the jury again brought in a guilty verdict. Although the evidence was ample to justify this, we are reluctantly constrained to reverse because of what we think some jurors could well have considered partisan conduct by the judge on the core issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">I. <em>Speedy Trial Rules</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Before taking up other matters we must deal with one contention of the defendant which, if correct, would invalidate not only the trial leading to the conviction under review but, in all likelihood, a subsequent one. This is that the government was not ready for retrial within the period stipulated by the Second Circuit Rules regarding Prompt Disposition of Criminal Cases. While Rules 3 and 6 require that, in cases where a defendant is detained, as Fernandez was, the government must be ready within 90 days \u201cfrom the date when the order occasioning the retrial becomes final,\u201d in this instance March 17, 1972, defense counsel took the position, as she still does, that it was enough that the government be ready within six months. Since Rule 3 provides simply <em>for discharge </em>of a defendant held in custody when the government is not ready within 90 days, and Rule 4 alone provides for <em>dismissal </em>of the charges against a defendant when the government is not ready within 6 months, rights based on the 90-day period were clearly waived. Rule 8. It further appears that during at least some of this time defendant was detained in state prison on an entirely separate offense, in which case the detention provisions of Rule 3 by their own terms do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">The government announced its readiness for trial no later than July 7, 1972, less than four months after the order for retrial had become final. More than a month of this delay was excludable because of pretrial motions under Rule 5(a); indeed two such motions were- heard on the very day when the government announced its readiness. While defendant argues that the government cannot claim it was \u201cready\u201d when it had not complied with orders to turn over evidence, we have no reason to doubt that if in July the court had set the case for early trial, the government would have complied. Although the trial did not begin until November 8,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we thus find no violation of the Second Circuit Rules. We add, however, that there should be no such long interval between the filing of our order of remand and the fourth trial we are directing.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">II. <em>Place of Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">Another matter deserves discussion before we proceed to the point that we deem to require reversal. The District Court for the Eastern District of New York is authorized to sit not only at its headquarters in Brooklyn, but also in Mine\u00f3la and Westbury, Long Island. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(c). Judge Travia and Senior Judge Zavatt have sat regularly at Westbury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Individual Assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>and Calendar Rules for the Eastern District provide that cases shall be assigned to all judges on a random basis, with the result that the judges sitting at Westbury may be initially assigned a case where trial in Brooklyn would be more convenient. Under Rule 1.1(b), a criminal case may be designated as a \u201cWest-bury case\u201d if the crime is alleged to have been committed in whole or in substantial part in Nassau or Suffolk counties or \u201cif the interests of justice so require\u201d; however, Rule 1.1(d) provides that \u201c[t]he assigned judge shall have discretion to designate a case as a Westbury case\u2019 whether or not any of the parties desire such designation,\u201d and that such designation or the lack of it \u201cdoes not require that judge to conduct proceedings in the case in whole or [in] part at any particular place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The instant case having been assigned to Judge Travia in Westbury, defendant moved on March 28, 1972 for its reassignment to Brooklyn since the crime was committed in Queens County. We perceive no sound reason for the denial of the motion. There is not the slightest indication why \u201cthe interests of justice\u201d required trial at a point 26 miles away from the headquarters of the court and the United States Attorney, and nearly that much further away from the office of defense counsel in Manhattan. According to Fernandez\u2019 affidavit on the transfer motion \u2014 not contradicted by the government in this respect \u2014 none of the principal witnesses lived in Nassau County or in a place to which Westbury, without public transportation, was easily accessible. So far as the record shows, the only person convenienced by trial at Westbury was the judge. Denial of the motion to reassign the case seems to have violated the second sentence of F.R.Cr.P. 18,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we might well have reversed on this ground alone if defendant had been able to show any prejudice. While he made no attempt to do this except on the matter of jury selection, that and other claims relating to trial at Westbury should be discussed since they may create problems in future cases unless corrective measures are taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">There is no merit in Fernandez\u2019 most extreme argument, namely, that by having been tried in Westbury rather than Brooklyn, he was deprived of rights under Article III, Section 2 and the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, and under the first sentence of F.R. Crim.P. 18. Both the Sixth Amendment and the first sentence of Rule 18 speak of a right to trial in the <em>district </em>where the crime occurred; since the theft of which Fernandez was convicted occurred in Queens, in the Eastern District of New York, trial in Westbury, in Nassau County, a county adjacent to Queens and within the District, rather than in Brooklyn, the headquarters of the Eastern District, does not offend the terms of these venue requirements. Indeed, Rule 18 was amended in 1966 to eliminate an earlier requirement that the trial take place in the district <em>and division </em>where the crime occurred. The Advisory Committee suggesting the change relied on dictum in Supreme Court opinions indicating that trial within the district but not within the division was constitutionally permissible, see United States v. Anderson, 328 U.S. 699, 66 S. Ct. 1213, 90 L.Ed. 1529 (1946), on which lower federal courts have also relied, see Lafoon v. United States, 250 F.2d 958 (5th Cir. 1958); United States v. Par-tin, 320 F.Supp. 275 (E.D.La.1970). It follows <em>a fortiori </em>that when a district is not separated into divisions, like the Eastern District of New York, trial at any place within the district is allowable under the Sixth Amendment and the first sentence of F.R.Cr.P. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">However, satisfaction of this rather simple requirement need not pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>elude further inquiry into the propriety of what was done here. In its most extensive discussion of the venue requirements of the Sixth Amendment, United States v. Johnson, 323 U.S. 273, 65 S.Ct. 249, 89 L.Ed. 236 (1944), the Supreme Court has suggested a number of principles and policies embodied therein.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Two of these \u2014 that the provision avoids \u201cthe unfairness and hardship to which trial in an environment alien to the accused exposes him,\u201d United States v. Johnson, <em>supra, </em>323 U.S. at 275, 65 S.Ct. at 250; see also United States v. Cores, 356 U.S. 405, 407, 78 S.Ct. 875, 2 L.Ed. 2d 873 (1958), and prohibits \u201cprosecution remote from home and from appropriate facilities for defense,\u201d United States v. Johnson, <em>supra, </em>323 U.S. at 275, 65 S.Ct. at 250; are somewhat undercut by clear holdings, compelled by the constitutional text, that trial must be in the district where the crime is committed rather than in a different one where the defendant resides. Platt v. Minnesota Min. &amp; Mfg. Co., 376 U.S. 240, 245, 84 S.Ct. 769, 11 L.Ed.2d 674 (1964); United States v. Bithoney, 472 F.2d 16, 22 (2 Cir. 1973).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, a third policy enunciated in <em>Johnson </em>\u2014 that too great leeway in the selection of a situs for trial \u201cleads to the appearance of abuses, if not to abuses, in the selection of what may be deemed a tribunal favorable to the prosecution,\u201d 323 U.S. at 275, 65 S. Ct. at 250, is pertinent to the trial at issue here, particularly since, this being a federal trial, we are not limited to the confines of the Sixth Amendment but can exercise our supervisory power, see Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187, 192, 67 S.Ct. 261, 91 L.Ed. 181 (1946). The holding of a criminal trial, over the objection of the defendant, in a place removed from the court\u2019s headquarters, having no relation to the place of the crime, and for no apparent reason other than the convenience of the judge, may \u201c[lead] to the appearance of abuses,\u201d and this is heightened by Fernandez\u2019 points concerning the selection of the jury to which we will now refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">Prior to the interrogation of the veniremen on <em>voir dire, </em>Fernandez moved \u2014apparently pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(a) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 to have testimony on the procedures used in selecting the array. Thereupon the Jury Clerk for the Eastern District of New York was called and testified at some length but, as will appear below, without great clarity, about the District\u2019s system in selecting and calling the venires. Following this testimony Fernandez offered to present witnesses who would testify concerning the ethnic, economic and age characteristics of the population affected by the selection procedures. This offer of proof was denied by the judge with the statement that he \u201ccould almost take judicial notice of [this] fact. All you do is look at the census reports, the last census reports of 1970 will give you those figures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">We think this denial was ill-advised.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the judge meant, which he hardly could have, that a reading of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Census figures would show the defendant\u2019s contention was necessarily without merit, we could not agree; as shown below, they indicate rather strongly that racial disparities were at least a possible outcome of the selection procedures. Further, under the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861 et seq., a number of possible challenges to the jury selection system could not be answered merely by reference to the racial composition of the district and to the procedures used.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The process for selecting veniremen under the Eastern District\u2019s Jury Selection Plan,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as it appeared from the testimony of the Jury Clerk, was as follows : The names of registered voters in the Eastern District are entered upon computer tape. From this list the computer regularly retrieves on a random basis a designated number of prospective veniremen. These are then sent questionnaires advising them of their duty to serve on a future petit jury. Initially, those who live more than 25 miles from the Federal Courthouse in Cadman Plaza, Brooklyn, are allowed, upon request, an automatic deferral on the basis of hardship.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Subsequently, when a trial is set for Westbury, jurors not already so deferred or otherwise excluded are allowed another chance at automatic deferral upon request if their residence is more than 25 miles from Westbury. Thus, if we understand the testimony of the Jury Clerk, this series of cumulative deferment allowances reaches the anomalous result that in Westbury trials the only area in which jurors are not allowed an automatic deferment on the basis of distance is, not a circle with a 25-mile radius from Westbury, but rather the area within two intersecting arcs encompassing towns within 25 miles of <em>both </em>Westbury and Cadman Plaza.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Federal policies of fair and impartial jury selection procedures were most eloquently stated in Thiel v. Southern Pac. Co., 328 U.S. 217, 220, 66 S.Ct. 984, 985, 90 L.Ed. 1181 (1946):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-11\">The American tradition of trial by jury, considered in connection with either criminal or civil proceedings, necessarily contemplates an impartial jury drawn from a cross-section of the community, [citations omitted] This does not mean, of course, that every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>jury must contain representatives of all the economic, social, religious, racial, political and geographical groups of the community; frequently such complete representation would be impossible. But it does mean that prospective jurors shall be selected by court officials without systematic and intentional exclusion of any of these groups. Recognition must be given to the fact that those eligible for jury service are to be found in every stratum of society. Jury competence is an individual rather than a group or class matter. That fact lies at the very heart of the jury system. To disregard it is to open the door to class distinctions and discriminations which are abhorrent to the democratic ideals of trial by jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Such language \u2014 in particular the phrase \u201ccross-section of the community\u201d \u2014 is helpful only as a description of rather than a solution to the problem of determining which jury selection <em>procedures </em>are permissible and which are not. On the one hand, it is clear that a criminal defendant in a federal court has no right to an individual panel represented by any particular racial, social, or economic group. United States v. Dennis, 183 F.2d 201, 224 (2 Cir. 1950), aff\u2019d, 341 U.S. 494, 71 S.Ct. 857, 95 L.Ed. 1137 (1951). Nor does one have a right to exact \u201cproportional representation\u201d in the array, United States v. Flynn, 216 F.2d 354, 388 (2 Cir. 1954) (Harlan, J.). And use of certain valid \u201cselective criteria\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> may \u201chave the inevitable effect of detracting from the representative character of venires.\u201d United States v. Leonetti, 291 F.Supp. 461, 474 (S.D.N.Y.1968). On the other hand, the Jury Selection and Service Act goes beyond prohibition of \u201cintentional\u201d distortions and provides that in certain cases affirmative measures must be undertaken to insure that \u201cjuries [are] selected at random from a fair cross section of the community . . . ,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861, 1863(b)(2); H.R.Rep. No. 1076, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968), reprinted in 1968 U.S.Code Cong &amp; Adm.News, pp. 1792, 1794.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A determination whether the procedures here used sufficiently implemented the goals mandated by the Act, or evidenced signs of improper distortions in selection of the venires, could not have been adequately made without hearing additional testimony concerning the statistical composition of the popula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>tion and. of the venires. Although our disposition of this appeal on other grounds makes it unnecessary for us to determine whether the judge\u2019s refusal of the offer to introduce such proof would itself be reversible error, we would not wish to be understood as approving his decision not to hear evidence that might have a bearing on this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">In particular, it seems to us that the combination of the Eastern District\u2019s system of hardship allowances and of the holding of certain trials in Westbury rather than Brooklyn may well lead to departures from the prescriptions of the Jury Selection and Service Act. Hardship allowances based on distance from the courthouse are not in themselves suspect selection criteria. United States v. Kelly, 349 F.2d 720 at 778-779 (2 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 947, 86 S.Ct. 1467, 16 L.Ed.2d 544 (1966); United States v. Leonetti, <em>supra, </em>291 F.Supp. at 474.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, an excuse procedure based on distance, reasonable though this may be from the standpoint of the prospective juror, will have the inevitable effect of tending to concentrate the representation on the venire of those living relatively close to the courthouse.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although this may be without legal consequences when veniremen are selected for a single courthouse within a division or district, see United States v. Leonetti, <em>supra, </em>or when court is held in several places and cases are assigned because they rationally belong there, a more difficult problem is presented when the place of trial \u2014 and thus the area of likely concentration in the selection of a venire \u2014 is moved from its normal site, over objection, apparently for the sole convenience of the judge. Furthermore,- our reading of the gross census figures for the counties involved indicates that the impact of the move to Westbury on the relative incidence of representation of non-white minorities might well have been significant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> While the statistical significance and the legal relevance of the selection process cannot be adequately explored on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>record,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cthe appearance of abuses, if not . . . abuses, in the selection of what may be deemed a tribunal favorable to the prosecution,\u201d United States v. Johnson, <em>supra, </em>enhances our disfavor toward the decision to conduct this trial at Westbury over defendant\u2019s objection. We earnestly suggest that the questions canvassed in this section of the opinion, which we have found Unnecessary here to decide, receive the immediate attention of the judges of the Eastern District.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">III. <em>The Conduct of the Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">In order to place the issue of the judge\u2019s conduct of the trial in its setting, it is necessary to summarize the evidence with respect to the identification of Fernandez as one of the robbers, since the issue was even more closely contested at the third trial than at the second. Indeed, defense counsel asks that, in the light of the new evidence presented, we reconsider this court\u2019s previous ruling that the impermissibly suggestive photographic identification did not preclude the bank employees from making an in-court identification at a retrial, <em>456 </em>F.2d at 642-643.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Our ruling was based in considerable part on what seemed a strong resemblance between a photograph of Fernandez taken after his arrest on February 18, 1971, and the robber shown in the photographs by the bank\u2019s surveillance camera as standing on the bank floor, near a sign announcing that the bank would be closed on December 25 and an American flag \u2014 despite the fact that the surveillance photographs disclosed only the left side of the robber\u2019s face. The main point advanced against this at the second trial was that the robber in the surveillance photographs appeared to be at most of medium height, as several bank employees had said, whereas Fernandez was 6\u2019 tall. This was what made it important for the defense to have \u201cmaterial allegedly in the Government\u2019s files showing the dimension of the interior of the bank so as to permit a calculation of the height of the man wearing the dark pea jacket in the surveillance photographs.\u201d 456 F.2d at 643 n. 4. At the third trial both sides adduced expert evidence on this issue. The government\u2019s witness was Special Agent Webb of the F.B.I., with many years of experience in the examination of bank surveillance films. Starting from the apparently conceded premise that' the angle at which the surveillance camera was positioned would necessarily distort heights as they appeared in photographs, he testified that by superimposing photographic transparencies of various frames of the surveillance film onto other frames and comparing other individuals of known height shown in the film in the same position relative to the camera as the robber in the pea jacket, he could estimate the height of the robber as between 5' 10\" and 6' 2\". He also testified that the shape and contours of various facial characteristics of the robber shown in the surveillance photographs as wearing the pea jacket and cap and the set of the pea jacket with respect to the neck and shoulders were identical or wholly consistent with those in Fernandez\u2019 post-arrest photograph. To counter this impressive testimony the defense called William Vandivert, an experienced professional photographer, who was allowed to testify as an expert in identification after lengthy interrogation by counsel and the court into his qualifications. Using a process similar to that employed by Webb, Vandivert superimposed a transparency of a bank official whose height was variously determined to be 6' or <em>6' </em>2\" over the surveillance photographs of the robber in the dark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>pea jacket, and attempted to demonstrate that the robber was six inches shorter than the official. Vandivert also compared observable facial characteristics appearing in the surveillance photographs of the alleged Fernandez, including the shape of the nose and the lips, and concluded that they differed markedly from the characteristics appearing in police photos of Fernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The other new evidence on identification at the third trial was this: At the second trial the government had offered a number of photographs excerpted from the surveillance film, which as now appears, had been cropped in such a way as not to reveal clearly the position of the alleged Fernandez relative to the desks of the two identifying bank employees, Mrs. Kalata and Mr. Pesch. At the third trial, after having finally obtained from the government on the eve of trial what is claimed to have been an exceedingly poor copy of the surveillance film, defense counsel subpoenaed from the Holmes Detective Agency a better copy which was displayed to the jury and which this court witnessed in the presence of counsel. In hundreds of frames this film shows a minute and a quarter of the robbery, starting at some indeterminable time after the robbers had entered the bank and ending as the robber identified as the defendant backed out of the camera\u2019s range while he covered the flight of the three other robbers. The point strongly urged by defense counsel is that whereas Mrs. Kalata and Mr. Pesch had been certain that the robber identified as Fernandez was standing immediately in front of Mrs. Kalata\u2019s desk, save for a brief interval when he moved toward the middle of the floor, the surveillance film shows the robber identified as Fernandez always in the middle of the floor until his exit and no one else in that position. The government\u2019s response was that the camera had not gone into operation at the beginning of the robbery (as was evidently true, since the first frame shows two of the robbers already busy behind the tellers\u2019 windows), and, implicitly, that while Mrs. Kalata and Mr. Pesch may have been overly positive in their recollection how long the robber they identified as Fernandez had remained near Mrs. Kalata\u2019s desk, this was a matter for the jury. Although we adhere to our ruling that the impermissibly suggestive photographic identification did not give rise to such a \u201csubstantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\u201d Simmons v. United States, 390 U. S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968), as to prevent Mrs. Kalata and Mr. Pesch from making a valid in-court identification and will not do so on a new trial,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the introduction of the complete surveillance film and other possible inconsistencies in their testimony, to be discussed below, raised sufficient doubt about their testimony to convert what we had regarded as a rather clear case for the government, see 456 F.2d at 642, into a considerably closer one. This made it peculiarly necessary that the trial judge should not put the weight of his authority in the scales against the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The defendant\u2019s criticisms are of two sorts \u2014 a general claim that the judge participated unduly in the conduct of the trial, and a more particularized one that, especially by his treatment of the defense expert, Vandivert, he telegraphed to the jury his adverse view on central issues in the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Although on the former issue defense counsel places primary reliance on United States v. DeSisto, 289 F.2d 833, 834 (2 Cir. 1961), she has furnished no statistics of the number of questions directed to witnesses by counsel and by the judge such as were there presented. We have not undertaken to perform that task for the trial as a whole; numbers alone do not furnish a \u201chandy tool with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>which to gauge a claim that a judge\u2019s conduct improperly has shifted the balance against a defendant.\u201d United States v. Nazzaro, 472 F.2d 302, 304 (2 Cir. 1973). Compare United States v. McCarthy, 473 F.2d 300 (2 Cir. 1972). Although some of the judge\u2019s questions were clearly for the purpose of clarification, this rubric does not cover a number of his interventions. Among these were his examination which minimized the testimony of Patrolman Arena, whom the defense had called to show that the bank manager, O\u2019Connor, had given 5' 6\" as the height of the robber identified as Fernandez; his lengthy, and wholly unnecessary, additions to the government\u2019s cross-examination of defendant\u2019s alibi witnesses Chasson and Rop\u00e9r; and his similar addition to the cross-examination of defense witness Villalobos.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Before any of these incidents had occurred, the extent of the court\u2019s questioning during the prosecution\u2019s case led the Assistant United States Attorney to remark, on one occasion when a government witness had been turned over to him for direct questioning, that he would proceed \u201cunless the Court would prefer to question him.\u201d Even if the Assistant\u2019s remark was jocular, the impression of some sort of partnership between the prosecution and the judge was unmistakable. Moreover, although the judge declined the invitation to begin the interrogation, after the Assistant had examined the witness to the extent of two pages of the transcript the judge took over for another thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The episodes thus far recited do not jibe with our notion of the proper role of a federal judge in a criminal trial. The Supreme Court noted long ago that \u201cunder any system of jury trials the influence of the trial judge on the jury is necessarily and properly of great weight, and that his lightest word or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling.\u201d Starr v. United States, 153 U.S. 614, 626, 14 S.Ct. 919, 923, 38 L.Ed. 341 (1894). Even if the judge thinks the performance of the Assistant United States Attorney has been inadequate, and we do not suggest here that it was, it is not his business to step in; there is too much danger that the jury will regard him as associated with the prosecution and be swayed accordingly. As Judge Learned Hand observed in United States v. Marzano, 149 F.2d 923, 926 (2 Cir. 1945), while the judge may examine witnesses, or occasionally even call them, \u201che must not enter the lists.\u201d See also Jackson v. United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 325, 329 F.2d 893, 894 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">However, we need not face the hard question whether these incidents would demand reversal if they stood alone. What tips the scale is the judge\u2019s treatment of the defense expert Vandivert. Although this portion of the record needs to be read in its entirety to appreciate the full flavor of the judge\u2019s seeming antagonism, we must be content with the extracts quoted in the appendix. While on one or two occasions the judge seems to have taken over the questioning in order to head off browbeating by the Assistant United States Attorney, whom he urged to cool off, and although Mr. Vandivert did not always give as direct answers as might have been desirable, it is impossible not to fear that the judge\u2019s repeated, lengthy and occasionally angry interventions<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> gave at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>some jurors the impression that he considered the testimony unworthy of belief. The judge\u2019s questioning of Van-divert is quite reminiscent of the kind of interrogation which we held to require reversal in United States v. Brandt, 196 F.2d 653 (2 Cir. 1952) (Clark, J.), despite a contention by the government that all was cured by the standard charge that the jury\u2019s own view of the evidence controlled. In United States v. Curcio, 279 F.2d 681, 682 (2 Cir. 1960), Judge Clark again reminded that a federal judge not only \u201cmust not interfere for a merely partisan purpose\u201d; he must not \u201cpermit even the appearance of such an interference.\u201d While we held in <em>Curcio </em>that the judge cured any excesses by his repeated admonitions to the jurors of their responsibilities, we have become increasingly sensitive to the danger that jurors may \u201chave been impressed with the trial judge\u2019s partiality to one side to the point that this became a factor in the determination of the jury.\u201d United States v. Guglielmini, 384 F.2d 602, 605 (2 Cir. 1967); see also United States v. Grunberger, 431 F.2d 1062, 1067-1068 (2 Cir. 1970). Compare Blunt v. United States, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 266, 244 F.2d 355, 365-368 (1957). If there is an uneasy tension between the principle that the judge may not appear to assume the role of an advocate and Sir Matthew Hale\u2019s extolling the ability of the common law judge to give the jury \u201chis opinion even in matters of fact,\u201d History of the Common Law, 291-292, quoted in Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466, 469, 53 S.Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933), see 8 Moore, Federal Practice jj 30.09 (1972), Chief Justice Hughes\u2019 opinion in <em>Quercia </em>indicates it is the latter that must yield. As was there said, the judge must conduct the trial \u201cin conformity with the standards governing the judicial office\u201d; he \u201cmay analyze and dissect the evidence, but he may not either distort it or add to it.\u201d 289 U.S. at 470, 53 S.Ct. at 699. Whatever may have been true in Sir Matthew Hale\u2019s time, we doubt that a guilty verdict rendered after the judge had told the jury that he considered a defense witness an unmitigated liar would be sustained by the Supreme Court today. When a judge interrupts the testimony of an important defense witness or interrogates him in a manner reflecting the judge\u2019s disbelief to the extent that was done with the witness Vandivert, he is departing from the standard laid down in <em>Quercia </em>for the conduct of criminal trials. The superimposition of this upon the incidents we have previously noted and others, while not so egregious as in United States v. Nazzaro, <em>supra, </em>472 F. 2d at 310-313, demands a new trial if the high reputation of federal criminal justice and the policy of complete and even-handed fairness for the defendant are to be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">IV. <em>Other Points</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Of the many additional points of error claimed by defense counsel, it is necessary to consider only those that are likely to affect the next, and what we devoutly hope will be the last, trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">(1) On January 18, 1971, Special Agent Sweeney of the F.B.I. had made an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant which averred that \u201ctwo unrelated individuals\u201d had identified three of the perpetrators shown in the surveillance photographs as Jerome Reide, Arthur N. Teare and Horsun Howard. Teare was a light skinned black; his photograph was included in an array of five pictures submitted to bank employees on January 25, 1971, with negative results, see 456 F.2d at 641-642. In a pretrial motion defense counsel requested that the government be compelled to disclose the names of the two individuals. The government opposed on the ground that the individuals would be in grave jeopardy if their names were disclosed, and the court refused to compel disclosure. Defendant contends this violated the teaching of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and our holding in United States ex rel. Meers v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Wilkins, 326 F.2d 135 (2 Cir. 1964), that it was a violation of due process for a prosecutor to fail to turn over to the defense the affidavits of witnesses to a robbery that they had viewed Meers at police headquarters shortly thereafter and positively stated he was not one of the participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">For several reasons, we do not regard <em>Meers </em>as applicable. The persons whose statements were withheld in <em>Meers </em>were witnesses to the crime, not persons who had made an identification from photographs, and there was no assertion that disclosure involved any danger to them. The persons who identified the light-skinned black robber as Teare were in the status of informers who had already positively identified two of Fernandez\u2019 co-defendants from the surveillance photographs. In the face of the government\u2019s claim of danger to them from a disclosure of their identity, the case called \u201cfor balancing the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual\u2019s right to prepare his defense.\u201d Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 62, 77 S.Ct. 623, 628, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957). Here Fernandez has made no contention that Teare was one of the robbers; indeed, comparison of Teare\u2019s picture and the surveillance photographs would suffice to dispel this. The claim is not that the two unnamed individuals would stick to their identification of Teare and thereby exculpate Fernandez but rather that their presence as witnesses would permit the defense to develop that since two people erred in saying that the light-skinned robber was Teare, Mrs. Kalata, Mr. Pesch and the government expert, Mr. Webb, may have erred in saying he was Fernandez. Since the defense is already in a position to do this, sufficiently although perhaps not quite as effectively, by examining Sweeney, the prejudice arising from the nondisclosure of the informants\u2019 identities is relatively slight.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">(2) Agent Sweeney had made up from the surveillance pictures an exhibit of isolated views of each of the four robbers. On direct examination, the prosecutor asked him to \u201cput the name of each individual above that picture.\u201d When defense counsel objected, the court asked \u201cThose are pictures of four people you know to be people whose names you put on?\u201d and, on receiving an affirmative answer, allowed the witness to write the names, including Fernandez\u2019, above the photographs, received the exhibit in evidence, and allowed it to be shown to the jury. This was clear error since Sweeney had no personal knowledge and his statements were thus pure hearsay. Nor had he been allowed to testify as an expert qualified to compare the surveillance photographs with known photographs of Fernandez. Very Tikely the jury took this into account, but the error should not be repeated on the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">(3) Defense counsel objected, on grounds of irrelevancy and prejudice, to the court\u2019s receiving in evidence the .45 fully loaded automatic pistol and ammunition, the pea coat, and $480 in bills found on Fernandez\u2019 arrest, see 456 F.2d at 639. The objections to admissions of the gun, the ammunition and the pea coat are plainly without merit. Admission of the bills is a closer question. Forty-seven days had elapsed between the bank robbery and the arrest, and Fernandez claimed, although not very persuasively, that he had earned the money. While the evidence had some minimal relevancy, that is not the end of the inquiry, since there was a substantial possibility of prejudicial impact on the jury. Our own answer to the further question, \u201cIs its value worth what it costs,\u201d McCormick, Evidence 438-39 (1972 ed.), would differ from the trial judge\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">(4) Although defense counsel had not previously challenged the validity of Fernandez\u2019 arrest, see 456 F.2d at 639, as distinguished from the search and seizure, she now does so. The attack could well be regarded as untimely under F.R.Cr.P. 41(e), especially since the lapse of time has caused the government to be unable to locate the affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>supporting the arrest warrant. Although the prime purpose of the Rule is to avoid the interruption of trials, its letter goes beyond this and it is reasonable to demand that attacks on an arrest and an incidental search and seizure should be made before recollections have become too dimmed and documents have been lost. In any event invalidity of the arrest is arguably without consequence in view of our holding, 456 F.2d at 640, that Mrs. Fernandez consented to the entry and search; although the consent came after the seizure of the ammunition, the bills and the pea jacket, it was broad enough to include these. Finally, Sweeney\u2019s testimony that three informants of previous reliability, in addition to Arthur Teare,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> had identified Fernandez from the surveillance pictures constituted probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">(5) Defense counsel makes the standard objection that the government expert Webb should not have been allowed to express an opinion on the \u201cultimate\u201d issue of identity which was to be decided by the jury. Any such rule has long since been abandoned, for reasons stated in 7 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1920-21 (3d ed. 1940), and McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 12 (1972 ed.), although, of course, the jury must be properly instructed as to its function. The contrary statement in United States v. Spaulding, 293 U.S. 498, 506, 55 S.Ct. 273, 79 L.Ed. 617 (1935), must be regarded as an aberrational departure from the permissive rule earlier announced in Transportation Line v. Hope, 95 U.S. 297, 24 L.Ed. 477 (1877). The federal courts have chosen to follow <em>Hope </em>and ignore <em>Spaulding. </em>See, in addition to the Wigmore and McCormick treatises, Carlson v. Chisholm-Moore Hoist Corp., 281 F.2d 766, 772 (2 Cir. 1960), and cases there cited; Proposed Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">(6) We likewise see no basis for objection to the government\u2019s asking two bank employees whether they had identified the other three robbers as Horsun Howard, Jerome Reide and Johnny Sellers. This was relevant in view of testimony that Fernandez had admitted acquaintanceship with Reide and Howard, and that one of his alibi witnesses knew Howard and the others, Reide and Sellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">(7) Related to the defense argument that the robber identified as Fernandez was not standing where Mrs. Kalata and Mr. Pesch had placed him, defense counsel makes strenuous objection to the alteration of a diagram of the bank, introduced as Exhibit 1 in the first and second trials and as Exhibit N at the third, by the government\u2019s \u201cwhitening\u201d two places where Mr. Pesch had put marks. The \u201cwhitening\u201d appears to have been to permit use of the exhibit at the trial of another robber and, as the government concedes, was an inexcusable breach of the duty of counsel to keep exhibits left in their custody inviolate so long as there is any possibility of need for their reuse.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Defense counsel complains that during the first trial, before Judge Bruchhausen, Mr. Pesch marked on what is now Exhibit N as \u201cP 2\u201d the spot where a robber <em>other </em>than the one Pesch now identifies as Fernandez was standing; that no \u201cP 2\u201d can now be seen on the exhibit but that a whitening appears where the alleged Fernandez stands in the surveillance film. Although there is indeed a whitening in this spot, it is now in the process of peeling off because of handling and there appears to be a \u201cP\u201d and quite possibly a \u201cP 2\u201d underneath. We thus do not think defense counsel will be handicapped in making this argument, which indeed she advanced in the present trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">The other claim is that at the second trial, before Judge Costantino, Mr. Pesch was asked to indicate on Exhibit N where Fernandez was during the robbery, to which he responded \u201cUp in this area (indicating).\u201d At the judge\u2019s request he then put an \u201cFF\u201d on the spot. Counsel says that the \u201cFF\u201d was whitened over, a fair inference since it is not to be found on the exhibit, and that the \u201cFF\u201d was in a spot <em>behind </em>the teller\u2019s windows now covered by a whitening and a \u201cP.\u201d At the third trial Mr. Pesch was shown the \u201cP\u201d and he denied having made it. In the present state of the exhibit it is impossible to tell where Mr. Pesch had placed the \u201cFF\u201d; there are other \u201cwhitenings\u201d in addition to the two here discussed. The government should give the defense all possible aid in attempting to restore the exhibit to the form it was in after the second trial, perhaps, if the defense desires, by hiring a disinterested expert in an attempt to remove the various whitenings. However, we are unwilling to hold that if this should fail, Fernandez would be entitled to dismissal of the indictment; this will be for the district judge to determine in the first instance, on all the evidence before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">As previously indicated, it is important to the interests of justice that, whatever the outcome, Fernandez\u2019 fourth trial should be the last. To that end we strongly urge some lowering of temperature on the part of counsel for both sides. Defense counsel seems to have been convinced that the government was pursuing a studied course of balking at the disclosure of evidence to which the defense was entitled; the prosecution seems to have been equally convinced that all this was a ploy designed to prevent a trial or make a record for appeal. We suggest that counsel put away such ideas, no matter how sincerely held, and recognize that while each has a task to perform with vigor and determination, this is not inconsistent with due regard and cooperation. In particular we urge the government to be forthcoming in disclosure except when, as in the case of the informants discussed in Section IV(1) above, this might entail danger to other persons or the drying up of important sources of information. If the government can help the defense locate the former bank employee, Anthony Benjamin, it should do so; if it cannot, the record on that subject should be plain. We are unclear what has happened to the list of 30 persons in the bank at the time of the robbery<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the list of nine made up by Agent Sweeney in the course of the first trial, see 456 F.2d at 643 n. 4. If these still exist, they should be promptly made available; if they do not, the government should explain how they disappeared. We observe finally that methods of cross-examination by a prosecutor popularized by television should not be the norm for the court room; while cross-examination may be vigorous, witnesses deserve to be treated with proper respect.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>The judgment of conviction is reversed for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">During cross-examination on Vandivert\u2019s qualifications to estimate the robber\u2019s height by the process described above, the following occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The Court: In other words, this is the first time using a transparency?</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The Witness: Using a transparency. However, I have' \u2014 and I did the other day in projection make \u2014 make an \u2014 make a tracing, and came to some conclusions as to \u2014 as to height.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">The Court: How do you do that? I want to hear this.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">The Witness: This is \u2014 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">The Court: Now let\u2019s not go off into something else. Let\u2019s go to what you just said.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">The Witness: I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m saying that this is not the sort of thing that one can give an estimate in evidence\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">The Court: Now, I didn\u2019t ask you that opinion, Mr. Vandivert.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">The Witness: Vandivert.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">The Court: You\u2019re smart enough to know that there is such a thing as answering a question.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">The Witness: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-16\">The Court: So don\u2019t throw in a kettle</p>\n<p id=\"b808-17\">The Witness: I\u2019m not.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-18\">The Court: (continuing) \u2014 -when you talk about peaches and apples, don\u2019t throw an apple in the way of a peach then by using your own expression. Answer my question.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-19\">The Witness: I \u2014 I made \u2014 I made an estimate based on my knowledge of \u2014 of 35 millimeter lenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-21\">The Court: Looking at a picture?</p>\n<p id=\"b808-22\">The Witness: Looking at a picture. The Court: Just looking at a picture you can tell me how high or how tall- \u2014 \u2022 The Witness: I 'said to you earlier, your Honor, that I could not tell height without a comparison. And this is the first time I\u2019ve had an honest comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-23\">The Court: Then how did you do it previous to this if you didn\u2019t use a transparency, how did you do it before? That\u2019s all I asked you, and please stick to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-24\">The Witness: I couldn\u2019t do it scientifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-25\">The Court: You couldn\u2019t do it. That\u2019s all I want to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-27\">Although Vandivert had made clear that the only conclusion by which he would stand was that the light skinned robber was 6\" shorter than O\u2019Connor, who he thought was 6\u2019 tall, pages were devoted to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b808-28\">The Court: Supposing you were told he was 6-2, would that make the bank robber 8 inches smaller rather than 6?</p>\n<p id=\"b808-29\">The Witness: I have said that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b808-30\">The Court: You said 6 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-31\">The Witness: I believe there is six inches difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-32\">The Court: Based upon the 6 feet?</p>\n<p id=\"A2W\">The Witness: Based upon\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b808-33\">The Court: That would make him 5-6, you said that?</p>\n<p id=\"b808-34\">The Witness: No. Your Honor, I thought there was six inches difference between the two men and that would obviously make the bank robber somewhere possibly around 5 feet 8 or if O\u2019Connor was 6 feet 2\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>The Court: Didn\u2019t you say in answer to one of my questions that he was 6 inches shorter than Mr. O\u2019Connor ?</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The Witness: I said that he was six inches shorter and I have just finished saying that if O\u2019Connor is six feet two, that would make my estimate of the bank robber\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The Court: No. This is based upon your information, based upon your opinion, based upon the photographs that you superimposed and you said on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The Witness: I have to go from a known fact about O\u2019Connor as the only index of height in the\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">The Court: What\u2019s the known fact that you used?</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The Witness: I used 6 feet or 6 feet 2. It doesn\u2019t matter. We can go from that. I say there is six inches between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">The Court: You used 6 feet\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">The Witness: I used six feet because that\u2019s the information that\u2019s been given to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">The Court: If you used six feet, is that the reason why you told me that he was six inches shorter ?</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">The Witness: No. My estimate of the difference in height between the two, in a comparison of the photographs and the transparency, is six inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">The Court: According to your own testimony, in other words, he could also be 5 foot 8?</p>\n<p id=\"b809-15\">The Witness: That\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">The Court: This so-called robber? Is that the robber?</p>\n<p id=\"b809-18\">The Witness: That is the bank robber here and Mr. O\u2019Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-19\">The Court: In other words, he could also be 5 foot 8?</p>\n<p id=\"b809-20\">The Witness: That\u2019s right, Your Honor. I am not trying to put a height to the bank robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-22\">The Court: Because you told me earlier you can\u2019t distinguish height from a photograph ?</p>\n<p id=\"b809-23\">Don\u2019t change that now.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-25\">The Witness: I won\u2019t change that. It can be done geometrically, but I am not competent to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-26\">Later the court interjected, without the slightest need:</p>\n<p id=\"b809-27\">The Court: You looked at the whole film and\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b809-28\">The Witness: I haven\u2019t had the time to go into this exhaustively or to get prints off the film.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-29\">The Court: You told us earlier\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b809-30\">The Witness: I haven\u2019t examined the films.

In understanding that two cumulative hardship excuses are allowed we may have been misled by the unclear presentation of the Jury Clerk and the haphazard questions put to him. As indicated in the text, if we have understood him correctly, a prospective venireman living in West-bury could be excused from sitting in a Westbury trial on the ground that he lived more than 25 miles from Brooklyn! I-Iowever, if we are wrong about that and only a single hardship excuse based on distance from Westbury alone is allowed, this would tend to exacerbate the problem of racial disparities between Brooklyn and Westbury panels, discussed below, since an even higher relative percentage of prospective veniremen would come from counties with a low incidence of non-white residents.

This was explained by the House Judiciary Committee which reported on the bill in the following language: \u201cThe bill requires that the voter lists be supplemented by other sources whenever they do not adequately reflect a cross section of the community.

Whether such affirmative measures are necessary only when there is evidence of \u201csystematic discrimination\u201d in the composition of the voting lists or also when voluntary voting patterns create a statistical deviation from the cross-section of the community seems to have created a difference of opinion among courts which have considered the problem.

For instance, we have here cited only gross, county-by-county statistics available in the 1970 Census. It <em>might </em>be demonstrated at a trial that areas affected by the 25 mile limit beyond which veniremen are allowed an automatic excuse from service do not, in fact, contain high densities of non-white population, in which case a tendency to diminish the representation of those areas would not tend to lower the incidence of non-white jurors on Westbury panels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b802-5\">. But for the excellence and clarity of the surveillance photographs we might have a different case. These photographs served, far better than a mere mental image, as the recollection of what the witnesses had seen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b803-6\">. Miss Villalobos was called to testify that, in an early phase of the investigation, FBI Agent Sweeney had attempted to pressure her into identifying the light skinned black in the surveillance photographs as her brother Arthur Teare. Her direct and cross-examination had taken six pages of the transcript; the court\u2019s took ten. This led to another question by the prosecutor, and six more pages of totally unnecessary examination by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b803-11\">. On cross-examination the judge asked 112 questions as against the prosecutor\u2019s 133. The six questions asked by defense counsel on redirect were followed by 103 questions from the court which can only be characterized as recross-examination. The government\u2019s reeross was then limited to two questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\">. Sweeney was uncertain whether his affidavit seeking an arrest warrant had mentioned two of the informants. Even if the arrest warrant was therefore invalid, none is required for a day-time arrest, even in a dwelling, which has been made on probable cause, especially when, as here, no force was used. United States v. Hall, 348 F.2d 837, 841 (2 Cir. 1965). Contrast Jones v. United States, 357 U.S. 493, 499-500, 78 S.Ct. 1253, 1257, 2 L.Ed.2d 1514 (1958) ; Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 474 (Stewart, J.), 492 (Harlan, J.), 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971), with respect to a \u201cforceful nighttime entry into a dwelling to arrest a person reasonably believed within, upon probable cause that he had committed a felony, under circumstances where no reason appears why an arrest warrant could not have been sought.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b806-13\">. This incident again calls in question the practice of permitting counsel to retain exhibits. See our remark in United States v. Silverman, 430 F.2d 106, 127 n. 2 (2 Cir. 1970), to which we referred in our earlier opinion in this case, 456 F.2d at 643 n. 4. On representations by some district courts that a uniform practice requiring all exhibits save those of unusual bulk to be left with the clerk would not be feasible, we adopted Local Rule \u00a7 11. If experiences like that here discussed should recur, reconsideration of that Rule may be needed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b807-5\">. The surveillance pictures confirm that such a list was made. Defense counsel . particularly emphasizes two orientals who, as the pictures show, had an especially good opportunity to observe the robber claimed to be Fernandez. The defense should be given their names if these are available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b807-11\">. In light of our holding in Part III, we are not obliged to pass on the defense\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>claims of prosecutorial misconduct. However, the summation by the Assistant who tried the case surely went to the verge and perhaps beyond it. As this court warned only last year, the use of \u201cfirst-name epithets at a defendant that might be commonplace in a second-rate movie or television script\u201d is \u201cbeneath the dignity of the United States Attorney\u2019s office and of the United States as a sovereign,\u201d United States v. Benter, 457 F.2d 1174, 1177 (2 Cir. 1972), notwithstanding the sincerity of the prosecutor\u2019s belief that the defendant is guilty or that perjury has been committed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
