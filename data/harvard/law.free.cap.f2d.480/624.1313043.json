Green lost federal grants and loans when the College determined that he was disqualified from receiving student benefits by his conduct on campus under the terms of section 504(a) of the 1968 Federal Higher Education Amendments (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1060 (a)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court held that the College has misconstrued section 1060(a), and that the hearing, which resulted in disqualification, did not satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>due process. The district court granted Green\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On appeal the College contends (1) that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction; (2) that the district court misconstrued section 1060(a) to require specific intent; and (3) that the evidence adduced at the hearing adequately supported the College\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">This action grows out of a turbulent student meeting held on May 9, 1969, in the cafeteria of Mt. San Antonio College. Students were excused from class to permit them to debate the allocation of student funds to the athletic department and to the Black Student Union. The budgetary issue was an outcrop of racial tensions on the campus, and the atmosphere of the debate was volatile. A student chairman was selected to establish orderly access to the microphone. Green had been previously allocated microphone time to express the views of the Black Student Union. After the chairman recognized Green and as he approached the microphone, one of the students, Stute, who was waiting his turn, yelled \u201cDon\u2019t let that nigger speak.\u201d The audience reacted with jostlings, shouting, and exchanges of obscenities and racial epithets. Green immediately responded by leaving the platform and by taking several swings at Stute. Fist fights then broke out throughout the hall and spilled over to adjoining areas. The meeting was stopped, and classes were canceled for the rest of the day. Green was later convicted in a court of record of battery for striking Stute.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Green transferred from Mt. San Antonio College to California Polytechnic College. On August 27, 1969, the College told him that he had been awarded $2400 in federal aid for the 1969-1970 academic year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A month later, the Dean of Students notified him that the Dean had decided that the incident at Mt. San Antonio disqualified him from federal assistance under section 1060(a). A perfunctory hearing was held confirming the Dean\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Green commenced this action pleading federal jurisdiction, <em>inter alia, </em>under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> combined with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While retaining jurisdiction, the district court ordered the College to conduct a new hearing. With a retired judge appointed by the College acting as hearing officer, the new hearing was held on August 13, 1970. The hearing officer found that Green had been convicted for battery after the effective date of section 1060(a), that the battery involved the use of force, that the battery \u201cprevented officials or students of such institution [from] engaging in their duties and pursuing their studies,\u201d and that such a crime \u201cwas of a serious nature and contributed to a substantial disruption ... at Mount San Antonio College.\u201d The College concluded that Green was ineligible for federal benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Green filed a complete transcript of the second hearing and moved for summary judgment. The district court decided that the College had acted under color of law, that Green had been denied due process because there was no evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>denee before the hearing officer to prove that Green\u2019s battery was of a \u201cserious nature\u201d within the meaning of section 1060(a) or to prove that Green had the requisite intent to prevent officials or students from engaging in their duties or pursuing their studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The College argues that it is immune from 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 because, in conducting the hearing, the College was acting pursuant to federal law and not under color of state law. The College is too modest about its role and too restrictive in its reading of the section 1983 script.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In enacting section 1060(a) and in providing federal aid to state college students, Congress did not reduce the College to the status of a federal hireling. The College was a participant in a federal-state cooperative venture of a kind that is increasingly familiar. Its role is analogous to that of state agencies administering other kinds of federally funded or cooperatively funded, social programs such as the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program. The Supreme Court has repeatedly found federal jurisdiction for challenges to the activities of state agencies administering federal programs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 combined with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. It has not mattered a jurisdictional whit that the agency was enforcing federal statutes, as well as pursuing state ends. <em>{E.g., </em>Carter v; Stanton (1972) 405 U.S. 669, 92 S.Ct. 1232, 31 L.Ed.2d 569; Townsend v. Swank (1971) 404 U.S. 282, 92 S.Ct. 502, 30 L.Ed. 448; Dandridge v. Williams (1970) 397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491; Rosado v. Wyman (1970) 397 U.S. 397, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442; Goldberg v. Kelly (1970) 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287; King v. Smith (1968) 392 U.S. 309, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\"> The \u201cunder color of law\u201d component of section 1983 is the equivalent of the state action requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment (United States v. Price (1966) 383 U.S. 787, 794-795 n. 7, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 16 L.Ed.2d 267) and it carries the same meaning as its criminal counterpart, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242. <em>E.g., </em>Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co. (1970) 398 U. S. 144, 152 n. 7, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed. 2d 142; United States v. Price, <em>supra </em>at 794-795 n. 7, 86 S.Ct. 1152; Monroe v. Pape (1961) 365 U.S. 167, 185, 212, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492. Recognizing these concepts as expansive,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Supreme Court has persistently refused to permit them to be shriveled by technicalities drawn from private law doctrines or to be emasculated by unnatural, artificial interpretations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>The College is a state institution. The state clothed it with authority to act; its officers and agents derived their authority to conduct the hearing from the College. \u201cMisuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law, is action taken \u2018under color of\u2019 state law.\u201d (United States v. Classic, <em>swpra, </em>313 U.S. at 325-326, 61 S.Ct. at 1043; <em>see also </em>Monroe v. Pape, <em>supra, </em>365 U.S. at 184, 81 S.Ct. 473; Williams v. United States (1951) 341 U.S. 97, 99, 71 S.Ct. 576, 95 L.Ed. 774; Screws v. United States (1945) 325 U.S. 91, 109, 112-113, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Kletschka v. Driver (2d Cir. 1969) 411 F.2d 436, 447-449, is closely in point. A Veterans Administration doctor brought a civil rights action against federal and state officials seeking redress for interference with his employment rights. He alleged that Veterans Administration officials conspired with a state medical school to cause his transfer from the veterans\u2019 hospital and his loss of a research grant. The court reversed summary judgment that had been awarded in favor of the state defendants, holding that the state officials acted under color of law. \u201cWhen the violation is the joint product of the exercise of a State power and a non-State power then the test under the Fourteenth Amendment and \u00a7 1983 is whether the state or its officials played a \u2018significant\u2019 role in the result. See Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 722 [81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45], ...\u201d (411 F.2d at 449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The actions of state officials caused Green\u2019s loss, and they acted under color of state law. Federal jurisdiction was appropriately laid under section 1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1343(3). <em>(Cf. </em>King v. Smith, <em>supra, </em>392 U.S. at 312 n. 3, 88 S.Ct. 2128; Wong v. Hayakawa (9th Cir. 1972) 464 F.2d 1282.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">The College next contends that the district court misconstrued section 1060(a) when it decided that Green was not ineligible for benefits unless he com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>mitted the battery for the purpose of disrupting campus activities. The statute provides that disqualification results from a determination by the College that a person \u201chas been convicted . of any crime . . . which involved the use of force . <em>to prevent officials or students in such </em>institution's] <em>from engaging in their duties or pursuing their studies, </em>and that such crime was of a serious nature and contributed to a substantial disruption of the administration of the institution <em>with respect to which such crime was committed. . . </em>. \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The College argues that the statute contains no provision for the specific intent element and that ineligibility is satisfied by proof that Green was convicted of battery, a crime involving force, and that his battery contributed to the disruption of the institution. The College\u2019s interpretation is unacceptable because it reads the italicized language out of the statute. The purpose of the statute, read contextually, was to withdraw federal aid from a student whose crime was committed to disrupt the institution, one whose crime was a kind of offense against the institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The legislative history of section 1060(a) is brief. Nothing in the history, however, suggests that Congress intended to reach offenses that had the unintended consequence of disruption. The statute was enacted during an era scarred by campus shootings, bombings, sit-ins, and shut-downs, and it was deliberately provocative conduct of that nature and gravity which Congress sought to discourage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Senate Report indicates that Congress sought to reach such conduct as the \u201cvicious willful destruction of property [that] occurred at Columbia University\u201d; it was not attempting to withdraw financial aid from students exercising First or Fifth Amendment rights<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or those who were guilty of \u201cstudent pranks,\u201d even if the pranks also constituted a crime involving force. S.Rep.No.1387, <em>supra </em>note 10, at 4053.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">We also agree with the district court that Green\u2019s offense was not a crime of a \u201cserious nature\u201d contemplated by Congress. Fist fights between male college students have long been a part of the undergraduate scene and are not generally considered serious; prosecutions are very rare. A fist fight cannot be escalated into a serious crime unless we can say that the aggressor intended to provoke consequences beyond his personal feud with his fellow student.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">Finally, the College attacks the district court\u2019s conclusion that Green was denied due process because there was no substantial evidence before the hearing officer .to support a finding (had one been made) on the essential intent element. It contends that intent could be inferred from the fact that disruption occurred after the fight. The principle that one is deemed to intend the natural and probable consequence of his intentional acts does not fit this case. Green reacted to fighting words. We cannot say that the audience responded more probably than not to Green\u2019s swing than to Stute\u2019s provocative language or, indeed, to the obscenities and epithets which the audience exchanged in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>emotionally charged atmosphere before Green left the platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The due process violation in this case stems from the conduct of the entire proceedings that contributed to a defective hearing process. Cf. Goldberg v. Kelly (1970) 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287. The mistake of law committed by the hearing officer that resulted in no substantial evidence being adduced to support a finding of specific intent, and the subsequent action taken by the College in reliance upon the hearing officer\u2019s findings, violated due process and thereby conferred jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3). Cf. Wong v. Hayakawa (9th Cir. 1972) 464 F.2d 1282, 1283; see <em>also </em>General Order on Judicial Standards of Procedure and Substance in Review of Student Discipline in Tax Supported Institutions of Higher Education, 45 F.R.

We live in an age of complex intergovernmental relations that were virtually unknown to the post-Civil AVar drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Ku Klux Elan Act of 1871. Ours is a time of increasing cooperative and creative federalism marked by joint federal-state ventures in numerous aspects of economic and social life. Programs such as revenue sharing, crime control, health care, and social security have blurred any sharp lines of demarcation of governmental authority and responsibility that once may have existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\">. Civil rights legislation should generally not be interpreted narrowly. Section 1983 was designed as comprehensive, remedial legislation for the deprivation of federal constitutional and statutory rights. Smith v. Hampton Training School for Nurses (4th Cir. 1966) 360 F.2d 577; Basista v. Weir (3d Cir. 1965) 340 F.2d 74, 81. The contours of \u00a7 1983 must necessarily remain flexible to accommodate changing circumstances and the exigencies of a given era. Because it is remedial in nature, \u00a7 1983 is appropriately suited to redress any \u201cnew method of interference\u201d with the rights which its words protect. \u201cFor it is the constitutional right, regardless of the method of interference, which is the subject of the statute and which in precise terms it protects from injury or oppression.\u201d United States v. Classic (1941) 313 U.S. 299, 324, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 1042, 85 L.Ed. 1368.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b694-14\">. What is now 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 originated as \u00a7 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871. 17 Stat. 13 (R.S. \u00a7 1979). Designated as \u201cAn Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>for other Purposes,\u201d it was one of the methods by which Congress exercised the power vested in it by \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. As the debates at the time disclose, Congress sought to effectuate three purposes in enacting \u00a7 1983: (1) to override certain kinds of state laws; (2) to provide a remedy where state law was inadequate; and (3) to afford a federal remedy where the state remedy, while adequate in theory, was not available in practice. <em>See </em>Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess. (1871) 268, 345, 365-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">The sharp exchanges between proponents and opponents of the Act demonstrate that Congress was not placing a restrictive or unduly literal gloss on the phrase acting \u201cunder color of any statute.\u201d One of the legislation\u2019s supporters, Senator Edmunds, Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, stated that it created a civil action to protect federal rights \u201cassailed by any State law <em>or </em>under color of any State law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568 (emphasis added). Congressman Perry understood \u00a7 1983 to remedy injuries done \u201cunder color of State authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">The comments concerning \u00a7 1983 at the time of passage and an understanding of the circumstances that prompted its enactment demonstrate that Congress envisioned a more expansive interpretation of the words \u201cunder color of any statute\u201d than appellants\u2019 suggested construction. <em>See generally </em>Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., <em>supra, </em>398 U.S. at 162-169, 183-184, 203-209, 90 S.Ct. 1598; Monroe v. Pape, <em>supra, </em>365 U.S. at 171-183, 81 S.Ct. 473. The drafters were vividly aware that while many state laws did not compel racial discrimination or the deprivation of such rights as due process, the administration of a state\u2019s laws by its officers could effectively accomplish these ends. <em>E.g., </em>Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess. (1871) 315, 334, 505. Consequently, \u00a7 1983 addressed not only abuses sanctioned by law, but also those committed by state officials or individuals who were in a position to perpetrate unconstitutional actions solely by virtue of the authority conferred upon them by the state government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b695-14\">.
