The next and final refusal was based on the view that the mark was an informational slogan and did not \u201cserv\u00e9 to distinguish applicant\u2019s goods from like goods of others.\u201d In the Examiner\u2019s Answer, Sec. 2(e)(1) of the Act of 1946 is cited and refusal is said to be required because the mark would be recognized by purchasers as \u201cmerely descriptive of the goods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-16\">The board, after noting that the goods are cooking bags useable in browning meats, that the word \u201cbrown\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s as \u201cto make brown by scorching slightly\u201d and noting particularly appellant\u2019s advertisements wherein appellant states that meats will \u201cbrown right in the bag,\u201d affirmed the refusal in this single sentence:</p>\n<p id=\"b969-17\">It is clear enough from the record in this ease that \u201cBROWN-IN-BAG\u201d is descriptive of a purpose or function of applicant\u2019s product, and in the absence of any evidence bearing thereon, we are not persuaded that it would have anything other than a descriptive connotation to purchasers thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-18\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b969-19\">The parties have argued the case in the briefs on the basis of the board\u2019s opinion. The issue thus presented is whether the mark is merely descriptive of a purpose or function of the goods. If so, it is not registrable. In re The Realistic Company, 440 F.2d 1393, 58 C. C.P.A. 1204 (1971); In re W. A. Sheaf-fer Pen Company, 158 F.2d 390, 34 C.C. P.A. 771 (1946); In re General Perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>nent Wave Corporation, 118 F.2d 1020, 28 C.C.P.A. 1099 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">We think the mark is suggestive of one purpose to which the goods may be put, i. e. to brown meats in an oven. Suggestive marks are registrable. In re Ada Milling Co., 205 F.2d 315, 40 C.C. P.A.1076 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">The board\u2019s opinion and the Commissioner\u2019s brief cite these, and only these statements in appellant\u2019s advertisements :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-6\">\u201cNew Reynolds Brown-in-Bag bastes meat brown \u2019n juicy * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-7\">\u201cMeat brown savory and tender.\u201d \u201cBecause the Brown-in-Bag is made of transparent Reynolon, \u00ae meat browns right in the bag.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">From this the Commissioner\u2019s brief states that \u201conly one use is disclosed by this entire record.\u201d Appellant\u2019s advertisements of record, however, disclose other uses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-9\">(1) making the meat juicy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-10\">(2) making the meat tender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-11\">(3) keeping the juices from escaping and splattering on the oven; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-12\">(4) basting the meat in its own juices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">Appellant\u2019s specimens describe the product as \u201cSEE-THROUGH BAGS YOU CAN COOK IN.\u201d That browning is not the sole purpose or function of the bags is further illustrated by appellant\u2019s instruction pamphlets of record wherein the cooking of sauerkraut, pears and vegetables \u2014 items not ordinarily browned \u2014is taught.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-14\">It is true, but not fatal, that appellant\u2019s mark is informational. Because \u201cbag\u201d is obviously descriptive of the product and \u201cbrown\u201d is descriptive of what can happen to some foods when the bag is used, the Commissioner\u2019s brief insists that the mark <em>informs </em>the housewife-purchaser of a purpose to which the bag may be put and thus it is <em>merely descriptive </em>of a purpose and unregistrable. But one may be informed by suggestion as well as by description. Here appellant is not seeking to register the \u201cinformation\u201d that their bags may be used to brown foods and is not seeking to register a direction such as \u201cbrown foods in this bag.\u201d Appellant seeks to register, as a unitary mark, the combination of words and hyphens which form the mark BROWN-IN-BAG.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-16\">That appellant appears to find it necessary to advertise, inter alia, that meats may be browned in its bags may indicate its unwillingness to rely on the mark alone even to suggest that function. However that may be, it is the mark appellant seeks to register, not its advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-17\">The Commissioner\u2019s brief reflects concern that registration here would \u201cdeprive appellant\u2019s competitors of the use of common generic words which are in the public domain.\u201d We think not. Competitors are deprived only of the use of the three words in such format as would be likely to confuse. Competitors remain perfectly free to inform purchasers that foods may be browned in their bags and to use \u201cbrown,\u201d \u201cin\u201d and \u201cbag\u201d in whatever nontrademark manner they choose. Pacific Industries Inc. v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co. Inc., 425 F.2d 1265, 57 C.C.P.A. 1282 (1970); In re Automatic Radio Mfg. Co., 404 F.2d 1391, 56 C.C.P.A. 817 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-18\">In summary, we are unable to agree that the mark BROWN-IN-BAG, standing alone, is merely descriptive of a use, purpose or function of the goods. Accordingly the decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-19\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-20\">. Application serial No. 350,521, filed February 4, 1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b970-20\">ALMOND, Senior Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ACS\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-21\">I agree with the board that \u201cBROWN-IN-BAG\u201d is descriptive of the purpose and function of appellant\u2019s product. Therefore, I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
