Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964). The motion was denied. The issue of voluntariness was also submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Appellant was arrested on the afternoon of February 4, 1972, in possession of a stolen automobile. He with two other occupants was taken to the police station where he was interviewed by detective James H. Dotson, Vincennes, Indiana Police Department and FBI Agent Roger Waite. Prior to the interview the FBI Agent read the <em>Miranda </em>warning to appellant and appellant signed a standard waiver of rights form. The trial court dictated findings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">\u201cI think the Court will make some factual findings first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">\u201cNow, the Court finds that the police officers \u2014 Agent Waite and Sergeant Dotson \u2014 properly and fully warned the defendant of his constitutional rights before interrogating him and before discussing any matter with him affecting this case, or these cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">\u201cThe Court further finds that at no time did the defendant request an attorney, although he had been advised that he could if he wanted to; so the Court does not consider that point well taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Appellant contends the trial court applied the wrong test. We do not agree. The proper test is whether the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel. A heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate the waiver. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 475, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 894 (1966). The issue is whether the defendant was effectively warned of his rights to counsel and that he knowingly and intelligently declined to exercise them. United States v. Scogin, 459 F.2d 182 (CA8 1972); Hughes v. Swenson, 452 F.2d 866 (CA8 1971). The mere fact that the trial court did not formally enunciate the test in full does not change the correctness of his ruling. We are satisfied from a complete review of this record that defendant waived his right to counsel under the standards prescribed. He was fully advised of his right to counsel and knowingly signed a written declination to exercise them. To what extent appellant\u2019s use of drugs may have affected his waiver of counsel will be considered in our review of the trial court\u2019s finding as to the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s statements which we next consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\"> The issue of whether a confession is voluntary and thus admissible is governed by standards summarized in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 307, 83 S.Ct. 745, 755, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). \u201cIf an individual\u2019s \u2018will was overborne\u2019 or if his confession was not \u2018the product of a rational intellect and a free will\u2019 his confession is inadmissible because coerced.\u201d (footnotes omitted). The question of voluntariness necessarily turns on the totality of circumstances. Boulden v. Holman, 394 U.S. 478, 89 S. Ct. 1138, 22 L.Ed.2d 433 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">After conducting the suppression hearing the trial court made detailed findings with respect to the issue of voluntariness. In summary the Court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-13\">\u201cNow, for the record I am going to find that the defendant, despite the thin evidence, was an addict and was under the influence of drugs at the time of his arrest, that he needed drugs, and that he did suffer from some withdrawal symptoms during the course of his interrogation; that he was given medication that tended to relieve this and tended to produce a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>sense of euphoria, and then the interrogation was completed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">Nevertheless, in spite of all those findings, the Court concludes and finds that the statements made were voluntary, and that as far as the preliminary hearing is concerned, the Court is making the determination now that they will be admissible at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">* * -* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">Now, I frankly think my decision is an extremely close one. And I do recognize that the Government has the burden of proving the voluntariness of this confession beyond a reasonable doubt; the defendant doesn\u2019t have to do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">But I have to make some reasonable interpretation of voluntariness and some reasonable interpretation of rational intellect and free will; and I think the interpretation that I am making is the only practical, only sensible, only real one, because I think, except for a very sophistic type argument, it was a voluntary confession. I think he thought it was; I don\u2019t think he felt under any compulsion, either from his drug habit or anything that the officers did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">So it will be received, and that is the ruling of the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">A review of the evidence indicates that appellant at the commencement and during his interrogation advised his interviewers that he was an addict and \u201cneeded a fix.\u201d The evidence shows he was not promised medication to induce his statements; he was oriented with good memory and good recall; that as he showed signs of discomfort the officers took him to a hospital where he was administered \u201ca half dosage\u201d of Demerol; this was equivalent in effect to 2-4 ounces of alcohol according to the prescribing physician \u2014 and the principal effect of the Demerol, is to sedate, to remove the need for the basic drug; thereafter appellant was more comfortable and reaffirmed the details of his prior confession concerning various crimes; the physician felt that the fact that appellant could recall and recount with specificity the details of past events suggested that he was not too much influenced by the prior drug or the Demerol which was administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">We recognize, as did the trial court, that the issue of voluntariness under all the circumstances is a troublesome one. Based on our careful independent review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">This is not a ease where a defendant suffering from withdrawal symptoms is induced to confess by promises of relief. <em>Compare, </em>United States Ex Rel. Collins v. Maroney, D.C., 287 F.Supp. 420. In the instant case when appellant showed signs of discomfort and exhibited symptoms of withdrawal, he was taken to the hospital where he was adminstered \u201ca half dosage\u201d of Demerol which relieved these symptoms and appellant became more relaxed and discussed in more detail events previously related. However, there is no indication that his statements were not the product of a rational intellect and free will. We are not prepared to say that a confession made by a person under the influence of drugs is per se involuntary. It is suspect, and a full and complete evidentiary hearing is necessary to a resolution of such an issue. Jackson v. Den-no, <em>supra, </em>378 U.S. at 390-391, 84 S.Ct. 1774. The trial court recognized its duty to hold such a hearing and to apply the proper standards. In announcing its decision the Court, among other cases, discussed the principles reviewed in Gladden v. Unsworth, 396 F.2d 373, 380 (CA9 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">The issue here was whether the Demerol injection deprived appellant of \u201ca rational intellect and free will.\u201d Wade v. Yeager, 245 F.Supp. 62 (D.C. N.J.1964); <em>compare, </em>Griffith v. Rhay, 177 F.Supp. 386 (D.C.E.D.Wash.1959), rev\u2019d 282 F.2d 711 (CA 9 1960) (Demerol \u2014 reversed because no waiver of right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>to counsel); Fant v. Peyton, 303 F. Supp. 457 (D.C.Va.1969) (intoxication). The trial court found that appellant\u2019s statements were voluntary. The evidence supports that finding. United States v. Tyrone Wilkins, 477 F.2d 323 (CA8 1973) (drug flashback).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">In conclusion we deem it appropriate to comment that the trial court exercised great care to insure that these difficult issues were fully developed in the .suppression hearing. Appellant was advised that he might testify at the hearing without prejudice to his right to remain mute at the trial before the jury later on.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government was permitted to offer as a part of these proceedings a certified copy of the findings of facts and conclusions of law and judgment entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on October 26, 1972 finding that appellant was competent at the time he entered a plea of guilty to proceedings in that court on February 11, 1972 and \u201cat all times in question\u201d (which included the date here in question February 4, 1972). However, Judge Eisele recognized there was some ambiguity with respect to the issues ruled on in Indiana as compared to the issues presented'in the instant matter and properly insisted on a complete hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">After carefully considering the entire record, we are satisfied that appellant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel and voluntarily made the incriminating statements. The issues presented are troublesome. Absent a complete hearing and the record here made we might well be constrained to reach a different result. The issues were fully developed under the careful guidance of the trial court and with the able assistance of counsel for both the government and appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-33\">. Sentences of 6 years and 3 years to run concurrently were imposed on the respective convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\">. Aside from vigorous cross-examination of the government\u2019s witnesses, appellant offered no additional evidence at the suppression hearing. During the trial appellant only offered the testimony of Dr. Keyes who had testified upon call of the government in the suppression hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
