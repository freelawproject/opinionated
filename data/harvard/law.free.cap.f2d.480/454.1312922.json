KAUFMAN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b520-23\">On December 29, 1964, a fire gutted a five-story building owned by appellant, Van Iderstine Company, in Long Island City, New York. The structure was part of a complex of twenty-eight buildings used in Van Iderstine\u2019s business of rendering butchers\u2019 offal and manufacturing bone meal, poultry feed and bone glue. Van Iderstine subsequently brought this action against R. G. J. Contracting Company, a contractor hired by Van Iderstine to demolish the building in question in preparation for new construction, and Michael Petrow, a subcontractor engaged by R. G. J. to perform the job, to recover $980,000 in property damage allegedly caused by the defendants\u2019 negligence in setting the fire. A jury, after trial before the Hon. Orrin Judd in the Eastern District of New York, returned a verdict for the defendants. Thereafter, Judge Judd denied Van Iderstine\u2019s post-trial motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, and Van Iderstine appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-24\">Appellant urges us to reverse the judgment below because, in his view, the verdict was contrary to the evidence, the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury in certain respects and the trial conduct of the attorney for defendant R. G. J. Contracting Company was so prejudicial to Van Iderstine as to require a new trial. We have carefully considered the briefs and the record of the trial and find no basis for disturbing the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-25\">We doubt whether we would have memorialized this case in a written opinion of the court were there not present in the record evidence of conduct by counsel so disturbing as to require some fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>ther discussion. During our customary reading of the briefs and examination of the record in preparation for the argument of the appeal we discovered a pattern of behavior by several lawyers who participated at trial that was shocking, unbecoming officers of the court and lacking in concern for professional integrity and responsibility. Since the courts must never provide a sanctuary for such gross misconduct as was demonstrated in this case we shall have something to say about the events at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">We note initially that had more than an insubstantial portion of counsels\u2019 intemperate behavior been brought to the attention of the jury, we would have had no restraint in ordering a new trial. The attentiveness of the district judge, however, spared the jury from conduct that we believe would have fatally infected the trial. Although it is our judgment that the verdict was untainted by the acrimony that occurred outside the jury\u2019s presence, that alone cannot excuse the untoward behavior of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Canon 7 of the Code of Professional Responsibility sets forth the elementary maxim that \u201cA lawyer should represent a client zealously within the bounds of the law.\u201d Disciplinary Rule 7-106 (Trial Conduct) of the Canons, however, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">(C) In appearing in his professional capacity before a tribunal, a lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">(6) Engage in undignified or discourteous conduct which is degrading to a tribunal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Moreover, Ethical Consideration 7-37 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">In adversary proceedings, clients are litigants and though ill feeling may exist between clients, such ill feeling should not influence a lawyer in his conduct, attitude or demeanor towards opposing lawyers. A lawyer should not make unfair or derogatory personal reference to opposing counsel. Haranguing and offensive tactics by lawyers interfere with the orderly administration of justice and have no proper place in our legal system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">With this backdrop, we turn to a discussion of several examples of the conduct we have found particularly offensive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">During the direct testimony of Daniel Roff, vice-president of R.G.J., Mr. Mangiatordi, counsel for defendant R.G.J., questioned the witness on the relationship between R.G.J. and defendant Petrow. The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-17\">Q. When Petrow was contacted\u2014 in your contacting Petrow, how did this come about as far as Van Iderstine was concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-18\">Did you go into the full set of negotiations with respect to the operation of the demolition, et cetera?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-19\">A. I brought Mike Petrow in to do the demolition. From there on, Mr. Goonan [Van Iderstine\u2019s plant manager] knew just what he was going to do with his equipment and I had no further \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-20\">Mr. Greenspan [counsel for Van Iderstine]: I object to that. The contract speaks for itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-21\">Mr. Mangiatordi: It\u2019s not a contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-22\">The Court: What Goonan knew, the witness can say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-23\">Mr. Mangiatordi: I object to the comment by counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-24\">The Court: He was making an objection. I think his comment was in addition to his objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-26\">Mr. Mangiatordi: I believe he referred to something as a legal term that your Honor denied me to make a statement with respect to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The Court: Ask your next question. Mr. Mangiatordi: He ought to refer to it as a Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">May I approach the Bench for a minute, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">The Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">(The following occurred at sidebar). Mr. Mangiatordi: Mr. Greenhill [co-counsel for Van Iderstine] insists on making faces and showing exasperation from my questioning. I am going to ask that he discontinue or he be excluded from the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">Mr. Greenspan: Mr. Greenhill has been looking at some notes\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">Mr. Mangiatordi: That\u2019s not true. Mr. Greenspan: How can you say it\u2019s untrue. You have some nerve. You don\u2019t know what you are talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">Mr. Mangiatordi: Judge, if this continues \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">The Court: The witness cannot tell what Mr. Goonan was trying to do. Let\u2019s continue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">The able trial judge unfortunately permitted himself to be drawn into the dispute between the attorneys. He was often interrupted discourteously and abused without reason by Mr. Mangiatordi, as the following testimony during plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination of Roff illustrates :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-14\">Q. [Mr. Greenspan] Isn\u2019t it true when you do demolition work and there is steel in the building\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">Mr. Mangiatordi: I object to the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-16\">The Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-17\">Q. Isn\u2019t it true when you do demolition work and you have steel in the building that you have to use a torch to cut it? .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-18\">Mr. Mangiatordi: I object to the question. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s referring to when he uses the words \u201cwhen you do demolition work.\u201d I object to the form of the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-19\">The Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-20\">Mr. Mangiatordi: Is the word meant generally, Judge, did you, any person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-22\">The Court: I think this is dealing with his experience as to demolition work generally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-23\">The Witness: I don\u2019t have experience with demolition work. I couldn\u2019t answer that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-24\">Q. You were a former fireman, were you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-25\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-26\">Q. In doing demolition work is it necessary to use a torch to cut steel? Mr. Mangiatordi: I object to that. The Court: He can answer that if he knows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-27\">Mr. Mangiatordi: I can answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-29\">A. If you have steel and the steel is put together with bolts, you don\u2019t need a torch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-30\">Mr. Greenspan: I move the answer be stricken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-31\">The Court: No. I will let it stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWB\">Q. If you say it was put together with bolts, do you mean that you have to use a torch to cut them or do you mean that you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-32\">A. No. You can use wrenches to take out bolts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-33\">Q. Supposing the size of the metal is so large and they are not put together with bolts and you have to cut it, you have to split it, how would you cut it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-34\">A. You would cut it with a torch. Mr. Mangiatordi: I object to that. He\u2019s trying to make him an expert on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-35\">The Court: I let you make him an expert on fire. I will have an expert on demolition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-36\">Mr. Mangiatordi: He was a fire marshal. He was an expert. He is not an expert on demolition and on cutting metals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-37\">The Court: We had a statement \u2014 \u2022 Mr. Mangiatordi: Judge, I would like to go to the side bar again, if your Honor pleases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>The Court: We will take a short recess now. The jury go back to the jury room and don\u2019t discuss the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">(Jury excused.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">Mr. Mangiatordi: Again at this time I have to sincerely ask for a mistrial, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">The evident bias in this case that your Honor is projecting to this jury as against the defendants in this ease, it\u2019s shocking. You are suggesting to these plaintiff\u2019s attorneys how to try their cases in the first instance. You are telling them what testimony to put in, what testimony to exclude. You are making suggestions to them as to whether or not the word \u201csub-contractor\u201d should go into evidence as opposed to their intention to prove that there was a joint venture, and now you are trying to show \u2014 because this man was projected as being an expert in fire \u2014 that that automatically makes him an expert in weld-ing and cutting and demolition and I take exception to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">The Court: No. Because Mr. Greenspan had just put in a couple of statements about his having worked on demolition jobs before. You have a right to file a Certificate of Bias. Do it any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">Mr. Mangiatordi: Judge, I am in the middle of trial and I don\u2019t get out of here until 6, 7 o\u2019clock at night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">The Court: I don\u2019t keep you that long.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">Mr. Mangiatordi: I am here at night. You may not know it, but I am here until 7 o\u2019clock at night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-16\">It\u2019s evident that what you are doing is really projecting to the jury and I ask you, please, in the interests of justice to give us an opportunity to present the case in a fair light and not project yourself into the case. I mean it sincerely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-17\">The Court: You just get yourself too excited. That\u2019s why we have all these personalities that are resulting in your accusing the other counsel of misconduct, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-18\">Mr. Mangiatordi: You are prejudicing the defendants here and I ask you, please, if there is a question pertaining to evidence, not to project yourself to show that what we are doing is erroneous or wrong or we are trying to hoodwink this jury. I think it\u2019s highly prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-19\">(A recess was taken.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-20\">The ultimate disservice to the advocate\u2019s role was exhibited during the direct examination of defendant Michael Petrow. The witness testified that he had seen lawyers for Van Iderstine at the fire site and they had identified themselves as fire marshals and inspectors. The record needs no embellishing:</p>\n<p id=\"Ajh\">Q. [Mr. Mangiatordi] Who did you see there at the premises?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-21\">A. [Mr. Petrow] The two fire marshals, the two fire inspectors.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-22\">Q. The gentleman sitting on the end and the gentleman with the eyeglasses in his mouth, they said they were fire marshals and inspectors?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-23\">A. And adjusters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-24\">Mr. Cohen: Designate their name for the record, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-25\">Mr. Greenspan: Mr. Kreisberg [co-counsel for Van Iderstine] you saw there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-27\">The Court: Did you see Mr. Kreisberg?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-28\">The Witness: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-29\">Mr. Greenspan: When was this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_y\">The Court: Mr. Mangiatordi is questioning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-31\">Q. What did they represent themselves as being at the time you saw them there ?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-32\">A. Fire inspectors, fire adjusters, or something of that nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-33\">Q. Did you see them there throughout the job after the fire had occurred?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-34\">A. Once, twice, sometimes three times a day; poking around here, poking around there. I\u2019d run into them at the oddest places.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Q. Did you ever catch them in conversation with your men ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">Mr. Greenspan: I object to that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">The Court: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">Q. Were your men on the job after the fire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">Q. Did you notice whether there was any conversation going on with your men and with these men?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">Q. Did you have a conversation with them with respect to these conversations they were having with your men?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">Q. And what did\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\">Mr. Mangiatordi: If you want to stare at me I\u2019ll put you on the stand next.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-15\">The Court: We\u2019ll take a recess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-16\">The jury will go back to the jury room because we want to talk about the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-17\">(The jury left the courtroom.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-18\">The Court: Mr. Mangiatordi, is there any other counsel available to try this case if I declare a mistrial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-20\">Mr. Mangiatordi: No, sir. This case took a lot of preparation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-22\">The Court: Don\u2019t spoil it by dealing in \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-23\">Mr. Greenhill: I think we have reached a point where a mistrial is necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-25\">The Court: We will recess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-26\">Mr. Greenhill: We have wasted your time and we wasted our time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-28\">Mr. Mangiatordi: I except.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-29\">The Court: Do you think\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-30\">Mr. Greenhill: This man should be reported to the Federal Bar Association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-31\">Mr. Mangiatordi: This man has been glaring at me all through the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-33\">Mr. Greenhill: And I say there is perjury committed. This record should go to the District Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-34\">Mr. Kreisberg: And I want\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-35\">Mr. Greenhill: This should be referred to the District Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-36\">Mr. Kreisberg: I want to call this man an unmitigated liar and put my testimony on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-37\">Mr. Greenhill: I want this testimony to go to the District Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWS\">This is a disgrace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-38\">Mr. Petrow: Two men of mine almost died.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-39\">Mr. Greenhill: You are a liar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-40\">I\u2019ll say another thing. I want to say one more thing because it affects me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-41\">Mr. Roth said on this stand he believes he saw me there the day of the fire. I was outside in the hall with his personal attorney and I said, \u201cMr. Roth, is that true?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-42\">He said, \u201cNo. Don\u2019t you remember when I was there ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-43\">He said, \u201cYes. When were you there Mr. Greenhill? I was there on December 31st.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-44\">That was the first time I saw him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-45\">Mr. Cohen: Two days after the fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-47\">Mr. Kreisberg: But not the day of the fire as this man says. And I was sick in bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-48\">Mr. Petrow: I didn\u2019t say that you were there the day of the fire. I said the day after.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-49\">Mr. Greenhill: This record should go to the District Attorney\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-50\">Mr. Petrow: It should go because two men almost lost their lives. These men were with me twenty years, you know. Even though they work for me they are still my friends. There was arson involved here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-51\">Mr. Greenhill: Listening for two weeks to wisecracks. Listening to the comic lawyer, listening to these \u2014 this man can\u2019t even try cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-52\">The Court: We are going to take a twenty-minute recess. Counsel can go to the court library on the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>floor to see if I have the power to grant a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-3\">Mr. Mangiatordi: This ease has been adjourned \u2014 if Mr. Greenhill doubts my competency, he is the person who was supposed to be trying this case, all of a sudden he asked for adjournments claiming that he was sick. Now, I asked your Honor in the course of this trial to ask this man to quit his tactics and doing this every time a question was asked and during all of my cross-examination, during my questioning, during this entire trial, and your Honor refused to admonish him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">The Court: I have only your word to believe it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">Mr. Mangiatordi: He\u2019s not denying it, either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">Now, you are talking about tactics. He should conduct himself as a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">Mr. Greenhill: I could be your father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">Mr. Mangiatordi: You could never be my father under any circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">The Court: We\u2019ll take a short recess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">Mr. Mangiatordi: You couldn\u2019t clean my father\u2019s shoes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">The Court: We will take a twenty-minute recess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-14\">Mr. Mangiatordi: You couldn\u2019t shine my father\u2019s shoes, you Goddamn bootblack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-16\">Mr. Kreisberg: What did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-17\">The Court: We will take a twenty-minute recess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-18\">Ordinarily, when a lawyer\u2019s misconduct is called to our attention, our reviewing task is made difficult because the cold trial transcript does not permit us easily to capture the mood of the trial. The pages of this record, however, virtually sizzle with misbehavior. We believe the depressing illustrations, just noted, of what passed for advocacy in this case sufficiently demonstrate the nature of the unruly proceedings below. Even Judge Judd\u2019s patient and perhaps overly tolerant attitude towards the attorneys\u2019 conduct ultimately had to give way. He was moved to observe finally that \u201cIn a bar as disciplined as the English bar, Mr. Mangiatordi would have been subject to public censure and perhaps suspension for the repeated and unfair criticisms of plaintiff\u2019s counsel.\u2019\u2019 We do not believe any civilized legal system need tolerate behavior which makes a mockery of our adversary trial system. Civil litigation provides an opportunity for private parties to dispose of disputes in an orderly and disciplined fashion. But the open forum which our courts provide for conflict resolution is not, nor can it ever be, a license to slander and abuse one\u2019s adversary. Such conduct diminishes the integrity of an institution whose usefulness depends upon the respect in which it is held by the public, and by the lawyers who practice in it. Advocacy is an art in which the unrelenting pursuit of truth and the most thorough self-control must be delicately balanced. Lawyers, as officers of the court, must always be alert to the rule that zealous advocacy in behalf of a client can never excuse contumacious or disrespectful conduct. Counsel who abuse the adversary system, and infect court proceedings with the tactics of street brawlers cast doubt upon their fitness as responsible advocates and betray a trust with which they are invested by the court and public.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-20\">The attorneys\u2019 conduct which we have noted reveals a total lack of self-discipline. Moreover, we believe Mr. Mangiatordi\u2019s behavior particularly merits censure. Since the district judge did not recommend initiation of disciplinary proceedings in this matt\u00e9r, we forebear from doing so ourselves. Similar conduct, however, will not be tolerated in the future and this opinion should serve as notice to that effect.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-11\">.
