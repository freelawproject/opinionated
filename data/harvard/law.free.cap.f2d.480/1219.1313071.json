He also contends that his confession was otherwise unlawfully coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-12\">We see no merit in the claim of coercion in the manner in which the confession was obtained. The principal ground for asserting the invalidity of the seizure is the claim that petitioner\u2019s wife may not be said to have consented to the search when she was not advised, nor did she know, that she had a right to withhold her consent; and the validity of the confession, under petitioner\u2019s first theory, depends upon whether it was the product of tainted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-13\">After argument of the ease, we stayed decision pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Schneckloth v. Bustamonte. That case was decided May 29, 1973. 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854. It held that the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of consent to a search depends upon the totality of the surrounding circumstances; and while lack of knowledge of the right to withhold consent is a factor to be considered, proof of such knowledge is not required to render consent voluntary. Since the surrounding circumstances in the instant case all point to petitioner\u2019s wife\u2019s consent to the search as a voluntary act, save only the claim that she did not know that she could withhold her consent, we conclude that the search and seizure were valid. It follows that we reject petitioner\u2019s first two contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
