Church, brought this diversity suit against defendant, Al-don Cochran, for damages suffered when defendant\u2019s automobile allegedly struck plaintiff while he was walking in an A &amp; P parking lot in McCaysville, Georgia. Following a full trial, the jury found for the defendant. Plaintiff appeals on several grounds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-22\"> We have reviewed the record and we find that although the evidence was conflicting there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict and therefore it was not error for the district court to refuse to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial. <em>See </em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 365. The trial court charge \u2014 which instructed that the traffic signs and customs in the parking lot could be considered and that both the driver and the pedestrian owed each other a duty of care \u2014 adequately apprised the jury of what appears to be a somewhat unsettled area of Georgia law. Plaintiff\u2019s contention that the district court should have charged that the driver owed the pedestrian a greater duty of care rather than that they simply both owed a duty is not squarely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>supported by the former cases and we believe that the charge as a whole, particularly that part which permitted the jury to consider the customary traffic pattern of the lot, was clear enough that had the jury believed the plaintiff or disbelieved the defendant (who claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that he wasn\u2019t sure he even struck the plaintiff), the verdict would have so reflected.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Finally, we find that the court properly excluded the defendant\u2019s remark at the scene of the accident to the effect that he was covered by insurance. The remark is hardly an admission of negligence and the potential prejudice flowing from the admission to the jury of such a statement far outweighs whatever probative value, if any, it might have.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
