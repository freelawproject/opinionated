Buyer shall pay interest on the diminishing balance of said purchase price at the rate of four percent per annum from the 1st day of June, 1965, which interest shall be deducted from each installment payment and the balance of each payment applied in reduction of principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">3. <em>Successors and Assigns. </em>The provisions of this agreement shall inure to the benefit of and bind the successors and assigns of Buyer and the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of Seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Subsequently, by order of the Superi- or Court of Washington for King County on September 23, 1965, Robert N. Coates as Trustee of the Trust Under Will of Sydney Coates received an undivided one-third interest in the May 20 contract for the sale of 75 shares of WIP held by the Sydney Coates Estate. By the same order Robert N. Coates as Trustee for the Rose Ann Coates Trust<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> received an undivided two-thirds interest in the May 20 contract for the sale of the 75 shares held by the Estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">In their 1965 income tax returns, all parties reported the 1965 transaction as a sale of their WIP stock entitling them to capital gain treatment. In his notice of deficiencies the Commissioner treated the \u201csale\u201d as a redemption by a related corporation under \u00a7 304(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> taxable as a dividend at the face value ($1,000) of the agreements. The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner\u2019s \u00a7 304(a)(1) and dividend treatment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but found the fair market value of the agreements to be 60% of their face value rather than 100% as determined by the Commissioner. It is from this decision that the taxpayers appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">Initially, petitioners contend that since the two trusts were not in existence at the time of the transfer of the WIP shares to CAM they are not taxpayers within the meaning of \u00a7 7701(a) (14), and that, accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Commissioner determined deficiencies against the wrong parties. They would have us hold that since the WIP shares were community property, the proper parties for taxation are the Estate of Sydney Coates and Rose Ann Coates. We decline to do so and affirm the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"> The Trust Under Will of Sydney Coates, under \u00a7\u00a7661 and 662, was a proper party to the proceedings below. While the question raised as to the Rose Ann Coates Trust is more difficult, we have concluded it also was a proper party below. Upon the death of her husband, Mrs. Coates held her community property interest in the WIP shares subject to a restriction on their use, by virtue of the mutual wills (see footnote 1 <em>supra). </em>Under Washington law, her agreement to transfer her half of the community property into trust was specifically enforceable by the beneficiaries thereof. In re Young\u2019s Estate, 40 Wash.2d 582, 244 P.2d 1165 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Thus on May 20, 1965 when the WIP shares held by the Estate were \u201csold,\u201d Mrs. Coates held her half of the community property in constructive trust for the beneficiaries of her agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>Healy v. Commissioner, 345 U.S. 278, 73 S.Ct. 671, 97 L.Ed. 1007 (1953). We conclude, therefore, that the beneficial and equitable owner of the 50 WIP shares on May 20 was the Rose Ann Coates Trust, and as such it was subject to the tax on the transfer thereof. 2 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation, \u00a7 17.08 (1967 Revision).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">Petitioners next contend that the agreements entered into on May 20 between CAM and the WIP shareholders are \u201csecurities\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 351<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that, since after the May 20 transaction the WIP shareholders controlled over 80% of the stock of CAM, \u00a7 351 operates to grant them either no tax liability or capital gain treatment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Tax Court concluded that the agreements were not securities, citing Warren H. Brown, 27 T.C. 27 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">Petitioners argue that the <em>Brown </em>decision creates an invalid distinction between an installment sales contract and other long term corporate obligations. <em>See </em>Bittker &amp; Eustice, Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders 3-55 (3d Ed. 1971); Comment, Section 351 Transfers to Controlled Corporations: The Forgotten Term \u2014 \u201cSecurities,\u201d 114 U.Pa.L.Rev. 314 (1965). We do not reach that issue, however, for even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that these agreements are \u201csecurities\u201d under \u00a7 351, we are convinced that the provisions of \u00a7 351 are overridden by those of \u00a7 304 and that, accordingly, \u00a7 304 and not \u00a7 351 applies to this transaction. <em>See </em>Henry McK. Haserot, 46 T.C. 864, 872 (1966) (Tannenwald, J.) (separate opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">In Commissioner v. Stickney, 399 F.2d 828 (6th Cir. 1968), aff\u2019g, Henry McK. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Haserot, <em>supra, </em>the reached a contrary result. While the statutory language and legislative history reveal that Congress did not provide for or contemplate the possible conflict between the permissive policy of \u00a7 351 and the preventive policy of \u00a7 304, we' are convinced that our decision \u201cbest achieves the underlying legislative intent and policy and . . . more nearly reflects the manner in which Congress would have \u2018straightened this ruck out if they had come across it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haserot, supra, </em>46 T.C. at 878 (Tannenwald, J.). Accordingly, we decline to follow the Sixth Circuit for the reasons so cogently set forth by Judge Tannenwald.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Sixth Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Petitioners next argue that the Tax Court erred in holding that the transaction was a redemption through the use of a related corporation under \u00a7 304(a)(1). They would have us hold that the \u201cone or more persons\u201d of \u00a7 304(a)(1)(A) refers to one person plus those persons whose shares are attributed to him under \u00a7 318, and that the coneept of aggregate control as prescribed by Reg. \u00a7 1.304-2(b) <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and applied by the Tax Court departs from the specific language and intent of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Petitioners misconceive the operation and effect of \u00a7 304. That section was not designed to be so narrowly confined as to relate only to \u201cfamily\u201d transactions. To the contrary, it was designed to apply to any closely held corporations whether or not the parties were related by blood. The phrase \u201cor more persons\u201d is not superfluous, as petitioners ultimately must contend, but rather indicates an attempt to expand the scope of \u00a7 304(a)(1) beyond the family relationship to include unrelated persons who act in concert. <em>See </em>Radnitz v. United States, 187 F.Supp. 952 (S.D.N.Y.1960), aff\u2019d per curiam, 294 F.2d 577 (2d Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Since in the instant case the same group of persons controlled both WIP and CAM, \u00a7 304(a)(1) applies to this transaction, and the property received by the WIP shareholders must be treated as a distribution in redemption of the stock of CAM.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">To determine the tax consequences of a \u00a7 304(a)(1) redemption, it is necessary to refer to \u00a7 302. Unless the redemption qualifies as an exchange under one of the categories of \u00a7 302(b), it is to be treated under \u00a7 301.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The only portion of \u00a7 302(b) relevant here is \u00a7 302(b)(1), which provides that a redemption shall be treated as an exchange if it is \u201cnot essentially equivalent to a dividend.\u201d To so qualify, the redemption \u201cmust result in a meaningful reduction of the shareholder\u2019s proportionate interest.\u201d United States v. Davis, 397 U.S. 301, 313, 90 S.Ct. 1041, 1046, 25 L. Ed.2d. 323 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The instant transaction resulted in no reduction in any of the taxpayers\u2019 proportionate interests in WIP.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That being the case, the Tax Court correctly concluded that the distribution did not qualify for the preferred treatment under \u00a7 302(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Taxpayers attempt to distinguish <em>Davis </em>on the grounds that that opinion applies only to 100% shareholders. The rationale of <em>Davis </em>does not support such a distinction, and we reject it without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Petitioners finally contend that the Tax Court erred in determining the fair market value<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of the agreements to be $600 per $1,000 face value. We have carefully examined the record and conclude that there was ample support for the court\u2019s finding. It certainly was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\">. Sydney and Rose Ann Coates had executed mutual wills. His will gave the house, auto, bank accounts and personal effects to Rose Ann Coates, with the residue of his estate going to the Trust Under Will of Sydney Coates. Her will provided that, in the event Sydney Coates predeceased her, she would convey by separate instrument her interest in any community property \u201cto the Trustee or Trustees as named under the terms of the Trust created by the Will of Sydney N. Coates.\u201d Pursuant to this agreement, the Rose Ann Coates Trust was created by instrument dated August 21, 1965, executed by Rose Ann Coates, trustor, and Robert N. Coates, trustee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\">. The court below determined that the WIP stock was held by Sydney and Rose Ann Coates as community property. 37% shares belonging to each spouse. The odd apportionment is explained by the Order Approving Pinal Account, Report and Decree of Distribution of the Superior Court, which provided that in dividing the community property \u201cany disproportionate allocation necessary shall be made in the respective ownership of the contract receivable for the sale of the Washington Industrial Products stock.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b537-17\">. All section references hereafter are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b537-18\">. On October 24, 1969, the Tax Court tered decisions of no deficiency in the following listed cases on the basis that the redemption of their stock in WIP by CAM was substantially disproportionate pursuant to \u00a7 302(b) (2) : Arthur C. Heinen and Molly M. Heinen; Estate of Ruby M. Boyd, deceased, R. Morgan Boyd, executor; R. Morgan Boyd; Robert W. Boyd and Judith K. Boyd; Gary A. Heinen; Richard G. Heinen; Barbara Gaye Heinen; James E. Boyd. Robert and Marjorie are not parties in this case because of other matters with respect to their 1965 return which had not been resolved by the Service at the time this suit was instituted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b537-19\">. The decision of the Tax Court is reported at 55 T.C. 501 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b538-6\">. It is noteworthy that at no time after the death of her husband did Mrs. Coates obtain control over the WIP shares or the purchase agreements. Also, the agreements did not pass through Mrs. Coates, but rather were transferred directly from the Estate of Sydney Coates to the Rose Ann Coates Trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b538-7\">. Section 351(a) provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Mo gain or loss shall be recognized if property is transferred to a corporation ... by one or more persons in exchange for stock or securities in such corporation and immediately after the exchange such person or persons are in control ... of the corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b538-15\">. The taxpayers argue two alternative positions: (1) that all of the agreements are securities, that \u00a7 351 is applicable and, no \u201cother property\u201d having been received, that the taxpayers did not incur any tax liability on the transfer; or (2) that certain of these agreements are \u201csecurities\u201d but that some of them could be treated as \u201cother property\u201d under \u00a7 351, thus making the transaction taxable at capital gains rates to the extent of the value of this other property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b539-10\">. Our case reveals the ultimate inconsistency that would result if we followed <em>Sticlcney </em>and held that the \u201cexcept as otherwise provided\u201d provisos of \u00a7\u00a7 302(d) and 301(a) precluded \u00a7 304 applicability to these taxpayers. Other parties to this \u2018 transaction were taxed at the capital gains rate by virtue of \u00a7\u00a7 304(a) and 302(b) (2). (See footnote 4, supra,). That result would not be altered were we to follow <em>Stiokney\u2019s </em>interpretation of the provisos. Thus <em>Stiokney\u2019s </em>rationale would lead us to hold that those specifically excluded by Congress from dividend treatment (by virtue of \u00a7 302(b)(2)) would be taxed at the capital gains rate, while those Congress intended to be taxed at ordinary income rates (by virtue of \u00a7\u00a7 304(a), 302(d), and 301(a) would escape taxation altogether by \u00a7 351. Such a result does not comport with our reading of the legislative intent behind \u00a7\u00a7 304 and 351.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b539-21\">.
