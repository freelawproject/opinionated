We reach this conclusion on two alternative grounds. First, this is an appeal from the lower court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s motion to consolidate its case with a suit previously filed in that court. A trial court has broad discretion in determining whether to consolidate a ease pending before it. An order denying consolidation is not a final appealable order. See, 9 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 2386 (1971); United States v. Chelsea Towers, Inc., 404 F.2d 329 (3d Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">Furthermore, appellant did not timely perfect an appeal. Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure requires that a notice of appeal be filed in the district court within thirty days. The order denying consolidation was entered on November 28, 1972, but appellant did not file its notice of appeal until December 29, 1972. Thus thirty-one days elapsed before the notice of appeal was filed and therefore this court is without jurisdiction to hear this appeal, in the absence of further proceedings in the district court under Rule 4(a), F.R. A.P., to determine the existence of excusable neglect in the late filing of the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
