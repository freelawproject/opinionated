The bill of exceptions presents the question whether the trial judge correctly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-23\">There was evidence from which it could have been found that the plaintiff slipped on a piece of rope \u201cbrown and . . . about % inch thick\u201d similar to the rope used to mark off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the enclosure. The testimony summarized in the bill of exceptions did not indicate that the sole defendant, Diebold Inc., had any relation whatsoever to the rope surrounding the enclosure or to any operations being conducted within it. The testimony describing these operations showed that one Diebold Safe Company was the subcontractor which had supplied a safe for Worcester County Trust Company and that, on the day of the accident, one J. W. Bishop Company, a general contractor, was doing work involving the trust company, in which, beside employees of the J. W. Bishop Co. \u201con the job that day,\u201d two trucks, a foreman, and eight men were engaged in \u201cunloading plates\u201d made of metal. The plates were \u201ctoo heavy to carry\u201d and \u201cthey had some kind of a jack hoist.\u201d The relationship, if any, \u2022 of Diebold Safe Company to Diebold Inc. is not apparent from the bill of exceptions, which refers to no testimony showing whose employees were doing the unloading work within the roped off enclosure, or the ownership of the trucks involved in the operation, or any connection between such employees and trucks and the defendant, Diebold Inc. The most definite testimony about the employees was that they \u201cbelonged to the trucking firm who brought the safe,\u201d but the witness did not know the name of the firm. There was no evidence here, to warrant an inference that a particular defendant had some connection with an injury, comparable to that considered in cases like <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Fred T. Ley &amp; Co. Inc. </em>210 Mass. 371, <em>D\u2019Addio </em>v. <em>Hinckley Rendering Co. </em>213 Mass. 465, 466, 469, <em>Heywood </em>v. <em>Ogasapian, </em>224 Mass. 203, 205-206, and <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>R. E. Cunniff, Inc. </em>314 Mass. 7, 9. See, however, <em>Cochrane </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. </em>281 Mass. 386, 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">A verdict for the defendant should have been directed. Upon this record to find any connection between this defendant and the plaintiff\u2019s injuries would be sheer conjecture. <em>Burwick </em>v. <em>McClure, </em>318 Mass. 626, 630. See <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Griggs, Inc. </em>334 Mass. 139, 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
