The case is before us on the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the trial judge\u2019s direction of a verdict for the defendant. The facts are stated in their aspect most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">On February 7, 1948, the plaintiff\u2019s house was not getting water from the defendant\u2019s water supply system from which the plaintiff bought water. The superintendent of the water department and one Kacergis, a metal smith, went to the street in front of the plaintiff\u2019s house to thaw the pipes which were frozen. Kacergis took with him a portable welding machine capable of generating two hundred amperes and forty volts of electricity. The place where the pipes in the street were frozen was found to be on the street side of a shut off valve in a one inch fine running below the surface of the ground to the plaintiff\u2019s house. The one inch fine obtained water from a six inch main which lay beneath the center of the street. The valve was reached from above through a vertical four inch cast iron pipe. There was a comparable valve in the one inch pipe which led from the six inch main to the house opposite that of the plaintiff. Each valve could be opened or closed by an iron rod inserted from above through the appropriate four inch pipe. Such rods were attached to, and wedged down upon, each of these valves. To these rods Kacergis attached electrodes with the purpose of sending an electric current through the rods and the intervening pipes to thaw the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">It was found impossible to obtain a good electrical connection through this circuit. Nevertheless, in an attempt to do so, the machine was operated for several minutes. Water department employees \u201cthen went to the connection and jiggled the rod, first on the connection on one side and then on the connection on the other side.\u201d This failed to improve the connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">An excavation was then made to uncover the valve box near the plaintiff\u2019s house and an electrode was attached di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>rectly to the pipe. A circuit was established immediately and the machine was run for a period of from twenty to forty-five minutes, at the end of which a fire was discovered in the plaintiff\u2019s house from which <em>\u201ca </em>sudden surge of steam pressure came ... to the . . . valve.\u201d The machine was then shut off.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Kacergis, who was requested to do this work by the superintendent, \u201cbilled ... for each such job.\u201d Any \u201cwork concerning the attaching of electrodes and the operation of the machine was done by . . . Kacergis who was not an employee of the town, nor did he work under the direction of the town, but ... he was in charge of the job and hired by the town as an expert in thawing and . . . was in charge of the thawing process .... [N]o employee of the town had anything to do with the attachment of any machine or electrodes. As far as electricity and his apparatus was concerned Kacergis was in complete control.\u201d Kacergis \u201cdoes not come under the jurisdiction of the . . . superintendent,\u201d who \u201cexercised direction on digging the hole and nothing else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Prior to the time he was requested to do the work Kacergis directed the attention of representatives of the town to the fact \u201cthat the machine was inadequate ... to do this kind of a job.\u201d He did not enter the plaintiff\u2019s house between arriving on the job and the outbreak of the fire. \u201cThe method of thawing as used here is always used and Kacergis was called in because the thawing process was beyond . . . [the] knowledge or capacity\u201d of the superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s house had a steam heating system which \u201cprior to the fire . . . was in perfect working order.\u201d The heater \u201cwas connected to the water supply with iron pipe . . . [and] run by electricity and . . . the wiring was BX with fourteen gouge wire.\u201d It was testified by Kacergis \u201cthat the effect of the intensity of heat of 200 amps, flowing through a fourteen gouge wire would be to burn it up.\u201d An expert electrician testified \u201cthat attaching the electrodes to rods that were wedged down on top of a . . . valve [essentially the method first attempted] was not a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>way to make a connection; that in order for this system to function properly a tight connection is necessary at both electrodes; \u2018if any of those connections are faulty, the path could be up through this pipe . . . [and] the current could flow in any direction.\u2019\u201d The expert further testified (although this testimony was disputed) that it would be possible to energize the outer covering of the BX cable which \u201c before it breaks down . . . will be cherry red over the metal covering everywhere in the house\u201d; that the proper way to do the \u201cthawing operation would be to isolate the house\u201d by taking out the water meter or removing a coupling from the pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">1. A municipality is liable for its negligence in connection with maintaining a water supply system, in part for the use of inhabitants who pay for the water supplied. <em>Sloper </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>301 Mass. 20, 24. <em>Iver Johnson Sporting Goods Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>334 Mass. 401, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">2. Even if it be assumed that on the expert evidence it could have been found that Kacergis was negligent, there was no evidence which would warrant a finding that Kacergis was the agent or employee of the defendant. All the evidence tended to show that he was an independent contractor. Even if this evidence should not be believed, the burden would remain on the plaintiff to show that Kacergis was the town\u2019s agent. <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>C. I. T. Corp. </em>302 Mass. 281, 283-284. See <em>Anglim </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>278 Mass. 90, 95. Accordingly, to hold the defendant hable it must be shown either (a) that the servants and employees of the town participating in the work were themselves negligent (see <em>Baumgardner </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>304 Mass. 100, 105-107) or (b) that the defendant, upon some ground other than that Kacergis was its agent, was hable because of neghgent acts of Kacergis, an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">3. There was no evidence from which it could be found that the superintendent or his employees did any work neghgently. The evidence was that the superintendent \u201chad nothing to do with establishing electrical contact with the pipe . . . that was Kacergis\u2019s job.\u201d Although it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>have been found that the superintendent \u201cwent along and put the rods in the box,\u201d there is no basis for a finding that it was not done with due care. The testimony that, as Kacergis told the superintendent, \u201cthe machine was inadequate . . . to do this kind of a job,\u201d even if it shows improper equipment was used, has no tendency to prove any causal relation between the inadequacy and the fire. See <em>Sturman </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>321 Mass. 442, 443-444; Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 430; Harper and James, Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 20.1, 20.2; Prosser, Torts (2d ed.) \u00a7 44. Compare <em>Comeau </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>319 Mass. 17, 19-20. There is also no evidence that the defendant reserved to itself power to direct Kacergis\u2019s actions in respect of his electrical connections and other electrical work. See <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>LaCroix, </em>336 Mass. 484, 487. Compare <em>Hartman\u2019s Case, </em>336 Mass. 508, 510. There was no evidence that the superintendent was negligent in his selection of Kacergis as an expert or that Kacergis was not well qualified. For reasons discussed below, it could not have been found that the superintendent was lacking in due care in permitting Kacergis to do the work in the manner adopted by the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">4. It next must be considered whether the work done was of an especially dangerous character, where \u201cnecessarily from the nature and circumstances of the work harm will occur unless guarded against,\u201d so that even if there had been \u201cselection of a capable . . . person to do the\u201d work, the defendant would be liable \u201cif, through any lack of reasonable care on . . . [its] own part in guarding against the known dangers of the undertaking, injury result[ed] . . . from the negligence of those to whom . . . [it] entrusted] ... its performance.\u201d <em>McConnon </em>v. <em>Charles H. Hodgate Co. </em>282 Mass. 584, 588. <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Shivek, </em>326 Mass. 142, 149-152. See Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 835 (d) and (e) and comment h. Compare absence of liability of an owner or other responsible person for \u201cnegligence of . . . [an] independent contractor which is merely incidental to carrying out nondangerous work.\u201d <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>LaCroix, </em>336 Mass. 484, 488. See also <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Wernick, </em>334 Mass. 624, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>626-627. Compare Restatement: Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 409, 413-414, 416, 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In counts 1 and 2 the plaintiff did not allege that the method of thawing employed was of an ultra hazardous or unusual nature. However, we need not consider whether upon the present pleadings there could be recovery in tort under the principles of law just mentioned. We think it could not be found that those concerned had ground to believe that injury would probably result from this work unless the defendant took special precautions. There was no evidence of any fire or injuries arising out of use of the thawing method either in Provincetown or elsewhere. The method had been used by Kacergis and the superintendent on other occasions and was \u201calways used.\u201d The operation, using as it does electricity in an underground pipe, does not have the same obvious inherent risk of injury as a blasting explosion such as was considered in the <em>McConnon </em>case, 282 Mass. 584, and in <em>Coughlan </em>v. <em>Grande &amp; Son, Inc. </em>332 Mass. 464, 466, or the use of toxic fumigants dealt with in <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Ashkenazy, </em>307 Mass. 197, 201. See analysis of other relevant cases in <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Shivek, </em>326 Mass. 142, 150-151; Prosser, Torts (2d ed.) \u00a7 64, pages 357-361, where it is said that \u201cthe principle []of responsibility for negligence of an independent contractor doing inherently dangerous work] seems to be limited to work in which there is a high degree of risk in relation to the particular surroundings, or some rather specific danger to those in the vicinity, <em>recognizable in advance </em>as calling for definite precautions\u201d (emphasis supplied). See Harper and James, Torts, \u00a7 26.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">5. Upon the evidence here present, there is no basis for holding the defendant liable for any negligence on the part of Kacergis.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
