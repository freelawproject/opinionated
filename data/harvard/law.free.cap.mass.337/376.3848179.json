The bill was later twice amended (a) to allege that the plaintiffs communicated to the defendants certain confidential views about real estate development and that the defendant Ellis Rome agreed to act as their broker in acquiring suitable land, and (b) to ask, in the alternative, money damages. The judge refused to allow a further amendment of the bill asserting that the defendants were constructive trustees of the land because they knowingly participated in an alleged breach of a supposed fiduciary obligation to the plaintiffs on the part of one Murdock, broker for the vendor from whom the defendants purchased the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The case was referred to a master. In compliance with Rule 90 of the Superior Court (1954) the master with his report filed summaries of evidence underlying specified findings to which the defendants had filed objections. The defendants have appealed from interlocutory decrees overruling a demurrer to the bill and confirming the master\u2019s report and, for the purpose of preserving their earlier claims of appeal, have also appealed from the final decree dismissing the bill. See <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Bauman, </em>333 Mass. 214, 219. The plaintiffs appeal from the final decree and, by a bill of exceptions, present an exception to the denial of their motion for leave further to amend their bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The master found the following principal subsidiary facts. The plaintiffs were experienced real estate developers. The defendants conduct a real estate business representing \u201ccustomers as general brokers and on occasions\u201d buying for their own account. Where they cooperated with a broker having an exclusive agency on particular property, it was the practice for the latter broker \u201cto divide the commission\u201d with them if they sent a purchaser to him. \u201cWhenever this occurred the exclusive broker took over the customer and the forwarding . . . broker had no further direct dealings with the customer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Early in January, 1955, the plaintiffs told the defendants that they wanted to buy land near Hanover for a housing development. During the next two months the defendants caused to be shown to the plaintiffs various parcels including a glass factory property, owned by certain corporations but controlled by a husband and wife through stock ownership, so that the couple for the purposes of this case can be regarded in practical effect as the owners. Murdock had been given \u201can exclusive agency for the sale of [the] land and business.\u201d The plaintiffs met with Murdock to discuss the property and told him that they had been referred to him by Rome. Murdock mentioned a price of $50,000 but \u201cthought that an offer of $40,000 . . . might be acceptable to the owners.\u201d Murdock had been given \u201cno definite sales price but simply an authority to receive . . . and submit . . . offers to the owners for their consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">During March and April, 1955, the plaintiffs spent most of their time examining the glass factory\u2019s business. Murdock facilitated the plaintiffs\u2019 investigation in various ways and conferred with the plaintiffs frequently. At these meetings the plaintiffs \u201cconfided in him the results of their investigation . . . into the company\u2019s affairs and what must be done to make it a successful business.\u201d They found little value in it as then operated, but felt that the land and factory building were \u201cworth purchasing ... at a far less price than was quoted ... by Murdock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">On :May 2, 1955, the plaintiffs made to Murdock an offer of $10,000]for \u00a1all the factory assets \u201cexcluding bills payable and accounts receivable.\u201d On May 3 they gave to Murdock a deposit check of $1,000, to his order, on the back of which were indorsed a summary of the offer and the statement, \u201cSubject to agreements of Purchase and Sale satisfactory to both buyer and seller.\u201d On May 4 Murdock told one plaintiff by telephone that the offer \u201chad been accepted by the owners.\u201d On May 6 the plaintiffs and Murdock examined a purchase agreement prepared for the signatures of the president and clerk of the corporations which in fact owned the building and with a \u201clast blank line ... for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>signing by the plaintiffs.\u201d The plaintiffs \u201cstated that they would take one of the agreements to their own lawyer and have him look over . . . and approve it. . . . The meeting closed with the common understanding . . . that the property was to be held for the plaintiffs and would be given to them just as soon as the plaintiffs returned the agreements duly signed and paid the balance of the consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">On May 9 Murdock told one plaintiff by telephone that the \u201cproperty had been sold to another party\u201d but declined \u201cto give . . . information ... as to who the purchaser was.\u201d The deposit check was returned. \u201cActually, there was no other agreed purchaser ... on May 9 when Murdock telephoned.\u201d On May 10 at a real estate board meeting, Murdock purported to tell Rome that he \u201chad an offer of $10,000 for the factory, which I have lost,\u201d and Rome answered, \u201cI will buy it.\u201d On the morning of May 11,1955, Rome gave Murdock a deposit check for $1,000, and, on the same day, Rome signed as buyer the same agreement which had been prepared for the plaintiffs\u2019 signatures. This purchase was eventually completed for $10,000. The value of the assets sold was found to be $23,500 in May and June, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u201cUpon the foregoing subsidiary facts,\u201d the master made \u201cultimate conclusions of material facts,\u201d which, so far as here relevant, are stated below: 1. \u201cThe plaintiffs, as principal, never hired the named brokers [[the Romes and Murdock] ... to buy the property.\u201d 2. There was with respect to \u201cthe purchase and sale of property ... no fiduciary relationship . . . between the plaintiffs and the defendants.\u201d 3. On May 5 \u201cthe owners had accepted [[the] plaintiffs\u2019 offer . . . and there remained nothing further to be done except for the parties to sign a written . . . agreement . . . satisfactory to both the agreed buyers and sellers.\u201d <em>4. </em>A \u201cfiduciary relationship did exist between Murdock and the plaintiffs.\u201d Although \u201cMurdock was not employed by the plaintiffs to buy the property for them . . . he did accept valuable information confidentially conveyed to him by the plaintiffs, and in violation of such confidential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>relationship, in concert with [the] defendants . . . he . . . abused such confidence to the unjust enrichment of both himself and [the] defendants . . . and to the prejudice of the plaintiffs.\u201d The plaintiffs communicated to Murdock the results of their investigations \u201clargely to justify why their offer . . . was so low in comparison with Murdock\u2019s original quotation.\u201d 5. Realizing that the low offer meant only a \u201cmodest commission\u201d which \u201cwould have to be shared\u201d with the defendants, Murdock \u201cintentionally . . . decided to prevent a sale ... to the plaintiffs.\u201d 6. When Murdock on May 9 told one of the plaintiffs that the \u201cowners had . . . agreed to sell ... to another ... no such . . . sale had been . . . even contemplated by the owners.\u201d 7. \u201c[A]fter acceptance of the plaintiffs\u2019 offer . . . Murdock communicated with [the] defendants . . . and told them of the . . . offer and its acceptance . . . and disclosed to the Romes information which he had confidentially received from the plaintiffs\u201d and obtained the defendants\u2019 agreement to purchase on the same terms, the defendants waiving any commission, so that Murdock would receive the whole commission. On May 11, when they signed the agreement, the defendants knew that the plaintiffs \u201cwere the named buyers ... in that agreement.\u201d 8. With \u201cfull knowledge of Murdock\u2019s breach of a fiduciary obligation owed by him to the plaintiffs, [the] defendants . . . actively participated in such breach, and by reason thereof the plaintiffs were prevented from completing their purchase of the property to their . . . loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">1. The substantial question raised by these conclusions is whether there were subsidiary findings, so far as justified by the evidence summarized in accordance with Rule 90, which in turn justified the master\u2019s conclusion that Murdock owed a fiduciary obligation to the plaintiffs. It is the duty of the trial court, and of this court upon appeal from the final decree, to see that the final decree is such as the law requires upon the subsidiary facts found by the master and the proper inferences therefrom. <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Bauman, </em>333 Mass. 214, 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The evidence in support of the finding that the plaintiffs \u201cconfided\u201d the results of their investigations to Murdock was testimony by one plaintiff, (a) giving a detailed account of the investigations of the factory\u2019s business; (b) \u201cthat [the] plaintiffs bought eighty contiguous acres ... in connection with plans for future . . . expansion\u201d; and (c) that \u201call of this information . . . [was] communicated by the plaintiffs to Murdock, whom they trusted as a fellow real estate man and who led them on so to do, being dined frequently by Murdock who was especially friendly ... to them at all times.\u201d This evidence shows only that they told Murdock certain facts. Accordingly, we construe the master\u2019s subsidiary finding as meaning simply what the evidence thus justifies, bare communication of the facts to Murdock.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">There is no suggestion in the evidence, or in the subsidiary finding as thus construed, of agreement by Murdock to treat the information as secret, even if he could properly have made such an agreement. He was not the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, as the master was thoroughly justified in finding. <em>DiBurro </em>v. <em>Bonasia, </em>321 Mass. 12, 14-16. See <em>Follansbee </em>v. <em>Photiou, </em>326 Mass. 638, 640. Compare <em>Berenson </em>v. <em>Nirenstein, </em>326 Mass. 285, 289, where, on demurrer, allegations of a full agency relationship between a broker and a prospective purchaser presented a basis for equitable relief against the broker who acted in violation of his fiduciary relationship and one who participated with the broker. Indeed, Murdock, as the broker and agent of the beneficial owners of the property, was under a duty to disclose to them matters learned in the conduct of the agency and relevant to its success. Restatement: Agency, \u00a7 381. As the plaintiffs, experienced real estate men, should have known, he was not entitled to receive information pertinent to the subject matter of the agency which he was not at liberty to place at his principal\u2019s disposal. Accordingly, the subsidiary findings, properly interpreted, do not justify the ultimate conclusions (see those numbered 4 and 8 above) that a fiduciary relationship existed between Murdock and the plaintiffs. We think that the relationship between him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the plaintiffs was no more than a business relationship. <em>Swinton </em>v. <em>Whitinsville Savings Bank, </em>311 Mass. 677, 678 (seller of house fails to disclose presence of termites). See <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Merchants National Bank, </em>309 Mass. 354, 360-362 (bank officer giving investment advice to bank customer); <em>Plumer </em>v. <em>Luce, </em>310 Mass. 789, 798-799 (investor and investment house representative); <em>National Shawmut Bank </em>v. <em>Hallett, </em>322 Mass. 596, 602 (debtor-creditor relationships not made fiduciary by the existence of mutual respect and confidence); <em>Rockland-Atlas National Bank </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>336 Mass. 220, 223; <em>Yamins </em>v. <em>Zeitz, </em>322 Mass. 268, 273; Scott, Trusts (2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 462.1, 462.2, 505; Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed.) \u00a7 956a; Note 20 A. L. R. (2d) 1140, 1148-1149. See also as to efforts to make disclosures of information \u201cconfidental,\u201d <em>Laughlin Filter Corp. </em>v. <em>Bird Machine Co. </em>319 Mass. 287, 289-290. Compare cases where there was a recognized type of confidential relationship, fiduciary in character. <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Durfee &amp; Canning, Inc. </em>323 Mass. 187, 196. <em>Sher </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>325 Mass. 348, 353. <em>Mendelsohn </em>v. <em>Leather Manuf. Corp. </em>326 Mass. 226, 233-235. Compare also <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>318 Mass. 669, 674; <em>Karal </em>v. <em>Marken, </em>333 Mass. 743, 745-746.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The plaintiffs rely on <em>Warsofsky </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>326 Mass. 290. See Note 31 B. U. L. Rev. 101. That case is distinguishable. There, the relationship between a cooperative bank officer and a loan applicant created a special obligation based upon the bank officer\u2019s position, which was reinforced by the statutory provisions there mentioned (see page 294). There the information was necessarily transmitted on a confidential basis, as an essential step in securing a loan, to one who, by reason of his position, owed a duty to use it for only one purpose. In the present case, experienced real estate operators incautiously transmitted information to one, with whom they were, or should have been, dealing at arm\u2019s length (see <em>Evatt </em>v. <em>Willard D. Martin, Inc. </em>302 Mass. 414, 416), and who was under no fiduciary duty not to compete with them. <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Adametz, </em>142 Conn. 218, 55 A. L. R. (2d) 334, also relied upon by the plaintiffs, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>also distinguishable. See 35 B. U. L. Rev. 604. Compare 54 Mich. L. Rev. 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The master\u2019s conclusion that the Romes were not the plaintiffs\u2019 brokers effectively disposes of the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Rome \u201cagreed to act as broker and agent for the plaintiffs\u201d on any theory contained in the bill and its first two amendments. What has been said establishes that there could also have been no relief under the bill even if amended to allege that the defendants contributed to a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by Murdock to the plaintiffs. There was no such duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">2. The plaintiffs now argue that relief should be granted on the theory that the defendants \u201cknowingly collaborated with Murdock in interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 business relationship with the\u201d owner of the property \u201cand therefore must pay damages in the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 economic loss,\u201d thus essentially seeking to recover in tort, on the principles mentioned in <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>322 Mass. 356. Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 766. See Prosser, Torts (2d ed.) \u00a7 107; Harper and James, Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 6.9, 6.11. The plaintiffs have not included, even in their proposed amended bill, allegations or prayers for relief based upon the theory that property acquired by allegedly tortious interference with a potentially advantageous business relationship should be held in constructive trust for them, or, as an alternative, seeking damages. This is not a case for authorizing the allowance, at a very late date in the suit, of an amendment for which the plaintiffs, on their third attempt at stating the basic theory of their bill, have not even asked. In the absence of proposed pleadings on such a theory, it is unnecessary to consider whether such a bill would state grounds for relief in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">3. The demurrer to the original bill was correctly overruled. If the proof had sustained the allegations, as it did not, relief in equity could have been granted. <em>Berenson </em>v. <em>Nirenstein, </em>326 Mass. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">4. The interlocutory decrees overruling the demurrer to the original bill and confirming the master\u2019s report are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>affirmed. The final decree dismissing the bill is affirmed with costs to the defendants. The exceptions to the denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend the plaintiffs\u2019 bill are overruled. <em>So ordered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
