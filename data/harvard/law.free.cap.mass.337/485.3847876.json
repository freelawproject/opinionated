The trial judge made findings, stated below. From a final decree dismissing the bill, the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The plaintiff has branch offices in thirty-three States. Starting in 1924 it, or a predecessor corporation, sold portable electric saws under the trade mark \u201cSkil Saw\u201d and \u201cfor at least the past ten years\u201d it has had \u201ca complete line of portable electric hand tools and accessories,\u201d all of which are sold under the trade mark Skil. The trade mark Skil Saw was registered in the patent office in 1925 and \u201cthe registration ... is subsisting.\u201d The mark Skil was registered in Massachusetts in 1947. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 110, \u00a78.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The defendant engages in business in Wellesley as an individual under several names. He \u201cregistered the business style Skill Built Tool Company\u201d with the town clerk in 1953. In 1954 he began a radio advertising campaign for an indoor outdoor thermometer, selling for $3.98 at retail, on which he uses the trade mark Skill Built. In 1955 he applied this mark to a portable charcoal grill which sells at retail for $5.95. The defendant also sells hand saws which do not bear the trade mark Skill Built. The thermometer and broiler are sold throughout Massachusetts in many hardware stores carrying the plaintiff\u2019s Skil products.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The judge\u2019s principal conclusions were (a) that the \u201cplaintiff and the defendant are not business competitors\u201d; (b) that the thermometer and grill differ from the plaintiff\u2019s power tools; (c) that \u201cif the word Skil has obtained a secondary meaning ... it has applied only to the plaintiff\u2019s power tools\u201d; (d) that no evidence was offered by the plaintiff of \u201cinjury to its business reputation or dilution of the distinctive quality of its trade mark\u201d; (e) that \u201cthe only testimony of confusion was that of three people . . . in Massachusetts\u201d by events occurring after the bill was filed; (f) that, \u201cexcept in two isolated instances,\u201d Skill Built \u201chas not misled anybody, and ... is not likely to mislead those . . . [among] whom the parties . . . look for business\u201d; and (g) that the \u201cdefendant has not attempted to pass off his goods as the plaintiff\u2019s or to deceive the public\u201d into thinking \u201cthat they are . . . [dealing] with the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">1. The judge filed his findings of fact and order for decree on November 29, 1956. He resigned from the Superior Court on December 1, 1956. The plaintff contends that it was thereby deprived of a report of material facts under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 23, as appearing in St. 1947, c. 365, \u00a7 2. The findings were obviously the facts relied upon by the judge in framing his order for a decree. See <em>Fields </em>v. <em>Paraskis, </em>318 Mass. 726, 727-728. If the judge had adopted these findings as a report under \u00a7 23 (see <em>Acacia Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Feinberg, </em>318 Mass. 246, 247), the plaintiff at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>most could have requested the judge to amplify his findings. He Would not have been bound to do so. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>308 Mass. 584, 587. <em>Colby </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>311 Mass. 727, 728. See <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Coakley, </em>257 Mass. 159, 161-162; <em>Plumer </em>v. <em>Houghton &amp; Dutton Co. </em>277 Mass. 209, 214-215. Compare <em>Birnbaum </em>v. <em>Pamoukis, </em>301 Mass. 559, 561-562.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Since the evidence is reported, we must decide the case according to our judgment as to the facts, giving due weight to the judge\u2019s findings. <em>Lowell Bar Association </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass. 176, 178. See <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Markey, </em>321 Mass. 87, 88. Little, if any, of the oral testimony seems conflicting and much evidence was documentary. We thus are more nearly than in many cases in as good a position as the trial judge to appraise the evidence. See <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>290 Mass. 553, 557-558; <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Kyes, </em>304 Mass. 56, 57-58. See also <em>First National Stores Inc. </em>v. <em>First National Liquor Co. </em>316 Mass. 538, 540; <em>Mendelsohn </em>v. <em>Leather Manuf. Corp. </em>326 Mass. 226, 236-237; <em>Mellon National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>327 Mass. 631, 632. In view of the scope of the available review, the plaintiff has not been prejudiced by the fact that the findings were not technically a report under \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">2. There was no direct competition between the parties on like products. On this account, the plaintiff might not have been entitled to injunctive relief under the Massachusetts authorities prior to the enactment of St. 1947, c. 307, inserting a new \u00a7 7A in G. L. c. 110, despite suggestions in <em>265 Tremont Street, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamilburg, </em>321 Mass. 353, 356-358, that the trend of decisions was then away from any requirement of direct competition as a basis for relief from unfair competition. See <em>Silbert </em>v. <em>Kerstein, </em>318 Mass. 476, 479-482; <em>National Fruit Product Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>DwinellWright Co. </em>47 F. Supp. 499, 509 (D. Mass.), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>Dwinell-Wright Co. </em>v. <em>National Fruit Product Co. Inc. </em>140 F. 2d 618 (1st Cir.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>The plaintiff, however, seeks relief under \u00a7 7A, which reads: \u201cLikelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of a trade name or trademark shall be a ground for injunctive relief in cases of trademark infringement or unfair competition notwithstanding the absence of competition between the parties or of confusion as to the source of goods or services.\u201d The legislative history of the section throws little light upon its purpose,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and thus far the Massachusetts courts have had little occasion to consider the section. See <em>265 Tremont Street, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamilburg, </em>321 Mass. 353, 356-358; <em>Healer </em>v. <em>Bloomberg Bros. Inc. </em>321 Mass. 476; <em>Jays Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay-Originals Inc. </em>321 Mass. 737, 742; <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Parkway Motor Sales, Inc. </em>324 Mass. 151, 157; <em>New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>National Merchandising Corp. </em>335 Mass. 658, 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Section 7A has been considered more comprehensively by the Federal courts. In <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Food Fair, Inc. </em>83 F. Supp. 445, 450-451 (D. Mass.), it was held (1) that \u00a7 7A created a new ground of injunction and also substantive rights; (2) that \u201cthe statute was . . . designed to make the Massachusetts law go at least as far as the unfair competition rules laid down in federal courts before . . . <em>Erie Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>304 U. S. 64 . . . and as far as the Restatement of Torts\u201d; (3) that the reference to \u201clikelihood of injury to business reputation\u201d in the statute authorized relief (notwithstanding the absence of direct competition) against a person borrowing a plaintiff\u2019s trade name; even though the borrower \u201cdoes not tarnish it, or divert any sales by its use\u201d; \u201ceven though [[the] defendant\u2019s . . . [[product] is of premier quality and even though only a few average customers would be confused\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>and (4) that the statutory words \u201clikelihood of dilution of the distinctive quality of a trade name\u201d authorized the protection by injunction of \u201cnot merely a distinctive trade name such as a coined word but also the . . . characteristic quality inherent in any valid trade name after it has acquired a distinct secondary meaning.\u201d The Court of Appeals (177 F. 2d 177) affirmed the District Court\u2019s decree prohibiting the defendant from using the name Food Fair in connection with its Brookline retail grocery store unless such words were prefaced by a descriptive word or words to distinguish it from connection with the plaintiff\u2019s out-of-State stores. See <em>Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby </em>y. <em>Libby, </em>103 F. Supp. 968, 970 (D. Mass.).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\"><em>Esquire, Inc. </em>v. <em>Esquire Slipper Manuf. Co. Inc. </em>139 F. Supp. 228 (D. Mass.), involved the efforts of the magazine Esquire to enjoin the use of that name in connection with the defendant\u2019s corporate name and its men\u2019s slipper business. The judge declined to enjoin under \u00a7 7A use of the word \u201cEsquire\u201d in the defendant\u2019s corporate name partly because of the defendant\u2019s assurances that it would discontinue the use of the name on merchandise. The Court of Appeals (243 F. 2d 540, 546) vacated the judgment of the District Court and ordered an injunction entered prohibiting the defendant from using the name Esquire on products in violation of its assurances. It also construed \u00a7 7A as <em>permitting, </em>but not as <em>requiring, </em>injunctions grounded on dilution consistently with the \u201ctraditionally flexible equity practice of granting or withholding injunctive relief in the exercise of sound judicial discretion\u201d (page 544).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">For present purposes, it is sufficient to state that \u00a7 7A goes at least as far as the <em>Food Fair, Libby, </em>and <em>Esquire </em>cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>suggest, without determining what are the limits of its applicability. Under \u00a7 7A, injunctive relief is permissible in the present case, if the plaintiff has proved (a) that Skil as applied to power tools, accessories, and related hardware, although not a unique trade name, has come to have a secondary meaning in Massachusetts as referring to the plaintiff's products, for persons trading in or purchasing such items; and (b) that there is reasonable probability that the defendant, even in the absence of actual competition with the plaintiff, by use of the name may detract from the reputation created by the plaintiff in connection with its trade name or marks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, on general equitable principles, any possibility that the defendant may confuse the public as to the source of the goods sold by him may be given consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">3. Skil is obviously a misspelling of an English word in common use, and would not be a valid trade mark, if the word \u201cskill\" in its application to the plaintiff's product would not be. See Restatement: Torts, \u00a7725. Compare greater protection given to wholly coined names, Nims, Unfair Competition &amp; Trade Marks (4th ed.) \u00a7 202. Skil, however, is applied in a somewhat imaginative sense to inanimate tools which, apart from their users or manufacturer, are not related to skills. It thus is more than merely descriptive (compare <em>Randolph Refining Corp. </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>333 Mass. 506, 509) and can constitute a valid trade mark, which is entitled to protection from infringement and from unfair competition, at least to the extent that it has acquired a secondary meaning. See <em>Reading Stove Works, Orr, Painter &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>S. M. Howes Co. </em>201 Mass. 437, 438 (\u201cSunshine\u201d as applied to stoves); <em>Jenney Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Leader Filling Stations Corp. </em>291 Mass. 394, 397-399 (\u201cAero\" as applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>to gasoline); <em>Grills </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>322 Mass. 21, 27-28 (\u201cSealskin\u201d apparently assumed to be valid as applied to cosmetic cream); Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 715, comment c; Nims, Unfair Competition <em>&amp; </em>Trade Marks (4th ed.) \u00a7 203. See also Chafee, Unfair Competition, 53 Harv. L. Rev. 1289, 1293-1294, 1297. Compare <em>Lusta-Foame Co. </em>v. <em>Wm. Filene\u2019s Sons Co. </em>66 F. Supp. 517, 519 (D. Mass.).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The judge did not make complete findings on the issue of secondary meaning. Accordingly, we find the facts set forth below, supplementing those, already summarized, found by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The plaintiff has manufactured for at least fourteen years approximately one hundred fifty different tools and about one thousand different accessories, including saws, blades, drills, sanders, grinders, trimmers, and polishers. These vary in price from less than one dollar for some accessories to over one hundred dollars for some more elaborate tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The products are divided into (a) the builder\u2019s line, sold generally through wholesalers who sell to retailers who in turn sell to carpenters, mechanics, and home users; and (b) the industrial line of heavy duty tools, sold to industrial supply houses. To each tool a metal name plate bearing the word Skil and the plaintiff\u2019s corporate name has been attached since at least 1945. These words appear in all advertising material. The plaintiff\u2019s portable saws also bear the trade mark Skilsaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">In the years 1946 to 1956, the plaintiff spent some $5,515,-000 for advertising, including expenditures for space in magazines of both general (for example, Life, Saturday Evening Post, Popular Mechanics) and limited circulation and for catalogs, mailers, displays, mats supplied to retailers, booklets, and other printed advertising. Twenty-one Massachusetts dealers in 1956 applied for advertising mats, apparently for use on their own account for retail advertising that they sold Skil products, a matter of significance in showing that to them the name had value with respect to selling the plaintiff\u2019s products. In Massachusetts, besides a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>branch office, the plaintiff had sixty-one distributors handling its industrial line and eleven wholesalers selling its builder\u2019s Une to about eight hundred retail outlets, including hardware and appliance stores and garden centers. The plaintiff had gross sales in 1955 of about $17,000,000. New England sales amount to about $750,000 per year and Massachusetts sales to about $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Established competitors of the plaintiff regard it as a leading and effective producer of tools and as one of the \u201cnames that have become a part of the hardware trade\u201d like Stanley, Corbin, Yale, Black and Decker, and Millers Falls, whose products \u201cqualitywise . . . are all in the top group.\u201d They associate Skil, in connection with items sold in hardware stores, with the plaintiff. The plaintiff has had some success in protecting its trade marks and name from use by others, particularly by voluntary action of alleged infringers with respect to competitive items.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">More adequate evidence of consumer and market attitude would have been helpful. See <em>American Luggage Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Trunk Co. Inc. </em>158 F. Supp. 50 (D. Mass.). We conclude, however, that Skil as a trade mark has acquired a secondary meaning in relation to power tools and accessories. This conclusion is consistent with the somewhat ambiguous finding of the trial judge and with the statement in the defendant\u2019s answer that the plaintiff\u2019s marks and names \u201chave acquired no secondary meaning <em>except as applied to the portable electric power tools made by \\_the] plaintiff . . </em>.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The defendant entered the hardware field in 1952. He has sold hand saws by mail and through door to door salesmen. Thermometers, grills, key identifiers, and anemometers he sells under the Skill Built name, partly through hardware stores. The defendant in the first nine months of 1956 spent over $36,000 advertising grills and thermometers on the radio under the name Skill Built. He also advertised by store counter cards, catalogs, and mail flyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">There has been confusion, referred to in the judge\u2019s findings, on occasions apparently not numerous, on the part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>of customers of the plaintiff and others as a result of the defendant\u2019s activities. In addition there have been somewhat more numerous (about twenty-five in six months) telephone inquiries of the plaintiff about items mentioned in the defendant\u2019s radio advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">4. The fact that, in the limited field of tools and related products, the plaintiff\u2019s marks have an established secondary meaning is sufficient to lead us to grant carefully limited relief under \u00a7 <em>7A </em>against action of the defendant which is likely to* dilute the distinctive quality of the plaintiff\u2019s marks in that field. In doing so we take into account, among others, the considerations listed below. See Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 731. (a) There is a substantial possibility that dilution of the distinctive quality of the plaintiff\u2019s marks, in their special field, as well as some confusion, will result from the defendant\u2019s actions even if there is now little actual confusion and damage. See <em>Monroe Stationers &amp; Printers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Munroe Stationers, Inc. </em>332 Mass. 278, 280-281; Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 730. This possibility is emphasized by the facts that the defendant\u2019s items like the plaintiff\u2019s are distributed partly through hardware stores; that in the defendant\u2019s radio advertising the spelling differences between the plaintiff\u2019s mark and the defendant\u2019s trade name will not be apparent; and that the defendant uses the word \u201ctool\u201d in its trade name, although he sells no tools under that name, (b) The plaintiff used and registered its marks well before the defendant in 1953 made any use of the words \u201cSkill Built.\u201d (c) Although Skil as a mark is not as easy to protect as a more unique one, its secondary meaning can be protected to an appropriately limited extent. See <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Food Fair, Inc. 177 </em>F. 2d 177, 185 (1st Cir.). (d) The risk of damage to the plaintiff\u2019s marks in their proper field is not sufficient to require \"the defendant to abandon the trade name \u201cSkill Built 'Tool Company.\u201d These considerations, on balance, lead us to require that \u00a1the defendant in selling and advertising tools and other products of a type ordinarily sold in hardware or tool stores, bearing the mark \u201cSkill Built\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>described as made or distributed by the Skill Built Tool Company, use as a prefix in connection with these words, and with equal emphasis, some other distinctive word such as his own name or the name of the town where his business is conducted, for example, \u201cBarnet Skill Built Thermometer.\u201d This limited relief will impose no unreasonable burden upon the defendant, who, unnecessarily (see <em>Jays Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay-Originals Inc. </em>321 Mass. 737, 740-741) even if unintentionally, moved into a position where he could do some \u201cfree riding\u201d (see the <em>Esquire </em>cases, 139 F. Supp. 228, 231, and 243 F. 2d 540, 545) on the plaintiff\u2019s business reputation, to the damage of the plaintiff\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">5. This is not a case where the proof warrants an award of damages or an accounting of profits, if, indeed, the plaintiff still asks such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">6. The final decree is reversed and a new final decree is to be entered consistent with this opinion. Neither party is to have costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\"> See also older cases as to likelihood of confusion, such as <em>First National Stores Inc. </em>v. <em>First National Liquor Co. </em>316 Mass. 538, 539, 541-542; <em>Thomas Kerfoot &amp; Co.
