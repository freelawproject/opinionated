L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (the State administrative procedure act), inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1, to review a decision of the contributory retirement appeal board established under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (4), as appearing in St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The pertinent facts are these. From January, 1950, until his death on January 1, 1954, Lawrence Baruffaldi was employed by the city of Somerville as city engineer, and was a member of the contributory retirement system of that city. He had a history of heart disease, the disease \u201cbecoming progressively more serious in recent years.\u201d On March 13, 1953, he was admitted to a hospital from which he was discharged on March 28, 1953. The admission diagnosis was \u201cCoronary artery insufficiency due to arteriosclerosis, old myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, secondary to the coronary arteriosclerosis.\u201d He was again a patient at the same hospital from July 31, 1953, to August 2, 1953, during which period the following \u201cfinal diagnosis\u201d was made: \u201cArteriosclerotic heart disease with cardiac enlargement. Normal sinus rhythm, decompensated with coronary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>insufficiency. Angina pectoris.\u201d For about a year prior to his death Baruffaldi had been under the care of a physician who advised him to avoid \u201cemotional upsets.\u201d His last visit to his physician was on December 8, 1953. During the latter part of 1953 his use of medicine far exceeded the amount used in former years.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">As city engineer, Baruffaldi had the duty of supervising the construction of a municipal garage with a view to ensuring that the contractor was meeting the specifications of the contract with respect to time, materials, and workmanship. \u201cThere were many, almost constant, disagreements, heated disputes, between . . . [Baruffaldi] and the contractor regarding the work which caused . . . [Baruffaldi] to become emotionally upset on repeated occasions.\u201d These incidents became \u201cmore frequent and intense as the time for a change of administration as a result of the municipal election of November, 1953, drew close.\u201d Baruffaldi\u2019s term as engineer was to expire on January 4, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">On the morning of December 31, 1953, Baruffaldi became involved in his \u201cfinal and bitterest argument\u201d with the contractor. The argument related to the heating of the building, Baruffaldi contending that the contract required the contractor to heat the building and the contractor contending the contrary. This dispute was \u201cbroken off at the instance of an associate who led . . . [Baruffaldi] by the arm from the scene.\u201d Baruffaldi stayed on the job until 4:30 p.m., when he left for home. It appears that he was ill that evening but it does not appear that he sought medical aid at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The next day (New Year\u2019s Day) Baruffaldi visited the job and returned to his home in the afternoon. He died that evening about 9 p.m. The cause of death set forth in the death certificate was \u201cCoronary thrombosis (1 day) Coronary insufficiency (3 years).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The petitioner (Baruffaldi\u2019s widow) applied to the Somerville retirement board (hereinafter called the local board) for death benefits under the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The local board denied her application and she appealed to the contributory retirement appeal board (hereinafter called the appeal board) under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (4). Following a hearing, the appeal board reached a decision in which, after reciting the facts set forth above, it concluded as follows: \u201cWe find that Mr. Baruffaldi\u2019s death undoubtedly resulted from the impact upon his already diseased heart, of the argument which took place on the morning of December 31, 1953. We rule, therefore, that under the circumstances of this case his death was not the result of a personal injury sustained within the provisions of \u00a7 9 (1) of c. 32 of the General Laws. The decision of the . . . [local board] is affirmed [and the] appeal [is] dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The petitioner then filed this petition for review in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. The judge ordered a decree to be entered affirming the decision of the appeal board. From a decree entered accordingly, the petitioner appealed. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The rights of the petitioner to death benefits are found in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9 (1), the material portions of which are: \u201cIf the board, upon receipt of proper proof, finds that any member [of the contributory retirement system] in service died as the natural and proximate result of a <em>personal injury </em>sustained or a hazard undergone as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties at some definite place and at some definite time . . . without serious and wilful misconduct on his part, the payments and allowances hereinafter referred to . . . shall be granted to bis beneficiary or beneficiaries, in the sum or sums, and upon the terms and conditions, specified in this section . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">As stated above, the appeal board found that Baruffaldi died as a result of \u201cthe impact upon his already diseased heart, of the argument\u201d which took place on the preceding day and that this argument arose out of the construction of a building which Baruffaldi was supervising as city engineer. Yet, notwithstanding these findings, the appeal board ruled that the petitioner was not entitled to death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>benefits under \u00a7 9 (1). This ruling can be supported only by holding that Baruffaldi\u2019s death was not \u201cthe natural and proximate result of a personal injury sustained . . . as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties . . ..\u201d On the findings of the appeal board there is no basis for concluding that what happened to Baruffaldi did not result from the performance of his duties. And we think that such result can be said to be \u201cnatural and proximate.\u201d The petitioner does not contend that Baruffaldi\u2019s condition resulted from a hazard of his employment. See <em>Hough </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Board, </em>309 Mass. 534, 539. Thus the question narrows down to whether the incident causing his death was a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the intendment of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Clearly under the predecessor of \u00a7 9 (1) the petitioner would not be entitled to death benefits in a situation like the present. By G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 31B, as appearing in St. 1936, c. 318, \u00a7 1, death benefits were payable only in cases where the appropriate board, upon receipt of proper proofs, \u201cshall decide that . . . death was the natural and proximate result of an <em>accident </em>or of undergoing a <em>hazard peculiar to his employment, </em>at some definite time and place while the member was in actual performance and within the scope of his duty . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). In <em>Hough </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Board, </em>309 Mass. 534, a town clerk sought retirement under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 31, as appearing in St. 1936, c. 318, \u00a7 1, by reason of total and permanent incapacity. It appeared that his incapacity resulted from long hours of clerical work over a period of years, culminating in his collapse after attending a lengthy meeting of a town board. In refusing to quash the decision of the appeal board denying retirement, this court, construing language in \u00a7 31 which is identical with \u00a7 3 IB quoted above, said at pages 538-540, \u201cBenefits under \u00a7 31 are based upon disability due to an accident or hazard peculiar to his employment .... The petitioner contends that there is an analogy between the instant case and those arising under the workmen\u2019s compensation act where death was caused by an injury to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>heart resulting from overexertion or overwork .... But these cases are plainly distinguishable. . . . [T]he workmen\u2019s compensation act requires an injury but it does not require a personal injury by accident . . . while under said \u00a7 31 retirement allowances are based exclusively upon disability resulting from accident or hazard peculiar to the employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">It will be noted that the words \u201caccident or . . . hazard peculiar to his employment\u201d do not appear in \u00a7 9 (1); these words have been replaced by \u201cpersonal injury sustained or a hazard undergone \u201d as a result of and in the performance of duty. Section 9 (1) became a part of our law by St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1, which extensively revised our retirement laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioner argues that the substitution of the words \u201cpersonal injury\u201d for \u201caccident\u201d is significant and evinces a legislative intent to authorize retirement allowances in cases where formerly they were not permitted. It seems to us that this argument has merit. We do not believe that in substituting the words \u201cpersonal injury\u201d for \u201caccident\u201d the Legislature intended no change in the law. \u201cWords and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language; but technical words and phrases and such others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law shall be construed and understood according to such meaning.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third. The words \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d whether viewed as words in common use or as technical words which have acquired a peculiar meaning, are not the equivalent of \u201caccident.\u201d They are words which elsewhere in our law, and especially in our workmen\u2019s compensation act, have acquired a broader meaning, and we are of opinion that they are to be given such meaning in \u00a7 9 (1). It was held in <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, after full discussion, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the words \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in the workmen\u2019s compensation act were not limited to injuries incurred by accident, and that the aggravation of a preexisting heart disease by exertion or strain was compensable. Other cases to the same effect are <em>O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s </em>Case, 325 Mass. 303, and <em>McMurray\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 29, 32. Under such a construction Baruffaldi\u2019s death resulted from a \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">We have not overlooked the fact that \u00a7 9 has the same title as its predecessor, \u00a7 3IB, namely, \u201cAccidental Death Benefit.\u201d General statements of the scope or purpose of an act in a title may aid construction of doubtful or ambiguous clauses, but cannot control the plain provisions of the enactment. <em>Milk Control Board </em>v. <em>Gosselin\u2019s Dairy, Inc. </em>301 Mass. 174, 179-180. <em>Charles I. Hosmer, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>302 Mass. 495, 501. <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>320 Mass. 29, 31-32. The words here involved do not impress us as doubtful or ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The respondents direct our attention to the provision of St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1 (G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 2), that \u201cSections one to twenty-eight inclusive, to the fullest extent conformable to the terms thereof, shall be construed as a continuation of and amendment of sections one to thirty-eight A inclusive . . . and not as a new enactment.\u201d We find nothing in this provision which precludes the construction we have placed on \u00a7 9 (1). Nor is the board aided by the rule of construction that \u201c\u2018when a statute after having been construed by the courts is reenacted without material change, the Legislature are presumed to have adopted the judicial construction put upon it.\u2019\u201d <em>Bursey\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 702, 706. Here it cannot be said that the change was not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">It follows from the foregoing that the petitioner has brought herself within \u00a7 9 (1). The facts established before the appeal board show that her husband while a member of the contributory retirement system \u201cdied as the natural and proximate result of a personal injury sustained . . . as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties at some definite place and at some definite time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>The final decree affirming the decision of the appeal board is reversed and a new decree is to be entered setting aside the decision of that board and ordering a decision to be entered that the petitioner is entitled to the benefits prescribed by \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\"> The act was entitled \u201cAn Act to establish a single contributory retirement law for public employees\u201d and was recommended by a special commission established by c. 49 of the Resolves of 1943. See report of the commission in 1945 House Doc. No. 1950, page 10. It amended G. L. c. 32 by striking out \u00a7\u00a7 1 to 38A, inclusive, and \u00a7\u00a7 68A-68C and substituting twenty-eight sections in place thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
