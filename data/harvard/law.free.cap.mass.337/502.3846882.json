Allen (hereinafter called the insured) who died in 1950. She was the beneficiary named in a policy of fife insurance upon the insured\u2019s life in the face amount of $100,000. When the proceeds became payable upon the insured\u2019s death, the taxpayer became en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>titled to elect either (a) to receive immediately in cash the face amount (plus a small prepaid premium) or (b) to receive settlement under any one of the three stated options set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further provisions of the policy are also described in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The beneficiary elected settlement \u201cin accordance with . . . Option#2 . . . by 20 annual payments of . . . $6,847.08 . . . beginning October 9, 1950,\u201d with the proviso that, in the event of her death, \u201cthe balance of said payments remaining unpaid shall be commuted and paid in one sum\u201d to her executors or administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The insurance company made a first payment of $6,847.08 in 1950. The beneficiary did not include any part of this sum in her Massachusetts income tax return of income receiyed by her in 1950. The State tax commission (hereinafter called the commission) assessed the beneficiary for a deficiency of $135.85 based upon the omission from her return of $1,810.98 of the first payment, claiming that this $1,810.98 was interest on indebtedness within subsection (a) of G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 1, which at all times here relevant provided for a tax \u201cat the rate of six per cent per annum\u201d on \u201cinterest from bonds, notes, money at interest and all debts due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the person to be taxed\u201d with certain exceptions not here pertinent. The commission \u201cdivided the total payments to be made, $100,722 by twenty, the number of payments. The quotient $5,036.10 deducted from . . . $6,847.08 gives . . . $1,810.98 which\u201d the commission claims is taxable under the quoted provisions of \u00a7 1 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The tax of $135.85 with interest of $17.37 was paid. An application for abatement was denied and the beneficiary perfected an appeal to the Appellate Tax Board. The board also denied an abatement, holding that \u201cthe excess over the face amount of the policy paid annually to the appellant is the amount fixed by the parties for the use of the cash retained by the insurer and constitutes a receipt of 'interest' from a debt due the . . . [beneficiary] which is taxable under . . . \u00a7 1 (a).\u201d The beneficiary has appealed from the board's decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">1. This court has recently considered the question of what constitutes interest under \u00a7 1 (a). <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, </em>335 Mass. 431, (profits realized by a finance company purchasing a conditional sale transaction from a dealer held not to be interest). In the <em>Gordon </em>case (at page 437) weight was given \u201cto the doctrine . . . that tax statutes are to be strictly construed, and to the further doctrine that 'all doubts are to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer'\u201d and (at page 435) to the principle that the \u201cright to tax must be found within the letter of the law; it is not to be extended by implication beyond the clear meaning of the language used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The <em>Gordon </em>case and the present <em>case </em>both obviously present instances of payments the amounts of which, in a general sense, in part are determined by the fact that the payment of money owed is being delayed, but without any allocation by the parties of any specific part of the payment as a consideration and compensation for the retention of the money and delay in payment. In the present case, for example, the amount of the delayed payments is undoubtedly computed on an actuarial basis which takes into account the interest, at the rate of at least three and one half per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>cent per annum, which the insurer expects to earn on the unpaid balance of the face amount of the policy. It was held, in effect, in the <em>Gordon </em>case, in the light of the earlier case of <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>261 Mass. 134, and of the canons of construction of tax statutes already mentioned, that \u00a7 1 (a) exhibited no clear legislative intention to tax any unsegregated portion of the payments there involved. The present problem similarly must be considered in the light of the fundamental canons of construction just mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">2. We have not been referred to any prior decision of this court under \u00a7 1 (a) which is determinative of the present case. The beneficiary, however, contends (1) that the precise matter has been dealt with under the closely comparable provisions of \u00a7 22 (b) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) that we should follow the decision in <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>146 F. 2d 388, 389 (2d Cir.) in which the court (per Learned Hand, J.) held that \u00a7 22 (b) (1) did \u201cnot mean to separate ... installments . . . \u00a1(payable monthly under a provision similar to that in the present case] into principal and interest and to include the interest in gross income; but that it exempts the whole installment\u201d even where, at the death of the insured, \u201cit was the beneficiary, not the insured, who made the choice\u201d of option. The court rejected the \u201cargument . . . that, since she had the option of choosing between the principal and one of the options, it is as though she had actually received the principal and had reinvested it with the insurer, instead of upon some other security.\u201d See to the same effect <em>Law </em>v. <em>Rothensies, </em>155 F. 2d 13, 14 (3d Cir.); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>Bullard, </em>5 T. C. 1346, 1349. See also Hilgedag, Life Insurance Planning for Estate and Gift Taxes, 5 N. Y. Univ. Inst. Fed. Taxation (1946) 25, 48-51; Mertens, Federal Income Taxation, \u00a7\u00a7 6A.01, 7.03-7.06. Compare <em>Hall, </em>12 T. C. 419, 423-428; <em>Strauss, </em>21 T. C. 104, 110-111; <em>Jones, </em>22 T. C. 407, 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We have recently pointed out that in construing the Massachusetts income tax law (G. L. c. 62) decisions under the Federal income tax statutes must be used with caution in view of the very different character of the two taxes. <em>Second Bank-State Street Trust Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, ante, </em>203, 211-212. Here the language of the Federal statute is not precisely the same as that of the Massachusetts statute, and the Federal cases deal, to a considerable extent, with the construction of what constitutes amounts \u201creceived under a life insurance contract\u201d within \u00a7 22 (b) (1) quoted, <em>supra, </em>in footnote 3, rather than what is interest. Many aspects of the problem, however, are the same and the conclusions reached in the Federal cases are persuasive. What the beneficiary here receives is a payment as a result of a contract made with the deceased insured to pay her, at her option, either the face value of the policy at death or payments over a period of time in accordance with any one of the three options. What she received is the payment by one method of a debt which she could collect in four different ways. As Judge Hand points out in the <em>Pierce </em>case (at page 390), \u201cThe policy offered the beneficiary a choice between rights already in existence, with whose creations she had had nothing whatever to do; they came to her ready made by the insured.\u201d It may well be that, if she had accepted the first option, there would have been a sufficiently clear segregation of the item of interest, so that she would have received it as such, that is, as compensation for the detention of money. See <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>314 Mass. 285, 289. Having elected Option 2, however, there is no such segregation and the payments take at least the form of the payment of an obligation of the insurer to pay a series of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>principal amounts. Even though (see the <em>Pierce </em>case, page 389) \u201cin economic theory there is no difference between . . . interest [where the principal sum is retained under Option 1 by the insurer undiminished], and the interest concealed in an installment\u201d paid under Option 2, the segregation has not been made by the insurer and the insured in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Nothing in the statute expressly authorizes the commission to make the segregation for the parties. Certainly no part of each payment constitutes interest \u201cfrom bonds [or] notes\u201d under \u00a7 1 (a), nor do we think that any sum is set aside by Option 2 as interest \u201cfrom . . . money at interest and all debts due the person to be taxed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1 (a). Nor is the commission helped by the fact (see footnote 2, <em>supra) </em>that the beneficiary at her option may commute future payments \u201cupon the basis of interest at three and one-half per cent per annum.\u201d This privilege of commutation is in effect merely a further option, or a subsidiary feature of Option 2, and does not affect her absolute right to each of the payments provided under Option 2. We find no clear statutory mandate that a tax shall be laid upon any specified portion of each individual payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Three further considerations lend support to our conclusion. (1) On the theory adopted by the commission, the annual amounts claimed to be taxable as interest would remain fixed during the period of the instalment payments, notwithstanding the fact that the balance of principal proceeds in the hands of the insurer would be constantly diminishing. If a portion of each payment had been intended to be regarded as interest, such portions would presumably steadily diminish in amount as the principal remaining unpaid was reduced. (2) The Legislature has never imposed an inheritance tax under G. L. c. 65 upon life insurance proceeds passing to a beneficiary by reason of the death of the insured. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver General, </em>226 Mass. 306, 309. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>309 Mass. 293, 298. Where the right to elect to receive payments under Option 2 arises by reason of death, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>accrues at the insured\u2019s death, and is not then taxed under c. 65, it would take very clear legislative language to lead us to hold that any part of the later payments, to which the beneficiary became absolutely entitled at the insured\u2019s death as principal amounts, was intended to be taxed under c. 62, \u00a7 1 (a). (3) When in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (see footnote 3, supra) the Congress decided to tax the increment in such instalments based on an actuarial computation of an interest factor, thus changing the rule in the <em>Pierce </em>case, very explicit statutory language, supplemented by regulations, was regarded as necessary to reach the result. If a tax is to be imposed, under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 1 (a), on this actuarial increment in this type of insurance instalment, we think it should await a specific statement of legislative intention to do so similar to that found in the 1954 Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">3. Abatement is to be granted in the sum of $153.22 with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\"> The options were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">\u201c Option 1 \u2014 Proceeds left on Deposit.

S. C. (1946 ed.) \u00a7 22 (b) (1), 53 Stat. 10, provides in part for the exemption from taxation of: \u201cAmounts received under a life insurance contract paid by reason of the death of the insured, whether in a single sum or otherwise (but if such amounts are held by the insurer under an agreement to pay interest thereon, the interest payments shall be included in gross income).\u201d Somewhat changed provisions are found in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \u00a7 101, dealing with the same subject matter.

See also the regulations under the 1954 Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1.101-1, 1.101-4, which adopt, but on the basis of explicit new statutory language in the 1954 Code, a rule for partial taxation of instalment <em>payments </em>somewhat comparable to that here urged upon us by the commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b548-12\"> The parties have not brought to our attention any relevant legislative history nor have they introduced in evidence any administrative construction of, or departmental regulations under, \u00a7 1 (a) in force at any time during the forty-two years since its enactment, which would tend to support the imposition of the tax here assessed.
