(hereinafter called Association). Association leases from the Commonwealth the whole pier premises, of which those subleased by Cold Storage form a part. The same general situation was discussed in <em>Dehydrating Process Co. of Gloucester, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>334 Mass. 287. The facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The State Fish Pier was originally authorized by St. 1931, c. 311, \u00a7 1, \u201c[f[or the purpose of improving and developing Gloucester harbor for the promotion of the fish industry and the commercial facilities of . . . Gloucester.\u201d It was completed in 1938. On March 1, 1937, the Commonwealth executed a lease <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the pier to Association for a term expiring in 1949, which in 1945 was extended to September 30, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Association is a nonprofit, \u201ccharitable\u201d corporation formed in 1936 under the general law governing such corporations, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 180, as contemplated by St. 1937, c. 29, \u00a7 1, \u201cfor the purpose of administering said pier and its facilities without profit and in such manner that said pier and its facilities shall be available ... to fishermen, fish dealers and the fishing industry generally.\u201d Originally, Association\u2019s members were all members of the Gloucester city administration as provided in c. 29. By St. 1954, c. 252, \u00a7 1, the membership was changed to consist of \u201cfive . . . residents ... of Gloucester, to be appointed by the mayor for terms of three years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Association in 1938 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> entered into a sublease, of a large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>storage building on the premises to Cold Storage (a business corporation engaged in manufacturing ice and freezing and storing fish) for a term of ten years with a right of renewal for an additional twenty years. Cold Storage was required to pay rent and charges for water, sewer and electricity; to make its own charges for ice, freezing fish, or cold storage reasonable, competitive, and the same to all persons; and to offer its services to all proper persons without favoritism. The sublease imposed no express obligation on Cold Storage to pay taxes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1945, the sublease to Cold Storage was extended to September 30, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 3A, as appearing in St. 1951, c. 667, \u00a7 1, reads in part: \u201cReal estate owned by or held in trust for the benefit of <em>the commonwealth or </em>a city or town, if used or occupied for other than public purposes, shall be taxed to the lessee or lessees thereof, or their assigns, or to the occupant or person in possession thereof, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the said lessee or lessees or their assigns or the occupant or person in possession were the owners thereof in fee, free of any trust. This section shall apply to real estate which shall have been acquired by virtue of the provisions of a will or deed, and held by <em>the commonwealth or </em>any city or town in trust for public charitable purposes, whether or not the same is subject to a duly recorded lease which provides that the lessee shall assume or pay all taxes assessed thereon.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 15, reads: \u201cIf a tenant paying rent for real estate is taxed therefor, he may retain out of his rent the taxes paid by him, or may recover the same in an action against his landlord, unless there is a different agreement between them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Purporting to act pursuant to \u00a7 3A, the Gloucester assessors, as of January 1, 1956, assessed to Cold Storage real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>estate taxes in the sum. of $19,177.71 with respect to the premises leased by it from Association. Cold Storage paid the taxes with interest under protest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cold Storage thereupon deducted (see \u00a7 15, supra) the amount of the taxes so paid by it from the next rent payable by it to Association. Association has notified Cold Storage that the withholding of this amount from its rent is a breach of the sublease and threatens to evict Cold Storage. If all subtenants (whose subleases also impose on them no express obligation to pay taxes) of Association make similar deductions, Association will be unable to pay its rent to the Commonwealth. Cold Storage, fearing that termination of the principal lease from the Commonwealth to Association will terminate its sublease, seeks declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The trial judge found the material facts to be substantially as stated in the bill in equity, from which they have been summarized above. He ruled that \u00a7 15 has no application to real estate, taxable under \u00a7 3A, of the Commonwealth or a city; that Association \u201cis really a part of the city of Gloucester\u201d;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the \u201cLegislature did not intend that a tax could be assessed . . . and then have the city which imposed the tax immediately . . . obliged to return the amount of the tax to the taxpayer.\u201d He ordered a decree entered declaring that Cold Storage is not exempt from taxation under \u00a7 3A and that it is \u201cnot entitled to withhold from . . . rent due . . . Association the amount paid ... on account of real estate taxes assessed to it as occupant of the leased premises.\u201d Cold Storage appeals from the final decree thereafter entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">1. It is settled by the <em>Dehydrating </em>case (334 Mass. 287) that real estate taxes may be levied against Cold Storage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>under \u00a7 3A. The property subleased to Cold Storage is land of the Commonwealth used for other than public purposes. The character of the use is not \u201cdetermined by the activities of the holder of the principal lease,\u201d namely Association (see <em>Dehydrating </em>case at pages 291-292). As was said in <em>Cabot </em>v. Assessors <em>of Boston, </em>335 Mass. 53, 65, \u201c[although the maintenance of the pier as a facility was a proper public purpose to assist the important fishing industry, the use of the pier by the sublessees in their own businesses was held . . . not to be for a public purpose.\u201d It is for the Legislature to decide to what extent it will assist the execution of a public purpose. Here the Legislature has made no express provision for tax exemption of the pier in the hands of tenants operating for private profit, comparable to the specific tax exemption considered in the <em>Cabot </em>case (at pages 63-65), but has contented itself with assisting the fishing industry by the construction of basic facilities, leaving them taxable under \u00a7 3A to private business occupants, even though such occupants directly and indirectly contribute to the accomplishment of the public purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">2. The remaining question is whether Cold Storage is entitled to reimbursement from Association for the amount of the tax. Section 15, enacted long prior to \u00a7 3A, has been in effect in essentially its present form since Gen. St. (1860) c. 11, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 3A was first enacted by St. 1928, c. 111, \u00a7 l<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> probably following in some degree the precedent estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>fished in 1922 with respect to property \u201cowned by the city of Boston ... if leased for business purposes.\u201d See St. 1922, c. 390, \u00a7 l<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and other earlier precedents mentioned below.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Mr. Justice Gray in <em>Ammidown </em>v. <em>Freeland, </em>101 Mass. 303, 309, said, \u201cIt is within the province of the legislature to determine not only which party shall pay the amount of the tax to the government, but upon whom the burden shall finally rest, and also ... to provide that the amount of the tax shall be paid by one party to the government and recovered by him from the other party or deducted upon a final settlement with him.\u201d See also <em>Merchants National Bank </em>v. <em>Merchants National Bank, </em>318 Mass. 563, 572-574. \u201cIt is not always easy to determine where the ultimate burden of a tax . . . falls\u201d (see <em>United Shoe Machinery Corp. </em>v. <em>Gale Shoe Manuf. Co. </em>314 Mass. 142, 156), but it here must be decided whether the 1951 Legislature by \u00a7 3A provided that the ultimate tax burden should rest (in the case of real estate of the Commonwealth used for other than public purposes) upon the lessee or occupant without right of reimbursement under \u00a7 15 from any lessor. The cases just cited indicate that the Legislature has constitutional power to determine that the occupant shall bear the ultimate burden of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Section 3A, as originally enacted in 1928, dealt only with the land of cities and towns (but not that of the Commonwealth) used for other than public purposes. Section 3A first was made applicable (see footnote 4, <em>supra, </em>and related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>text) to land of the Commonwealth by St. 1951, c. 667, \u00a7 1. After 1928 and prior to 1951, if \u00a7 15 had been applied to land owned and leased (without an express provision for the payment of taxes by the lessee) by a city to a private business occupant, there would have been a strange result. The city would have assessed the tax to the business occupant, would then have collected the tax from the occupant, and, as an immediate consequence, would then have become liable to refund the amount of tax under \u00a7 15 to the same occupant. It is persuasively argued that the 1928 Legislature could not have intended this futile circuity of payment and reimbursement. See <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Commission, </em>324 Mass. 309, 314; <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>336 Mass. 60, 64. See also <em>Rossire </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>4 Allen, 57, 59. Plainly, a determination that \u00a7 15 was applicable to land taxable prior to 1951 under \u00a7 3A would not have rendered \u00a7 3A entirely meaningless, for it would still have had application in cases where leases from a city obligated the lessee to pay taxes. However, the language of \u00a7 3A is broad enough for the section reasonably to be construed as a specific direction that the lessee or occupant of land taxable under the section bear the burden of the tax,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Obviously, if, prior to 1951, \u00a7 3A in fact determined that city land leased for business purposes was to be taxed to the lessee or occupant without right of reimbursement from his lessor under \u00a7 15, then the same result must be reached after 1951 with respect to land of the Commonwealth leased for business purposes. In the 1951 act there is no indication that \u00a7 3A means anything different with respect to Commonwealth land leased for business purposes than it meant with respect to city land thus leased before 1951. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The fact that \u00a7 3A was enacted long after the decision in <em>Boston Molasses Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Mass. 387, however, must be taken into account in considering the relation of \u00a7 15 to \u00a7 3A. The <em>Boston Molasses Co. </em>case involved a tax imposed under St. 1904, c. 385, \u00a7 1. That statute provided that certain lands of the Commonwealth in South Boston known as the Commonwealth Flats \u201cshall, if leased for business purposes, be taxed by the city of Boston <em>to </em>the lessees thereof, respectively, in the same manner as the lands and buildings thereon would be taxed to such lessees if they were the owners of the fee.\u201d The molasses company, as lessee of such land, sought reimbursement from the Commonwealth, its lessor, of the Boston taxes assessed upon and</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">paid by the company. This court (at page 389) held that the Commonwealth, in making the lease, was acting in \u201cthe position of a private citizen\u201d and that whether it must reimburse the molasses company \u201cmust depend in the first instance upon the terms of\u201d the lease. The lease provided for the payment by the lessee of taxes assessed on buildings placed upon the property by the lessee but did not provide for the lessee\u2019s payment of further taxes upon the land and other structures. This court stated (at page 391) that the burden of these \u201cfurther taxes lawfully assessed upon the .leased property must, as between these parties, fall finally upon the lessor. The tax is a charge upon the owner by reason of his ownership, and must fall upon him so far as he has not guarded himself therefrom by the terms of his lease.\u201d It was stated that \u201cthe common law rule . . . 'where the lease is silent upon the subject, imposes upon the lessor the obligation to pay the taxes upon the leased property.\u2019\u201d See Am. Law of Property, \u00a7 3.76; McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 44.59, 44.71. The <em>Boston Molasses Co. </em>case has been cited' in various cases,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but none of them appears to control the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>In <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Quincy Market Cold Storage &amp; Warehouse Co. </em>312 Mass. 638, 645, it was said that \u201cstatutes providing to whom a tax on real estate shall be assessed and who shall be liable for its payment in the first instance do not determine upon whom the final liability is cast. . . . These statutes are for the convenience of the assessing and collecting officers.\u201d There is substantial ground, however, for regarding this last statement as not applicable to \u00a7 3A for it is apparent that the amendments both in 1928 and 1951 were intended as substantive amendments of the law, permitting affirmatively the taxation of hitherto tax exempt property, not to the entities in whose hands it would be tax exempt but to its users for business purposes, who, if treated as if they \u201cwere the owners thereof in fee, free of any trust,\u201d might reasonably be expected to contribute to the support of government by an annual tax based upon their respective interests in real estate on the assessment date.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In the <em>Quincy Market </em>case, while dealing with issues not involved in the present case, the court considered \u00a7 15 as having bearing by analogy to the issues then before it. It cites the <em>Boston Molasses Co. </em>case as authority for the principle that \u201cif there were no such statute [as \u00a7 15], there would be such a right of recovery at common law\u201d (pages 645-646). However, in the <em>Quincy Market </em>case, there was no doubt that the person assessed and required to bear the ultimate burden of the tax was the full beneficial owner who should bear his share of the burdens of government, whereas, in the case of the otherwise exempt properties taxable under \u00a7 3A by reason of their use for business purposes, the justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>fication for their taxation (rather than exemption) is the user\u2019s business interest in them on the tax date rather than the property interest of the exempt owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The foregoing conflicting considerations bear upon the interpretation of \u00a7 3A. If it were not for the <em>Boston Molasses Co. </em>case, we would feel (a) that \u00a7 3A, as originally enacted in 1928 and as expanded in 1951, was intended by the Legislature to tax (and to impose the final burden of that tax upon) the user of property which except for \u00a7 3A would be tax exempt, and (b) that \u00a7 15 had no application whatsoever to occupants of lands of the Commonwealth or a city or town taxable under \u00a7 3A. The legislative history (see footnotes 8, 11, supra) points strongly in that direction, as do the practical consequences of any other interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">It seems to us impractical, however, to distinguish the present case from the <em>Boston Molasses Co. </em>case. The 1904 statute considered in the <em>Boston Molasses Co. </em>case is in substance very closely similar to \u00a7 3A.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 3A covers a broader range of real estate than does the 1904 statute, but that difference does not affect the principles of the <em>Boston Molasses Co. </em>case. Similar considerations govern the fact that \u00a7 3A permits assessment to an \u201coccupant or person in possession\u201d instead of only to \u201clessees\u201d as in the 1904 act. Nor can we find adequate ground for distinguishing \u00a7 3A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>from the 1904 statute by the farmer\u2019s use of the words \u201cand to the same extent\u201d in describing the scope of the tax to be imposed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This refers only to the fact that the whole interest, the fee (see <em>Boston Molasses Co. </em>case, at page 388; compare <em>Squantum Gardens, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Quincy, </em>335 Mass. 440, 449), is to be taxed and not merely the leasehold interest. This was the construction given to a later form of the 1904 statute<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in this respect in <em>Grasselli Chemical Co. </em>v. Assessors <em>of Boston, </em>281 Mass. 79, 81 (in the absence of the statutory words \u201cto the same extent\u201d), and, sub silentio, in <em>Stoneman </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>263 Mass. 255, 258, 260, to the 1922 statute (see footnote 9, <em>supra) </em>which contained the words \u201cto the same extent.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AL\">This court has said that, in considering the meaning of a statute, \u201cit . . . must be presumed that the Legislature knew preexisting law and the decisions of this court.\u201d See <em>Condon </em>v. <em>Haitsma, </em>325 Mass. 371, 373; <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Board, </em>335 Mass. 610, 614. We think that this principle must be given great weight in the present case. Even though, as a matter of first impression, the present court might well have reached a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>different from that stated in the <em>Boston Molasses Co. </em>case, the case has been accepted as law for half a century. Doubtless, some lessees have entered into leases in reliance upon it. It establishes, in a sense, a rule of property law, not lightly to be overruled. If the Legislature had intended to change a rule of such long standing (as we think it could have done) it would have been natural for it to provide in explicit terms that \u00a7 15 and the common law rule mentioned in the <em>Boston Molasses Co. </em>case were not to apply to taxes assessed under \u00a7 3A. Since it did not do so, we feel that we must hold that \u00a7 15 does apply to such taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">If, as Cold Storage and Association appear to agree, the result of our holding will be that Association will be unable to pay its rent to the Commonwealth, then it may well be that termination of the main lease will cause termination of the sublease to Cold Storage, so that wholly new arrangements will be necessary. If so, Cold Storage may well have won a Pyrrhic victory. These matters, however, are not sufficiently presented on the present record to require us to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">3. Paragraph 3 of the final decree is to be modified to provide that the plaintiff (Cold Storage) is entitled to withhold from the rent due the defendant Association the amount paid by the plaintiff on account of real estate taxes assessed to it as occupant of the leased premises. As so modified, the decree is affirmed. Costs are not to be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\"> Association under its lease from the Commonwealth agreed to pay \u201call water or sewer rates and all annual taxes which may be lawfully assessed upon the premises leased.\u201d This provision was obviously only for the benefit of the Commonwealth and not for the benefit' of Association\u2019s sublessees. It does not affect the issues here raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-9\"> In 1947, the Commonwealth expanded the pier facilities somewhat.

In each case, there was a covenant to pay taxes by the assessed lessee, so the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>question (where Cold Storage has given no such covenant) was not raised.

This provision applies by its terms only to property held in trust and not to other property of the Commonwealth. Indeed the express inclusion of the provision with respect to trust property and its omission with respect to other State property (although possibly mere inadvertence) may give support to the applicability of \u00a7 15.

L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 3D, inserted by St. 1956, c. 690, \u00a7 1, which is expressed in much the same language as \u00a7 3A. Presumably, the suggestion is that \u00a7 3D is an instance (a) of clear indication of legislative intention to tax the lessee of property of the United States leased to others, where that is constitutionally possible, and (b) of a situation where no recovery by the lessee under \u00a7 15 of a tax paid by it would be constitutionally possible. A statute passed in 1956 would be unlikely to give indication of the legislative intention in 1928 and 1951. We place no weight on the fact that the 1956 act followed the earlier language. It is not necessary for us here to consider the relation of \u00a7 3D to \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 15 and other provisions of c. 59. Various questions presented by \u00a7 3D and related sections have already been pointed out in the <em>Squantum Gardens, Inc. </em>case, 335 Mass. 440, 446-453.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
