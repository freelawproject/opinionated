The petitioner was indicted for violation of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 123, \u00a7 112, in that on September 26, 1956, at Fitchburg he \u201cdid assist and connive at the escape of two patients and did secrete said patients from the Metropolitan State Hospital.\u201d He was also indicted for violation of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 265, \u00a7 23, for carnal abuse of a female child under the age of sixteen years. A jury trial was held under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, as amended. On October 24, 1957, he was convicted of a violation of c. 123, \u00a7 112, and found not guilty on the other charge. He was given an indeterminate sentence at Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Concord,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and commenced serving that sentence. On November 13, 1957, he appealed. Pending this proceeding he has been admitted to bail. The commissioner of correction has certified that the petitioner has been classified by the department of correction as serving an indefinite term for a misdemeanor and that the maximum time for which he may be held is two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">1. By G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 250, \u00a7 9, \u201cA judgment in a criminal case may be re-examined and reversed or affirmed upon a writ of error for any error in law or in fact.\u201d As to the limited scope of such reexamination, see <em>Blankenburg </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>260 Mass. 369, 376-377; <em>Aronson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>331 Mass. 599, 601-602; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>335 Mass. 476, 479-480; <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante, </em>264, 268. \u201cWrits of error in such cases may be brought at any time after judgment . . . .\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 250, \u00a7 10. In a criminal case the sentence is the judgment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 19. <em>Cherry </em>v. <em>Cherry, </em>253 Mass. 172, 176. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millen, </em>290 Mass. 406, 411. \u201cSentence shall be imposed upon conviction of a crime . . . although exceptions have been alleged or an appeal taken. . . .\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 279, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>There was no error in issuing the writ while an appeal is pending. As was said in <em>McGarty </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>326 Mass. 413, 414, \u201cOrdinarily the single justice ought to issue the writ if it seems to him that there is any reasonable possibility that error of substance has occurred which can be corrected thereby .... That the same points can be taken by appeal in accordance with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c: 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, is not necessarily decisive against the issuance of the writ. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marsino, </em>252 Mass. 224, 227-228, and cases cited.\u201d See <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>331 Mass. 439, 441. If there be any intimation in the <em>Marsino </em>case at page 228 that no final judgment in a criminal case can be entered while exceptions are pending, it is not to be understood as stating our modern practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">2. The petitioner contends that his sentence is unlawful because the statute prescribes no punishment with sufficient particularity. General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 123, \u00a7 112, provides: \u201cAny person who wilfully permits or assists, or connives at, the escape of a patient from any institution, or secretes a patient who has escaped therefrom, shall be punished by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of the court.\u201d Under this provision there would be no discretion to impose a sentence to State prison. In a penal statute a felony can be created only by express words or by necessary implication. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macomber, </em>3 Mass. 254, 257. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barlow, </em>4 Mass. 439. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>128 Fla. 79, 89-90. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cowen, </em>231 Iowa, 1117, 1130. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>155 Va. 1152, 1154-1155. The crime created by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 123, \u00a7 112, is, therefore, a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Authorization to impose a sentence for an indefinite term is contained in G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 31 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 770, \u00a7 99).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe court imposing a sentence of commitment for an indefinite term shall not fix the maximum term unless it exceeds five years, but shall merely im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>pose an indefinite sentence or commitment.\u201d G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 32 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 770, \u00a7 100). The classification by the department of correction doubtless was based upon G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 274, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and upon G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33 (as amended through St. 1956, c. 715, \u00a7 25), which provides that one sentenced to the Massachusetts reformatory for an offence other than those specified \u201cmay be held therein for not more than two years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">We are of opinion that the Legislature has thus indicated that a sentence of less than two and one half years could be imposed for the offence here. Otherwise the offence would be a felony. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 279, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Compare G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 279, \u00a7 23. Any requirement that the Legislature fix a maximum term of imprisonment is met by reference to other statutes. There has been no violation of arts. 12 and 30 of the Declaration of Rights or of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. See <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>256 Mass. 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">We need not consider the applicability of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 279, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>R. I. Sherman Mfg. Co. </em>189 Mass. 76, 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\"> The Massachusetts reformatory. G.
