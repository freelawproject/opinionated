Her husband asks consequential damages. The trial judge found for both plaintiffs and denied the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings that the evidence did not warrant findings for either plaintiff. Upon report to the Appellate Division, the findings were vacated and findings for the defendant were ordered. The plaintiffs appealed. The facts, in their aspect most favorable to the plaintiffs, appearing upon the report are stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">Mrs. Jacquot, a cosmetics demonstrator of long experience, was employed by Hazel Bishop Company and assigned to work in the defendant\u2019s store. In April, 1955, she bought from the defendant a fingernail kit made by another company. The kit consisted of five vials containing liquids and a powder. Mrs. Jacquot read the enclosed instructions and followed them in applying the material from April to July, 1955. Compare <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>336 Mass. 709, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>712, 714-715. These instructions \u201cincluded ... a warning against the continued use of the product for persons with allergies.\u201d Over objection and a request for a report, Mrs. Jacquot testified that the defendant\u2019s salesgirl told her \u201chow wonderful the product was\u201d and that \u201cit would enhance my hands.\u201d The trial judge found that the purchase was made \u201cupon the express warranty . . . that the ingredients . . . would grow . . . shapely nails.\u201d Mrs. Jacquot made known the purpose for which she was buying the kit and relied upon these express warranties, and any applicable implied warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In July, 1955, Mrs. Jacquot\u2019s fingernails became cracked and inflamed, with the nails turning brown. She had never used the product before. On adequate medical testimony, summarized below, the trial judge found that use of the product caused the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Upon discovery of the injuries, Mrs. Jacquot went to a medical clinic on the defendant\u2019s premises and was treated by a physician. She reported the injury to him on July 19, 1955, and to the floor manager of the defendant\u2019s cosmetics department on August 1, 1955. We consider the case on the assumption that the trial judge correctly found that Mrs. Jacquot gave to the defendant sufficient notice of the alleged breach of warranty. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 106, \u00a7 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Mrs. Jacquot was also treated by a qualified dermatologist. The history given by her to him showed \u201cthat she had previously had . . . transitory skin eruptions following the use of perfume and mascara.\u201d Mrs. Jacquot herself so testified. He gave as his opinion (a) \u201cthat the condition of the tips of her fingers and fingernails was caused by the artificial fingernails\u201d and that \u201cin reference to . . . [her] skin . . . [she] became abnormal to the reaction\u201d; (b) that \u201cthe average normal person does not have . . . [such] eruptions\u201d; and (c) \u201cthat the plaintiff was allergic to the liquid in the kit . . . [and] had a peculiar sensitivity to this particular product.\u201d In his ten to eleven years of practice as a dermatologist this \u201cunusual case\u201d was \u201cthe first ... he had ever seen of a person having a dermatitis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>resulting from the use of the\u201d kit. This doctor, with the contents of the kit, conducted patch tests on Mrs. Jacquot but not on other persons. \u201cNo analysis, chemical or otherwise, was made of the ingredients ... in the kit.\u201d The defendant in 1955 sold over five hundred kits and \u201cthis case was the only claim of notice ... of any injury ... as a result of the use of . . . [the] kit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Prior to purchase of the kit, Mrs. Jacquot had reported to the defendant\u2019s clinic for treatment of an \u201cinflamed eye following the use of mascara.\u201d Trouble wdth her eyes was ended when she stopped using mascara. She reported to the doctor at that time that she was allergic to fingernail polish.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">1. The salesgirl\u2019s statement that the product was \u201cwonderful\u201d was only seller\u2019s talk and has no legal significance. <em>Ireland </em>v. <em>Louis K. Liggett Co. </em>243 Mass. 243, 248. The express warranty that the use of the product would \u201cenhance\u201d Mrs. Jacquot\u2019s hands, when taken with the instructions against its continued use by persons with allergies, would not support a finding that the express warranty meant more, or had a wider scope, than .the statutory implied warranty, under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 106, \u00a7 17 (1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the product was reasonably fit for use as an artificial fingernail kit.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">2. For a plaintiff to recover for breach of an implied warranty of fitness of a garment, a cosmetic, or comparable product, sold for use on or near the person, the plaintiff must show (assuming, for purposes of discussion, that the implied warranty, reliance thereon, and notice of its alleged breach have been shown): (1) that personal injuries were suffered because of use or wearing of the article; and (2) that the article was unfit to be worn or used by a normal person. <em>Bradt </em>v. <em>Hollaway, </em>242 Mass. 446, 449. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>R. H. White Co. </em>314 Mass. 63, 65. <em>Longo </em>v. <em>Touraine Stores, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>319 Mass. 727, 728. See, however, <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Bedell Co. of Massachusetts, </em>242 Mass. 450, 453-454. This proof would be necessary not only with respect to the implied warranty, but with respect to a comparable express warranty. See <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>319 Mass. 690, 692, 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">By the dermatologist\u2019s testimony, Mrs. Jacquot estab-' lished a causal relationship between the product and her injury. Even if this causal relationship could also have been inferred from the fact that the injuries followed upon her first use of the product, she has not sustained the burden of proof resting upon her that the product was unfit to be used by a normal person or that it had some \u201cintrinsically unhealthy quality . . . that would affect a normal person.\u201d See the <em>Longo </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at page 728. There was no evidence whatsoever of analysis of the chemical content of the kit. In the absence of direct testimony about the sensitivity of her skin, there might be a presumption, or permissible inference, that she was normal. See <em>Payne </em>v. <em>R. H. White Co. </em>314 Mass. 63, 65. She is bound, however, by her own testimony that \u201cfollowing the use of perfume, nail polish and mascara, she had temporary blotches on her skin,\u201d there being no testimony as to her skin more favorable to her. See <em>Muir Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Sawyer Construction Co. </em>328 Mass. 413, 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Any presumption that the plaintiff\u2019s skin was normal, if there is such a presumption under the <em>Payne </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at page 65, disappeared once her own and the medical testimony, warranting a finding that her skin was not normal, was introduced. See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Mazurowski, </em>317 Mass. 218, 220-221; <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authority, </em>317 Mass. 297, 301-303. Any inference that her skin was normal ceased to be permissible where (a) her own testimony was to the contrary and (b) there was no affirmative testimony that she was normal. The trial judge was not warranted by the evidence in the record in finding or inferring, as he did, \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s skin and fingernails were not sensitive and that she never had trouble with them before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The case is unlike <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Yardley &amp; Co. Ltd. </em>319 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>92, 94 (where it did not appear that there was any evidence whatsoever about the sensitivity of the plaintiff\u2019s skin), <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>319 Mass. 690, 693 (where, the plaintiff having testified that there was nothing wrong with her skin before using the product there in question and that she had previously used a similar product, it was held that the jury might disregard her expert\u2019s testimony that she was unusually susceptible and infer that she was normal from her own testimony), and <em>Kurriss </em>v. <em>Conrad &amp; Co. Inc. </em>312 Mass. 670, 674 (where it \u201ccould have been found that the plaintiff had never before had any skin ailments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The plaintiff has not shown that she is one of a class of persons sensitive to the fingernail kit to whom the implied warranty of fitness might extend under the principle stated in <em>Bianchi </em>v. <em>Denholm &amp; McKay Co. </em>302 Mass. 469, 473. See Note, 25 Fordham L. Rev. 306, 310-313; Note, 26 A. L. R. (2d) 963, 966-972. See also Prosser, Torts (2d ed.) 503. Compare Harper and James, Torts, \u00a7 28.22. The only admissible evidence on this poipt was (a) that of the dermatologist who in ten to eleven years of practice had not seen another case of such sensitivity and (b) the evidence that, in over five hundred sales of kits by the defendant, this was the only one on which there had been notice of claim. See <em>Silver </em>v. <em>New York Central Railroad, </em>329 Mass. 14, 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">3. The trial judge admitted, over the defendant\u2019s objection and claim of report, testimony of Mrs. Jacquot\u2019s husband and of one of her friends that they had each made patch tests by placing small amounts of the contents of the several vials in the kit, on his or her thigh, then covering each such patch with a band-aid. After about a day in one case and forty-eight hours in the other case, certain of the patch areas showed signs of redness and inflammation. There was no medical evidence offered (a) to show that these patch tests \u201cwere done in accordance with recognized medical standards\u201d or (b) to interpret the tests. A motion to strike the testimony was denied subject to the defendant\u2019s claim of a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The Appellate Division properly held that these tests per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>mitted \u201cno rational deductions which could be helpful in determining the . . . issue\u201d here presented because the tests were not made under the supervision of a qualified expert and because \u201capplication of the material ... to the bare skin on the thigh is hardly a place to test the suitability of a product sold as a nail restorer.\u201d The evidence as presented had no probative value without medical backing and interpretation and should have been excluded. See <em>LeBlanc\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 265, 267; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Spering, </em>334 Mass. 458, 461. This was not an instance where a layman\u2019s general knowledge and experience could be an adequate substitute for expert interpretation. Compare <em>Lovely\u2019s Case, </em>336 Mass 512, 515-516.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Because this testimony should have been excluded, there was no admissible evidence whatsoever of any generally injurious quality in the ingredients of the kit. The trial judge should have excluded answers to hypothetical questions in cross-examination of a medical witness, admitted over the defendant\u2019s objection and subject to a claim of report, based on the assumption that such an \u201cinjurious\u201d quality had been shown. See <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Growers Outlet, Inc. </em>307 Mass. 373, 376; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>336 Mass. 609, 613-614. Compare <em>Mazukna </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>333 Mass. 331, 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">4. The defendant\u2019s requests for rulings that the evidence did not warrant findings for either plaintiff should have been granted. As has been shown, there was no admissible evidence that the kits were not reasonably fit for use by a normal person. In addition, in this action of contract, if the purchase was made by Mrs. Jaequot for her own account and not as agent.for her husband, he had no cause of action. See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Brockelman Brothers, Inc. </em>334 Mass. 225, 227.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\n<em>Order of Appellate Division affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\"> Statute 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1, inserted a new G.
