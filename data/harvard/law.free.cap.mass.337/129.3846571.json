She reported the incident to her supervisor but lost no time from work. She was badly bruised and had discoloration for about four weeks. She had no medical attention until September, 1955, but, in the interim, had intermittent pain and trouble with her back, which became so bad that she stopped work in September, 1955, on the advice of a doctor to whom she was then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>referred. Her duties as a file clerk required a great deal of bending and stooping. In October, 1955, she was admitted to a hospital where a fusion was performed on her back. She was discharged from the hospital in November, 1955, and has continued to have pains in her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The single member found these facts and (a) that the employee\u2019s injury in 1952 arose \"out of and in the course of her employment . . . and was the cause of her disability on September 20, 1955, and thereafter,\u201d and (b) that the employer had knowledge of the injury \"and was not prejudiced by any failure ... of the employee to conform to the statutory requirements.\u201d He awarded compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The reviewing board adopted the single member\u2019s findings but amplified them by finding that the employer filed, on October 10, 1955, a first report of injury dated September 28, 1955, that the employee had prompt and adequate medical treatment when her incapacity began in September, 1955, and \"that the insurer was not prejudiced because the employee failed to file her claim for compensation until February 13, 1956.\u201d In the Superior Court a decree was entered enforcing the order of the board. The insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">1. The insurer concedes that it had notice of the injury in 1952, but contends that it was prejudiced by the employee\u2019s failure to file a claim until February 13, 1956, on the grounds that this failure (a) destroyed the right of the insurer to a medical examination, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 45,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to furnish medical treatment (\u00a730<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>), and (b) deprived it of opportunity to investigate the circumstances seasonably. Section 41 provides in part, \"No proceedings for compensation . . . shall be maintained . . . unless the claim for compensation with respect to such injury has been made within six months after its occurrence.\u201d Section 49<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides in part, \"Failure to make a claim within the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>fixed by section forty-one shall not bar proceedings under this chapter if it is found that it was occasioned by mistake or other reasonable cause, or if it is found that the insurer was not prejudiced by the delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Obviously the protection afforded to the insurer by these statutory provisions for prompt notice and filing of claim should not be taken from the insurer lightly by any perfunctory finding that the insurer has not been prejudiced. The \u201cburden of proving lack of prejudice with respect to . . . the delay in presenting the claim was on the claimant\u201d and \u201cthe claimant\u2019s burden is not sustained by surmise or conjecture.\u201d Like all other findings which by c. 152 the board is called upon to make, there must be in the evidence sufficient \u201cbasis for a finding of want of prejudice.\u201d <em>Russell\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 680, 682-684. The long delay in filing claim even after the employee\u2019s discovery in September, 1955, that she had suffered disability calls for special scrutiny of the board\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">We see no prejudice to the insurer through any deprivation of opportunity to investigate the circumstances of the injury, for it concedes that it had notice of the incident. A closer question is presented of possible prejudice in failure to have prompt filing of claim in September, 1955, after the employee knew that some disability had set in, where it can be argued that contact thereafter by the insurer with the medical aspects of the case might have been of significance. Doubtless, the fact that for thirteen weeks she then received accident and health benefits from her employer was in part responsible for her failure to appreciate the necessity of acting more promptly. However, the employee then had medical care reasonably found by the board to have been competent. She remained available for physical examination, which the insurer did not see fit to make until nearly eight months after the filing of the claim. She was called as a witness before the single member and testified. The orthopedic surgeon who treated her testified at length and was available for cross-examination. The insurer points out no special respect in which there has been prejudice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>it through want of opportunity to participate in diagnosis, treatment and examination. We cannot say that a finding of lack of prejudice has no sufficient support in the evidence. <em>Tassone\u2019s </em>Case, 330 Mass. 545, 548. <em>Brown\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 343, 348. The situation is different from that in <em>Russell\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 680, where the injury complained of was an alleged aggravation of a heart ailment of which the self insurer had no notice until ten months after the employee\u2019s death. Compare also <em>Booth\u2019s Case, </em>289 Mass. 322, 325 (no notice to insurer at all until seven months after injury); <em>Meagher\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 304, 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">2. The insurer also contends that the evidence did not warrant the board in finding that the employee\u2019s disability after September 20, 1955, was causally related to the 1952 injury. Upon the evidence it could be found (a) that, although the employee had poliomyelitis at age eleven, she had no back trouble prior to the 1952 injury, and (b) that from the date of her fall \u201cshe had pain . . . she had a lump and she was very conscious of a drawing sensation right along ... a definite pain in her buttock all the time . . . right down in the left hip and buttocks.\u201d The 1955 hospital record showed a diagnosis of \u201clower back pain following a fall three years ago.\u201d The doctor who treated her in 1955 said that it was his \u201copinion that Mrs. Clifford\u2019s low back problem was a direct outgrowth of her fall\u201d and that \u201cit is causally related.\u201d On cross-examination, some of his admissions unquestionably cast substantial doubt upon his opinion but not, as we read the evidence, to an extent sufficient to destroy its foundation (compare <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>336 Mass. 609), reading the admissions in context. They went only to the weight of the evidence, which was for the board. A medical expert called by the insurer testified that he \u201cwould say there was a connection,\u201d assuming (1) that the employee fell in 1952, (2) that she had encountered no trouble with her back prior to the fall, and (3) that after the fall she had intermittent back pain. We cannot say that no \u201crational view of the evidence\u201d (see <em>Wnukowski\u2019s Case, </em>296 Mass. 63, 64) war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ranted the board in finding that the employee\u2019s disability was caused by the 1952 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The decree is affirmed.
