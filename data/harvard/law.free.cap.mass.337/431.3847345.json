The plaintiff agreed to cut down trees and level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the small knoll and the large hill on the westerly side of the defendant\u2019s property. The plaintiff further agreed to use part of the fill to fill in a pond on the front of the defendant\u2019s property. For all other sand and gravel removed from the defendant\u2019s property the plaintiff was to pay the defendant seven cents a yard. In order to enter the defendant\u2019s property and carry out the agreement it was necessary for the plaintiff to build a temporary road and clear the trees, and the plaintiff assumed this obligation in the agreement. The plaintiff failed to complete the work he had agreed to do and the defendant, with justification, terminated the agreement. There was a finding for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Both the plaintiff and the defendant moved for judgment on the auditor\u2019s report. The plaintiff\u2019s motion was denied and the defendant\u2019s motion was allowed. The plaintiff appealed. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The auditor\u2019s report was in effect a case stated. It was the duty of the judge to enter the correct judgment on the facts contained in the auditor\u2019s report. <em>Union Old Lowell National Bank </em>v. <em>Paine, </em>318 Mass. 313, 315. While the subsidiary findings of the auditor are very meager, they are sufficient to support his ultimate finding for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The plaintiff argues that the auditor made subsidiary findings, other than those recited above, which are inconsistent with his ultimate findings. It is true that the report contains several pages of material which might at first blush appear to be subsidiary findings. But an examination of these recitals, together with the fact that the auditor designated the portion of the report summarized above as his \u201cfinding,\u201d convinces us that they amounted to no more than a summary of the evidence. This was highly irregular. In the absence of an order of the'court \u2014 and there was no such order here \u2014 an auditor should not report evidence; bis duty is to find facts. <em>Lombardi </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>336 Mass. 587, 590. See <em>Jameson </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>250 Mass. 302, 306-307; <em>Joyner </em>v. <em>Lenox Savings Bank, </em>322 Mass. 46, 57-58. Accordingly, we have considered the case on the findings alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">\n<em>Order for judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
