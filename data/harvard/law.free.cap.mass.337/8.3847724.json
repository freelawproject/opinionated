The jury, taking the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>most favorably for the plaintiffs, could have found facts as follows: The minor plaintiff (hereinafter called the plaintiff), a girl seven or eight years of age, was injured on March 31, 1953, when she tripped and fell in passing through the rear doorway of the house in Revere owned by her parents in which she lived with her family. The plaintiff tripped on a piece of wood, a two-by-four, which had been nailed to the threshold by a workman, one Webb, about two weeks before March 31 in the course of installing an aluminum door pursuant to a contract for door and window installation between the plaintiff\u2019s father and mother and the defendant. The two-by-four extended the full length of the threshold and had been installed by Webb without instructions from or prior knowledge of any other person. It was so placed as to be flush with the inner side of the door in its closed position in order to block the entrance of the elements through a space under the door which resulted from a sag in the building and a consequent slope in the threshold. The space was about one and five eighths inches high at the lower end of the threshold and tapered out to nothing at the other end. The doorway had been measured prior to the date of installation of the door and the door had been built on the premises of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The evidence of the relationship between the defendant corporation and the workman at the time of the installation was ambiguous and confusing. From the testimony of Webb, the jury could have concluded, with reasonable construction of ambiguities, as follows: In 1952 and in 1953 until a date after the subject installation the workman was on the payroll of \u201cWarner Doormaster Company,\u201d which was not identified as a corporation, a partnership or an independent proprietorship, but which was affiliated in some way with the defendant, Richard Baird Company. The man who signed his payroll checks \u201cstamped Warner Door\u201d was the manager or owner of the defendant. The defendant, was a \u201csales outfit.\u201d \u201cWarner Door\u201d \u201ccontracted] as the worker . . . [and] did their work for them.\u201d The defendant did install also but \u201chandle[d] mostly windows in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>outfit.\u201d Later in 1953 Webb went to work for the defendant as a service man. Webb was ordered to do the work by one Sweet who was \u201cconnected with, or one of . . . [his] superiors at Warner Doormaster.\u201d Sweet was originally with the defendant company, but \u201cwas at Warner Door-master at that time.\u201d Work which Webb did in or about 1952 was work for the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">From the testimony of the general manager of the defendant, given prior to Webb\u2019s testimony, the jury could have found the following facts, not inconsistent with the foregoing: Only the general manager, a shop foreman and an outside man were on the defendant\u2019s payroll directly. The storm door installer, Webb, worked for the defendant at one time, sometime in 1953; at the time the door was installed he was not on salary with the defendant. He \u201cwas sent to the plaintiffs\u2019 premises by a foreman of the defendant company,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to do the work which was being done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u201cin accordance with . . . [the] agreement\u201d with the plaintiff\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Other testimony of the general manager, possibly inconsistent with Webb\u2019s, must be noticed, namely: The installation was done on \u201cpiecework.\u201d There were twenty salesmen or applicators working for the defendant on \u201cpiecework.\u201d The installer of the doors at the plaintiff\u2019s house \u201cnormally . . . worked with a cousin as an independent contractor.\u201d \u201cThat was the term ... we gave them in the business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s older sister saw the two-by-four installed and pointed it out to the plaintiff. When the plaintiff\u2019s mother arrived home in the evening after her daughter was hurt she saw the two-by-four and on the following day she \u201ccalled the company\u201d; the night she arrived home she called the salesman who had negotiated the contract but did not get hold of him. The glass in the door was broken by the fall and had not been replaced up to the time of trial (February, 1957) and the two-by-four was still in place. The plaintiff\u2019s father did not call the company when he saw the two-by-four but he spoke to his wife about it. The defendant had \u201crecords of service complaints [at the property] and . . . some had been rectified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The judge submitted to the jury three questions: \u201cWas . . . Webb an agent or employee of the defendant when he put the door in? Was there any negligence on the part of Webb in putting that two-by-four in the place? Did this little girl trip over the two-by-four, in consequence of which she went through the lower pane of glass in the door?\u201d To each question the jury answered \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The evidence permitted the conclusion that Webb was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>sufficiently the agent or employee of the defendant to charge the defendant with Webb\u2019s negligence. The jury could have found that Webb was working under the direction of a foreman of the defendant. Acceptance of Webb\u2019s testimony that he was employed and paid by \u201cWarner Doormaster Company\u201d did not require rejection of the testimony of the defendant\u2019s general manager, stated in the bill of exceptions in narrative form without qualification, that \u201cThe installer of the storm doors was sent to the plaintiffs\u2019 premises by a foreman of the defendant company.\u201d Perhaps the general manager was intending this to be understood as stating the fact only if the work had been done at a time when Webb was doing piecework for the defendant, and was not on the \u201cWarner Doormaster Company\u201d payroll. He was uncertain in his testimony. We do not think, however, that his testimony was such that the jury had to accept or reject all of it. See <em>Cosman </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>282 Mass. 224, 228; <em>DiManno </em>v. <em>DiManno, </em>332 Mass. 709, 711; compare <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>224 Mass. 405, 406. The testimony of the general manager and of Webb was consistent with \u201cWarner Doormaster Company\u201d having been a division or department of the defendant, with separate bank account, but without separate legal identity, so that even if Sweet was a \u201cshop foreman\u201d for \u201cWarner,\u201d he was as such in law a foreman of the defendant. Even if Warner had been an independent legal entity, the jury could have found that orders to Webb were given by one who, if a foreman for Warner, was-also foreman for the defendant. Nothing that the general manager and Webb testified to was necessarily inconsistent with this. On this premise the evidence permits the conclusion that, though paid by Warner, Webb was a borrowed employee for whose acts the defendant was responsible, inasmuch as he was doing business of the defendant, and business which was directly within the scope of the defendant\u2019s enterprise. Smith: Scope of the Business: The Borrowed Servant Problem, 38 Mich. L. Rev. 1222, 1233 et seq.; 1248 et seq. <em>Hasty </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>157 Mass. 123, 124, and cases cited. <em>Langevin\u2019s Case, </em>326 Mass. 43, 47 \u2014 48. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>See also <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Cushman, </em>103 Mass. 194, 198; <em>Cosman </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>282 Mass. 224, 230. The jury could have found that a foreman of the defendant had the power to direct and control the work (see <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 U. S. 215, 221-222; <em>Coughlan </em>v. Cambridge, 166 Mass. 268, 277) even though inevitably there would be a measure of discretion in the workman on the job. See <em>Delory </em>v. <em>Blodgett, </em>185 Mass. 126, 128-129; <em>Langevin\u2019s Case, </em>326 Mass. 43, 47-48; <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Association, Inc. </em>330 Mass. 135, 141. The jury were not obliged to accept the testimony of the general manager that the installers were \u201cindependent contractor [s]. \u201d See <em>Chisholm\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 412, 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">It was, we suppose, within the power of the defendant to show beyond doubt what the facts were as to the relationship between the defendant, Webb, and \u201cDoormaster.\u201d In the circumstances the plaintiff was clearly entitled to have the jury consider that part of the general manager\u2019s testimony which was favorable to the plaintiff notwithstanding its possible conflict with other parts of his testimony, or with the most plausible reconciliation of his testimony with the later testimony of an employee, who could be expected to have little sure knowledge of the legal identity of, and relationship between, the closely associated companies, on whose work, in one way or another, he was engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">We do not think that there was acceptance of the work by the plaintiff\u2019s parents such as to bar recovery. There are decisions indicating that, at some stage after a contractor has turned work over to the owner, the owner\u2019s election to accept the premises with the dangerous condition built in, and so to maintain them, may be deemed to end the contractor\u2019s responsibility, whether expressed in the concept that proximate causation has been interrupted, or that there is no longer a duty owed by the contractor to one who may be hurt. <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>T. A. Gillespie Co. </em>241 Mass. 280. Cases cited in annotation 13 A. L. R. (2d) 195. We need not determine whether or how far the principle underlying <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Yardley &amp; Co. Ltd. </em>319 Mass. 92, affects these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Here it could be found that the owners had complained, and had not accepted the work as satisfactory at the time of the accident. Two weeks was not an unreasonable time to allow for the defendant to overcome the dangerous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The installation of the two-by-four could have been found to be negligence. Persons crossing a threshold many times adjust to its height and the necessary lifting of the foot becomes a reflex action. It could have been found that to raise the height of the threshold about two inches meant that it was probable that someone would fall and created a condition of danger. The fact that the plaintiff\u2019s attention was directed to the changed condition does not mean that she was contributorily negligent as a matter of law in not recalling the change on a subsequent occasion. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. </em>292 Mass. 526, 528; <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>334 Mass. 455, 457. See also, as to contributory negligence of children, <em>Dennehy </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>321 Mass. 78, 81-82; <em>Ryder </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>329 Mass. 285, 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-6\"> As Webb finally left it, he was not testifying that he was on the defendant\u2019s payroll at any time prior to a date in 1953 after the door was installed.
