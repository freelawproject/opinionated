Gray against the American Bank-Note\" Company to recover a commission of 10 per cent, on an order for $3,000 worth of work alleged to have been obtained by plaintiff for defendant through one A. H. Bronson, the agent of the National Bank of Honduras, to engrave and print for said bank, certain notes and certificates. A judgment for plaintiff was affirmed by the general term of the city court, and defendant again appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b921-10\">Argued before Allen, C.

Y. Supp. 701, (Com. PI. N. Y. Dec. 1890.) At the request of appellant\u2019s counsel, however,- decision of the appeal was deferred, so that he might have opportunity of causing the case to be resettled, and the requisite certificate to be supplied, and so enable us to dispose of this appeal on the merits. Since then there has been sufficient time within which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>necessary application could have been made to and determined by the court below; and as a settlement of the case has not been brought to our attention, and we have not been advised that an application for -such resettlement is pending and undetermined, we feel justified in disposing of this appeal, which must be as intimated on the argument. The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
