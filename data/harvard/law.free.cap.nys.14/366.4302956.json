There was no proof of negligence on the part\u00b0of the plaintiff, or that he of .his own volition did or omitted to do any act, whereby the damages were \u2022created or increased. He was under no obligation (without request) to insure the property lost by fire;\u2019 and, there being a disputed claim of title to the property seized, it could not be safely determined whether any part of the prop\u25a0erty ought to be returned to the defendant in the original action or to the claimants of it. Ho injustice has been done to the defendants. The judgment herein hereby indemnifies the sheriff, and that is what the defendants \u25a0agreed to do. We find no error. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
