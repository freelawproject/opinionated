Y. Supp. 742. This is decisive of the present case, as the relator\u2019s petition was to be appointed to an independent and separate department of the city government. It is true the question raised in that case related to the removal of a veteran, but the same principle is applicable. The office of health officer, under the village charter of Yonkers, is distinct and independent, and not subordinate to any other officer or department. If these views are right, it is not important to determine whether the remedy sought by the relator was proper, as in no view could the court grant him any relief. The statute has been so fully and often discussed that it is nob <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>necessary that any further comment should be made.
