Y. \u00a7 1822, provides, when an executor rejects a claim against the estate of his testator, unless the same be referred, \u201cthe claimant must commence an action for the recovery thereof against the executor or administrator within six months after the dispute or rejection. \u201d Section 405 provides, where an action is commenced within due time, and \u201cis terminated in any other manner than by a voluntary discontinuance, a dismissal of the complaint for neglect to prosecute the action, or final judgment upon the merits, \u201d the plaintiff may commence a new action for the same cause, after the expiration of the limited time, within one year after the termination of the action. Plaintiff, on May 7, 1888, presented a claim to executors for worthless stock transferred to him by testator in payment for land. On June 28, 1888, plaintiff brought an action to recover the apparent value of said stock as so much due on the purchase money of the land. Plaintiff was nonsuited October 31, 1888, and on November 29, 1888, he commenced a second action to recover said purchase money. <em>Held, </em>that plaintiff\u2019s claim for reimbursement for the worthless stock, and for a balance of purchase money due by reason of such worthlessness, were one and the same; and that the institution of suit within one year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>after the nonsuit in the first action, which had been instituted in proper time, prevented the application of the bar of the statute (section 1823) to the second.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b715-5\">3.

The court instructed the jury that the measure of damages sustained by the plaintiff was \u201cthe difference in the value of the stock as represented and the actual value of it at the time the sale was made. \u201d It appeared that plaintiff had procured a loan of $1,500 on the stock, and that the corporation issuing it had failed, with assets about equal to the liabilities, including the capital stock. Plaintiff introduced no evidence showing the difference between the value of the stock as represented and as developed to be equal to 100 cents on the dollar. Plaintiff obtained a verdict for $5,000 damages. Held, that the verdict was contrary to the evidence and the instructions of the court, and should be set aside, and a new trial granted.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b715-7\">Appeal from circuit court, Tompkins county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b715-8\">Action by Charles M. Titus against Charles F. Poole and others, executors of Edward V. Poole, deceased. Edward V. Poole died on the 1st of October, 1887, and on the 12th of October, 1887, his will was admitted to probate by the surrogate of Tioga county, and the defendants were appointed executors. In the complaint it is alleged that on the 9th day of February, 1883, the plaintiff sold and conveyed to defendants\u2019 testator certain real estate situated in the city of Ithaca at the agreed price of $9,000, \u201cand accepted and received an assignment of what purported to be fifty shares, of one hundred dollars e.ach, of the stock of an alleged bank called \u2018The Home Savings Bank of South Waverly,\u2019 alleged to have been organized under an act of the legislature of the state of Pennsylvania, as full payment of five thousand dollars, balance due plaintiff on such purchase price, and that plaintiff received and agreed to receive said alleged stock by reason of and relying on the warranty, express and implied, and on the statements and representations hereinafter set forth. \u201d \u2022 The complaint sets out a copy of the certificate. Indorsed thereon is a power of attorney to transfer the 50 shares of the capital stock of the Home Savings Bank of South Waverly, standing in the name of the testator on the books of the said company, which was executed by the testator on the 9th day of February, 1883. It is alleged that the stock certificate \u201c was printed and engraved in the common ioim, and on paper usually used in scrip representing bank-stock.\u201d It is further alleged that the testator, \u201cby express words and by implication, warranted and represented that said scrip or alleged certificate of stock so transferred was in all respects what it purported to be on its face, and that all the statements and representations printed and written on it were true; and said testator further stated, represented, and warranted that it was a regular dividend payingstock; that it was a state bank, regularly organized under the laws of the state of -Pennsylvania; that it was all right in every particular; * * * whereas, in truth and fact, said scrip or alleged certificate of stock was not in any respect what it purported on its face to be. It was not regular bank-stock. It was not organized under an act of the legislature of the state of Pennsylvania. * * * None of the statements and representations written or printed upon said scrip was true, and it was utterly worthless for any purpose whatever. It was not in any respect what plaintiff agreed to receive as payment of said $5,000, and the transfer to him of the above-described piece of paper did not operate, in whole or in part, as a payment of the said balance, which has never been paid by defendants or their testator, and the same is still due and owing this plaintiff, together with interest from the 10th day of February, 1883.\u201d It is also alleged in the complaint \u201cthat said demand and claim was in writing, and was presented on or about the 29th day of November, 1888, and contained substantially the facts set forth in this complaint.\u201d It is alleged that the executors refused to pay, and that the plaintiff offered to refer, and that the defendants neglected and refused to refer, the claim. In the answer the defendants allege that the? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>claim w.as presented on the 7th of Hay, 1888, and by them rejected; and they allege \u201cthat the claim so presented May 7, 1888, arose out of and was founded upon the same transaction substantially set forth in the complaint in this action; that these defendants, on or about June 12, 1888, disputed and rejected the aforesaid claim which the plaintiff: presented to the defendants May 7, 1888.\u201d They then set up that the action was not brought within six months after the claim was so rejected, and that it is barred by the short statute of six months, according to the language of section 1822 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The answer of the defendants contains several denials, as ' well as other matters by way of defense. On the 28th of June, 1888, an ac-, tian was brought in this court claiming to recover $5,000, balance of thepurchase money for the real estate, by reason of alleged infirmities in the stock transferred in payment therefor, i The complaint in that action alleged that the testator, at the time of the transfer, intended to \u201cdeceive and defraud the plaintiff in the transaction in question.\u201d The issues in that action were brought to trial at a circuit on the 31st of October, 1888, and the plaintiff was nonsuited, as there was a failure to prove that the testator \u201cknew the. representations made by him were false. \u201d Thereafter a fresh claim was presented to the executors, and rejected; and on the 26th day of December, 1888, this action was commenced \u201con contract only for unpaid balance of purchase money, containing no allegations of fraudulent representation or intent.\u201d While the plaintiff held the stock he received a dividend thereon of $150. The verdict of the jury is for $6,922.67, being for $5,000, and the interest thereon from the 9th day of February, 1883, less the $150 which had been received by the plaintiff on the 10th day of February, 1884, with interest thereon from, that date. The verdict as to amount seems to be in accordance with an intimation made by the trial judge in the course of his charge. For further facts as to the defunct bank, see 9 if. Y. Supp. 46. Code Civil Proc. if. Y. \u00a7 1822, provides, where an executor rejects a claim against the estate of his testator, unless the same be referred, \u201cthe claimant must commence an action for the recovery thereof against the executor or administrator within six months after the dispute or rejection. \u201d Section \"405 provides, where an action is commenced within due time, and \u201cis terminated in any manner other than by a voluntary discontinuance, a dismissal of the complaint for neglect to prosecute the action, or a final judgment upon the merits,\u201d the plaintiff may commence a new action for the same cause, after the expiration of the limited time, within one year after the termination \u00f3f the action.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqMA\">Appellants insist that the short statute of limitations, found in section 1822 of the Code, applies, and bars the right of action, because this suit was not commenced within six months from the rejection of the first claim presented. In <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Bonnett, </em>50 N. Y. 538, it was held that the short statute of limitations (in 2 Rev. St. p. 89, \u00a7 38) was penal in its character, and should be strictly construed. Respondent maintains that, as the first action was terminated by a nonsuit, he was entitled to \u201ccommence a new action for the same cause after the expiration of the time so limited,\u201d by the provisions' of section 1822 of the Code, provided the new action be brought \u201cwithin one year after such termination\u201d of the nonsuit mentioned. Apparently the first action was brought by reason of the supposed misrepresentations, statements, and assertions alleged to have been made by the testator. In the complaint in that action it was asserted that the testator knew that the representations made by him were false. In the present complaint no such allegation is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>tained. The <em>gravamen </em>of the first action was a failure of the plaintiff to receive and realize satisfaction for his real estate from and out of the balance of the stock transferred to him; and the gist of the second action seems to be the same, or, in the language of section 405, it may be said the plaintiff has brought \u201ca new action for the same cause,\u201d and, as it was brought within one year from the nonsuit, it seems to be saved by section 405 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Our attention has been called to <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Board, </em>119 N. T. 344, 23 N. E. Rep. 921. That was an action against the county under a statute creating liability for the acts of a mob, provided the action was brought within three months, and it was held that, as the action was under a special law, it was only maintainable by its authority; that the limitation was so incorporated with the remedy given as to make it an integral part of it, and was a condition precedent to the maintenance of the action at all, and therefore section 405 of the Code did not apply. We think the case does not aid the appellants. It may be observed, in passing, that if it could be successfully maintained that the claim first presented, and upon which the first appeal was brought, was essentially different from the second claim presented and rejected, it might be said with force that this action was brought within the six months next preceding the rejection of the second claim, and it was not barred by the provisions of section 1822 of the Code of Civil Procedure. However, we prefer to uphold the plaintiff\u2019s right to escape the force of section 1822 by resting the same upon the provisions of section 405 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">2. After a careful perusal of the evidence found in the appeal-book, we are of the opinion that the testator acted in good faith and without any intent to defraud the plaintiff when he transferred to him the shares represented by the certificate which he held, and which are mentioned in the complaint. Such seems to be the opinion and ruling of the trial judge. Hear the close of the same case he observed: \u201cHow, as I understand it in this action, there is no claim here that Mr. Poole made these representations in bad faith; or that that question is here at all.\u201d Again he observed: \u201cI have no doubt but that Mr. Poole acted in good faith.\u201d The defendants\u2019 counsel took the position that, under the evidence in the case, \u201cthe question as to whether there is a warranty is a question of law in this case.\u201d Thereupon the court ruled, viz., \u201cI rule and hold it is a question of fact for the jury upon the whole of the evidence.\u201d To that ruling the defendant took an exception. The case seems to have been submitted to the jury upon the theory that it was for them to find whether there was a warranty; and, if so, whether there was a breach; and, if so, to ascertain the damages sustained by reason of the breach; and the defendants\u2019 counsel took an exception to that portion of the charge \u201c which, in substance, submits to the jury to say whether the stock had any value at all, or represented anything at all;\u201d and thereafter he took the position, by way of a request, as we understand the appeal-book, \u201cthat the rule of damages in this case is the difference in the value between the stock as warranted and its actual value in the market at the time of the trade;\u201d and the court so charged, adding this expression, \u201cThat is what I charge, if it had any value at all.\u201d Thereupon the defendants\u2019 counsel observed, viz., \u201cWell, we except to that portion that leaves to them again whether it has any value at all. Thereupon the court observed, \u201cI have left it for the jury to say whether it had any value.\u201d Thereupon the defendants\u2019 coifnsel asked the court to charge \u201cthat the measure of damages is the market price of the stock about the time or soon after the purchase;\u201d to which the court responded, \u201cThat is so, if they find it had any market value.\u201d Thereupon the defendants\u2019 counsel observed, \u201c And that the market price at the time or soon after the purchase is strong evidence of its value.\u201d To this request the court responded, \u201cThat is so; I charge that, with this qualification: that, if the price was based upon the fact that the persons who were dealing in it believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>that it was a corporation, that fact would affect it, but, if they were ignorant of the fact it was a corporation, that would be a different thing. \u201d Thereupon the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted to the qualification.' The defendants\u2019 counsel then observed \u201cthat such market price will control, unless the real pecuniary condition of the stock is shown;\u201d to which the court responded, \u201cThat would be so, within the rules I have.laid down.\u201d Thereupon the defendants\u2019 counsel requested the court to charge \u201cthat the burden of proving the real pecuniary condition of the bank is upon the plaintiff;\u201d to which the court responded, \u201cIn that form I decline to charge it; it is true the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show that this stock was of less value than its face, or of no value at all; that is probably what you mean.\u201d Thereupon ttie defendants\u2019 counsel took an exception to the refusal to charge as requested. From the quotations already made, as well as from other expressions found in the charge, it may be assumed that, the trial judge intended to instruct the jury that the rule of damages applicable was the difference in the value of the stock as represented and the actual value of it at the time the sale was made in February, 1883. Witnesses were called in behalf of the defendant, who testified that sales were made subsequent to the transfer to the plaintiff, at par. Dr. Cady testified that he knew of its being bought and sold in August, 1886, at par, and from- the time the bank was organized down to the time of the sale made by him that the value of the stock was par, and that the- market value of it from 1873 to 1887 was par; and the witness Brooks testified that he knew the bankfrom the time it was organized, in 1873, until it closed, and that during that time the stock had a market value; and, in answer to the question as to what it was worth, he says: \u201c100 cents on a dollar. I bought some of it, and sold some of it, and investigated as to its value.\u201d The witness Clark testified that he knew the Home Savings Bank from 1873 up to the time it closed its doors, and in speaking of the stock he added: \u201cI should say its market value on the 1st of February, 1883, was from eighty-five cents to a dollar on a dollar.\u201d Besides the evidence given by the opinion of witnesses as to the value of the stock, it appeared in evidence that the bank was in operation from 1873 to 1887, and during that time it was a bank of deposit and discount; and a witness was called who testified as to the assets possessed by the bank in 1883. Considerable evidence was delivered also indirectly bearing upon the question of the actual condition of the bank as to the assets' which it possessed in 1883, and the statement of February 3, 1883, showing the assets to be $226,174.88. William Kirby, who was the book-keeper in the bank from March, 1881, until the time it closed, in 1887, testified that he was familiar with the books and its assets in February, 1883; and he says that the value of the assets at the close of the business on the 9th of February, 1883, \u201cwas $171,000, and something over. * * * It would make the assets about equal to the liabilities, including the capital stock.\u201d If the stock, at the time of the transfer in February, 1883, was worth par, or if the shares in the assets represented by the certificate was worth $5,000, it is difficult to see how the plaintiff sustained damages in the sum of $5,000 by reason of a breach of any warranty shown to have been given by the testator to the plaintiff. It was incumbent on the plaintiff to show the value of the stock if as represented, and its actual value as it was. The plaintiff furnished no satisfactory evidence to indicate that the differehce between the value of the stock as it was, if as represented, and the value of the stock as it was, was equal to 100 cents on th\u00e9 dollar. We are therefore inclined to think the verdict is .not in accordance with the evidence, and that the jury did not follow the rule laid down by the trial judge upon that subject. Undoubtedly the plaintiff, when he took the certificate for the shares, became in equity the owner of a proportionate share of the assets of the institution. If, when he thus acquired an ownership in the institution, capitalized at $100,000, his one-twentieth share thereof was worth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>$5,000 at the time he received the certificate, it is difficult to see how he sustained $5,000 damages by reason of the breach of any representations shown to have been made by the testator. It does not follow that the plaintiff\u2019s damages are $5,000 from the fact that the institution failed in 1887, four years after he acquired an ownership therein. It seems he used the certificate, and by means of it he borrowed $4,500 from the institution, pledging the certificate as security for the loan to that amount made to him by the institution. We think the verdict is not in accordance with the evidence, nor the charge of the learned trial judge, as we understand it. Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
