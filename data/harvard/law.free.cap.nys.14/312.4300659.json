N. Y. \u00a7 1018, providing for references in cases where the trial will require the examination of long accounts, an objection to the reference upon the ground that the account of defendant, if long, was such as would be taken under a counter-claim, was properly disregarded when the answer pleaded as a defense what was pleaded in the counter-claim also.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b348-17\">Appeal from special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-18\">Action by Davis D.

The answer pleads as a defense what it pleads as a counter-claim also. Then the long account would be involved in issue upon the complaint, irrespective of there being a counter-claim. Order affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
