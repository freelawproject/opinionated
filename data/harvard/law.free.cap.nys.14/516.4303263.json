If an authority is needed for this proposition, beyond the sections of the Code relating to demurrers, it will be found in the case of <em>Kingsland </em>v. <em>Mayor, etc., </em>52 Hun, 99.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In that case the court held that, in a controversy submitted upon an agreed state of facts, under section 1279 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court had power to grant an allowance, and the court said: \u201cThe position of the defendant is the same as that of a defendant who demurs to the complaint in an \u25a0ordinary action. He admits the facts as alleged, but denies that they entitle the plaintiff to any relief against- him. * * *\u201d The demurrer is deemed to be a defense, under section 3253. We see no reason for interfering with the discretion,exercised by the court below, and shall therefore affirm the order appealed from, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-18\"> 4 N. Y. Supp. 685.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
