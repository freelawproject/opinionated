Proponent\u2019s relations with testator had been of a close and confidential character for many years. He was a magistrate, accustomed to draw business and legal papers, and to some extent had charge of testator\u2019s business, there being no practicing lawyer in the vicinity. It did not appear that the will was read to testator, and there was no evidence of a previously expressed intention by testator to make his will in favor of proponent. Testator\u2019s correspondence with contestants (his nephews and nieces) contained such recognition of kinship as to raise a presumption that he intended to provide for some of them, and in a letter to one of his nieces, he expressed a wish that she should make his home her home after his death. The last clause of the will was as follows: \u201cAnd I hope and believe that the said [proponent] will use and dispose of my said property according to my wishes to him made, and to the best of his judgment. \u201d <em>Held, </em>that a decree of the surrogate admitting the will to probate would be reversed, and an-issue as to fraud and undue influence would be awarded to be tried by a jury.

Lewis Burgess, the proponent, and sole executor named in the instrument, drew the same, and is the sole legatee and devisee named in the body of the instrument. On the margin is a note directing a cheese factory to be given to Seymour L. Western. The property devised and bequeathed in the will is valued at from forty to fifty thousand dollars.

It is quite apparent from all the evidence that the testator was not wanting in testamentary capacity to make a valid testamentary disposition of his property, and, if this instrument was the free and voluntary act of the testator, with a knowledge of its provisions at the time it was made, it must be upheld as his will. It is urged by the contestants that the confidential relations that existed between the proponent and testator, the fact that the will was drawn by the proponent in his own handwriting, and that he is made the sole beneficiary, to the exclusion of the kinsfolk of the testator, who are the more natural objects of his bounty, and the failure of the proponent to prove that the will was made over \"to the testator or by him, or that he knew its contents, raise the legal presumption of fraud, or undue influence or both; that such presumption is not overcome by evidence on the part of the proponent, and that the probate of the instrument as a will should for that reason be denied. The evidence discloses that the business relations between the proponent and testator in his life-time had been close, and somewhat of a confidential character. They had been partners in business years before; and the proponent, although not an attorney, was a magistrate, and accustomed to drawing busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>ness and legal papers, and to some extent had charge of testator\u2019s business, there being no practicing lawyer in that town or vicinity. While the relation of attorney and client did not exist between Western and Burgess, still it is apparent from the evidence that the former regarded the latter as a trusted business assistant, and to some extent confidential adviser, in matters of a legal and business nature. It is most natural that the testator, in the absence of a lawyer, to whom he could apply for the transaction of this important business, should select this proponent, who had been accustomed to do his business for him, and who to a certain extent had had charge of his business, and was, as appears from the evidence, the substitute for a lawyer in that community. Had not the proponent been named in the will as the principal beneficiary, no question could have risen out of such a situation. But when we find that the trusted friend and draughtsman of this will is made in it not only the sole executor, but devisee and legatee, of this entire estate, to the exclusion of all of the next of kin and heirs at law of the testator, we are called upon to inquire and determine whether, in the light of rules-of law governing the testamentary disposition of property, the proponent has by his proof overcome the legal presumptions that arise out of the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">In pursuing this inquiry we must start with the concession and assertion of the testator\u2019s absolute legal right and power to dispose of his property by will as he pleases, without regard to any supposed claims founded upon kinship or ties of consanguinity or affinity. These relations can only be considered as bearing upon the question of the probabilities of the instrument offered for probate being the free and .voluntary will of the testator. But the fact that a will is drawn by one who is a principal beneficiary in it has always been regarded as a suspicious circumstance, tending to cast doubt upon the validity of the instrument. By the civil law, such a will drawn by a legatee is absolutely void. But the rule of common law in England and this state has not followed the civil law', and, while regarding it as a suspicious circumstance, it has not, alone, been regarded as\u2019ground for declaring a will void. In <em>Marvin </em>v. <em>Marvin, </em>3 Hun, 141, note, Mason, J., in discussing this question, uses this language: \u201cYet the better rule to be adduced from the adjudged cases is that a presumption of undue influence shall be indulged in against them when the testator is feeble, weak, and in advanced old age. I do not mean to say that such legal presumption will be indulged in in every conceivable case, but the rule to be deduced from the adjudged cases in our own courts will fully justify this charge in its application to the case at the bar.\u201d In that case the one who drew the will was a lawyer, and acted as the legal adviser of the testatrix. In <em>Newhome </em>v. <em>Godwin, </em>17 Barb. 236, the testator left a wife and sister in comparatively destitute circumstances, and gave the bulk of his estate to his counsel, who drew the will, and whose influence over the testator extended beyond professional matters; there being no evidence to show' that it was in accordance with previous directions, or that the testator had previously designed to give anything to him; and it was proved that the testator, in consequence of illness, was in a state of mind in which he readily yielded or assented to the suggestion of others. It was held that the will was invalid, as having been obtained by undue influence, and the decree of the surrogate refusing to admit the will to probate was affirmed by this court on appeal. In this case the will was read to the testator, which does not appear to have been done in the case at bar. In that case,'Strong, J., delivering the opinion of the court, says: \u201cThe appellant drew the will. There is nothing to show that it was in accordance with previous directions,, or that any directions were given. It is true that it was read to the testator, and that he must have assented to it. His assent does not prove that it was his will, as the evidence shows that he readily assented to whatever was proposed to him.- This peculiarity, coupled w'ith the entire absence of any proof that the testator had previously designed to give anything to the appellant, or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>he had given him any instructions to draw the will,- lead strongly to the inference that it was the will of the appellant, and not of the testator. \u201d It is true that the case from which we have quoted differs from the one we are considering in this: that the will was in that case read to the testator, but that, in consequence of mental and physical weakness, the will of the draughtsman was deemed to dominate that of the testator; but in the case at bar, where it does not appear that the will was read by or to the testator, or that he knew its contents, and where the draughtsman was the principal beneficiary, the conclusion is quite as irresistible that this was the will of the draughtsman, and not of the testator, as in the case from which we last quoted. In this case, as in that, there is no evidence of a previously expressed intention by the testator to make his will in favor of his proponent, or of any direction or instruction by the testator to the draughtsman as to the disposition of the property under the will. In this case, as in that, the draughtsman is a beneficiary under the will. It is perhaps worthy of note in this connection that, while the evidence discloses no previous expression of intent on the part of the testator to make the proponent the recipient of his property, there is, in letters and correspondence of the testator with his brother \u00a1Seymour and his wife and daughters, such a cordial recognition of kinship as to raise a presumption that he intended them or some of them as the objects of his bounty, in one of which he expresses a wish that a niece make his home her home after his death. It is true that this letter was\"written long after the date of the will, but, as that instrument could take effect only at bis death,\" it may furnish some light evidence of his understanding of the provisions of that instrument, especially when considered in connection with the last clause before the attestation clause in the will, which reads as follows: \u201cAnd I hope and believe that the said Lewis Burgess will use and dispose of my said property according to my wishes to him made, and to the best of his judgment.\u201d While it is not, as we have seen, the province of the court to interfere with a testator\u2019s right to exercise his free volition ,in the testamentary disposition of his property, the court may, in determining the question of fraud or undue influence, consider the relations existing between the testator and the natural objects of-his bounty, and, judging from the ordinary motives actuating men, inquire whether the will is unnatural, and apparently contrary to the testator\u2019s previously fixed and determined purpose, and in such case scrutinize closely, with a view of ascertaining whether the act was free, voluntary, and intelligent. In <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>McDevitt, </em>63 N. <em>Y. </em>213, it was held that to establish fraud and undue influence in such a case it is not necessary that the precise mode of committing the fraud should be proved. If it appears that the beneficiary under the will had an intent to defraud the testator in order to procure a personal advantage to himself in the will, and had the opportunity to practice deception, and a result was produced in his favor contrary to the known wishes and purposes of the testator, and no satisfactory explanation of the change is furnished, the will should be declared valid. It will be observed in this case that the will as presented and probated before the learned surrogate is entirely inconsistent with the express request of the testator in his letter to his niece of November 13,1888, unless .the testator had confided to the proponent some direction or instruction in reference to his property which he supposed the proponent, who is named as executor, would carry out, as a part of the will of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">It is urged by the appellant that this provision of the will quoted above is evidence upon the face of the instrument itself of the fraudulent design of the proponent in drawing the instrument to practice upon the credulity of the testator by inducing the belief in his mind that some private instructions, not written in the will, could be carried out by proponent as executor, which \u25a0lie knew at the time of drawing the same could not be ingrafted upon the same, or in any way affect the positive devise and bequest of the entire estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>to him; and, while there is no evidence <em>aliunde </em>the instrument in support of that theory, it is perhaps worthy of consideration in the case, in determining whether under all the facts and circumstances the proponent can stand upon the <em>prima facie </em>case made by him of testamentary capacity and due execution, or whether the contestants have not cast enougli of suspicion on'the <em>prima facie </em>case to so shift the <em>onus </em>upon the proponent \u2022 as to acquire explanation from him. The proponent insists that if the draughtsman of a will takes a legacy under it it is suspicious only in connection with other circumstances indicative of fraud or undue influence, and in support of that proposition cites <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>23 N. Y. 9. In that case Comstock, J., upon that subject cites with approbation the language of Baron Parke in <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Butlin, </em>1 Curt. Eec. 637, as follows: \u201c All that can be, truly said is that if a person, whether an attorney or not, prepare a will with a legacy to him, it is at most a suspicious circumstance of more or less weight, according to the facts of each particular case,\u2014in some of no weight at all, as in the case suggested,\u2014varying according to circumstances; for instance, the quantum of the legacy, the proportion it bears to the property disposed of, and numerous other contingencies.\u201d In <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Coffin, supra, </em>the draughtsman of the will, who was a nephew of the testator, took the same amount bequeathed to other nephews of the testator, and it was held not to vitiate the will. The learned counsel for the proponent insists that before the will can be assailed where the draughtsman is a beneficiary some other facts must be established by the contestant tending to show fraud or undue influence; 'and in support of that contention cites <em>Post </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>91 N. Y. 539. In this contention he is supported by the last case cited, where, as in <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Coffin, supra, </em>the attorney and draughtsman receives a small share of the estate, and shares with other relatives in an equal degree; whereas, in another class of eases, such as <em>Nexse </em>v. <em>Nexse, </em>*41 N. Y. 229, where the draughtsman and attorney receives as a legacy a considerable portion of the estate, he is required to explain the transaction by more than usual formal proof. In this case Davies, J., in discussing the duty of a beneficiary under such circumstances, at page 232, uses this language: \u201cIt easts upon him, in addition to the ordinary burden of a proponent of a will, the additional one of establishing it by testimony of a more clear and satisfactory character. The courts demand in such case satisfactory proof that the party executing the will clearly understood and fully intended to make'that disposition of his property which the instrument purports to direct.\u201d It is true that in this case the will was admitted to probate, but it was upon the explanatory evidence of the draughtsman, who testified to all the circumstances of the execution and of the testatrix\u2019s knowledge of the contents of the will, which had been in her possession for some time before its execution. But it is urged by the learned counsel for proponent that the legal presumption obtains and exists in support of his contention that the testator knew the contents of the will, and cites' <em>In re Will of Coleman, </em>111 N. Y. 227, 19 N. E. Rep. 71, upon that point. That was a case where the attorneys who drew the will were objected to as witnesses to its execution. Objections were made under section 835 of the Code; and upon the question of testator\u2019s waiver of the privilege of the attorneys by making them subscribing witnesses the court says: \u201cThe law presumes knowledge on his [testator\u2019s] part of his provisions, \u201d etc. We cannot believe that the court intended by that expression to extend that doctrine of presumption to a case like this. We think, therefore, in this case the burden was cast upon the proponent of showing that the testator understood the provisions of this will, and that it was not the subject of artifice, fraud, or undue influence, by proof, in addition to the ordinary evidence required by statute to establish a will and admit it to probate. We do not see how this will can be declared a trust, as there is no <em>cestui que trust </em>named in it; and in such case, if it created a trust, the trustee would hold it without account<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>ability to any one, unless it should be held that a resulting trust was created in favor of testator\u2019s heirs in law or next of kin, in which case there is no apparent reason for declaring a trust, as the estate would descend to them by the laws of distribution or descent, either directly or through the medium of a personal representative. The decree of the surrogate is reversed, and an issue awarded to be tried by a jury, issues to be settled by a judge of this court, unless fixed by the stipulation of the parties. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
