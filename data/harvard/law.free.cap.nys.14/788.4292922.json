Bruen against the Manhattan Bailway Company and the Metropolitan Elevated Bailway Company to recover damages alleged to .have been inflicted on plaintiff\u2019s property, Bo. 118 West Third street, by reason of the construction, maintenance, and operation of defendants\u2019 elevated railway in the street in front thereof. The complaint alleged that \u201cthe plaintiff is and was the owner in fee of certain premises in the city of Bew York, and described as follows;\u201d and also that \u201cthe plaintiff, as owner of said described premises, owns and holds, and did own and hold, an easement in the land upon which West Third street is and was laid out;\u201d and also that \u201cthis plaintiff owns and is seised in fee, and did own and was seised, of one-half of that part of West Third street immediately in front of and abutting upon her land.\u201d The answer denied any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the first allegation, and denied the others. On the trial no attempt was made to show that the plaintiff owned any part of the bed of the .street, which was opened under the law of 1813, and there was no question as to the plaintiff\u2019s title to the property in suit. The title-deeds to the property were received in evidence, but the defendants offered no testimony designed to rebut the evidence of the plaintiff on that point, and did not set up any claim to the ownership of any part of the property. The jury returned a verdict of six cents in favor of the plaintiff. Defendants thereupon presented their bill of costs to the clerk, and it was duly taxed. Thereafter the plaintiff moved that defendants\u2019 bill of costs be set aside, and plaintiff\u2019s bill taxed, on the ground that a claim of title to real property came in question upon the trial or arose in the pleadings, bringing the case within Code Civil Proc. B. Y. \u00a7 3228, which provides that \u201cthe plaintiff is entitled to costs, of course, upon the rendering of a final judgment in his favor in either of the following actions: (1) An. action triable by a jury, to recover real property, cran interest in real property; or in which a claim of title to real property arises upon the pleadings, or is certified to have come in question upon the trial.\u201d The motion was granted, and an order entered, from which defendants now appeal. The trial judge also granted a certificate that a claim of title to real property came in question upon the trial. The defendants then moved to set aside the certificate, and from the order entered upon the denial of their motion they also appeal. The opinion of Daly, C. J., is reported in 14 B. Y. Supp. 285.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b825-6\">Argued before Allen, P.
