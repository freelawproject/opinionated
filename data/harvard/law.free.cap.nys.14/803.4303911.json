In 1891 defendant changed the name of its paper to that of \u201cThe Electrical Age, \u201d and adopted a title-page.similar in general to that of plaintiff, but having points of striking diversity, and printed in and upon other and different colors.

This was finally adopted from, and by way of improvement upon, a preceding publication of the plaintiff, and likewise devoted to the consideration and discussion of electrical intelligence. The defendant has been the publisher of another newspaper devoted to the same subjects, and its title-page has been changed from that which characterized and identified it prior to the present year. Early in 1891 it was designated by the name of \u201cThe Electrical Age,\u201d instead of \u201cThe Electric Age,\u201d which was previously the name given to it. When this change was made in the early part of 1891, other structures and devices were combined with the name, producing a general resemblance to the title-page of the plaintiff\u2019s newspaper, but still differing in the location of the objects, and printed in and upon other and different colors. While there are points of general resemblance, there are also features of striking diversity, rendering the inference at least somewhat uncertain whether the defendant is publishing its newspaper under such a form of title-page as is calculated to produce the belief in the minds of subscribers or purchasers that the defendant\u2019s is the paper of the plaintiff. If that could, upon the affidavits and exhibits, be concluded to be the fact, then the case would be one for an injunction, for that would be a violation of the plaintiff\u2019s rights, which no court could permit to be successfully devised and followed. <em>American Grocer Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Grocer Pub. Co., </em>25 Hun, 898; <em>Koehler </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>122 N. Y. 65, 72-74, 25 N. E. Rep. 285; <em>Vulcan </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>11 N. Y. Supp. 668. But the conclusion that subscribers or purchasers will be deceived by the appearance of the frontispiece and title of the defendant\u2019s newspaper into the belief that it is in fact the plaintiff\u2019s publication has not been so certainly sustained as to present a case for an injunction during the pendency of the action. It is not intended to be intimated that after a full hearing of the evidence which maybe adduced the plaintiff may not be entitled to succeed, but simply for the present to say that the probability in its favor is not so free from substantial doubt as to entitle it to an injunction before the trial. At no remote period the issue between the parties can be disposed of upon a hearing of their testimony, which will form a more certain criterion for definite and certain action than the complaint and affidavits now before the court; and until then, no serious injury can result to the plaintiff by allowing the situation to remain as it now is. The order denying the injunction should be affirmed, with $10 costs and the disbursements on the appeal to abide the final result of the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
