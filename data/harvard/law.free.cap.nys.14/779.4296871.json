Thomas and others against James H. Whitlegge. On the 9th day of March, 1891, the defendant\u2019s attorney, upon his affidavit, procured an \u201corder to show cause,\u201d directing the justice to amend the return filed by him to an appeal, by striking therefrom certain matters, and by inserting additional matter therein, or that he show cause, etc. The order to show cause was applied for and issued on the 9th of March, and contained a provision requiring the order and affidavit to be served on appellant\u2019s attorney on or before the 14th day of March, the return-day being the 18th day of March. The amended return of the justice was filed on March 13th, he having availed himself of the alternative direction to show cause. Code Civil Proc. $7. Y. \u00a7 780, provides that notice of a motion or other proceeding before a judge shall be served at least eight days before the time appointed for the hearing.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b815-14\">Argued before Daly, C.

The right of the justice, upon his own motion, to make such supplementary return by leave of the court, was not questioned. Where one party obtains an order to show cause requiring the justice to amend his return in certain particulars, or show cause to the contrary, the justice is authorized to immediately file a return so amended, without waiting for a final order upon the motion, if the facts, in his judgment, require such amendment. He has the leave of the court to do so, and the service of the order to show cause upon the other party to the action, even after the amended return is filed, (but before the return-day, of course,) is sufficient notice to such other party, whose duty it is to attend upon return-day to hear the answer of the justice to the application, and who cannot, therefore, be surprised by the amendment. Here the justice availed himself of the leave given by the order to show cause and filed the amended return. The opposite party, having heard of it, moved to set aside the order to show cause, and also to set aside the amended return, on the ground that the order was irregular, and grants a contested motion <em>ex parte, </em>and was fraudulently obtained. Whatever irregularity or fraud there might be in obtaining the order, it could not affect the return made by the justice, who is required to look no further than the order granting him permission to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>an amended return, and to the justice and propriety of the amendment which he was authorized to make; so that, even if the order were vacated for irregularity or fraud, the amended return could not be vacated. The remedy of the party aggrieved is to mpve for a further amended return, or to proceed against the justice for a false return. ' The order was not irregular. It is a practice to institute the proceeding to procure an amended return by an order to show cause in the alternative; and, as the order was not returnable in less than eight days, it was not irregular in the particular respect complained of. The order did not decide the motion in advance. The fact that the justice was given leave to comply with the alternative portion of the order was not an adjudication by the court upon a contested motion. If the justice complied, there was no contest, so far as he was concerned; and there was no adjudication against appellant, because he cannot contest this question with the justice upon the motion. The justice has the right to amend his return by leave of the court upon notice. The order must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
