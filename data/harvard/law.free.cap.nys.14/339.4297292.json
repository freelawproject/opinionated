Thorn against Oliver T. Beard, for professional services rendered by plaintiff as an attorney. At the trial it appeared that part of such services were performed by plaintiff as guardian <em>ad litem </em>for minor children of defendant, in certain proceedings in the surrogate\u2019s court, in which defendant\u2019s interest was not identical with the interests of his children. The court excluded such services from the consideration of the jury. As to the remaining portion of the services sued for, plaintiff testified that he was employed by defendant in regard to proceedings contemplated, which were not involved in the other proceedings, and that he did work in pursuance of such employment, but the parties separated before any case was finally prepared, and no action was commenced. He also testified as to the value of the services so rendered. Defendant denied any employment of plaintiff. The jury found a verdict for plaintiff. Both parties appeal from the judgment for plaintiff entered on the verdict.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b375-13\">Argued before Dykman and Pratt, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-14\"><em>Homer A.

In those proceedings plaintiff was guardian <em>ad litem </em>for defendant\u2019s children. Their'interests were not identical with those of their father, and any agreement of the father to compensate the guardian would be contrary to public policy\". The evidence does not show that any service was rendered before the appointment as guardian. As to the one item on which plaintiff was allowed to go to the jury we find no error. There was a question of fact upon which the verdict was decisive. Judgment affirmed. Ho costs. ' \u2022 \u2019</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
