Blake and Charles Waterman\u2014on promissory notes executed by the defendants. The defendants in each case appeal from an order denying their motions to set aside the inquests, and judgments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>therein taken by default. The principal ground of the motions in the court jb\u2019elow was the alleged inability of the defendants\u2019 attorney to be present on .the day when the verdict was taken. He alleged that he was the,n engaged \u00a1in^, trial in New York city, at which defendants, his clients, were present, (which ended shortly after 8 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, after which it appeared ^hac.there was ample time and opportunity to reach White Plains, the place .of trial of these actions, before the case was called at a quarter past 5 o\u2019clock .of tlie'same afternoon. The managing clerk of defendants\u2019 attorney, himself .a,lawyer, was present at the session of the court at White Plains, and could have telephoned to the defendants to attend the.impending trial; but instead of doing so waited until the case was called, declared defendants ready for trial, and then objected to the constitution of the jury; which objection was overruled, and a judgment entered upon the inquest.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b483-5\">Argued before Barnard, P.

It is evident, from an examination of the pampers on this appeal, that there was no merit in the defense, and that the whole \u00a1.effort of the defendant was to secure delay. Hot only does it appear that the fnotes sued'.'\u00fapon were, given for a valid consideration, but liability had been .conceded by the defendant. If the counsel for the defendant had exercised .due diligence,' he could have reached the court at White Plains at the time the case was called for trial. He was represented, however, and what took place must be regarded as a trial. It does not appear that there was not a \u00a1legal panel of jurors present to try one of the cases when called; besides, no challenge'was made that was sufficient to raise that question. The plaintiff was no .way in fault for the absence of defendants\u2019 witnesses, and no motion was m.ade to postpone on the ground, of absence of witnesses. In one \u00a1 case thqre 'was no appearance at the circuit, and default and inquest were duly tak\u00e9n. Such being the case, it was incumbent in that case to show merits, which was not done. We do not think there was any irregularity in either case sufficient to warrant the granting of the motions; neither do we /.think there is .\"any merit in the defense in either action. Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
