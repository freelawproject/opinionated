Code Civil Proc. N. Y. \u00a7 3272, provides as follows: \u201cWhere security for costs is required to be given, the court in which the action is pending, or. except \u25a0in a case specified in the last section, a judge thereof, upon due proof, by affidavit of the facts, must make an order requiring the plaintiff, within a time \u2022specified, either to pay into court the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, to be applied to the payment of the costs, if any, awarded against him, or, at his election, to file with the clerk an undertaking, and to serve a written notice of the payment or of the filing upon the defendant\u2019s attorney, and staying all other proceedings on the part of the plaintiff, except to review or vacate the order, until the payment of filing, and notice thereof, and also, if an \u25a0undertaking is given, the allowance of the same.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b944-6\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

That section was complied with by the order which was made in the court below, and the power of the court was then exhausted, so far as the original application was concerned. We think, therefore, that the order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 \u25a0costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
