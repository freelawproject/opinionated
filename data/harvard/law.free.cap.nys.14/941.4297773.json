The charge of the-judge was not excepted to. The questions are all settled by the previous decision, reported 11 N. Y. Supp. .112. The ease of <em>Sturgis </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>45 N. Y. 446, has no application, for the reason that the statute there construed gave a single penalty of $100, and it was pointed out by the court that it was. not given for each offense. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
