Humphreys, his wife, Mary Elizabeth Hall, Thomas Hall, her husband, and Matthias Trimmer, to foreclose a mortgage. The defense set up is that plaintiff\u2019s attorney purchased the mortgage with the intent and for the purpose of bringing an action thereon, in violation of Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 73, which provides that \u201can attorney or counselor shall not,, directly or indirectly, buy, or be in any manner interested in buying, a bond, promissory note, bill of exchange, book debt, or other thing in action, with the intent and for the purpose of bringing an action thereon.\u201d The facts relating to the assignment are as,follows: One Trimmer had a judgment against the mortgagors, under which' a sale of the mortgaged premises was-advertised. Trimmer was advised and decided to purchase the mortgage to protect himself, and avoid 15 months\u2019 right of redemption. Thereupon he made a contract with the mortgagee at her residence to purchase the mortgage. Afterwards Trimmer preferred not to take the mortgage, part of his judgment having been paid, and he asked his attorney, Mr. White, to procure a purchaser of the mortgage. Thereupon Mr. Stephens advanced the money,, and took assignment of the mortgage at the office of the mortgagee\u2019s attorney, the late Stephen H. Thayer, and she was paid principal and interest in full. From a judgment of foreclosure defendant Robert L. Humphreys appeals. For former opinion, see 10 H. Y. Supp. 455.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b946-10\">Argued before Van Brunt, P. J., and Barrett and.

L. Humphreys undertook to show that the bond and mortgage' were purchased by attorneys with the intent and for the purpose of bringing an action thereon, in violation of the statute: Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 73.- In the attempt to establish this defense the party interposing it signally failed. The attorneys had no personal interest in the transaction at all, and it clearly appears that the purchase was originally made with the object of protecting the interest of a judgment creditor, (Trimmer,) who subsequently, and because a payment had been made on account of his judgment, did'not care to complete the transaction; and, at his request, his attorneys induced the plaintiff, who is not a lawyer, to buy the bond and mortgage, and he did so on his own account, and not as a mere cover for the attorneys; and, as he swears, (being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>called as a witness for the defendant,) he \u201cput the money into that security as an investment.\u201d Whether or not the plaintiff bought with an intent to foreclose is not material. The interdiction of the statute did not apply to him if he in good faith bought, and the attorneys were not \u201cin any manner interested in buying.\u201d If they procured the purchase to he made in order that they might benefit, and the purchaser was merely acting in subserviency to their desire, the defense might be sustained; but it is plain that when Trimmer did not care to proceed with the matter, and asked the attorneys to find some one to take it off his hands, the plaintiff was induced to do so. The facts of the case as they appeared on the trial would not have authorized any other conclusion than that reached. It did not appear that the bond and mortgage were bought solely that the attorneys might bring a foreclosure first, and therefore the case is not controlled by what was decided in <em>Browning </em>v. <em>Marvin, </em>100 N. Y. 144, 2 N. E. Rep. 635. The judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
