The word \u201csection,\u201d as used in the charter, must be given a practical meaning, in order to carry out the purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>of the law. In the connection in which the word occurs it must be held to be qualified by the words \u201cproposed to be improved,\u201d so that a petition by the majority of the owners on the frontage proposed to be improved is sufficient compliance with the charter to confer jurisdiction. \u201cSection\u201d cannot mean any arbitrary and uniform length of street, like a block, or one-half a mile, but it must refer to a portion of a street proposed to be improved, and, when that portion is described, it is a section of a street. The petition herein was signed by a majority of the owners on the frontage proposed to be improved. But if there was any doubt about the sufficiency of the petition, it was waived by the appellant\u2019s appearing before the commissioners and trying the case upon the merits. The only object of the notice was to get the party duly in court, and, having appeared, we think all objections to the form of the petition were waived. <em>Grunberg </em>v. <em>Blumenlahl, </em>66 How. Pr. 62. We fail to see any irregularity in the proceedings of the common council or in the appointment of commissioners. The fact that two of the petitioners attempted to withdraw their names from the petition after the commissioners had been appointed, was immaterial. <em>Town of Springport </em>v. <em>Teutonia Sav. Bank, </em>84 N. Y. 403; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>52 N. Y. 296. The -award, both as to damages for the land taken and for benefits to the remaining, seems to be supported by the evidence. Besides, the personal examinations made by the commissioners must be given some weight upon these questions. Lewis, Em. Dom. \u00a7 524. The record fails to show that in making the award the commissioners acted upon any erroneous principle. We are constrained to think that the decision of the commissioners was not only right in form and substance, but was made upon correct principles. Order affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
