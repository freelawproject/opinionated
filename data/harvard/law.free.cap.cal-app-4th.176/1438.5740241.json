In her appeal, the wife asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in reducing temporary spousal support and in setting permanent support. She contends that the court failed to account for all of the husband\u2019s income and that it erred in imputing investment income to her. In his cross-appeal, the husband contends that the permanent spousal support order unfairly charges him a second time for earnings from the business that he operates. In his view, since the wife received half of the business\u2019s going-concern value in the property division, the court should not consider the entire stream of business income in assessing his ability to pay support. The husband asks us to announce a new rule in California prohibiting such \u201cdouble dipping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-11\">Rejecting both parties\u2019 contentions, we affirm the challenged order. In the published part of the opinion, we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in determining the husband\u2019s income for purposes of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">The parties to this appeal are Scott Blazer (husband) and Karen Nickles Blazer (wife). Husband and wife married in November 1982 and separated in January 2002. There are two children of the marriage, both now adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">The principal marital asset was a company created in 1996 by husband and a business partner, called Blazer-Wilkinson LLC (BW). BW is a brokerage company that buys and sells produce, principally strawbemes and bush berries. In 2004, the court valued the community interest in BW at $5.6 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-7\"><em>2002\u2014Dissolution; Temporary </em>Support<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">\n<em>2007\u2014Order; Appeals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-9\">In March 2007, the court entered a formal order that was consistent with its August 2006 statement of decision, entered after the trial held in December 2005 and January 2006. The order reduces temporary spousal support from $52,000 per month to $30,000 per month, effective August 15, 2004 (consistent with the parties\u2019 prior stipulation permitting modification retroactive to that date); it sets permanent spousal support at $20,000 per month, effective January 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-10\">In May 2007, wife filed a notice of appeal and husband filed a notice of cross-appeal. The following month, husband asked this court to dismiss wife\u2019s appeal as untimely on the ground that the March 2007 order merely formalized the court\u2019s earlier ruling. We denied husband\u2019s dismissal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-11\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-12\">In her appeal from the May 2007 spousal support order, wife argues that the trial court abused its discretion (1) in excluding part of husband\u2019s income when considering his ability to pay support and (2) in imputing investment income to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-13\">In response to wife\u2019s appeal, husband defends the order against the two arguments that she offers. He also asserts that wife has forfeited her claims by failing to comply with appellate rules. In his cross-appeal, husband challenges the order on the same ground offered below\u2014that it permits wife to unfairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>\u201cdouble dip\u201d into the income stream from his business. He posits this challenge as an issue of first impression in California and a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">To establish the proper framework for our analysis, we begin by summarizing the applicable legal principles before turning first to wife\u2019s appeal and then to husband\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">I. <em>Legal Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">A. <em>Spousal Support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">The trial court is authorized to order and to modify temporary and permanent spousal support, as provided in the Family Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">1. <em>Temporary Support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-10\">The trial court has statutory authority to order temporary spousal support while a marital action is pending. (\u00a7 3600.) \u201cTemporary support. . . usually is higher than permanent support because it is intended to maintain the status quo <em>prior </em>to the divorce.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Schulze </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 519, 522 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 488].) The trial court has broad discretion to determine the amount of temporary spousal support, considering both the supported spouse\u2019s need for support and the supporting spouse\u2019s ability to pay. <em>(In re Marriage of Dick </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 144, 165 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 743].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-11\">2. <em>Permanent Support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-12\">Permanent spousal support \u201cis governed by the statutory scheme set forth in sections 4300 through 4360. Section 4330 authorizes the trial court to order a party to pay spousal support in an amount, and for a period of time, that the court determines is just and reasonable, based on the standard of living established during the marriage, taking into consideration the circumstances set forth in section 4320.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Nelson </em>(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1546, 1559 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 52]; see <em>In re Marriage of Cheriton </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 269, 302 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 755].) The statutory factors include the supporting spouse\u2019s ability to pay; the needs of each spouse based on the marital standard of living; the obligations and assets of each spouse, including separate property; and any other factors pertinent to a just and equitable award. (\u00a7 4320, subds. (c)-(e), (n).) \u201cThe trial court has broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>discretion in balancing the applicable statutory factors and determining the appropriate weight to accord to each, but it may not be arbitrary and must both recognize and apply each applicable factor.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Ackerman </em>(2006) 146 Cal.App.4th 191, 207 [52 Cal.Rptr.3d 744].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">B. <em>Appellate Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">As a general rule, we review spousal support orders under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>(In re Marriage of Nelson, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.4th at p. 1559.) We examine the challenged order for legal and factual support. \u201cAs long as the court exercised its discretion along legal lines, its decision will be affirmed on appeal if there is substantial evidence to support it.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Duncan </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 617, 625 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 833]; see <em>In re Marriage of Geraci </em>(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1278, 1286 [51 Cal.Rptr.3d 234].) \u201cTo the extent that a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion is based on the facts of the case, it will be upheld \u2018as long as its determination is within the range of the evidence presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Ackerman, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">Where a question of law is presented on undisputed facts, appellate review is de novo. (See, e.g., <em>Elsenheimer v. Elsenheimer </em>(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1536 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 447] [interpretation of child support statute presents question of law]; <em>In re Marriage of von der Nuell </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 730, 736 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 447] [on undisputed facts, date of separation is a question of law]; cf. <em>In re Marriage of Duncan, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at p. 625, fn. 5 [rejecting wife\u2019s bid for de novo review where the evidence was in conflict].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-8\">With those principles in mind, we consider the issues raised here. We begin with wife\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">II. <em>Wife\u2019s Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-10\">A. Forfeiture<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-11\">B. <em>Exclusions from Husband\u2019s Income</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANH\">1. <em>Pertinent Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-12\">In assessing husband\u2019s income for spousal support purposes, the court excluded funds used to capitalize BW and to vertically integrate the business. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>In the court\u2019s words: \u201cThe need to maintain higher capitalization in the company and the need to diversify the company\u2019s work are reasonable expenses that should not be charged against [husband\u2019s] income but rather should be taken out of the company before assessing what his reasonable income is for purposes of support.\u201d Wife assigns this determination as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">On the question of capitalization, the court heard testimony from two experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">Husband\u2019s expert witness was certified public accountant Richard Wilkolaski. Wilkolaski described BW as \u201cvery thinly capitalized for a business\u201d with such high gross revenue. Husband had drawn down his capital account at BW by more than $1 million in the three years from January 2002 to December 2004. Wilkolaski opined that the company was \u201cendangered\u201d by the level of capital, which instead \u201cshould be building back up again.\u201d Based on some 30 years of forensic accounting, Wilkolaski understood that capital account withdrawals are not income available for spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">Wife called certified public accountant Jeffrey Wriedt as her expert witness. Wriedt agreed that husband\u2019s BW capital account had declined. He characterized BW as \u201cprobably slightly undercapitalized.\u201d And Wriedt agreed with Wilkolaski that \u201cprobably more money should have been left in the business.\u201d Since he is not \u201ca legal expert,\u201d Wriedt could not say whether spousal support should be based on money withdrawn from husband\u2019s BW capital account. But Wriedt did state: \u201cWithdrawals from the partnership capital account are not taxable income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-7\">Concerning vertical integration, the court heard testimony from the same two expert witnesses, and from husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-8\">Husband testified about his postseparation actions to expand and vertically integrate BW. Explaining the need for these actions, husband said \u201cwe had to change the way we did business because the retail side was looking to cut out the middle man ... to lower their costs. ... So we have had to change and accept the fact that the buying broker entity is no longer a viable business plan.\u201d Explaining the nature of the change, husband testified that the company expanded in two directions, transforming from a middleman to include both distribution and growing operations. BW thus expanded by getting \u201cinto the warehouse side, which is a distribution arm,\u201d and by getting into the berry-growing business. The warehouse was an east coast facility operated by Blazer-Wilkinson-Salins, with BW in partnership with a third person; it had been profitable. The berry-growing operation, Camarillo Berry Farms, had not yet been profitable. Husband testified that he was willing to use his BW <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>capital account to continue with the \u201cCamarillo investment\u201d since \u201cthe only way\u201d to \u201ckeep Blazer-Wilkinson in existence, is to maintain some type of ground up relationships.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">Husband\u2019s expert witness, Wilkolaski, testified about husband\u2019s investments in Blazer-Wilkinson-Salins and in Camarillo Berry Farms, based on information gleaned from husband\u2019s tax returns. Both businesses were started in 2003. For Camarillo Berry Farms, husband contributed capital totaling about $342,000 in 2003 and about $1,086,000 in 2004. Those sums, which came to husband from BW cash flow, were \u201cmonies that were disposable to him to invest\u201d in Camarillo Berry Farms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">Wife\u2019s expert, Wriedt, testified that BW generated cash flow for 2002, 2003, and 2004 in the millions of dollars. Wriedt stated that it was husband\u2019s choice to \u201cspend the money on his vertical integration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">On appeal, wife argues that by excluding \u201cincome that was used by [husband] to diversify into other areas of his business to establish a more vertically integrated business,\u201d the court \u201cfailed to use the total of [husband\u2019s] income in setting support which is an abuse of . . . discretion.\u201d Wife challenges only the nature of these expenditures, not the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">2. <em>Legal Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">Under the spousal support statute that governs here, the trial court is required to assess the \u201cability of the supporting party to pay spousal support, taking into account the supporting party\u2019s earning capacity, earned and unearned income, assets, and standard of living.\u201d (\u00a7 4320, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-10\">The spousal support statute does not define income. \u201cThere are no statutes that address the computation of income for the purpose of determining spousal support.\u201d (2 Kirkland et al., Cal. Family Law: Practice and Procedure (2009) Spousal Support Orders, \u00a7 51.33, p. 51-31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-11\">This is in contrast to the statutory provisions governing child support.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As one commentator notes, \u201cthere is not yet any authority\u201d applying the child support definition to spousal support. (Kirkland et al., Cal. Family Law: Practice and Procedure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a751.33, p. 51-31.) Despite that dearth of authority, and without discussing the point, the parties offer argument based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>on section 4058, which defines income for child support purposes. As a general proposition, we question how well child support concepts translate to spousal support.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, to the extent that the child support provision defining income may have some relevance to the issue before us, we address it below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">So far as we are aware, there is no case law directly addressing the question before us here. While acknowledging that there are no reported cases \u201canalogous\u201d to the situation presented here, wife nevertheless cites two appellate decisions in support of her argument. The first case proffered by wife is <em>In re Marriage of Ostler &amp; Smith </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 33 [272 Cal.Rptr. 560]. In that case, the husband was required to pay spousal support based on a percentage of future bonuses. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 41-42; see also, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Mosley </em>(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1387 [82 Cal.Rptr.3d 497] [\u201cany bonus actually received must be counted as part of [obligor\u2019s] annual gross income for the purposes of spousal and child support\u201d].) The second case cited by wife is <em>In re Marriage of Kerr, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th 87. There, the husband was required to pay spousal support based on income that could include a percentage of future stock options. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 95 [on remand, \u201ca percentage support award based on [the husband\u2019s] exercised option income would be permissible as long as the court sets a maximum amount proportionate to its findings of the marital standard of living\u201d].) But as husband correctly observes, in both cases, the supporting spouse was an employee, not a business owner. <em>(In re Marriage of Ostler &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number><em>Smith, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at p. 37; <em>In re Marriage of Kerr, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 91.) We agree with husband that the two cases proffered by wife are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">The question before us thus is one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">3. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">Applying the governing statute to the case at hand, our analysis turns on the trial court\u2019s assessment of \u201cthe ability of the supporting party to pay spousal support, taking into account the supporting party\u2019s . . . income . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 4320, subd. (c).) As explained above, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision if it is supported in fact and law. <em>(In re Marriage of Duncan, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at p. 625.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">a. <em>The court\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">As pertinent to wife\u2019s appellate claim, the trial court determined that there was a \u201cneed to diversify the company\u2019s work\u201d and that funds spent for that purpose were \u201creasonable expenses\u201d properly chargeable to the business, not to husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-10\">The court\u2019s factual finding is supported by substantial testimonial evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Husband testified that unless the company diversified, BW \u201cwill not exist, it will be gone.\u201d The testimony of husband\u2019s expert supported the need for diversification, given the changing business environment and the risk inherent in BW\u2019s dependence on two major clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-11\">Since the court\u2019s determination on this point enjoys substantial evidentiary support, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>(In re Marriage of Ackerman, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-12\">b. <em>The court\u2019s determination is legally proper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-13\">The trial court\u2019s determination also comports with applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-14\">Under the spousal support statute that governs here, it was within the court\u2019s discretion to calculate husband\u2019s income without regard to funds derived from BW that were used to diversify the business.  The court</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>must consider the \u201cearned and unearned income\u201d and the \u201cassets\u201d of the supporting <em>party. </em>(\u00a7 4320, subd. (c).) Here, the trial court acted within its discretion in attributing the reinvested funds to the business instead of husband. The court may \u201clook past the apparent form of ownership in which husband\u2019s assets were held to determine the extent of husband\u2019s true interest in them and the availability of those assets in assessing husband\u2019s ability to pay.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Dick, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 162; cf. <em>In re Marriage of lmperato </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 432, 438, 440 [119 Cal.Rptr. 590] [in property division, court could disregard corporate entity when divorcing parties had \u201cnot treated the corporation as a separate entity\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">More broadly, in the face of an ambiguity as to whether disputed sums represent income available for support, that determination is committed to the court\u2019s discretion. For example, \u201cthe trial court possesses broad discretion to determine whether to consider as income available for spousal support purposes contributions made by a participant to his or her retirement plan, as well as accruals or accrued earnings of that plan which are not withdrawn.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Olson </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1, 13 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 480].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">To the extent that the child support statute may offer guidance, it likewise sustains the trial court\u2019s decision here. That statute excludes from income \u201cexpenditures required for the operation of the business.\u201d (\u00a7 4058, subd. (a)(2); but see <em>Afsaw v. Woldberhan </em>(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 1407, 1425-1426 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 323] [based on statutory interpretation, child support obligor could not deduct rental property depreciation from income]; <em>In re Marriage of Calcaterra &amp; Badakhsh </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 28, 36 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 246] [trial court did not err in using child support obligor\u2019s \u201cgross rental income without deducting expenses\u201d where ruling was \u201coccasioned by [obligor\u2019s] peijury\u201d]; <em>In re Marriage of Chakko </em>(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 104, 109 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 699] [trial court properly rejected business owner\u2019s \u201cstructuring of income and expenses\u201d as \u201can attempt to minimize child support obligations\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">Under the circumstances presented here, the court \u201cexercised its discretion along legal lines\u201d in making the challenged determination. <em>(In re Marriage of Duncan, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at p. 625.) We therefore reject wife\u2019s claim concerning husband\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-7\">C. <em>Imputation of Investment Income to </em>Wife<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number>HI. <em>Husband\u2019s </em>Cross-appeal<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">The March 2007 order is affirmed.
