We conclude that the juvenile court has discretion to set a lesser maximum term of confinement \u201cbased upon the facts and circumstances of the matter.\u201d Therefore, we will remand the case to the court to exercise that discretion. In all other respects, the court\u2019s orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-10\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-11\">The Compton Varios 70s (CV70\u2019s) and the Compton Varios Segundos (CVS) are rival gangs. The boundary between their territories is Compton Boulevard. On an evening in October 2007 Danny Rodriguez, a member of the CV70\u2019s, was shot and killed near the intersection of Compton Boulevard and Williams Avenue. The sheriff\u2019s deputies who arrived at the scene a few minutes after the shooting interviewed several bystanders. One witness stated that the shooter ran south on Williams immediately after the shooting, but none of the people interviewed identified the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-12\">Nestor Morales, who was among the persons interviewed at the crime scene, told the interviewing officer that he was working at a taco stand on the comer of Compton and Williams when the shooting occurred. He heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number>gunshots and ducked for cover but \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything.\u201d The officer who interviewed Morales testified that he only spoke to Morales for a short time and that Morales was trembling and appeared frightened and disoriented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">Eleven days after the shooting, Deputy Shannon Laren met with Morales. Laren showed Morales a photo \u201csix-pack\u201d and Morales immediately identified R.O. as the shooter. He did not hesitate in his identification of R.O. and he did not identify any other person before or after identifying R.O. At trial Morales identified R.O. as the shooter. He also testified that he recognized R.O. as a customer of his taco stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">Undisputed evidence showed that R.O. lived two blocks from the intersection of Compton and Williams and that the shortest route from the murder scene to R.O.\u2019s house was south on Williams, the direction in which the shooter ran. R.O.\u2019s brother testified that R.O. was at home just before the shooting. A sheriff\u2019s gang expert testified that R.O. was an \u201cassociate\u201d of the CVS gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-7\">The juvenile court sustained the allegations of a petition charging R.O. with first degree murder and the use of a firearm in the commission of the crime. The court rejected the allegation that R.O. committed the murder for the benefit of a criminal street gang. The court ordered R.O. committed to California\u2019s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Facilities, for a period not to exceed 35 years to life, which the court believed was the mandatory sentence for an adult convicted of the same offense with a finding of true on the same enhancement. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 190, subd. (a), 12022.53, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1340-8\">On appeal, R.O. maintains that the testimony of Morales, the prosecution\u2019s only witness to the murder, was insufficient to sustain the petition and that the court erred in committing him to the Division of Juvenile Facilities and in failing to exercise its discretion in setting his maximum confinement period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-9\">We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the petition and the court did not abuse its discretion in committing R.O. to the Division of Juvenile Facilities. We conclude, however, that the court erred in failing to exercise its discretion in setting the maximum term of confinement and we remand the matter to the juvenile court for reconsideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1497\">*1497</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">I., II.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">HI. <em>The Juvenile Court\u2019s Discretion to Set a Maximum Period of Confinement \u201cBased Upon the Facts and Circumstances of the Matter. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">After finding that R.O. committed a first degree murder in which he personally used a firearm, the court concluded that it had no choice but to set a maximum term of confinement equal to the mandatory sentence applicable to an adult convicted of the same offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> R.O. argues that the court erred in concluding that it lacked discretion to impose a lesser period of confinement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-8\">Prior to January 2004, Welfare and Institutions Code section 731<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> stated in relevant part: \u201cA minor committed to the Department of the Youth Authority may not be held in physical confinement for a period of time in excess of the <em>maximum period of imprisonment </em>which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-9\">Effective January 2004, the Legislature amended section 731, subdivision (b) (now subd. (c)), to read as follows: <em>\u201cA </em>minor committed to the Department of the Youth Authority <em>also </em>may not be held in physical confinement for a period of time in excess of the maximum term of physical confinement <em>set by the court based upon the facts and circumstances of the matter </em>or matters which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may not exceed the maximum period of adult confinement as determined pursuant to this section.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Italics added.) (Sen. Bill No. 459 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 1, enacted as Stats. 2003, ch. 4, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-10\">The authority to consider the \u201cfacts and circumstances of the matter\u201d necessarily implies the authority to impose a term shorter than the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>applicable to an adult for the same crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the court erred when it concluded that it lacked discretion to impose a term of confinement less than the indeterminate term that would have been imposed on an adult convicted of the same offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">The Attorney General, however, argues that section 731 not only sets a ceiling on the court\u2019s choice of a juvenile\u2019s period of confinement, it also sets a floor. Relying on <em>In re Joseph M. </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 889 [58 Cal.Rptr.3d 756] <em>(Joseph </em>M), the Attorney General reasons that because an adult convicted of first degree murder with the use of a firearm would be subject to a mandatory indeterminate sentence, it follows that the minimum confinement term for R.O. must be the same, there being no low, middle or upper term that the court could select. This result, the Attorney General contends, is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s goal in amending section 731 to insure that juveniles and adults serve comparable terms. He also argues that his interpretation of section 731 would avoid the \u201cpotentially bizarre result\u201d of a minor who committed murder being confined for a shorter period than a minor who committed a less serious crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">We reject the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation because the plain language of section 731, subdivision (c), which requires the court to consider the \u201cfacts and circumstances of the matter,\u201d explicitly vests in the court discretion to select a period of confinement that is less than the minimum mandatory indeterminate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-7\">The Attorney General\u2019s reliance on <em>Joseph M. </em>is misplaced. In <em>Joseph M., </em>the court held that if an adult committing the same offense as the minor would be sentenced under the triad structure of the determinate sentencing law, the juvenile court may not order a period of confinement that is less than the lowest term in the triad to which the adult could be sentenced, plus enhancements. <em>(Joseph M., supra, </em>150 Cal.App.4th at pp. 896-897.) Thus <em>Joseph M. </em>is inapposite because our case involves the interpretation of section 731, subdivision (c) as it affects cases involving indeterminate sentences, not determinate sentences.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>The decision in <em>In re H.D., supra, </em>174 Cal.App.4th 768, rejected, as we do, the Attorney General\u2019s argument that the Legislature intended juvenile offenders and adults to serve comparable sentences. <em>In re H.D. </em>held that the juvenile court, in exercising its discretion under section 731 with respect to an offense carrying a triad sentence, was not limited to imposing either the upper, middle or lower term, as would be the case in sentencing an adult, but could select a term in between the three. (174 Cal.App.4th at p. 776.) The court reasoned that \u201cabsent some legislative direction\u201d \u201cthe wholesale importation of the [determinate sentencing law\u2019s] triadic sentencing scheme into the juvenile court law would be inconsistent with [the juvenile law\u2019s] sentencing structure . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The amendment to section 731, subdivision (c) \u201ccontains no such direction,\u201d the court concluded. (174 Cal.App.4th at p. 776.) On the contrary, the court held, \u201cthe statute ties the court\u2019s exercise of discretion to \u2018the facts and circumstances of the matter or matters which brought or continued the ward under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,\u2019 strongly suggesting that the court should endeavor to tailor the disposition to the offender and the offense, rather than attempt to shoehorn the punishment into a one-size-fits-all sentencing scheme.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 776-777.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\"><em>In re Carlos E. </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1529 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 551] further supports our interpretation of section 731. In that case the court stated that \u201c[p]roof the juvenile court\u2019s decision is not tied directly to the adult system is found in the language utilized; the juvenile court is to consider the facts and circumstances of the matter, rather than being restricted solely to the aggravating or mitigating circumstance scheme for adults. The juvenile court\u2019s determination must be tied to the purposes of the juvenile system, which include the protection of the public as well as the rehabilitation of the minor. (\u00a7 202.) [][]... [1] .. . [T]he juvenile court must determine the maximum period of confinement . . . based on the facts and circumstances, this maximum may not be more than that for a comparable adult, but may be less.\u201d (127 Cal.App.4th at p. 1542.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-6\">We recognize that both <em>In re H.D. </em>and <em>In re Carlos E. </em>were cases involving adult determinate sentences rather than an indeterminate sentence as in the case here. We see no reason, however, why the courts\u2019 reasoning in those cases should not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-7\">Legislative history confirms our conclusion as to the intent of section 731, subdivision (c). As the court in <em>In re Carlos E. </em>recognized, the rationale for the change in section 731 arose out of a concern for the Youthful Offender Parole Board\u2019s \u201c \u2018tendency to increase [the] . . . length-of-stay beyond the board\u2019s own guidelines, and the board\u2019s lack of program expertise.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Carlos E., supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at p. 1541.) Thus, \u201c[t]he Senate Rules Committee analysis states that current law provides that the maximum period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>of imprisonment is the term a similarly situated adult would receive, but this bill \u2018would additionally provide that a \u201cminor committed to the Department of the Youth Authority also may not be held in physical confinement for a period of time in excess of the maximum term of physical confinement set by the court based upon the facts and circumstances of the matter or matters which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>boldface added by <em>Carlos E., </em>quoting Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Sen. Bill No. 459 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 17, 2003, p. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">Our interpretation of section 731, subdivision (c) is consistent with a 150-year tradition of maintaining two separate and distinct criminal justice systems\u2014one for juveniles and one for adults.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Describing California\u2019s original juvenile justice legislation, our Supreme Court observed: \u201cThe purpose in view is not punishment for offenses done, but reformation and training of the child to habits of industry, with a view to his future usefulness when he shall have been reclaimed to society, or shall have attained his majority.\u201d <em>(Ex Parte Ah Peen </em>(1876) 51 Cal. 280, 281.) Today those same principles are embodied in section 202 which states that the purpose of the juvenile justice system is \u201c(1) to serve the \u2018best interests\u2019 of the delinquent ward by providing care, treatment, and guidance to rehabilitate the ward and \u2018enable him or her to be a law-abiding and productive member of his or her family and community,\u2019 and (2) to \u2018provide for the protection and safety of the public ....\u2019(\u00a7 202, subds. (a), (b) &amp; (d); [citations].)\u201d <em>(In re Charles G. </em>(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 608, 614-615 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 503].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-6\">Finally, we disagree with the Attorney General\u2019s argument that our interpretation of section 731 will lead to the \u201cpotentially bizarre result\u201d of terms of confinement in which teenage murderers will serve less time in confinement than juveniles who commit less serious crimes. We have no reason to believe that, in setting the maximum period of confinement for a murderer or a joyrider, the juvenile courts will not set appropriate terms based on the facts and circumstances of each case. Nor by this opinion do we intend to suggest how the juvenile court should exercise its discretion in this case. We only hold that pursuant to section 731 the juvenile court must exercise its discretion based on the \u201cfacts and circumstances of the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-8\">The cause is remanded to the juvenile court with directions to vacate its order setting R.O.\u2019s maximum term of confinement and to enter a new order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>based on its exercise of discretion pursuant to section 731, subdivision (c), and in conformity with the views expressed in this opinion. In all other respects the court\u2019s orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">Mallano, P. J., and Chaney, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied December 2, 2009, S176929.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1340-10\"> The court found that R.O. personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing death to a person other than an accomplice, which carries a mandatory consecutive enhancement of 25 years. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d).) The court mistakenly believed that the term was 10 years and thus imposed a maximum 35-year period of confinement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1341-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1493.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1341-12\"> See footnote 1, <em>ante. </em>This sentence, of course, is a theoretical maximum period of confinement.

None of these changes affect our analysis of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1342-8\"> The juvenile court\u2019s discretion to set the minor\u2019s theoretical maximum period of confinement does not alter the Youth Authority Board\u2019s authority to discharge the minor \u201cas soon as in its opinion there is reasonable probability that he or she can be given full liberty without danger to the public.\u201d (\u00a7 1765, subd. (b).) In most cases, a minor committed for perpetrating a felony \u201cshall be discharged when such person reaches his 25th birthday.\u201d (\u00a7 1771.) And, as a general rule, a minor confined for committing first degree murder is eligible for parole consideration at least every seven years. (Cal.
