A jury convicted him of second degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and shooting at an occupied vehicle (\u00a7 246). The jury found true the allegation that defendant personally discharged a firearm, causing death. (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d).) The court sentenced defendant to state prison for 40 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-9\">The jury was instructed on alternate theories of second degree murder, both malice aforethought and felony murder with shooting at an occupied vehicle as the predicate felony. Defendant contends the application of the felony-murder rule in this case violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. He argues that since the merger rule of <em>People v. Ireland </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 522 [75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d 580] <em>(Ireland) </em>precludes application of the felony-murder rule unless defendant has a purpose collateral and independent to assault, and since the evidence of defendant\u2019s purpose was conflicting, the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it must find a collateral and independent purpose before it could rely on the felony-murder doctrine. Defendant contends permitting the jury to rely on the felony-murder rule without a jury finding of a collateral purpose violates his right to have the jury determine all factual issues beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">After briefing in this case was complete, the California Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>People v. Chun </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 1172 [91 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1453\">*1453</page-number>Cal.Rptr.3d 106, 203 P.3d 425] <em>(Chun). </em>In <em>Chun, </em>the Supreme Court overruled prior decisions and held \u201cthat all assaultive-type crimes, such as a violation of section 246, merge with the charged homicide and cannot be the basis for a second degree felony-murder instruction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1178.) In the published part of the opinion, we find that the trial court erred in instructing on second degree felony murder. However, as in <em>Chun, </em>we find the error was harmless and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">In the unpublished part of the opinion, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that his concurrent sentence on shooting at an occupied vehicle should be stayed under section 654 because the act was part of the same conduct as the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">Defendant and Savy Yip lived together for over six years, since they were 17. They had two children, but never married. They lived with defendant\u2019s mother and brother. Yip\u2019s parents lived a house away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-8\">Yip met Joshua Chace on a telephone chat line. After a few weeks, she started talking to him individually and considered him \u201csomewhat\u201d her boyfriend. Yip told Chace the father of her children was \u201cnot in the picture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">On August 19, 2005, Chace came to California from Massachusetts to see Yip. Yip told defendant she was going out with friends that night and picked Chace up at the airport. They spent the night together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">When Yip went home the next day, she and defendant got into an argument. She packed her things and went to her mother\u2019s. She spent the next four days with Chace.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">The night before the incident, Yip returned home and fell asleep. While she was sleeping, Chace called. Defendant answered and Chace told him he was Yip\u2019s \u201cman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">When Yip awoke the next afternoon, she and defendant argued. Yip told defendant she did not want to be with him. She left about 6:00 p.m. and went to Chace. They went to a park and talked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1454\">*1454</page-number>Defendant claimed he was heartbroken and hurt when he found out about Chace. When Yip told him it was over, they argued and defendant said he might do something stupid. After Yip left, defendant waited several hours for her to return. Later that night defendant waved down a friend and got in his Toyota 4Runner with a gun; he wanted to bring Yip home. They went to four or five parks before they found Yip.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">Around midnight, Yip and Chace were at Laughlin Park in the car with the seats reclined. Yip was in the driver\u2019s seat and Chace in the passenger seat. Yip saw headlights coming from behind. A car stopped in the middle of the road, about 15 feet away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">Defendant got out of the passenger side of the car. He had a gun in his hand and went to the driver\u2019s side of Yip\u2019s car. He tapped the windshield with the gun and yelled, \u201c \u2018get out.\u2019 \u201d Yip said \u201c \u2018no\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018don\u2019t shoot.\u2019 \u201d Defendant started walking around the back of the car. Yip started the car. Chace told defendant he did not want any problems, and told Yip, \u201c \u2018just go, just go.\u2019 \u201d Yip took off and made a U-turn. As she turned, she heard a shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">Yip kept driving. She noticed Chace was quiet and then heard him gasping for air; he did not move. She drove to the hospital. Chace died from a gunshot wound to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-8\">Defendant told the detective who interviewed him that he shot to scare Chace. At trial he testified he had the gun\u2014an SKS rifle\u2014below his waist. He ran after the car and shot in the air; he shot because he was angry and was not aiming. He was 10 feet from the car when he fired. On cross-examination, he testified \u201cI shoot the gun in the air to lose my anger. I told the detective I tried to scare him. That is all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-10\">I. Instructing on Second Degree Felony Murder Was Error, but Not Prejudicial</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\">Defendant contends that where, as here, second degree felony murder is based on shooting at an occupied vehicle, the merger rule of <em>Ireland, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 522, requires the trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had a purpose in shooting that was independent of and collateral to assault. He contends that since the jury did not make the finding of an independent collateral purpose, his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to have the jury decide factual questions that affected his sentence or the degree of crime were violated. Finally, he asserts that since the jury was instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1455\">*1455</page-number>on both murder with malice aforethought and felony murder, and it cannot be determined on which theory the jury relied, reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">The Attorney General agrees that a collateral purpose is required in this case for application of second degree felony murder. He asserts, however, that defendant\u2019s testimony that he fired over the car to scare Chace provided the necessary evidence of that collateral purpose. The Attorney General rejects the argument that the jury had to find the collateral purpose. \u201cIt is the trial court, not the jury, that decides which legal theories are warranted by the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">After briefing in this case was complete, the California Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Chun, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th 1172, which substantially altered the law on second degree felony murder. We requested supplemental briefing from the parties on the effect of <em>Chun </em>on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">In <em>Chun, </em>the 16-year-old defendant and three other gang members were in a Honda stopped at a streetlight. Gunfire erupted from the Honda toward a stopped Mitsubishi, killing a passenger and wounding two others. <em>(Chun, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 1179.) The defendant was tried as an adult and charged with murder, two counts of attempted murder, shooting at an occupied vehicle, and discharging a firearm from a vehicle, all with gang and firearm-use allegations, and street terrorism. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">Although the prosecution sought a first degree murder conviction, the court also instructed the jury on second degree felony murder based on shooting at an occupied motor vehicle (\u00a7 246) either directly or as an aider and abettor. The jury returned a verdict of second degree murder. It found the personal use allegation not true, but found a principal intentionally used a firearm and the shooting was for the benefit of a criminal street gang. The jury acquitted the defendant of both counts of attempted murder, shooting from a vehicle and shooting at an occupied motor vehicle. The defendant was convicted of being an active participant in a criminal street gang. <em>(Chun, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at pp. 1179-1180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">The California Supreme Court granted review to determine if the trial court prejudicially erred in instructing on second degree felony murder. <em>(Chun, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 1180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-10\">First, the Supreme Court addressed the defendant\u2019s claim that second degree felony murder violates separation of powers as a judicially created doctrine with no statutory basis. <em>(Chun, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 1183.) The court held that the \u201c \u2018abandoned and malignant heart\u2019 \u201d language of section 188 contains within it the common law second degree murder rule. <em>(Chun, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1456\">*1456</page-number><em>supra, </em>at p. 1187.) Second degree felony murder is based on statute and \u201cstands on firm constitutional ground.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1188.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">The court then considered the effect of the merger rule of <em>Ireland, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 522. After reviewing the court\u2019s jurisprudence in this area, the court held the state of the law regarding the <em>Ireland </em>merger doctrine was problematic, and found it necessary \u201cto reconsider our merger doctrine jurisprudence.\u201d <em>(Chun, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 1198.) Disapproving prior decisions, the court set forth a different test of merger. \u201cWhen the underlying felony is assaultive in nature, such as a violation of section 246 or 246.3, we now conclude that the felony merges with the homicide and cannot be the basis of a felony-murder instruction.\u201d <em>(Chun, supra, </em>at p. 1200.) Although the court declined to determine \u201cexactly what felonies are assaultive in nature,\u201d it held that \u201cshooting at an occupied vehicle under section 246 is assaultive in nature and hence cannot serve as the underlying felony for purposes of the felony-murder rule.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">Here the trial court instructed on felony murder with shooting at an occupied vehicle as the predicate felony. Under <em>Chun, </em>this instruction was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">To determine whether the error was prejudicial, we again look to <em>Chun. </em>The <em>Chun </em>court first noted that although the jury was not given specific instructions on implied malice second degree murder, CALJIC Nos. 8.30 and 8.31, the other instructions were sufficient to base a second degree murder conviction on either malice or felony murder. <em>(Chun, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at pp. 1202-1203.) Here the trial court fully instructed the jury on second degree murder under either implied malice or felony murder theories.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">In determining whether the instructional error was prejudicial, the <em>Chun </em>court relied on a test set forth by Justice Scalia in a concurring opinion in <em>California </em>v. <em>Roy </em>(1996) 519 U.S. 2 [136 L.E.2d 266, 117 S.Ct. 337]. In <em>Roy, </em>the error was permitting a defendant to be convicted of a crime as an aider and abettor solely due to his knowledge of the crime, without requiring a finding he shared the perpetrator\u2019s intent. The <em>Chun </em>court found this error similar to that in the case at hand, where the defendant could be convicted of felony murder without requiring a finding of a valid theory of malice. <em>(Chun, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 1204.) In his concurring opinion in <em>Roy, </em>Justice Scalia stated the test for prejudice thusly: \u201cThe error in the present case can be harmless only if the jury verdict on other points effectively embraces this one or if it is impossible, upon the evidence, to have found what the verdict did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1457\">*1457</page-number>find without finding this point as well.\u201d <em>(Roy, supra, </em>519 U.S. at p. 7 (cone, opn. of Scalia, J.), italics omitted.) The <em>Chun </em>court found this test worked well for an improper instruction on second degree felony murder. \u201cIf other aspects of the verdict or the evidence leave no reasonable doubt that the jury made the findings necessary for conscious-disregard-for-life malice, the erroneous felony-murder instruction was harmless.\u201d <em>(Chun, supra, </em>at p. 1205.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">Applying this test, the court found any juror who relied on felony murder \u201cnecessarily found that defendant willfully shot at an occupied vehicle.\u201d <em>(Chun, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 1205.) The undisputed evidence was that three people in the car were hit by multiple gunshots fired at close range. The <em>Chun </em>court concluded: \u201cNo juror could have found that defendant participated in this shooting, either as a shooter or as an aider and abettor, without also finding that defendant committed an act that is dangerous to life and did so knowing of the danger and with conscious disregard for life\u2014which is a valid theory of malice. In other words, on this evidence, no juror could find felony murder without also finding conscious-disregard-for-life malice. The error in instructing the jury on felony murder was, by itself, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Defendant argues the facts of this case are distinguishable and do not compel a conclusion that the jury found malice. Here defendant acted alone\u2014from personal, not gang, motives\u2014and fired only once. Defendant contends his actions show only a conscious indifference to the possibility of death, not the conscious disregard for life required for implied malice. Defendant relies on cases involving shooting at an inhabited dwelling, which hold an intent to strike the building is not required, only a reckless disregard or conscious indifference to the probable consequences. <em>(People v. Cruz </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 427, 433 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 148]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chavira </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 988, 993 [83 Cal.Rptr. 851].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">We find the harmless error analysis of <em>Chun </em>applicable. To find defendant guilty of second degree felony murder, a juror must have found he willfully shot at an occupied vehicle. Indeed, we know the jury so found because, unlike in <em>Chun, </em>the jury convicted defendant of violating section 246. The factual distinctions from <em>Chun </em>are not significant. Defendant was only 10 feet away from the car and knew there were two people in it. He fired an SKS rifle directly into the car. As in <em>Chun, </em>the jury must have found defendant committed an act that is dangerous to life, knew of the danger, and acted with conscious disregard for life. In other words, the jury found defendant acted with implied malice. Accordingly, as in <em>Chun, </em>the error in instructing on second degree felony murder was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number>One distinction from <em>Chun </em>is that the jury in this case was instructed on voluntary manslaughter. Therefore, we consider whether the error in instructing on second degree felony murder was not harmless because its effect was to remove from the case defendant\u2019s defense of heat of passion provocation to reduce the killing to manslaughter. In denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the trial court noted the \u201cproblem\u201d with felony murder is that it does not permit mitigation to manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">Here the trial court instructed the jury on heat of passion manslaughter. The defense argued the killing was provoked by heat of passion. The jury, however, was instructed: \u201cProvocation does not apply to a prosecution under a theory of felony murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">We find defendant\u2019s heat of passion defense does not render the instruction on felony murder prejudicial because the facts of this case are inadequate to reduce the killing to manslaughter as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">Voluntary manslaughter is an unlawful killing without malice \u201cupon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.\u201d (\u00a7 192, subd. (a).) \u201cHeat of passion arises when \u2018at the time of the killing, the reason of the accused was obscured or disturbed by passion to such an extent as would cause the ordinarily reasonable person of average disposition to act rashly and without deliberation and reflection, and from such passion rather than from judgment.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Barton </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 201 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 906 P.2d 531].) \u201c[T]he killing must be \u2018upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion\u2019 (\u00a7 192); that is, \u2018suddenly as a response to the provocation, and not belatedly as revenge or punishment. Hence, the rule is that, if sufficient time has ela[ps]ed for the passions of an ordinarily reasonable person to cool, the killing is murder, not manslaughter.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 868 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">Here there was no \u201csudden quarrel or heat of passion.\u201d Defendant fired after Yip refused his instruction to get out of the car. Rather than provoking defendant, Yip begged him not to shoot and Chace told defendant he did not want any problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">To be sure, there was quarreling and defendant\u2019s passion was aroused, but this provocation occurred over several days. Defendant and Yip quarreled days before the shooting, and she left him and went to Chace. The night before the killing, defendant spoke with Chace, who told defendant he was Yip\u2019s \u201cman.\u201d Defendant and Yip quarreled again the next afternoon and she left about 6:00 p.m. Defendant waited several hours for her to return. When she did not, he got a ride from a friend and searched several parks looking for her. When he found her, he shot Chace.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>This smoldering jealousy leading to a fatal act is similar to that in <em>People v. Hudgins </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 174 [60 Cal.Rptr. 176], where the defendant, consumed with jealousy, beat and threatened his wife. He broke into a house and shot the man he believed was his wife\u2019s paramour. The court found no evidence to support an instruction on heat of passion manslaughter. \u201cThere was no evidence of a sudden quarrel, but only proof of a violent attack by an armed man upon one who was unarmed and who made a futile attempt to save his own life. There was no sudden heat of passion, but only evidence of a persistent, brooding jealousy which spurred appellant to a decision to arm himself and lie in wait for a victim. All the evidence indicated it was not a sudden, impetuous decision, acted upon without time and opportunity for reflection and the cooling off of suddenly aroused emotion. It was a decision reached after long deliberation and meditation, and careful preparation to carry into execution the threats appellant had repeatedly uttered. Upon these facts the killing was not manslaughter; it was, at the least, murder of the second degree.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 181.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">Defendant had sufficient time to cool down after his quarrel with Yip the afternoon of the shooting. <em>(People v. Middleton </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 19, 34 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 366], disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 745, 752, fn. 3 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 676, 74 P.3d 771].) In <em>Middleton, </em>the defendant incapacitated his attacker and could have fled on foot or called the police. Instead, he chose to return and get his gun. He then shot the attacker. The court found no substantial evidence of provocation. \u201cHis return from the doorway represented a distinct and divisible event in the sequence of events and provided him sufficient time to \u2018cool down.\u2019 \u2018[I]f sufficient time has elapsed between the provocation and the fatal blow for passion to subside and reason to return, the killing is not voluntary manslaughter\u2014\u201cthe assailant must act under the smart of that sudden quarrel or heat of passion.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Middleton, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th at p. 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">There was insufficient evidence of heat of passion manslaughter.
