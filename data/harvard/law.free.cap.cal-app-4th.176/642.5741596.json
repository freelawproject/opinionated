INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">Defendant Raymond Eugene Peyton was convicted of one count of committing a lewd act with duress, fear or force on a child under the age of 14, in violation of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (b)(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (count 1), three counts of aggravated sexual assault (penetration by a foreign object), in violation of section 269, subdivision (a)(5) (counts 2-4), and one count of aggravated sexual assault (oral copulation), in violation of section 269, subdivision (a)(4) (count 5). All of the convictions involved the 12-year-old daughter, K., of defendant\u2019s live-in girlfriend, C. Defendant was sentenced to an aggregate indeterminate term of 66 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">In the published portion of this opinion, we address defendant\u2019s claim that his defense counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the filing of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>amended information at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case when no preliminary hearing had been held. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we address defendant\u2019s claims that (1) there was insufficient evidence to establish that any of the acts were committed with force or duress, and (2) he was unconstitutionally deprived of a jury\u2019s findings on the facts used for imposition of consecutive sentences. For the reasons we explain, we reverse defendant\u2019s section 288, subdivision (b) conviction in count 1. In all other respects, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">II. THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">At the time of the alleged molestations, defendant, a program director, talk host, and newscaster for a radio station in San Bernardino, was in his late 40\u2019s. He first met K.\u2019s mother, C., in December 2003. Defendant and C. started dating at that time. When he first met C. she was living in a two-bedroom apartment with her children, J. and K. At some point during 2004, defendant cosigned a lease so that C. and her children, J. and K., could move into a house. He moved into the house on August 1, 2004. He lived there until October 4, 2004, at which time he moved out. Defendant testified that the reason for his leaving was that C., who had been previously diagnosed with colon cancer, was irrational and illogical; they would fight over everything on an almost daily basis. C. died on December 9, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">During the fall of 2004, K. was 12 years old. Her father had died when she was three. She had been homeschooled for approximately three years. K.\u2019s cousin, J.M., with whom K. went to live following her mother\u2019s death, described K. as lacking in social skills and able to read and write at only a first grade level. Developmentally she was at the age of about eight. K.\u2019s older brother J. had brain damage stemming from a rollerblading accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Following the death of her mother and after moving to J.M.\u2019s house, K. saw defendant three times.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After seeing a show about Michael Jackson and his molestation cases, K. did not want to see defendant on a proposed fourth visit. During a conversation with J.M.\u2019s daughter following the third visit, K. told her she had been molested by defendant. Thereafter, K. told J.M. that defendant had molested her.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">J.M. testified that before K. told her about the molestations, defendant had asked to see K. because he wanted to stay in touch with her and felt they were bonded. K. had agreed to see him. There were three visits before K. told J.M. that she did not want to see defendant anymore. In October 2005, K. spoke with J.M. about being molested. K. was crying; she wrote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>down, \u201cHe licked in my privates.\u201d K. told J.M. she thought it was normal and it was what dads do. She also said she did not know it was wrong, but after living at J.M.\u2019s house and learning about things, she realized it was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">At trial, K. testified there were four separate incidents of molestation. They occurred in September 2004, around the time of her birthday, while defendant was living at the house. All of the occurrences were during the nighttime when defendant and K. were watching television. At the time of each instance they were the only two people in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">On the first occasion they were on the couch. K. was wearing sweatpants and was lying down on her right side, with her head on defendant\u2019s lap. Defendant reached his hand inside her pants and touched her vagina with his fingers, under her underwear. He put his fingers just inside the lips of her vagina and did not remove her underwear. He asked K. if it felt good, and she said \u201cyes.\u201d K. testified she answered \u201cyes\u201d because she thought that was what defendant wanted to hear.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The second incident happened in either the living room or entertainment room. K. was on the couch watching television. Defendant came to the couch. He reached his hand inside her pants and he inserted his fingers into her vagina. K. believed she was lying in the same position as during the first incident. She did not remember how long the touching continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">On the third occasion, K. and defendant were on the couch watching television. Defendant was next to the arm of the couch; K. had her head on the arm of the couch and was lying on her back with her upper torso across his lap. He pulled her sweatpants and underwear down to her thighs and started rubbing her legs; shortly thereafter he started touching her vagina with his fingers. She believed he moved her to the edge of his lap by scooting her out a little; in doing so, he grabbed her by the upper bicep and pulled her up. He then bent down and put his tongue into her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The fourth and last incident occurred in the entertainment room. The lights were off and the television was on. There was a blanket over her at the time. She was wearing jeans with a belt. He unbuckled her belt and reached his hand inside her pants underneath her underwear and rubbed the top of her vagina with his fingers. Her mother walked into the room while this was happening. K. thereafter rebuckled her pants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>K. testified that she did not think defendant was doing anything wrong or against the law during any of the incidents. Nor did she feel embarrassed at the time the conduct was happening. She went along with defendant\u2019s touching her because she thought that was what he wanted. She further stated she did not feel she had a choice in the matter and felt pressured to let him touch her vagina. One of the reasons she did not tell anyone right away was she thought it was partly her fault for letting it happen. She was also concerned her older brother J. would be accused of committing the molestations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Defense evidence was provided by the testimony of defendant and his cousin. Defendant denied the molestations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The essence of the defense evidence was that during C.\u2019s life there had been discussions about defendant adopting J. and K., and C. wanting him to adopt the children. Some of these discussions occurred in front of both J. and K. In September or early October 2004, defendant announced that he was not going to adopt the children. This news threw K. into a rage.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">According to defendant and his cousin, who was present at the house prior to going to a San Francisco 49ers game with defendant, K. stated, after hearing the announcement: \u201c \u2018My father had died and left me. My mother is dying. My stepfather treated me like a maid. I thought you were different. You were like a father to me. I thought you were different, but you\u2019re not. I wish I could hurt you like you\u2019ve hurt me.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Aside from the defense that K.\u2019s accusations were fabricated to get back at defendant for his failure to adopt J. and K., there was also subtle innuendo that J. was the perpetrator of the molestations.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">A. <em>Defendant\u2019s Section 288, Subdivision (b) Conviction in Count 1 Must Be Reversed, but All Other Charges Were Properly Pleaded</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In October 2006, the prosecution filed an amended complaint charging defendant with four counts of aggravated sexual assault, specifically, three counts of oral copulation (\u00a7\u00a7 269, subd. (a)(4), 288a) and one count of sexual penetration (\u00a7\u00a7 269, subd. (a)(5), 289, subd. (a)). In December 2006, defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing, and the prosecution filed an initial information charging defendant with the same crimes charged in the amended complaint. (\u00a7 737 [\u201cAll felonies shall be prosecuted by indictment or information,\u201d subject to exceptions not applicable here.].) Thereafter, the prosecution filed two amended informations. The first amended information was filed on the first day of trial; the second amended information was filed following the presentation of the prosecution\u2019s case. Both amended informations changed the charging allegations to allege three counts of sexual penetration and one count of oral copulation, rather than three counts of oral copulation and one count of sexual penetration as had been alleged in the amended complaint and initial information. The second amended information added a fifth count of aggravated lewd conduct in violation of section 288, subdivision (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Defendant claims his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the filing of the first and second amended informations on the ground they alleged crimes that differed from those alleged in the amended complaint and, on the further ground that the newly alleged crimes were not shown by the transcript of any preliminary hearing. On this basis, he claims his section 288, subdivision (b), or lewd act conviction, and two of his sexual penetration convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">We agree that defendant\u2019s section 288, subdivision (b) conviction in count 1 must be reversed, because it constituted an additional charge not pled in the amended complaint to which defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing. We further conclude, however, that each of defendant\u2019s four section 269 convictions in counts 2 through 5 were effectively pleaded in the amended complaint and that there was not a substantial variance between the amended information upon which defendant was convicted and the amended complaint. Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions in counts 2 through 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">1. <em>Relevant Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Suffice it to say, the pleadings are a mess. In March 2006, the People filed a felony complaint alleging in four counts that defendant violated section 288, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>subdivision (a). While the underlying conduct is not identified, it was alleged that the acts took place in October and November 2005, as opposed to 2004. In October 2006, an amended complaint was filed, alleging in three counts that defendant violated section 269, subdivision (a)(4) (the underlying conduct of which was oral copulation in violation of \u00a7 288a) and in a fourth count, section 269, subdivision (a)(5) (the underlying conduct being sexual penetration in violation of \u00a7 289, subd. (a)). It was again contended that the conduct occurred in 2005. In December 2006, defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing. Thereafter, an information that mirrored the amended complaint was filed. Defendant was arraigned and pled not guilty. Thus, as of the date of waiving his preliminary hearing, defendant was on notice that the charged underlying conduct involved three instances of oral copulation and one incident of sexual penetration, each in violation of section 269 and all occurring in 2005. On July 2, 2007, the first day of trial, the People filed an amended information alleging that the underlying acts occurred in 2004. While keeping the same number of counts, the allegations were changed to allege that three of the underlying acts involved sexual penetration in violation of section 269, subdivision (a)(5) and one involved oral copulation in violation of section 269, subdivision (a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">On July 10, following the presentation of the People\u2019s case, the prosecutor orally moved to amend the complaint. The following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Are there any motions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">\u201c[THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY]: Well, there is my motion to conform to proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes, we should do that first. [][] All right. I have in front of me the amended Information. Off the record, [the district attorney], maybe on the record earlier this morning, you indicated that you were going to amend one of the counts to conform to the proof on that count which [K.] indicated there was no actual penetration. Which count and which charge are you seeking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">\u201c[THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY]: It would be one of the [section] 269.5\u2019s. It doesn\u2019t really matter, since obviously the chronology of die events wasn\u2019t really clear in her memory. Count 1 is fine, I believe [section] 269.5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Count[s] 1, 3, and 4 are the [section] 269[, subdivision] (a)(5)\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">\u201c[THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY]: Count 1 can be the [section] 288[, subdivision] (b) pertaining to the jean and belt buckle incident. We\u2019ll call it that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: All right. You are going to allege only a [section] 288[, subdivision] (b) with no [section] 269 allegation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">\u201c[THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY]: Correct, just a lewd act of a child with duress, force, or fear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you wish to be heard? That does appear to conform to proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: So the Court will by interlineation\u2014we should have a second amended Information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">\u201c[THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY]: I will have one typed tonight, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: For now, I will by interlineation strike out the number [section] 269 on Count 1 and insert [section] 288, subdivision (b), crossing out subsection (5), same dates, and crossing out the word \u2018aggravated,\u2019 did commit a sexual assault of a child under 14 years of age, crossing out \u2018and ten or more years younger than the defendant,\u2019 leaving in, \u2018in that he did willfully and unlawfully commit a violation of Penal Code section 288[, subdivision] (a)\u2019\u2014strike that\u2014\u2018[section] 288[, subdivision] (b)(1), a lewd act by force, violence, duress, menace, fear, and threat.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">On July 11, the prosecutor told the court he had made a \u201chuge mistake\u201d and should have sought leave to amend the information to allege five counts rather than four. After some discussion, the court, the prosecutor, and defense counsel agreed K.\u2019s testimony supported five counts. In the \u201cbelt buckle\u201d incident there was no oral copulation or digital penetration, but in the single instance of oral copulation there was also digital penetration. Hence, it was agreed that the belt buckle incident would be charged in count 1 as a violation of section 288, subdivision (b)(1), and the information would be further amended to allege three counts of digital penetration in counts 2 through 4, and one count of oral copulation in count 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">On July 12, a second amended information was filed alleging five counts rather than four. Count 1 alleged a violation of section 288, subdivision (b)(1). Counts 2 through 4 alleged violations of section 269, subdivision (a)(5) (digital penetration) and count 5 alleged a violation of section 269, subdivision (a)(4) (oral copulation). The court said: \u201c[Defendant], we are going to proceed on Counts 1 through 5. There is an added count, as you heard yesterday in our discussion. Count 1 is a [section] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>288[, subdivision] (b), which was conforming to the proof during the course of this trial that there was no penetration in one of the incidents. So it\u2019s a lesser charge. But it does conform to what was described by [K.] at trial. Counts 2, 3, and 4 constitute the crime of sexual penetration, and Count 5 is oral copulation, [f] The Court will enter pleas of not guilty as to each of those counts, and we will proceed, and the jury will be instructed as to those charges, counts, and we will provide them with a copy of the second amended Information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">2. <em>Defendant\u2019s Ineffective Assistance Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Defendant claims his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the filing of the first and second amended informations. In order to establish an ineffective assistance claim, a defendant must show that his counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that but for counsel\u2019s error, it is reasonably probable the defendant would have realized a more favorable result. <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 691-692 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 104 S.Ct. 2052]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 216-217 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839].) The defendant may establish the first prong of an ineffectiveness claim by showing there could be no satisfactory explanation for counsel\u2019s act or omission. <em>(People v. Ledesma, supra, </em>at p. 218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Here, we are concerned with whether there could be no satisfactory explanation for defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the amendments set forth in the first and second amended informations, which were filed after defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing. We agree that counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the second amended information because it alleged an additional fifth offense\u2014the section 288, subdivision (b) violation in count 1. This charge was not included in the amended complaint to which defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing. We.disagree, however, that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to object to either the first or second amended information regarding any of the four section 269 charges, because these were effectively pled in the amended complaint and there was not a substantial variance between the amended complaint and the amended informations.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">3. <em>Defendant\u2019s Section 288, Subdivision (b) Conviction in Count 1 Must Be Reversed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Winters </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 997, 1005 through 1007 [270 Cal.Rptr. 740] <em>(Winters), </em>defendant argues that his waiver of the preliminary hearing \u201cextended only to the right to contest the evidence that would have supported the charges set forth in the complaint, [but] did not bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>him from challenging counts not charged in the complaint.\u201d We agree that, because defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing, his section 288, subdivision (b) conviction in count 1 must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In <em>Winters, </em>as in the present case, the defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing. The operative complaint charged the defendant with one count of possessing methamphetamine for sale. Thereafter, the defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing on the complaint, and an information was filed alleging the same charge. At trial, the prosecution was allowed to amend the information to add a second charge of transportation of methamphetamine, and the jury found the defendant guilty of both charges. <em>(Winters, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 999.) On appeal, the court reversed the transportation conviction on the ground that the amendment adding the transportation charge violated section 1009. <em>(Winters, supra, </em>at p. 1008.) The statute provides, in pertinent part, that: \u201cAn indictment or accusation cannot be amended so as to change the offense charged, nor an information so as to charge an offense not shown by the evidence taken at the preliminary examination.\u201d (\u00a7 1009.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The <em>Winters </em>court explained: \u201cSection 1009 specifically proscribes amending an information to charge an offense not shown by the evidence taken at the preliminary hearing. This rule has remained virtually unchanged for over 80 years, [f] In the instant case, the preliminary hearing was waived and, thus, no evidence was presented on the complaint which charged only possession of methamphetamine for sale. Respondent has cited no case authority which would allow, over objection, an amendment to the information to add a transportation count on these facts. ... We have found no exception to this express provision of section 1009 and appellant\u2019s conviction of count II of the information, transportation of methamphetamine, must be reversed.\u201d <em>(Winters, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1007-1008.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The People urge this court not to follow <em>Winters </em>because it misinterpreted section 1009. They argue that section 1009 does not proscribe amending a pleading to conform to proof at trial when, as here, the defendant has waived his right to a preliminary hearing. They criticize <em>Winters </em>for relying on dicta from a 1925 case, <em>People </em>v. <em>Bomar </em>(1925) 73 Cal.App. 372, 378 [238 P. 758] <em>(Bomar), </em>in which the defendant <em>did not </em>waive his right to a preliminary hearing. In <em>Bomar, </em>the court reversed two convictions that were not based on evidence shown at the preliminary hearing, and drew a comparison between upholding a conviction based on a charge not shown by evidence at a preliminary hearing and upholding a conviction based on an information filed in a case in which no preliminary hearing had been held.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>As quoted in <em>Winters, </em>the <em>Bomar </em>court observed: \u201c \u2018Before any accused person can be called upon to defend himself on any charge prosecuted by information, he is entitled to preliminary examination upon said charge, and the judgment of the magistrate before whom such examination is held as to whether the crime for which it is sought to prosecute him has been committed, and whether there is sufficient cause to believe him guilty thereof. These proceedings are essential to confer jurisdiction upon the court before whom he is placed on trial. To say that he was accorded a fair trial upon an information filed against him without a substantial compliance with these jurisdictional requirements, and, therefore, that there had been no miscarriage of justice, hardly meets the situation. <em>Such an argument would apply with equal force to the validity of the conviction upon an information filed by the district attorney in a case where no preliminary examination at all had been held. </em>Such practice would result, in legal effect, in wiping out all provisions of the [Constitution and the Penal Code providing for a preliminary examination, and in clothing the district attorney with unlimited authority to file information against whomsoever in his judgment he might consider guilty of crime. We do not believe that it was ever the intention to extend the scope of section 4 1/2 of article VI of the [Constitution [now article VI, section 13] to any such limits.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Winters, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 1007, quoting <em>Bomar, supra, </em>73 Cal.App. at p. 378.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The <em>Winters </em>court thus concluded that, when no preliminary hearing is held, the defendant may not be charged with additional crimes not charged in the pleading to which he waived his right to a preliminary hearing. Allowing such an amendment violates section 1009, even if the amendment did not prejudice the defendant or the defendant had notice of the facts underlying the new charges. <em>(Winters, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1006-1007.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We believe the reasoning of the courts in <em>Winters </em>and <em>Bomar </em>is sound, and that the courts in these cases aptly summarized the letter and spirit of section 1009. Simply put, section 1009 prohibits adding new charges to an accusatory pleading after the defendant has waived his right to a preliminary hearing on that pleading. In enacting section 1009, the Legislature determined that an accusatory pleading cannot be amended based on evidence not taken at the preliminary hearing. And when, as here, no preliminary hearing is held, the pleading cannot be amended to add <em>additional </em>charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In view of section 1009 and <em>Winters, </em>there can be no satisfactory explanation for defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the addition of the section 288, subdivision (b) charge in count 1. This charge was not included in the amended complaint that was on file at the time defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing. The amended complaint contained only four section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>269 charges. The section 288, subdivision (b) charge was alleged as an additional fifth charge following the close of the People\u2019s case-in-chief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, counsel\u2019s failure to object prejudiced defendant because he was convicted of a charge not included in the amended complaint to which he had waived his right to a preliminary hearing. Defendant has thus established both prongs of his ineffective assistance claim relative to his conviction in count 1. <em>(People v. Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 216-218.) His conviction in count 1 must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">At oral argument, the People further urged this court not to follow <em>Winters </em>because it espouses a \u201cper se rule\u201d that, once a defendant has waived his right to a preliminary hearing on a particular pleading, under no circumstances may that pleading be amended. The problem with such a \u201cper se rule,\u201d they argue, is that it encourages prosecutors not to allow defendants to waive their rights to preliminary hearings. (\u00a7 860 [despite the defendant\u2019s waiver of preliminary hearing, district attorney or magistrate may require that preliminary hearing be held].) In lieu of the \u201cper se rule,\u201d they urge this court to adopt a rule that, when the parties and court agree not to hold a preliminary hearing, the operative accusatory pleading may be amended at any time, including to conform to proof at trial, provided the defendant has notice, from any source, of the evidence to be presented at trial. The sources of notice to the defendant, they argue, may include any information available to the defendant or obtained through pretrial discovery, including police reports. And here, they argue, defendant was on notice, at the time he waived his right to a preliminary hearing, of the nature and number of the charges against him, as alleged in the second amended complaint. We refer to this proposed alternative to the \u201cper se rule\u201d as the \u201cdiscovery rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The People'overstate their argument against the so-called per se rule. The rule, as articulated in <em>Winters, </em>prohibits amending an accusatory pleading to allege new and additional offenses after the defendant has waived his right to a preliminary hearing on the pleading. (\u00a7 1009.) We fail to see how the so-called per se rule encourages prosecutors not to allow defendants to waive their rights to preliminary hearings. (\u00a7 860.) Prosecutors have every reason to insist on a preliminary hearing whenever it appears the evidence presented at trial may vary to any significant extent from the allegations of the operative pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>We decline to adopt the so-called discovery rule because it would be at odds with the letter and spirit of section 1009. In <em>Winters, </em>the respondent urged the court to uphold the defendant\u2019s transportation conviction on the ground the defendant \u201cclearly had notice of the People\u2019s evidence of transportation\u201d as indicated by statements the defendant made in a pretrial suppression motion and in view of the evidence presented by the People in their case-in-chief at trial. <em>(Winters, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 1005.) In addition, the People informed the defendant that they were seeking to add the transportation charge following the presentation of their case-in-chief. The defendant objected but did not seek a continuance or leave to conduct further discovery in order to defend against the transportation charge. Thus, the People argued, the defendant would not be prejudiced by the addition of the transportation charge. <em>(Winters, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 1007.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">In rejecting the respondent\u2019s argument that the transportation conviction should be upheld because the defendant was aware of the facts supporting it, the <em>Winters </em>court reasoned there was no legal support for the argument. <em>(Winters, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 1007.) Nor have we found any legal support, 19 years after <em>Winters </em>was decided, to support the People\u2019s substantially similar claim that, when a defendant is on notice of the facts supporting a charge, based on information available to him at the time he waived his right to the preliminary hearing, that charge may be added to the accusatory pleading to which he waived his right to a preliminary hearing. For the reasons explained, allowing such an additional charge violates section 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Preliminary hearing transcripts have long been considered the \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018touchstone of due process notice\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d to the defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Graff </em>(2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 345, 367 [87 Cal.Rptr.3d 827].) And when, as here, a defendant waives his right to a preliminary hearing and no preliminary hearing is held, substituting the preliminary hearing transcript with potentially vague indications that the defendant was on notice of the facts underlying a proffered additional charge would risk depriving the defendant of his due process right to notice of <em>all </em>of the charges against him. The contents of police reports and other \u201cdiscovery\u201d or information available to the defendant would be a poor and potentially dangerous substitute for the \u201ctouchstone\u201d of the preliminary hearing transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">4. <em>The Section 269 Charges in Counts 2 Through 5 Were Properly Amended</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">All of the pleadings consistently charged defendant with four counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child in violation of section 269. But in the first and second amended informations, the prosecution changed what had originally been charged as three counts of assault by oral copulation (\u00a7\u00a7 269, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>subd. (a)(4), 288a) and one count of assault by sexual penetration (\u00a7\u00a7 269, subd. (a)(5), 289, subd. (a)) to three counts of sexual penetration and one count of oral copulation. Defendant was convicted of the four amended section 269 charges in counts 2 through 5. He argues his defense counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the amendments to these charges, and he was prejudiced because he was convicted of <em>two </em>counts of sexual penetration that were not charged in the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">As pertinent here, the issue is whether the second amended information charged crimes different than those alleged in the amended complaint, thus depriving defendant of his due process right to notice of the allegations. Defendant maintains that a violation of sections 269, subdivision (a)(4) and 288a (assault by oral copulation) is simply not the same crime as a violation of sections 269, subdivision (a)(5) and 289, subdivision (a) (assault by sexual penetration). Again, defendant relies on <em>Winters, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at pages 1005 through 1007, for the proposition that his waiver of the preliminary hearing extended only to his right to contest the evidence underlying the charges alleged in the amended complaint, but did not bar him from challenging counts not alleged in the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We disagree that the amendments to the section 269 charges in this case violated section 1009 and defendant\u2019s commensurate due process right to notice. \u201cIt is a fundamental principle of due process that \u2018one accused of a crime must be \u201cinformed of the nature and cause of the accusation.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] This requirement is satisfied when the accused is advised of the charges against him so that he has a reasonable opportunity to prepare and present a defense and is not taken by surprise by the evidence offered at trial. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 992, 999 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 542].) \u201c \u2018Notice of the specific charge is a constitutional right of the accused. [Citation.]  An information which charges a criminal defendant with multiple counts of the same offense does not violate due process so long as (1) the information informs defendant of the nature of the conduct with which he is accused and (2) the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing informs him of the particulars of the offenses which the prosecution may prove at trial. [Citations.] <em>The information plays a limited but important role\u2014it tells a defendant what kinds of offenses he is charged with </em>and states the number of offenses that can result in prosecution. However, the time, place, and circumstances of charged offenses are left to the preliminary hearing transcript. This is the touchstone of due process notice to a defendant. . . HQ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HD \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [A]n information need <em>not </em>notify a defendant of all the particulars of the crime charged. <em>That role is left to the preliminary hearing transcript. </em>Where ... the particulars are <em>not </em>shown by the preliminary hearing transcript, the defendant is <em>not </em>on notice in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>way that he has the opportunity to prepare a meaningful defense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pitts </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 606, 904-905 [273 Cal.Rptr. 757], first italics added <em>(Pitts).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In discussing the due process aspects of the accusatory pleading and preliminary hearing transcript in the context of section 288 offenses not shown by evidence at the preliminary hearing, the court in <em>People v. Graff, </em>supra, 170 Cal.App.4th 345 observed that in <em>People v. Jones </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 294 [270 Cal.Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643], \u201cthe Attorney General argued, much as respondent does here, that as long as \u2018 \u201cthe preliminary hearing provides evidence of a certain number of lewd acts upon the specified victim \u2018on or about\u2019 the time frame in issue,\u201d \u2019 the defendants were \u2018 \u201con notice to defend themselves against <em>any touchings </em>\u2018This argument ignores the differences in function between an information and the transcript of the preliminary hearing. It is true that an information need <em>not </em>notify a defendant of all the particulars of the crime charged [because] <em>[t]hat role is left to the preliminary hearing transcript. </em>Where ... the particulars are <em>not </em>shown by the preliminary hearing transcript, the defendant is <em>not </em>on notice in such a way that he has the opportunity to prepare a meaningful defense.\u2019 [Citation.] ... \u2018[A] preliminary hearing transcript affording notice of the time, place and circumstances of charged offenses \u201c \u2018is the touchstone of due process notice to a defendant.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Graff, supra, </em>at pp. 366-367, first italics added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">When, as here, the defendant waives his right to the preliminary hearing, with the acquiescence of the district attorney and court, and there is therefore no preliminary hearing transcript upon which new or amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>charges may be based, the pleading on file at the time of the defendant\u2019s waiver must serve as the touchstone of due process notice to the defendant of the time, place, and circumstances of the charged offenses. (See <em>Winters, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1006-1007.) Thus, it is the amended complaint that must be looked to for purposes of determing whether defendant received due process notice. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Butte </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 956, 959 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 221] [plaintiff who waives preliminary hearing forfeits right to complain on appeal of vagueness in accusatory pleading].)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\u201cUnder the generally accepted rule in criminal law a variance [in pleadings] is not regarded as material unless it is of such a substantive character as to mislead the accused in preparing his defense . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Williams </em>(1945) 27 Cal.2d 220, 226 [163 P.2d 692]; see also <em>Pitts, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at pp. 905-907.) And \u201c[n]o accusatory pleading is insufficient, nor can the trial, judgment, or other proceeding thereon be affected by reason of any defect or imperfection in matter of form which does not prejudice a substantial right of the defendant upon the merits.\u201d (\u00a7 960.)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Here, all of the pleadings, including the amended complaint and second amended information, consistently alleged four section 269 charges based on either oral copulation by means of force or duress, in violation of section 288a, subdivisions (c)(2) or (3), or (d), or sexual penetration by means of force or duress, in violation of section 289, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Each pleading dealt with one victim and with conduct occurring over a very limited timeframe. And the only difference between the amended complaint, to which defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing, and the second amended information, upon which defendant was convicted at trial, is that the bases of two of the four alleged section 269 charges were changed from oral copulation to sexual penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Moreover, the amendments did not prejudice defendant\u2019s ability to prepare and present his defense to the charges as originally alleged. Defendant denied engaging in any illegal conduct whatsoever, whether oral copulation or sexual penetration. Nowhere during the trial, whether through cross-examination, direct examination or argument, does it appear that the specific conduct underlying the section 269 charges was of significance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">This case is unlike <em>People v. Burnett </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 151 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 629], where a firearm possession conviction was overturned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>because it was based on a totally distinct and separate incident of possession from that shown by the evidence at the preliminary hearing. It is unlike <em>Gray v. Raines </em>(9th Cir. 1981) 662 F.2d 569, where the defendant was charged in the information with forcible rape. After defendant put on a defense that the victim consented to the conduct, the prosecution was allowed to amend the information to allege statutory rape. In reversing the conviction, the court concluded that the defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated because he did not have notice of the specific charge of which he was convicted, and his substantial rights were prejudiced. And within the context of our present discussion, it is also unlike <em>Winters </em>where, after the filing of the initial information following the defendant\u2019s waiver of a preliminary hearing, the district attorney was allowed to add a whole new charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We therefore hold that defendant\u2019s convictions of the two counts of aggravated assault by sexual penetration were not in significant variance from the charges in the amended complaint; the convictions are therefore lawful. The operative pleading under which defendant was convicted did not charge him with violating a different Penal Code section from that alleged in the amended complaint. Both pleadings were based on the same course of conduct which occurred over an extremely limited time period and involved the same victim. Both pleadings dealt with the same underlying acts, oral copulation and sexual penetration. Defendant was not presented with a moving target; he was fully aware of what he had to defend against. Additionally, the punishment for the crimes charged in the amended complaint and the second amended information were identical. The substantial rights of defendant were simply not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Lastly, defendant argues there is insufficient evidence\u2014indeed, he argues, there is <em>no </em>evidence\u2014that he committed any of the offenses charged in the second amended information because it alleged that each crime occurred \u201con or about October 1, 2005,\u201d and the evidence presented at trial clearly showed that, by that time, defendant had moved out of the home he rented with C., C. had died, and K. was living with J.M. Instead, the evidence showed that all of the crimes were committed during the fall of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The prosecution was not required to show that the crimes took place \u201con or about October 1, 2005,\u201d but only \u201creasonably close to [that day].\u201d (Judicial Council of Cal. Crim. Jury Instas., CALCRIM No. 207 [Proof Need Not Show Actual Date].) The precise date on which an offense was committed need not be stated in an accusatory pleading unless the date is material to the offense (\u00a7 955), and the evidence is not insufficient merely because it shows the offense was committed on another date. <em>(People v. Starkey </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 822, 827 [44 Cal.Rptr. 738].) The October 1, 2005, date was not material to any of the charged offenses. Nor has defendant shown he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>prejudiced by the variance between the October 1, 2005 date, as set forth in the second amended information, and the evidence at trial that the offenses occurred during the fall of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">B., C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">IV. DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Defendant\u2019s section 288, subdivision (b) conviction in count 1 is reversed and his six-year sentence on count 1 is stricken.

I think I somehow ended up laying down because he always did it when I was laying down.\u201d \u201cWell, I would be sitting down. He would come sit next to me.

The court concluded that, absent unusual circumstances, the defendant\u2019s due process rights would not be violated if, at trial, the information is amended to allege two additional section 288 violations. The court reasoned that the defendant was on notice from the preliminary hearing transcript as to what charges he might have to defend against at trial. The court then changed the hypothetical to suppose that the evidence at trial showed two acts of sodomy and two acts of sexual intercourse, and the information is amended accordingly. In this scenario, the amendment would violate the defendant\u2019s due process rights because the preliminary hearing transcript did not put him on notice of the \u201cspecific acts\u201d he had to defend against. <em>(Pitts, supra, </em>at p. 906.) Moreover, the amendment in the specific acts underlying the charges, the court said, was material because it would affect medical testimony, among other particulars of the prosecution and defense case, and prejudice the defendant\u2019s ability to present his defense. The court disagreed that the defendant\u2019s due process rights would not be violated, in the second scenario, simply because he knew to defend against four violations of section 288. This proposition, the court said, \u201c \u2018assumes the guilt of the accused . .. [and is] foreign to our system of criminal justice.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Pitts, supra, </em>at p. 907.)
