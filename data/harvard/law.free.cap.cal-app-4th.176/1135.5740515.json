J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV7\">Coffman Specialties, Inc. (Coffman), an engineering contractor, brought an action against California\u2019s Department of Transportation (Caltrans) seeking a declaratory judgment that arbitration provisions in the State Contract Act are unconstitutional. (Pub. Contract Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 10240 et seq.) Coffman contends these provisions, on their face and as applied, violate its constitutional rights to a neutral arbitrator, petition the government, and equal protection of the law. The trial court sustained Caltrans\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend, and entered judgment in Caltrans\u2019s favor. Coffman appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">STATUTORY OVERVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">The State Contract Act governs specified public works projects that exceed a certain cost, and requires competitive bidding for covered projects. (\u00a7 10105.) The Act mandates that once a bid is accepted and the parties enter into a contract, the \u201cremedy for the resolution of claims\u201d arising from the contract \u201cshall be arbitration\u201d under the statutory provisions. (\u00a7 10240.) This arbitration process is administered by the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), and by a committee composed of industry and governmental representatives, known as the Public Works Contract Arbitration Committee (Public Works Arbitration Committee). (\u00a7\u00a7 10245, 10245.2; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 1, \u00a7 1310.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">The Public Works Arbitration Committee certifies arbitrators with experience in large-scale public construction matters to preside over statutory public works arbitration hearings, and maintains a list of those certified arbitrators (the Certified Panel). (\u00a7\u00a7 10240.3, 10245, 10245.3; Regs., \u00a7 1395, subd. (d).) The State Contract Act and the implementing regulations provide a detailed procedure to assist the parties in mutually selecting an arbitrator from the Certified Panel, and allow the parties to petition the superior court if this process does not result in the selection of a mutually agreeable arbitrator. (\u00a7 10240.3; Regs., \u00a7 1321.) Once the arbitrator is selected, the arbitrator is subject to numerous disclosure obligations, and either party may disqualify the arbitrator based on a required disclosure. (Regs., \u00a7 1322.) An arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>failure to disclose is a basis for vacating the arbitration award after it is issued. (\u00a7 10240.12; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1286.2, subd. (a)(6); <em>Guseinov v. Bums </em>(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 944, 957 [51 Cal.Rptr.3d 903].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">\n<em>Coffman\u2019s Public Works Contracts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Coffman successfully bid on three road construction projects governed by the State Contract Act, and entered into three separate contracts with Caltrans. The parties later had disputes on each project, and Coffman sought arbitration, or planned to seek arbitration, with respect to these disputes. The following summarizes the facts alleged pertaining to each of these construction projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\"><em>Route </em>7 <em>Project</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">Coffman entered into a contract requiring Coffman to construct Highway 7 between Highway 98 and Interstate 8. The stated contract price was $32,345,000. During the construction, numerous disputes arose between Caltrans and Coffman concerning issues such as the scope of the work and differing site conditions. In July 2005, Coffman substantially completed the work. In June 2006, Caltrans issued a final denial of Coffman\u2019s claims for additional payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">In September 2006, Coffman filed an arbitration complaint against Caltrans for $5,793,846. Coffman requested that Caltrans stipulate to an experienced and qualified arbitrator from outside the Certified Panel. Caltrans refused to agree to this request. Coffman and Caltrans then participated in, and exhausted, the arbitrator selection process under the applicable regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">In July 2007, Coffman filed a petition with the superior court seeking an order declaring the statutory arbitration requirement to be facially unconstitutional and unenforceable. In response, Caltrans filed its own petition for the appointment of an arbitrator from the Certified Panel. The court denied Coffman\u2019s petition, but stated the denial was without prejudice to raise the constitutional challenge in an alternate forum. The court then granted Caltrans\u2019s request for the appointment of an arbitrator. In October 2007, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>court issued a minute order appointing David Robison from the Certified Panel as an arbitrator on the Route 7 project arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">\n<em>Route 15 Project</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">In 2003, Coffman and Caltrans entered into a written contract for construction work along Interstate 15. The stated contract price was $16,255,000. Coffman completed the work in about October 2005. During the project, various disputes arose between Coffman and Caltrans. In July 2007, Caltrans issued a final written decision denying Coffman\u2019s claims for additional payment. In October 2007, Coffman filed an arbitration complaint against Caltrans for $370,191.93. The arbitration proceeding is currently pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">\n<em>Interstate 15/Route 56 Project</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">In 2003, Coffman and Caltrans entered into a written contract for the construction of managed lanes on Interstate 15 at the Interstate 15/Route 56 separation. The stated contract amount was $51,544,999.50. Coffman began work in December 2003. The work has not yet been completed, but Coffman has calculated that it will be owed an additional $10 million based on the parties\u2019 existing disputes. Upon completion of the project, Coffman intends to submit a claim for payment, and if the claim is denied, it will be required to file a complaint in arbitration with the OAH.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">\n<em>Declaratory Relief Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">In November 2007, Coffman filed the declaratory relief complaint at issue in this appeal. Coffman alleged the facts summarized above pertaining to the three construction projects, and asserted two causes of action. In the first cause of action, Coffman alleged the arbitration rules in the State Contract Act and implementing regulations are facially unconstitutional because the rules (1) \u201ccreate an inherent financial bias in the arbitrator\u201d to favor Caltrans because of Caltrans\u2019s status as a \u201crepeat customer\u201d in the arbitrations; (2) violate a contractor\u2019s First Amendment right to petition and due process rights by requiring contractors to pay one-half the costs of the arbitration; and (3) violate a public works contractor\u2019s equal protection rights by requiring claims against Caltrans to proceed under the arbitration scheme, while excluding contractor claims against other public agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">In the second cause of action, Coffman alleged the arbitration provisions are unconstitutional \u201cas applied\u201d because all arbitrators on the Certified Panel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>are biased in favor of Caltrans. Coffman did not allege any specific supporting facts, but instead asserted generally that Caltrans\u2019s substantial delay in the contract payment and arbitration process \u201ceffectively chills and abridges the contractor\u2019s ability to receive payment for work performed\u201d and is intended to \u201cpunish and deter a contractor from pursuing his or her statutory rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\">\n<em>Demurrer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Caltrans filed a demurrer, arguing that Coffman\u2019s complaint failed to state a cognizable cause of action. On the facial challenge, Caltrans argued the statutory scheme does not result in biased arbitrators or violate a contractor\u2019s First Amendment or equal protection rights. On the as-applied challenge, Caltrans argued that Coffman did not allege any facts about the manner in which the arbitration provisions were unconstitutional as applied to Coffman\u2019s case. Caltrans further asserted that the claim was not ripe because Coffman\u2019s concerns were hypothetical and Coffman has not suffered any harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">In response, Coffman focused primarily on its argument that the Certified Panel arbitrators are necessarily biased in favor of Caltrans because Caltrans is a \u201crepeat customer\u201d at public works arbitrations. In support, Coffman discussed facts that were not alleged in the complaint. First, Coffman stated that Caltrans is a party in 72 percent of all public works arbitration hearings, citing statistical records posted on the OAH Web site. Second, Coffman asserted that 53 of the 61 Certified Panel arbitrators have previously worked (at unspecified times) as an arbitrator on a Caltrans arbitration, and therefore 87 percent of the arbitrators are \u201cbiased by statutory definition.\u201d Based on these facts, Coffman argued the entire statutory scheme \u201cis set up in such a way that every arbitrator on the panel has an inherent financial incentive to rule in favor of the state and [Caltrans] because the state is always a party and [Caltrans] is the arbitrator\u2019s repeat customer 72 % of the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">At the hearing on the demurrer, Coffman\u2019s counsel also discussed the status of the arbitration in the Route 7 project matter. He stated that Caltrans had objected to the original arbitrator selected by the court (Robison) on the basis that Robison had previously served as an arbitrator for Coffman. The court then appointed another arbitrator who had issued a large monetary award in favor of a different contractor, but Caltrans also successfully objected to this arbitrator. Coffman\u2019s counsel argued that Caltrans\u2019s objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>tions to these Certified Panel arbitrators support Coffman\u2019s claims that the statutory scheme results in biased arbitrators. Counsel said Coffman could amend its complaint to add these and other factual allegations \u201cto show how [Caltrans] is able to manipulate the system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">After the hearing, the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The court found Coffman failed to state facts sufficient to support a facial or an as-applied constitutional challenge to the applicable arbitration provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">I. <em>Review Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">On appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after the court sustained a demurrer, a reviewing court must determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. <em>(Zelig v. County of Los Angeles </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1126 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 709, 45 P.3d 1171].) We give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. <em>(Ibid.) </em>We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but do not assume the truth of contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. <em>(Ibid.) </em>We exercise our independent judgment as to whether, as a matter of law, the complaint states a cause of action on any available legal theory. <em>(Betancourt </em>v. <em>Storke Housing Investors </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1157, 1162-1163 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 259, 82 P.3d 286].) We further examine \u201cwhether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment: if it can be, the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse.\u201d <em>(City of Dinuba </em>v. <em>County of Tulare </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 859, 865 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 614, 161 P.3d 1168].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">Coffman brought a facial and an as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of the public works arbitration statutes. The validity of both claims may be decided on a demurrer. (See <em>Easier v. Lockyer </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 472, 478 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 334, 2 P.3d 581]; <em>Breneric Associates v. City of Del Mar </em>(1998) 69 Cal.App.4th 166, 172 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 324]; <em>Alfaro </em>v. <em>Terhune </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 492, 509-510 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 197].) However, the analysis is different on each claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">In evaluating a facial challenge, a court considers \u201conly the text of the measure itself, not its application to the particular circumstances of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>individual.\u201d <em>(Tobe v. City of Santa Ana </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1069, 1084 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 402, 892 P.2d 1145].) The California Supreme Court has not articulated a single test for determining the propriety of a facial challenge. <em>(Guardianship of Ann S. </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 1110, 1126 [90 Cal.Rptr.3d 701, 202 P.3d 1089].) Under the strictest test, the statute must be upheld unless the party establishes the statute \u201c \u2018inevitably pose[s] a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Under the more lenient standard, a party must establish the statute conflicts with constitutional principles \u201c \u2018in the generality or great majority of cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics omitted.) Under either test, the plaintiff has a heavy burden to show the statute is unconstitutional in all or most cases, and \u201c \u2018cannot prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may possibly arise as to the particular <em>application </em>of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Zuckerman v. State Bd. of Chiropractic Examiners </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 32, 39 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 701, 53 P.3d 119].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">On an as-applied challenge, the plaintiff must plead and prove the specific facts giving rise to the alleged constitutional violation. (See <em>Tobe </em>v. <em>City of Santa Ana, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 1084.) To prevail, the plaintiff must establish the particular application of the statute violates the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>(Hale </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 388, 404-405 [149 CahRptr. 375, 584 P.2d 512].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">II. <em>Facial Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">In its complaint, Coffman alleges three separate ways in which the arbitration provisions in the State Contract Act and implementing regulations facially violate a contractor\u2019s constitutional rights: (1) establishing an arbitration system whereby all arbitrators are biased in favor of Caltrans; (2) violating a contractor\u2019s constitutional petition rights by requiring the contractor to share in the cost of the arbitration; and (3) violating a contractor\u2019s equal protection rights. We conclude the complaint does not state a valid cause of action on any of these three grounds, nor does any proposed amendment to the complaint support the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">A. <em>Contentions Pertaining to Biased Arbitrators</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">Coffman contends \u201call\u201d arbitrators appointed from the Certified Panel have a financial incentive to rule in favor of the state and therefore \u201call\u201d arbitrators are biased in favor of Caltrans. In considering this claim, we first summarize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>the statutory and regulatory provisions governing the selection of an arbitrator, and then examine Coffman\u2019s arguments that this process inevitably results in a biased arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">1. <em>Provisions Governing Arbitration Selection Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">The State Contract Act requires an arbitrator to be selected from the Certified Panel, unless the parties agree otherwise. (\u00a7 10240.3; see <em>Brutoco Engineering &amp; Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1326, 1332-1333 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 866] <em>(Brutoco).) </em>The arbitrators on the Certified Panel are chosen by the Public Works Arbitration Committee. (\u00a7\u00a7 10240.3, 10245, 10245.3.) The Public Works Arbitration Committee consists of seven members: (1) three public members appointed by the Governor, each of whom has at least 10 years\u2019 experience with a general contracting firm engaged in public works construction; (2) three government officers/employees appointed by directors of the various departments (including Caltrans); and (3) the OAH director, who is a nonvoting member. (\u00a7 10245.) The appointed public members serve four-year terms, and serve without compensation, except for expense reimbursement. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">The Public Works Arbitration Committee is responsible for establishing \u201cstandards and qualifications for the certification of arbitrators\u201d and for \u201ccertify[ing] as arbitrators persons meeting such standards and qualifications.\u201d (\u00a7 10245.3.) Arbitrators selected by the Committee are required to have \u201csubstantial experience\u201d in large-scale public works construction projects, experience as public works arbitrators, and knowledge of California law. (Regs., \u00a7 1395.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">The State Contract Act and implementing regulations provide detailed rules governing the selection of an arbitrator from the Certified Panel. The fundamental principles underlying these rules are full disclosure and mutual consent. After a party initially serves an arbitration complaint, the parties have 20 days to \u201cagree on the selection of an Arbitrator.\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 1321, subd. (b).) If no agreement is reached, the regulations provide for a process in which the OAH assists the parties in identifying an arbitrator who is acceptable to both parties. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Under these rules, each party must submit to the OAH a list of five acceptable arbitrators from the Certified Panel, and the OAH then reviews these lists for mutual preferences and selects an arbitrator who appears on both lists. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>If a mutually acceptable arbitrator has not been identified after the second round of arbitrator list submissions, or six months from the filing of the arbitration complaint, whichever comes first, either party \u201cmay petition the Superior Court to select one or more Arbitrators in order of preference from among those who have indicated a willingness to serve as an Arbitrator in the location for the hearing. . . .\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 1321, subd. (d).) Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.6 provides the court with the authority to appoint an arbitrator when the parties cannot agree to an arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Once an arbitrator is selected (either through the administrative process or by the superior court after a petition by a party), the prospective arbitrator \u201cshall disclose to the [OAH] any circumstances likely to prevent a prompt hearing and decision or to create a presumption of bias.\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 1322, subd. (a).) The disclosures must satisfy specific standards from the Judicial Council\u2019s Ethics Standards for Neutral Arbitrators in Contractual Arbitration (Ethics Standards), including standard 7. (Regs., \u00a7 1322, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Standard 7 provides: \u201cA person who is nominated or appointed as an arbitrator must disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed arbitrator would be able to be impartial. . . .\u201d (Ethics Stds., std. 7(d).) The standard then contains numerous rules requiring an arbitrator to disclose certain relationships or circumstances, which specifically include an arbitrator\u2019s prior service as a hearing officer for either party during the previous five years and detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>facts about the prior service, including the identity of the prevailing party and the amount of the award.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Ethics Stds., std. 7(d)(4)(A) &amp; (B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>As reflected in the margin, the disclosure requirements are comprehensive, covering any conceivable circumstance that might call into question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>the arbitrator\u2019s ability to serve as a neutral hearing officer, and any facts that might possibly show the appearance of bias. Additionally, these disclosure rules supplement and expand the statutory listing of required disclosures by arbitrators contained in Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.9, subd. (a)(1), which requires a proposed arbitrator to disclose \u201call matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial,\u201d including \u201c[t]he existence of any ground specified in [Code of Civil Procedure] Section 170.1 for disqualification of a judge. . . .\u201d and detailed information about current and prior arbitrations (within the past five years) involving parties to the pending arbitration.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Under the State Contract Act, upon disclosure of a disqualifying circumstance, \u201c[t]he prospective Arbitrator <em>shall </em>be disqualified by the [OAH] <em>if </em>an objection is made ... by [one of the parties] within ten days from the date of the receipt of the information. If neither [party] objects within the time specified, the prospective Arbitrator shall be deemed acceptable.\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 1322, subd. (b), italics added.) Further, the arbitrator\u2019s disclosure obligation under the State Contract Act is a continuing duty, applying from service of the notice of the arbitrator\u2019s proposed appointment until the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding. (Regs., \u00a7 1322, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">The statutes governing contractual arbitration provide parties with similar automatic disqualification rights. <em>(Luce, Forward, Hamilton &amp; Scripps, LLP </em>v. <em>Koch </em>(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 720, 729 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 869] <em>(Luce Forward)-, </em>Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1281.9, 1281.91.) \u201cSection 1281.91 \u2018confers on both parties the unqualified right to remove a proposed arbitrator based on any disclosure required by law which could affect his or her neutrality. [Citation.] There is no good faith or good cause requirement for the exercise of this right, nor is there a limit on the number of proposed neutrals who may be disqualified in this manner. [Citation.] As long as the objection is based on a required disclosure, a party\u2019s right to remove the proposed neutral by giving timely notice is absolute.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Luce Forward, supra, </em>at p. 729.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">On our review of the statutory and regulatory provisions, there is no support for Coffman\u2019s arguments that the public works arbitration system necessarily results in biased arbitrators. To the contrary, the broad disclosure and disqualification protections provided by the State Contract Act, and its implementing regulations, that incorporate the Ethics Standards, as well as the disclosure rules of Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.9, provide assurance that an arbitrator who ultimately presides over a public works <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>arbitration hearing will be neutral and acceptable to both parties. The fact that an appointed committee (composed of an equal number of industry and government voting representatives) screens and certifies the arbitrators provides additional grounds for concluding that any arbitrator with a predisposition to one side will not be qualified to serve as a public works arbitrator. To the extent a contractor believes a particular arbitrator is biased, the contractor can raise these concerns in the specific proceeding, either in response to the appointment of an arbitrator, or in response to a motion to confirm the award if new information is discovered during the arbitration proceedings. (See <em>Brutoco, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1330-1332.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\">As its primary legal theory, Coffman argues the statutory scheme necessarily violates a contractor\u2019s due process rights \u201cbecause the arbitrator must issue rulings favorable to Caltrans in order to obtain future employment.\u201d Coffman contends that any arbitrator placed on the Certified Panel develops an inevitable \u201cfinancial bias\u201d in favor of Caltrans because Caltrans is the \u201csteady and repeat customer\u201d in public works arbitrations. The asserted logic underlying this argument is as follows: (1) arbitrators on the Certified Panel are paid only if they are selected to conduct an arbitration; (2) most arbitrators who are on the Certified Panel have served as an arbitrator on a case in which Caltrans was a party;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (3) Caltrans will presumably rely on this prior service factor to disqualify arbitrators who have ruled against it in a prior case; and thus (4) an arbitrator will have a financial incentive to rule in favor of Caltrans because he or she wants to be selected as an arbitrator and the arbitrator does not want to be challenged for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">This chain of reasoning is unpersuasive. Most important, Coffman ignores that the rules permit any party (including a contractor) to disqualify an arbitrator based on a disclosure required under the Ethics Standards or statutory rules. One of these required disclosures is that the proposed arbitrator served as an arbitrator on a case in which Caltrans was a party during the previous five years. (Ethics Stds., std. 7(d)(4)(A)(i).) The arbitrator must also disclose details of the prior service, including the identification of the prevailing party and the total amount of monetary damages awarded, if any. <em>(Id., </em>std. 7(d)(4)(B).) If, based on this information, a contractor believes the arbitrator would not be fair or unbiased, the contractor would have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>automatic right to disqualify this arbitrator. (Regs., \u00a7 1322, subd. (b).) In this situation, any suggestion of bias would be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Coffman asserts that a contractor\u2019s right to object to an arbitrator does not eliminate the potential bias because individual contractors are parties in public works arbitrations with much less frequency than is Caltrans. Coffman thus claims arbitrators have the incentive to rule in favor of the \u201crepeat customer\u201d rather than the party who is only an occasional litigant in the process. However, under Coffman\u2019s own theory, if a contractor is seeking to avoid a \u201cbiased\u201d arbitrator, a relevant factor will be the arbitrator\u2019s prior rulings in Caltrans arbitrations. If the arbitrator has presided over a Caltrans public works arbitration within the past five years, the contractor will have the right to this information under the Ethics Standards. <em>(Id., </em>std. 7(d)(4)(B).) And if the contractor learns that an arbitrator has consistently ruled in favor of Caltrans, the contractor will have the opportunity to disqualify the arbitrator. Thus, under the structure of the mutual disqualification system, an arbitrator who wishes to be selected for future arbitrations would not have a particular incentive to favor either party, but instead to rule in a fair and impartial manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">In this regard, this case differs from <em>Haas v. County of San Bernardino </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1017 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 341, 45 P.3d 280], relied upon by Coffman. In <em>Haas, </em>the California Supreme Court upheld a plaintiff\u2019s due process challenge to the manner in which a county selected temporary administrative hearing officers to preside over alleged state law and ordinance violations. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1020-1021.) Under the challenged rules, the county prosecutor selected the hearing officer \u201cat will,\u201d paid the hearing officer\u2019s entire fee, and was free to select the same adjudicator for future disputes at the prosecutor\u2019s own discretion. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1021-1022, 1029.) The high court concluded that this ad hoc system for selecting hearing officers was unconstitutional because it created the risk that the officers would have a financial incentive to rule in favor of the county to obtain future work as a hearing officer. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1030-1031.) The court emphasized that \u201cthe County rather than [the opposing party] would be the repeat customer upon whose goodwill, <em>alone, </em>the hearing officer\u2019s prospect of future employment in that capacity depended.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1030, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">The arbitrator selection process here is materially different. It is not Caltrans\u2019s goodwill \u201calone\u201d that determines the arbitrator\u2019s future employment as a public works arbitrator. Instead, it is <em>both </em>parties\u2014Caltrans <em>and </em>the contractor\u2014who must mutually agree to the arbitrator if the arbitrator has been a hearing officer at a prior Caltrans arbitration. Unlike in <em>Haas, </em>a single party does not have the authority to select the arbitrator. Instead, the contractor and Caltrans must come to an agreement on the arbitrator (or a judge selects the arbitrator), and then each party has a right to strike an arbitrator for any discloseable circumstance, including if the arbitrator has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>worked for Caltrans in the prior five years. This system provides strong incentive for an arbitrator to be fair to both parties if he or she desires future arbitration work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\">Moreover, unlike in <em>Haas, </em>a neutral committee selects the potential individuals to serve as arbitrators in public works disputes, and the arbitrator must obtain recertification every seven years. Composed of an equal number of governmental and industry voting representatives, the Public Works Arbitration Committee is structured to ensure that individuals not strongly associated with either side would be included on the Certified Panel. (\u00a7 10245; see <em>Brutoco, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1331-1332.) Additionally, unlike the system in <em>Haas, </em>a public works arbitrator is subject to the Ethics Standards, which the <em>Haas </em>court noted would serve to \u201cgreatly reduce the specific risk of bias\u201d arising from a paid adjudicator\u2019s repeat service for the same party. <em>(Haas v. County of San Bernardino, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 1036.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">We reject Coffman\u2019s alternate argument that the fact an arbitrator has presided over a prior Caltrans arbitration necessarily means the arbitrator cannot fairly preside over the case in an unbiased manner. In support of this contention, Coffman cites the disclosure rules applicable to superior court judges (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 170.1), which apply to arbitrators under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.9, subdivision (a)(1). These disclosure rules do not mean the arbitrator is unfit to serve as a neutral decision maker. Under the applicable statutes and regulations, the public works arbitrator\u2019s neutrality is assured by (1) requiring extensive disclosures of all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain doubt that the proposed arbitrator would be able to be impartial (Regs., \u00a7 1322, subd. (a)); and (2) requiring the party to timely object to the arbitrator based on the disclosure if the party believes the arbitrator would not be appropriate (Regs., \u00a7 1322, subd. (b)). By establishing a broad disclosure requirement and then placing the burden on the parties to timely disqualify the arbitrator at the party\u2019s option, the Legislature did not provide that a disclosure, in and of itself, means the arbitrator could not be neutral.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>In a related argument, Coffman asserts that every arbitrator who is certified by the Public Works Arbitration Committee, is by definition, \u201cbiased\u201d or \u201cnon-neutral\u201d because he or she applied to be on the Certified Panel. In support of this argument, Coffman relies on Code of Civil Procedure section 170.1, subdivision (a)(8)(A)(i), which provides a judge \u201cshall be disqualified\u201d if the judge has a current or prospective employment as a dispute resolution neutral, or has participated in discussions concerning such employment, and certain other circumstances are present, including that the arrangement or prior employment was with a party to the proceeding, or the matter before the judge concerns enforcement of an arbitration agreement. Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.9 incorporates portions of section 170.1, subdivision (a)(8)(A)(i) as facts that must be disclosed under certain circumstances. (See \u00a7 1281.9, subd. (a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Reading these statutes together in a commonsense manner, the provisions do not mean that an arbitrator\u2019s application for certification from the Public Works Arbitration Committee reflects bias or the appearance of bias. A central purpose of the Certified Panel is to ensure that parties to public works contracts have an experienced hearing officer with a background in these large-scale projects, leading to better-informed rulings and more efficient dispute resolution. It would defeat this purpose to hold that all such arbitrators are subject to disqualification merely because they applied to be on the Certified Panel. There is no basis for concluding an application to serve on the Certified Panel reflects bias or the appearance of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">In its reply brief, Coffman argues the process of mutual disqualification means that an arbitrator will never be selected. It contends that because the challenges are \u201climitless\u201d there will be an endless process of disqualifications, and that Caltrans will intentionally delay the process by continuing to assert challenges until it obtains an arbitrator who is \u201cbiased\u201d in Caltrans\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">These arguments do not support Coffman\u2019s facial challenge to the statutory scheme. As Coffman acknowledges, numerous Caltrans arbitrations have taken place before a mutually agreed-upon public works arbitrator. The possibility that in some future situation, the parties will have difficulty selecting an arbitrator or that Caltrans will unreasonably delay the process does not show that the statutes \u201c \u2018inevitably pose[] a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions,\u2019 \u201d nor does it show the scheme violates due process in \u201cthe generality or great majority of cases.\u201d <em>(iGuardianship of Ann S., supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 1126, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">Further, the argument that the selection process is \u201cnever-ending\u201d is unsupported by the applicable statutory and rule provisions. The regulations establish a maximum six-month period for parties to agree to an arbitrator, and then the parties may petition the court to appoint an arbitrator. (Regs., \u00a7 1321, subd. (d).) The court would then have the inherent equitable authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>to impose reasonable time limits on the selection process. Moreover, we are required to presume good faith on the part of public officials. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 664; see <em>City of Banning v. Desert Outdoor Advertising, Inc. </em>(1962) 209 Cal.App.2d 152, 155 [25 Cal.Rptr. 621].) If a party believes Caltrans has acted in bad faith in a particular case, the contractor would be entitled to raise the issue with the court in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">B., C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">III. <em>As-applied Challenge</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">Judgment affirmed.
