Jabbour, </em>Assistant Prosecutor, argued the cause for respondent <em>(Mr. Joseph P. </em>Lordi, Essex County Prosecutor, attorney).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b530-4\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Ami\">Defendant appeals, on leave granted, from an order denying her motion \u201cchallenging the array of the petit jury panel on the ground that the petit juror\u2019s minimum age qualification of 21 years as set forth in <em>[N. J. S. </em>A.] 2A:69-1 is unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">On appeal defendant, who is 19 years of age, argues that \u201cthe exclusion of 18 to 21 year olds from prospective jury selection and service denies [her] the right to trial by a jury of her peers\u201d and \u201cis an invidious discrimination * * * repugnant to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d We find no merit in defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A.-69-1 sets forth the requisite qualifications of a juror, including the requirement that he or she be \u201cover 21 and under 75 years of age.\u201d The constitutional power of the State to provide such age qualifications for jurors is clear. See <em>Carter v. Jury Commission of Greene County, </em>396 U. <em>S. </em>320, 90 <em>S. Ct. </em>518, 525, 24 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 549 (1970), in which the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">It has long been accepted that the Constitution does not forbid the States to prescribe relevant qualifications for their jurors. The States remain free to confine the selection to citizens, to persons meeting specified qualifications of age and educational attainment, and to those possessing good intelligence, sound judgment, and fair character, [at 332, 90 S. Ct. at 525]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Although defendant contends that \u201cthe 18 to 21 year old age group constitutes a recognizable political, economic and social group of the community\u201d whose exclusion from jury duty is unconstitutional, her argument therefor is unpersuasive and she cites no case so holding. The reported cases are to the contrary, each rejecting contentions identical with those advanced by defendant. See, <em>e. </em>g., <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>v. </em>McVean, 436 <em>F. </em>2d 1120, 1122 (5 Cir. 1971), <em>cert. </em>den. 404 <em>U. S. </em>822, 92 S. Ct. 45, 30 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1971); <em>United States v. Gargan, </em>314 <em>F. Supp. </em>414, 417 (W. D. Wis. 1970); <em>People v. Hoiland, </em>22 <em>Cal. App. </em>3d 530, 99 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>523 (Ct. App. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We note that the question here argued will soon be moot since by <em>L. </em>1972, c. 81, effective January 1, 1973, the Legislature has extended to persons 18 years of age and older, among other things, the right to \u201cserve on juries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The order denying the challenge to the array is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
