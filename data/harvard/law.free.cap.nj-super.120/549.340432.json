He sustained personal injuries and incurred medical expenses as a result. He held a policy of insurance with defendant covering a personally owned 1962 Oldsmobile. The policy was in force on the date of the accident. Among the terms of the policy, defendant was required to pay $500 for medical expenses incurred under certain specified circumstances as the result of a motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff\u2019s recovery from defendant in this action was under this section of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Part II of the policy as written requires defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">To pay all reasonable expenses incurred within one year from the date of accident for necessary medical, surgical, X-ray and dental services, * * * : To or for the named insured and each relative who sustains bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom * * * caused by accident, (a) while occupying the owned automobile, (b) while occupying a non-owned automobile, but only if such person has, or reasonably believes he has, the permission of the owner to use the automobile and the use is within the scope of such permission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The definition of \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d is found on a previous page of the policy, under Part I \u2014 Liability, Paid II, stating: \u201cThe definitions under Part I apply to Part II.\u201d A non-owned automobile is there defined as one \u201cnot owned by or furnished for the regular use of either the named insured or any relative, other than a temporary substitute automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Plaintiff does not contend that he was misled by the terms of the policy. His argument to the court below was that the bus supplied to him for operation each day could not be considered an automobile furnished for his regular use since he did not necessarily drive the same bus each day and he was only permitted to operate it during working hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Defendant argues here that there is no liability because the accident occurred in a vehicle furnished for plaintiff\u2019s regular use. It contends that the purpose of such a clause excluding non-owned automobiles regularly furnished is to prevent exposure to additional risk without the payment of an additional premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">We reverse. It is the regular use of other motor vehicles that brings the exclusionary clause here involved into operation. Whether the insured\u2019s employer assigns one specific motor vehicle for his regular use, or a number of motor vehicles, any one of which may be assigned for a particular trip, the result would be the same. See <em>Hayes v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>170 <em>Colo. </em>164, 460 <em>P. </em>2d 225, 227 (Sup. Ct. 1969), and <em>Voelker v. Travelers Indem Co., </em>260 <em>F. </em>2d 275 (7 Cir. 1957). The weight of authority is in accord with this statement. See <em>Home Insurance Co. v. Kennedy, </em>52 <em>Del. </em>42, 152 <em>A. </em>2d 115 (Super. Ct. 1959); <em>Iowa Mutual Insurance Co. v. Addy, </em>132 <em>Colo. </em>202, 286 <em>P. </em>2d 622 (Sup. Ct. 1955); <em>Schoenknecht v. Prairie State Farmer\u2019s Ins. Assoc., </em>27 <em>Ill. App. </em>2d 83, 169 <em>N. E. </em>2d 148 (App. Ct. 1960); <em>Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Boecher, Ohio App., </em>48 <em>N. E. </em>2d 895 (App. Ct. 1942); <em>Davey v. Merchant\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>97 <em>N. H. </em>236, 85 <em>A. </em>2d 388 (Sup. Ct. 1952); <em>Whaley v. Great American Insurance Co., </em>259 <em>N. C. </em>545, 131 <em>S. E. </em>2d 491 (Sup. Ct. 1963); <em>Grantham v. U. S. Fidelity and Guarantee Co., </em>245 <em>S. C. </em>144, 139 <em>S. E. </em>2d 744 (Sup. Ct. 1964); <em>Bringle v. Economy Fire and Casualty Co., </em>169 <em>N. W. </em>2d 879 (Iowa Sup. Ct. 1969); <em>Kenney v. Employer\u2019s Liability Assurance Corp., </em>5 <em>Ohio St. </em>2d 131, 214 <em>N. E. </em>2d 219 (Sup. Ct. 1966); <em>O\u2019Brien v. Halifax Ins. Co. of Massachusetts, </em>141 <em>So. 2d </em>307 (Fla. D. Ct. App. 1962); <em>Dickerson v. Miller\u2019s Mutual Fire Insurance Co. of Texas, </em>139 <em>So. </em>2d 785 (La. Ct. App. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>American Casualty Co. v. Lattanzio, </em>78 <em>N. J. Super. </em>404 (Ch. Div. 1963), is misplaced. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>factual situation presented in <em>Lattanzio </em>is readily distinguishable from the circumstances presented here. Compare <em>Ruggiero v. Globe Indemnity Co., </em>66 <em>Misc. </em>2d 948, 323 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 292 (N. Y. C. Civil Court, 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Eeversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
