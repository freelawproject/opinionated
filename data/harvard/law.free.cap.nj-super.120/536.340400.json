J. S. A. </em>2A :121-3 (b)). He seeks a reversal of his conviction upon the grounds that (a) <em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings should hatre been given to [him] prior to interrogation,\u201d and (b) \u201cThe evidence seized were the fruits of an illegal search and therefore inadmissable.\u201d These contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Defendant was working at the plant of his employer, Western Electric Company, when he was questioned and searched by two special investigators who were also employed by Western Electric. At their request ho voluntarily opened his workbench drawer where lottery paraphernalia was found. In addition, he gave them other gambling paraphernalia which he had on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The interrogation by the investigators was not \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d by police or government agents which is proscribed by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U. S. </em>436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 694 (1966), unless appropriate warnings are first given. <em>State v. Kelly, </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>283 (1972); see generally, Annotation, \u201cCustodial Interrogation-Miranda Rule,\u201d 31 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 565 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\"> So, too, the search by the investigators was not proscribed by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 <em>U. S. </em>643, 81 <em>S. Ct. </em>1684, 6 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1081 (1961). The cloak of protection furnished by the Fourth Amendment is directed against official arrogance and insolence in office by public agents. <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 <em>U. S. </em>443, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>2022, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>29 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 564 (1971); <em>State v. Kelly, supra; State v. De Simone, </em>60 <em>N. J. </em>319 (1972); Annotation, \u201cPrivate Search-Evidence,\u201d 36 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 553 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
