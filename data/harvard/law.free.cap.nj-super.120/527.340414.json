Eugene Godleshy </em>argued the cause for respondent Marinat Real Estate and Insurance Company <em>(Messrs.

We hold that the trial court misconceived the duty owed by Marinat to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">\u00a7 381 of the <em>Restatement, Agency </em>2d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">Unless otherwise agreed, an agent is subject to a duty to use reasonable efforts to give his principal information which is relevant to affairs entrusted to him and which, as the agent has notice, the principal would desire to have and which can be communicated without violating a superior duty to a third person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">The Comment to this section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">a. <em>When duty is inferred. </em>An agent may have a duty to act upon, or to communicate to his principal or to another agent, information which he has received, although not specifically instructed to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4s\">The duty exists if he has notice of facts which, in view of his relations with the principal, he should know may affect the desires of his principal as to his own conduct or the conduct of the principal or of another agent. * <em>* </em>* In cases of this sort, the duty of the agent is inferred from his position, just as an authority is inferred. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Further, upon the record, we find that Marinat breached this duty when its representative, Mary Tsitsiragos, failed to advise plaintiff of the existing circumstances as to the tenant Wise \u2014 that the tenant was unhappy and wanted to leave, that rent had not been paid for three months and that the house had been re-advertised and shown to others by Marinat.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">However, the trial court in view of its determination that Marinat breached no duty owing by it to plaintiff, never considered whether that breach of duty was the proximate cause of the damages to the premises and contents. An affirmative finding on this issue is necessary to plaintiff\u2019s recovery. Accordingly, the judgment entered by the trial court is reversed and the matter remanded for a hearing on the issue of proximate cause. In the event that issue is resolved in favor of plaintiff, then the matter of damages shall be tried and determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Reversed and remanded in accordance herewith. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
