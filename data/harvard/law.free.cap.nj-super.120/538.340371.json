The record fully supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the undisputed facts appearing in the affidavits submitted established that the representative of defendant insurance company had offered to settle plaintiff\u2019s negligence action for $1,000 and that there had been a timely acceptance of that offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">Defendants do not argue that more than a reasonable time had elapsed between the date of the offer, Mlarch 26, 1970, and the acceptance on August 5, 1970 so that the acceptance came too late. Their reliance is on the contention that by force of the two-year statute of limitations, once more than two years had elapsed since the accident, which had occurred on June 4, 1968, there no longer was any consideration for their promise to settle and that therefore the promise was unenforceable. The contention is set forth as follows in defendants\u2019 brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-13\">It is the contention of this defendant that a consideration for an offer made by the insurance carrier was the potential liability of the claim against its assured. When the Statute of Limitations had expired there no longer was any consideration for such offer, and therefore plaintiff was not in the position to accept the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>The contention lacks merit. It ignores the uncontradicted statement in the affidavit submitted on plaintiff\u2019s behalf that the insurance company\u2019s representative \u201cheld out to me that the offer could be accepted at any time.\u201d Further, it is bottomed on an assumption, contrary to settled law, that expiration of the applicable period of the statute of limitations extinguished plaintiff\u2019s substantive rights arising by reason of the injuries sustained by her in the automobile accident, rather than operating merely on the remedy. <em>Cf. Duttkin v. Zalenski, </em>140 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>200, 205 (Ch. 1947); 51 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Limitation of Actions, </em>\u00a7 22 at 606 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Despite the expiration of the statutory period, the substantive right continued to exist so that a promise to pay a sum in settlement thereof is enforceable without an independent consideration. <em>Cf. State v. Standard Oil Co., </em>5 <em>N. J. </em>281, 295 (1950), aff\u2019d <em>sub nom. </em>341 <em>U. S. </em>428, 71 S. Ct. 822, 95 L. Ed. 1078 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
