On appeal, Wooden challenges only a six-level enhancement under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) for \u201cotherwise us[ing] a firearm\u201d that went into the calculation of his 120-month sentence for the carjacking count. Wooden contends that instead of applying the six-level enhancement, the district court should have enhanced his offense lev\u00e9l by only five points under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) for brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-18\">The underlying facts are not disputed. On January 27,1997, at about 8:00 p.m., Wooden robbed a man at an automatic teller machine in Miami, Florida. He stole $20 cash and the victim\u2019s automobile. In the course of the robbery, Wooden held a .9 millimeter semiautomatic handgun about one-half inch from the victim\u2019s forehead and pointed it at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-19\">The district court found that Wooden\u2019s conduct justified the six-level enhancement for \u201cotherwise us[ing]\u201d a firearm. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of the words used in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Vincent, </em>121 F.3d 1451, 1454 (11th Cir.1997). Section 2B3.1(b)(2) establishes a hierarchy of culpability for varying degrees of involvement of a firearm in a robbery offense. If a firearm is \u201cbrandished, displayed, or possessed,\u201d a five-level enhancement is required. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C). If a firearm is \u201cotherwise used,\u201d a six-level enhancement is required. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B). If a firearm is discharged, a seven-level enhancement is required. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A). The. instant case turns upon where the line is drawn between \u201cbrandished, displayed, or possessed,\u201d and \u201cotherwise used.\u201d Wooden contends that \u201cotherwise used\u201d was meant to encompass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>only uses of a firearm, short of discharge, that inflict physical injury on the victim \u2014 for example, pistol-whipping or bludgeoning. Wooden also points out that the applicable guidelines provisions do not contain any sort of explicit proximity test; in other words, he argues that the closeness of the weapon to the victim should not make any difference in whether it is deemed to have been \u201cotherwise used\u201d or \u201cbrandished, displayed, or possessed.\u201d On the other hand, the government contends (and the district court held) that pointing a gun at someone at one-half inch range constitutes something more than brandishing, displaying, or possessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">This is a question of first impression in this Circuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We can find some assistance in the commentary to the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Brandished\u2019 ... means that the weapon was pointed or waved about, or displayed in a threatening manner.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.1 application note 1(c). \u201c \u2018Otherwise used\u2019 ... means that the conduct did not amount to the discharge of a firearm but was more than brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.1 application note 1(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We hold that the instant facts constitute an \u201cotherwise use\u201d of the weapon, and not merely a brandishing thereof. Wooden pointed the handgun at a specific victim, holding the gun one-half inch from the victim\u2019s forehead. Under these circumstances, we hold that Wooden has \u201cotherwise used\u201d the firearm; in other words, in the language of the definitions in the Guidelines, his conduct was more than brandishing; it was more than merely pointing or waving the weapon about in a threatening manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">In so holding, we follow the weight of authority. In <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>931 F.2d 238 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 886, 112 S.Ct. 242, 116 L.Ed.2d 197 (1991), the Third Circuit held that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted an \u201cotherwise use,\u201d and not merely a brandishing. There the defendant pointed a gun at his victim from a distance of one or two feet and ordered her not to start her car or he would blow her head off. The court distinguished that situation, involving the leveling of a gun at the head of a specific victim at close range, from brandishing, which the court indicated would denote a generalized rather than a specific threat. Other cases are almost identical to <em>Johnson. See United States v. Fuller, </em>99 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that the following conduct constituted \u201cotherwise using,\u201d and not merely brandishing: the defendant pressed the gun to the head of the bank teller, and at one point threatened to kill her if she did not do as she was told); <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>929 F.2d 1126 (6th Cir.1991) (same with respect to the following conduct: the defendant was holding a knife against the victim\u2019s throat, threatening to kill her and her children).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Although <em>Johnson, Fuller </em>and <em>Hamilton </em>all involve conduct almost identical to Wooden\u2019s conduct in the instant case, it is true that those cases also involved an explicit threat. Although the threat in the instant case was not verbalized, we conclude that Wooden\u2019s conduct in pointing and holding a semi-automatic weapon one-half inch from his victim\u2019s head is equally coercive and threatening. Our conclusion in this regard is supported by cases in both the Eighth and the Tenth Circuits holding that conduct iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>tical to the conduct in the instant case rose to the level of \u201cotherwise using\u201d the weapon, and was not merely brandishing it. <em>See United States v. Elkins, </em>16 F.3d 952 (8th Cir.1994) (holding that the following conduct constituted \u201cotherwise using\u201d the weapon and was not merely brandishing: placing a knife against the victim\u2019s throat to facilitate cooperation with a robbery demand); <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>898 F.2d 1465 (10th Cir.1990) (same where defendant came up behind the victim using an automatic teller machine, and, with a knife in his right hand, put his right arm around the victim\u2019s neck and demanded money).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Wooden\u2019s pointing the gun at the victim and holding it one-half inch from the victim\u2019s forehead constituted more than brandishing the gun, and thus qualified for the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) enhancement for \u201cotherwise using\u201d the gun.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-16\">. If Wooden were to prevail on this argument, his adjusted offense level would be 25 rather than 26, which when combined with his criminal histoiy category of VI, yields a sentence range of 110-137 months rather than the 120-150 month range used based on adjusted offense level 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\">. In <em>United States v. Omar, </em>16 F.3d 1168, 1170 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>modified on reh'g, </em>24 F.3d 1356 (11th Cir.1994), we noted the application of the then-four-level increase for \"otherwise us[ing]\u201d a firearm in determining the sentence of a defendant who had pointed a gun at an assistant manager\u2019s head during a bank robbery. However, the propriety of this four-level increase, as compared to the then-three-level increase for brandishing, displaying, or possessing, was not one of the issues raised on appeal in <em>Omar. </em>Similarly, in <em>United States v. Vincent, </em>121 F.3d 1451, 1455 (11th Cir.1997), the defendant had committed a robbery in which he pressed a hard object against the victim's side, intending to simulate a weapon of some sort. We affirmed the three-level enhancement that applies to brandishing, displaying, or possessing a dangerous weapon, <em>see </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E), noting that fake weapons are treated as equivalent to real ones for purposes of this offense level enhancement. The government in <em>Vincent </em>did not argue, and therefore we did not consider, whether the higher \"otherwise used\" enhancement might apply to defendant's conduct in pressing a weapon-like object against the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b738-11\">. Section 2B3.1 application note 1 provides that the definitions in the commentary to \u00a7 IB 1.1 are controlling in the \u00a7 2B3.1 context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\">. <em>Hamilton, Elkins, </em>and <em>Roberts </em>involved knives, rather than firearms. Subsections (D) and (E) of \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) set up the same dichotomy \u2014 between \u201cbrandished, displayed, or possessed\" and \"otherwise used\" \u2014 for \u201cdangerous weapons\u201d that subsections (B) and (C) set up for firearms, so these cases are still persuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">. To the extent that <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>40 F.3d 735 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1074, 115 S.Ct. 1716, 131 L.Ed.2d 575 (1995), is inconsistent with our holding today, we decline to follow it. Although that opinion seems to reject without discussion the distinction between pointing a gun in a generally threatening manner and pointing the gun and implicitly threatening a specific victim, <em>id. </em>at 739-40, we note that the implicit threat in that case did not approach the level of the one in this case. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>20 F.3d 538 (2d Cir.1994), might also be thought to provide some support to Wooden's view. There the Second Circuit held that pointing a gun and explicit threats amounted only to brandishing, and did not rise to the level of \"otherwise using\u201d the gun. However, that case apparently involved only generalized threats, and in any event the opinion did not discuss the difference between a generalized threat and a clear threat to a specific victim. In this regard, the opinion cited <em>United States v. Roberts, supra, </em>as factually distinguishable. <em>Id. </em>at 554. As noted above, the instant case and <em>Roberts </em>are factually identical, and thus we gather the <em>Matthews </em>court would have considered the instant case also distinguishable. Moreover, the holdings in <em>Matthews </em>and <em>Gonzales </em>would seem to be in tension with the holdings in <em>United States v. Burton, </em>126 F.3d 666, 678-79 (5th Cir.1997), and <em>United States v. Seavoy, </em>995 F.2d 1414, 1422 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 954, 114 S.Ct. 407, 126 L.Ed.2d 354 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b739-18\">.For his argument that the six-level enhancement should apply only when there is physical injury caused by a use of the weapon other than discharge, Wooden relies heavily on dicta in the Supreme Court's opinion in <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993). In <em>Smith, </em>the Court confronted the meaning of the word \u201cuse\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), i.e., as a substantive element of a statutory offense. The Court briefly analogized to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2). 508 U.S. at 231-32, 113 S.Ct. at 2055. The Court said that \u201cit is perfectly reasonable to construe \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) as including uses, such as ... bludgeoning.\" <em>Id. </em>at 232, 113 S.Ct. at 2055. However, the Court did not suggest that \u201cotherwise used\" is limited to bludgeoning or infliction of physical injury. The passage from <em>Smith </em>does not speak to the issue before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
