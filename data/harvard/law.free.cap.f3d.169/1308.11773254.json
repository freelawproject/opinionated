We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-21\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Parks v. City of Warner Robins, Ga., </em>43 F.3d 609, 612-13 (11th Cir.1995). We review district court determinations under FOIA for clear error. <em>See Miscavige v. I.R.S., </em>2 F.3d 366, 367 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-22\">Having reviewed all relevant documents in the district court and the briefs of the parties and <em>amicus curiae </em>on appeal, we conclude that the district court\u2019s determination under FOIA was not clearly erroneous, and that it correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the U.S. Customs Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-23\">O\u2019Kane argues first that the U.S. Customs Service, pursuant to FOIA, should disclose the addresses of individuals whose possessions it seized because other federal agencies routinely publish names and addresses of individuals the government accuses of crimes in newspapers of general circulation. Other agencies\u2019 day-to-day practices, however, are irrelevant to a FOIA privacy exemption analysis. Instead, courts use a balancing test to determine whether an individual\u2019s privacy interest qualifies under the relevant FOIA exemption. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). In <em>F.L.R.A. v. United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number><em>Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>we held that individuals have an important privacy interest in their home address. 977 F.2d 545 (11th Cir.1992). We weigh this important interest against the public\u2019s corresponding \u201cright to know.\u201d O\u2019Kane argues that a public interest exists in promoting legal representation for violators of customs laws.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Clearly, any such interest does not outweigh individuals\u2019 important privacy interest in their home addresses. Therefore, the district court did not err when it determined that the addresses qualify for FOIA\u2019s privacy exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">O\u2019Kane also argues that the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 (Amendments) made clear that \u201ca requester may seek information from the Government for \u2018any purpose\u2019 and that it is no longer necessary that an individual request information only when that individual is interested in finding out what the Government is \u2018up to.\u2019\u201d In sum, O\u2019Kane argues that his purpose for requesting the information is irrelevant. The district court, however, correctly noted the Amendments merely clarified that electronic records are subject to FOIA; they did not narrow FOIA\u2019s privacy exclusions or invalidate the private-public interest balancing test. Finally, and perhaps alternatively, O\u2019Kane argues that we should afford a lesser degree of privacy to \u201cthose who violate the laws of the United States.\u201d The district court however, correctly noted this distinction violates the proposition that individuals have a substantial privacy interest in their criminal histories. <em>See United States Dep\u2019t of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, </em>489 U.S. 749, 767, 109 S.Ct. 1468, 103 L.Ed.2d 774 (1989). Accordingly, O\u2019Kane\u2019s last argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">Because the district court correctly rejected O\u2019Kane\u2019s contention that the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 altered the FOIA\u2019s privacy policy, and the district court did not clearly err in determining that an individual\u2019s interest in his or her home address outweighs the \u201cpublic interest\u201d O\u2019Kane asserts, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1366-6\"> O'Kane, a lawyer, wants the disclosure so that he can solicit these individuals for his law practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
