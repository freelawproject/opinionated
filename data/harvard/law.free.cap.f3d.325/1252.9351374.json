Plaintiff Thomas R. Herndon filed in state court an eleven-count class action complaint against Equitable Variable Life Insurance Company (\u201cEquitable\u201d), alleging various Georgia state law claims arising from the sale of a variable life insurance policy. Upon removal to federal court by Equitable, the district court held that the policy was a \u201ccovered security\u201d and dismissed with prejudice on the ground that SLUSA (1) makes federal courts the exclusive venue for class actions alleging state law claims in connection with the sale of \u201ccovered securities,\u201d (2) provides for removal of such state class actions to federal court, and (3) requires federal courts to dismiss such lawsuits. Herndon appeals. Neither party requested oral argument, and we agree that oral argument would not be useful in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">We hold that the district court correctly held that a variable life insurance policy is a \u201ccovered security\u201d under SLUSA and that the state law claims were \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale\u201d thereof. We therefore AFFIRM the dismissal of the removed complaint, with prejudice, there being no question that it met the statutory requirements for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">In 1996, Brent J. Savage purchased from Equitable a variable life insurance policy insuring his fifteen year old son. On the application, Savage indicated that his son had neither smoked nor used any other tobacco products for the previous twelve months. Savage later assigned that policy to the plaintiff, Thomas R. Herndon, who then, through Savage\u2019s law firm, filed a class action lawsuit in Georgia state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-9\">Although we do not address the merits of Herndon\u2019s claim, the lawsuit alleged that Equitable deliberately mis-designated Savage\u2019s son, as well as a putative class of other insureds, as a tobacco user so that it could charge higher premiums. Equitable answered that the policy\u2019s Prospectus clearly disclosed that the premiums for insureds under the age of twenty, such as Savage\u2019s son, were set <em>without </em>reference to whether the insured used tobacco. As such, Equitable argued, there was never a misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-10\">Congress passed SLUSA with the intent to make federal court the exclusive venue for class actions alleging state fraud claims in the sale of \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Congress accomplished this goal by providing for the removal of state class action lawsuits to federal court, and requiring federal courts to dismiss those lawsuits that meet certain statutory requirements. <em>See Riley v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>292 F.3d 1334, 1341 (11th Cir.2002). The <em>Riley </em>opinion summarized SLUSA\u2019s requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-11\">Under SLUSA, the removing party must show that (1) the suit is a \u201ccovered class action,\u201d (2) the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are based on state law, (3) one or more \u201ccovered securities\u201d has been purchased or sold, and (4) the defendant misrepresented or omitted a material fact <em>\u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of such security.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1251-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1342. Once the factors have been shown by the removing party, the case requires immediate dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-13\">Herndon concedes this is a \u201ccovered class action\u201d based on state law claims but argues that (1) a variable life insurance policy is not a \u201ccovered security\u201d under SLUSA, and (2) the misrepresentations and omissions in dispute were not made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>\u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of such a security.\u201d Herndon also argues that the district court improperly dismissed his case in its entirety rather than dismissing only the class action components.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">\n<em>(1) A variable life insurance policy is a \u201ccovered security\u201d under SLUSA.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">SLUSA defines a \u201ccovered security\u201d as \u201ca security issued by an investment company that is registered, or that has filed a registration statement, under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(b)(2). The Supreme Court has held that a \u201cvariable annuity\u201d is a \u201csecurity\u201d that is required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) under the Securities Act of 1933, codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77a. <em>See Securities &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>359 U.S. 65, 69-73, 79 S.Ct. 618, 3 L.Ed.2d 640 (1959). The Supreme Court has not yet decided whether a variable life insurance policy is a \u201ccovered security\u201d under SLUSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">The question here is whether a variable <em>life insurance </em>policy is a \u201ccovered security\u201d under SLUSA, an issue not previously decided by this Court but eloquently answered in the affirmative by the district court. <em>See Herndon v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y, </em>253 F.Supp.2d 1364 (S.D.Ga.2002). Other district courts are in accord with the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Araujo v. John Hancock Life Ins. Co., </em>206 F.Supp.2d 377, 382 (E.D.N.Y.2002); <em>In re Lutheran Bhd. Variable Ins. Prod. Co. Sales, </em>105 F.Supp.2d 1037, 1040 (D.Minn.2000); <em>Lasley v. New England Variable Life Ins. Co., </em>126 F.Supp.2d 1236, 1239 (N.D.Cal.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">Several circuits have tangentially decided the issue, holding that variable annuities, without the life insurance component presented in this case, are covered securities under SLUSA. <em>See Dudek v. Prudential Secs., Inc., </em>295 F.3d 875, 878 (8th Cir.2002); <em>Patenaude v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y, </em>290 F.3d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Lander v. Hartford Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co., </em>251 F.3d 101 (2d Cir.2001). In <em>Lander, </em>for example, the Second Circuit held that variable annuities, by themselves, are \u201ccovered securities\u201d under SLUSA because they are \u201csecurities\u201d and their sub-accounts are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act. <em>Id. </em>at 109. The key distinction, as argued by Appellant, is that this case, unlike <em>Lander </em>and the cases from our other sister circuits, involves a variable annuity <em>with a life insurance component. </em>We find that distinction to be inconsequential to an analysis of SLUSA\u2019s definition of \u201ccovered security.\u201d <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-10\">Both <em>Lander </em>and this case involve insurance companies who issued a variable annuity which was both required to be and was actually registered with the SEC. Both the <em>Lander </em>defendant and Equitable were also required to and did register the respective plaintiffs\u2019 individual annuity accounts with the SEC pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940. The fact that a variable life insurance policy account adds a life insurance component to the investment does not negate the fact that the statutory requirements of SLUSA have been met with regard to the annuity component of the insurance policy. As such, a variable life insurance policy is a \u201ccovered security\u201d under SLUSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-11\">Herndon\u2019s post-complaint reallocation of Savage\u2019s premium payments to a money market account is irrelevant. First, this Court is limited to reviewing allegations concerning \u201cthe time during which it is alleged that the misrepresentation, omission, or manipulative or deceptive conduct occurred_\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77p(f)(3). Second, in any event, at least one court has held money market mutual funds to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>covered securities under SLUSA. <em>See Kenneth Rothschild Trust v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, </em>199 F.Supp.2d 993, 1000 (C.D.Cal.2002). We need not decide that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">\n<em>(2) The misrepresentations and omissions in dispute were made \u201cin connection with\u201d the purchase of such a security.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">Herndon argues that the district court erred by determining that the alleged misrepresentations and omissions in dispute were not made \u201cin connection with\u201d the purchase or the sale of the variable life insurance policy to Savage. He argues that the misrepresentations were made with respect to the sale of the type of insurance policy <em>(ie., </em>a policy for a nonsmoker) and were \u201ctangential\u201d to the variable life insurance contract. This Court has recently dismissed a similar argument on SLUSA grounds, and we need not readdress it in this case. <em>See Behlen v. Merrill Lynch, </em>311 F.3d 1087, 1094 (11th Cir.2002) (rejecting argument that a broker\u2019s increased fees and commissions to an investor otherwise eligible for lower fees and commissions were incidental to and not made \u201cin connection with\u201d the purchase or sale of securities).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-9\">\n<em>(3) The district court properly dismissed the case in its entirety rather than dismissing only the class action components.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-13\">According to the record on appeal, Herndon made no argument in the district court that it improperly dismissed the complaint in its \u201centirety.\u201d This could foreclose the issue. <em>See Brown v. ITT Consumer Fin. Corp., </em>211 F.3d 1217, 1221 n. 1 (11th Cir.2000). In any event, Equitable properly points out that the amended complaint alleges <em>only </em>a class action, and does not allege an individual claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-14\">The district court\u2019s grant of Equitable\u2019s motion to dismiss based on SLUSA\u2019s preemption of the Georgia state law claims was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
