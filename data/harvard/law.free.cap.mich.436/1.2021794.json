Negotiations broke down when workers refused to agree to management demands for wage and benefit concessions equaling approximately thirty percent of the work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>ers\u2019 current wages. The workers stayed on the job for one week after the expiration of the old contract, but on September 9, the workers struck the company. The company never ceased production during the strike, operating first with the efforts of management and members of the families of company executives.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">As the strike progressed, the company gradually hired replacements. At the end of December, 1980, the company informed the replacements that the company considered them permanent; that is, they would be retained even in the event the strike was settled. On January 15, 1981, the company\u2019s attorney informed the union\u2019s chief negotiator that the striking workers had been permanently replaced. In the event the strike was settled, the workers could reapply for work and would be rehired only as openings became available. If they wished to work at Plymouth Stamping, the strikers could only do so under terms imposed by the company. Any strikers who agreed to return to Plymouth Stamping would have to accept the same terms offered the new replacement workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Upon learning of their permanent replacement, the striking workers applied for unemployment benefits. The Employment Security Commission initially denied benefits, reasoning that the workers were disqualified pursuant to the labor dispute disqualification provision of the mesa, MCL 421.29(8); MSA 17.531(8). The workers appealed to the mesc, which conducted a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">At the hearing, the company claimed that it only replaced the workers and did not \"discharge\u201d or \"terminate\u201d them. The company president testified that between January, 1981, and May, 1982, a total of thirty-seven openings occurred within the strikers\u2019 bargaining unit. The record discloses, however, that the company informed the union of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>the existence of only seven of those openings in February or March of 1981 when, while in the coffee room of the union office, the company\u2019s attorney told the union negotiator that he had seven openings he \"can offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">While the union ultimately acceded to the economic demands of the company\u2019s final proposal, the company refused the strikers\u2019 last and only demand, that the company rehire the strikers as a group, and not one at a time. Consequently, these claimants refused to apply for work at Plymouth Stamping.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">A referee found that the workers were entitled to unemployment compensation after January 15, 1981, the date on which they were notified through their union representative of their permanent replacement. The mesc Board of Review affirmed this decision as did the Wayne Circuit Court and the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>1 would also affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The facts of this case disclose the following: In the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s, Plymouth Stamping, like many other companies involved in the automotive industry, experienced difficult times. Like other companies in the industry, Plymouth Stamping responded by demanding wage and benefit concessions from its workers\u2014thirty percent cuts in wages and benefits. The wages and benefits the company offered the union actually decreased as negotiations proceeded. As the opinion for reversal aptly points out, the National Labor Relations Board found that the company was engaged in legal \"hard bargaining.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Faced with the company\u2019s demands, the workers had three choices. They could accede to the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>pany\u2019s demands (as did many workers in similar situations), they could quit, or they could strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Had the workers quit, they most likely would have been eligible for unemployment compensation. Leaving work because of substantial changes in wages or conditions of employment constitutes \"good cause attributable to the employer\u201d such that a worker will not be disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation under \u00a7 29(l)(a) of the mesa.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Copper Range Co v Unemployment Compensation Comm, </em>320 Mich 460; 31 NW2d 692 (1948); <em>Keith v Chrysler Corp, </em>390 Mich 458; 213 NW2d 147 (1973). Cf. <em>Lasher v Mueller Brass Co, </em>62 Mich App 171; 233 NW2d 513 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">However, the workers wanted to keep their jobs and hoped for a better deal, so they struck. They struck, presumably, with a clear understanding that, under state law, they would receive no unemployment compensation while on strike, while, under clear federal precedent, they could lose their jobs to permanent replacements. I do not believe they contemplated that they could both lose their jobs <em>and </em>be ineligible for unemployment compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">What employers will now understand, however, is that this Court has put them in a \"heads I win, tails you lose\u201d situation. Employers who face economic downturns now have every incentive to demand large concessions from unions in the hope of precipitating a strike. If such a labor dispute occurs, the employer can hire permanent replacements at the terms last offered the union. At that point, the company has an entirely new workforce at terms the company dictates. To the extent any of the former employees become members of the new workforce, it is only as vacancies occur and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>only according to the company\u2019s terms. After today, none of the workers whose jobs are filled by replacements will be entitled to unemployment compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">After permanently replacing the strikers, the company has effectively laid off its workforce and hired another, perhaps smaller, complement of workers willing to work at terms the company dictates. Under federal labor law, these workers have the right to decertify the union if the company asks for an election, and the replaced workers will have no rights to vote in that election if it is held twelve months after the strike began. While the workers suffer the hardships, the employer pays no costs in terms of future assessments for unemployment compensation funds so long as the striking workers refuse to become, in effect, permanent replacements themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Such a result cannot have been the intention of the Legislature when it enacted \u00a7 29(8). This provision was intended to promote state \"neutrality\u201d in labor disputes by preventing strikers from receiving benefits ultimately assessed against the struck employer. It was also intended to deny unemployment benefits to workers who voluntarily cause their unemployment. It cannot have been intended as a weapon with which employers can hire a cheaper labor force without taking the responsibility the mesa places on employers in almost all other situations\u2014the responsibility of contributing to an insurance scheme intended to insulate unemployed workers and their families from the harshest effects of involuntary unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The facts of this case are closely analogous to those presented this Court forty-two years ago in <em>Copper Range Co, supra. </em>In that case, a mining company, at the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, offered its workers a renewal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>tract at substantially lower wages, an offer which the workers refused. The miners were willing to work, but only for the wages they drew under the expired contract. Due to submarginal profitability, the mining company decided to close the mine instead of paying a higher wage. The company then challenged the workers\u2019 claims for unemployment compensation, not under the labor dispute disqualification provisions, but by charging that the workers, by refusing a new contract at reduced wages, had voluntarily left work without good cause attributable to the employer. This Court held in favor of the workers, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">To place the stamp of judicial approval upon the contentions of appellee in the instant case would be tantamount to the issuance of a notice to all employers in Michigan that, whenever they are confronted with economic loss, they can demand an abrogation of their working agreements and reduce compensation to a point unacceptable to employees, and thereby absolve themselves of the responsibilities imposed upon them by the unemployment compensation act. [320 Mich 470-471.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">I likewise refuse to condone an attempt by an employer to replace an entire workforce without taking any responsibility for the unemployment which results from those actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">By reviewing this case in light of our holding in <em>Copper Range, </em>it becomes apparent that at the heart of the Court\u2019s decision lies a proposition so anachronistic to the purposes of Michigan\u2019s employment law that it threatens the most fundamental bases of worker autonomy: job security and the rights to bargain collectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">ii \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">More than disagreeing with the result the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>reaches and the consequences of its opinion, I believe the Court\u2019s analysis is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">I approach the question presented in this appeal as one of mixed law and fact. The mesc and the trial court found as fact that these workers were \"discharged\u201d from Plymouth Stamping and therefore eligible under <em>Knight-Morley Corp v Employment Security Comm, </em>352 Mich 331; 89 NW2d 541 (1958), for benefits. Therefore, it is possible for this Court to review the mesc decision as this Court traditionally reviews the factual findings of that body, i.e., by determining whether its decision is supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence. See <em>Smith v Employment Security Comm, </em>410 Mich 231, 260-261; 301 NW2d 285 (1981); <em>Linski v Employment Security Comm, </em>358 Mich 239; 99 NW2d 582 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Although the mesc\u2019s finding of \"discharge\u201d is supported by the record, I am reluctant to view this case as presenting a question of fact. The decision in this case should not rest on whether the mesc or this Court believes permanent replacement is closer to \"discharge\u201d than it is to continuing employment; our decision should not depend on whether we believe these workers to have remained \"employees\u201d after their permanent replacement. Rather, as the opinion for reversal admits, our decision must find its authority in the intent of the Legislature. The practical reality is that permanently replaced employees are neither truly \"discharged\u201d in the same manner other unemployed workers are nor are they actually still \"employees.\u201d They fall into a special category of idled workers whose status under the mesa can only be defined by the authors of that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Although it has the power to do so, the Legislature has not made clear whether it intends to disqualify striking workers who have been perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>nently replaced from the benefits of the mesa. In the absence, of a clear pronouncement, it is the duty of this Court to construe the act as written in an effort to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s probable intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">We have a clear duty to construe this statute liberally as a remedial statute. Since the time when the mesa was but a few years old, this Court has recognized that it is a remedial statute entitled to a liberal construction. See, e.g., <em>Godsol v Unemployment Compensation Comm, </em>302 Mich 652; 5 NW2d 519 (1942); <em>Auten v Unemployment Compensation Comm, </em>310 Mich 453; 17 NW2d 249 (1945); <em>Copper Range Co v Unemployment Compensation Comm, supra. </em>\"[Mesa] was enacted in the interest of public welfare to provide for assistance to the unemployed and as such, is entitled to a liberal interpretation.\u201d <em>Godsol </em>at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Compensation is intended for all unemployed workers except those whom the Legislature clearly intended to exclude. \"[C]ourts are without power to deprive those entitled thereto of the benefits of the act, unless they are expressly precluded therefrom by its provisions.\u201d <em>Copper Range </em>at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Therefore, individuals who have lost their jobs to permanent replacements are entitled to mesa benefits in the absence of a clear legislative intent to exclude them.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Section 29(8) of the Employment Security Act, MCL 421.29(8); MSA 17.531(8) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">An individual shall be disqualified for benefits for a week in which the individual\u2019s total or partial unemployment is due to a labor dispute in active progress, or to shutdown or start-up opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>tions caused by that labor dispute, in the establishment in which the individual is or was last employed ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">This section prohibits the provision of unemployment compensation to workers who are out of work because they participate directly in a strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">However, when this Court construed this statute in 1958, it held that striking workers\u2019 disqualification under \u00a7 29(8) ends if they are \"discharged\u201d by the employer. In <em>Knight-Morley, supra, </em>we reasoned that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding of \"discharge\u201d where an employer (1) permanently replaced its striking workers, (2) removed their time cards from the time card rack, (3) canceled their group life insurance policies, and (4) published a notice in a newspaper stating that the workers \"are no longer employees of this company.\u201d <em>Knight-Morley </em>at 333. This Court held that the mesc\u2019s factual findings that the workers were discharged were amply supported by the record. We also held that, as a matter of law, this discharge ended the workers\u2019 disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">This case differs from <em>Knight-Morley, </em>however, because, although Plymouth Stamping permanently replaced the striking employees and notified them of their replacement, there is no evidence in the record regarding the fate of these workers\u2019 time cards, vacation pay, life or health benefits, or whether the strikers were still listed on the company\u2019s employment rolls. It is this lack of other evidence showing \"discharge\u201d that puts the question squarely before us: Can permanent replacement alone terminate a striking worker\u2019s disqualification under \u00a7 29(8)?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">At the heart of the mesa is the notion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own are entitled to a subsistence wage to assist them and their families in keeping body and soul together. The Legislature determined that \"[ijnvoluntary unemployment is a subject of general interest and concern which requires action by the legislature to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden which so often falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker and his family . . . .\u201d MCL 421.2; MSA 17.502.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">To achieve this monumental goal, the Legislature created a broad entitlement to unemployment benefits. Rather than identifying specific categories of workers entitled to benefits, the mesa creates an entitlement in <em>all </em>unemployed workers except workers in sixteen specific categories embodied in \u00a729.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">By examining each category of worker exempted from unemployment compensation, it becomes clear that the Legislature intended to withhold compensation from only those workers whose unemployment is <em>caused </em>by a <em>voluntary </em>act. With few exceptions, both parts of this test, the causational and the volitional, must be met to bring about disqualification. For example, an assaultive worker (assault always contemplates intentional, and, therefore, voluntary, acts) who is laid off can collect benefits <em>except </em>when his unemployment is <em>caused by </em>his assaultive behavior. MCL 421.29(l)(h); MSA 17.531(l)(h).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A worker who \"voluntarily\u201d leaves work is disqualified, but the law carefully qualifies \"voluntary\u201d as meaning \"without good cause and attributable to the employer.\u201d MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>421.29(l)(a); MSA 17.531(l)(a). A worker is disqualified for refusing to seek reemployment only when doing so \"without good cause.\u201d MCL 421.29(l)(c), (d); MSA 17.531(l)(c), (d). The act creates only one explicit exception to the causational test. In \u00a7 29(l)(m), the law provides that a worker who steals after notification of a pending layoff may be disqualified. This subsection is thus the only portion of the act which would explicitly allow disqualification for a voluntary act which did not actually \"cause\u201d unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The language of \u00a729(8), the.labor dispute disqualification provision, similarly contemplates a disqualification only for unemployment voluntarily caused by the worker. The statute\u2019s language requires a volitional test when it states \"[a]n individual shall not be disqualified under this subsection if the individual is not directly involved in the dispute.\u201d The causational element is embodied in the words \"due <em>to </em>a labor dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Therefore, I disagree with the dicta presented in this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Smith, supra, </em>that the labor dispute disqualification is an exception to the general rule that grants relief for involuntary unemployment. See <em>Smith </em>at 252-254. This Court is under a firm duty imposed by the rules of statutory construction to construe this statute so as to follow its general intent except where the Legislature has clearly created an exception through unambiguous language. Thus, I reiterate the call raised by Justice Blair Moody\u2019s dissenting opinion in Smith<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2014that we should never interpret a section of a statute without constant reference to the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Applying \u00a729(8) to the facts of this case, it is undisputed that the workers who struck Plymouth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Stamping in September, 1980, were initially disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation. Their unemployment was \"due to a labor dispute\u201d in which they were \"directly involved.\u201d In January of 1981, however, that situation changed. When the company permanently replaced the workers, their unemployment was no longer voluntary. Nor did a labor dispute remain the cause of their unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The workers\u2019 unemployment was no longer voluntary because, once permanently replaced, they had no jobs away from which they voluntarily chose to stay. Their jobs ceased to exist. They were no longer \"employees\u201d of Plymouth Stamping as that term is generally defined.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Were they unconditionally to seek reemployment at Plymouth Stamping, they would be hired only as openings occurred. They would begin work under a new contract. In all practical aspects, these workers could only obtain work at Plymouth Stamping as new employees. The only aspect of the replaced workers\u2019 status that set them apart from other persons who might apply for work at Plymouth Stamping was the fact that these workers were first in line for available employment, a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>recognized in <em>Laidlaw Corp v NLRB, </em>414 F2d 99 (CA 7, 1969), cert den 397 US 920 (1970). They were no more \"voluntarily\u201d unemployed from Plymouth Stamping than they were \"voluntarily\u201d unemployed from any other business in the area where they were qualified to work and could apply-</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Indeed, the mesa disqualifies workers who voluntarily refuse to seek reemployment at their former workplace, but only when those workers refuse \"without good cause.\u201d Section 29(l)(d). Yet, the law recognizes that a worker may have \"good cause\u201d for refusal to accept reemployment when that reemployment would pay substantially less than the workers\u2019 former wage\u2014as did the employment offered the workers here. MCL 421.29(7)(b); MSA 17.531(7)(b). See <em>Keith v Chrysler Corp, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Lasher v Mueller Brass Co, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The refusal of the individual strikers here to break ranks with the union and apply for any available work does not make their unemployment \"voluntary\u201d under clear terms of \u00a7 29(7)(a) of the act. In fact, the Legislature clearly prohibits this Court from denying benefits because an individual refused to cross a picket line or break union ranks in an effort to secure work.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">Work shall not be considered suitable <em>and bene\u00f1ts shall not be denied under this act </em>to an otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions: (a) if the position offered is vacant due directly to a . . . labor dispute . . . [or] (c) if as a condition of being employed, the individual would be required to join a company union <em>or to resign from </em>or refrain from joining a <em>bona \u00f1de labor organization. </em>[MCL 421.29(7); MSA 17.531(7). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">A worker is still involuntarily unemployed and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>therefore, entitled to benefits, even in situations where there is work available, if the worker cannot accept that work without crossing a picket line or terminating union membership. Since the union adopted a position that none of these claimants would work unless the company gave work to each of them, it is apparent that none could accept any of the thirty-seven supposed vacancies without leaving the union.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Their failure to leave the union and apply for work at Plymouth Stamping does not make their unemployment \"voluntary\u201d as a matter of fact or as a matter of law. Benefits \"shall not be denied\u201d for their failure to apply for available work at Plymouth Stamping.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Just as the replaced workers\u2019 unemployment ceased being voluntary, under the \"substantial contributing cause\u201d formula announced in <em>Smith </em>at 261, the strike ceased to be the \"cause\u201d of unemployment after permanent replacements filled the jobs. The hiring of replacements was an intervening event which cut off the dispute as the cause of the unemployment. At the moment it replaced the workers, the company caused their unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">A unanimous Supreme Court of California recognized this break in causation in <em>Ruberoid Co v California Unemployment Ins Appeals Bd, </em>59 Cal 2d 73, 81; 27 Cal Rptr 878; 378 P2d 102 (1963), when it dealt with the exact issue now before this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An analogy used in that court\u2019s opinion is helpful here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">[T]he prospective theatergoer who hesitates to purchase a ticket no longer retains an option to attend the performance once the management has sold all the seats. The occupancy of the theater destroys the theatergoer\u2019s possibility of exercising volition as to attending the performance. The cause of his nonattendance becomes, at that point, the full occupancy of the theater rather than the failure to buy a ticket. The union member who debates whether he should participate in the picketing or cross the picket line exercises no more effective choice than the theatergoer. Even if the worker were to decide to abandon the picketing or cross the line, the opportunity for effective decision or for realistic volition on his part is foreclosed as of the time the employer replaces him with another worker and terminates their relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Although it might be argued that the strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>remained a substantial contributing cause of the workers\u2019 unemployment, an honest evaluation of the practical realities of the workers\u2019 situation as of January, 1981, shows that <em>the </em>substantial contributing cause of their unemployment was the fact that their jobs <em>ceased to exist. </em>Because the workers no longer voluntarily caused their unemployment after they had been permanently replaced, they were eligible for unemployment compensation. So held the mesc, the circuit court, and the Court of Appeals. So would I also hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The most fundamental flaw in the Court\u2019s reasoning lies in the importance it places on the union\u2019s continuing demand that the permanently replaced strikers take jobs at Plymouth Stamping only as a group. The opinion for reversal reasons that this demand \"continued the labor dispute\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and caused the unemployment of any worker qualified to fill any existing vacancy. However, the Court admits that the union\u2019s demand did not cause the unemployment of any worker for whom a vacancy did not exist. \"Had the union . . . [been] willing to return to work, those strikers whose positions were filled by permanent replacements would undoubtedly have been entitled to unemployment compensation until such time that vacancies become available.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 51. The Court\u2019s remand order contemplates that any replaced worker for whom a vacancy was unavailable is entitled to compensation for that period when a vacancy did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">By making this argument, the Court has recast the analysis regarding the causation of the strik<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ers\u2019 unemployment in a very significant manner. The Court admits that after permanent replacement the cause of these workers\u2019 unemployment was no longer the original \"labor dispute,\u201d but the workers\u2019 refusal to come back to work, one at a time, to fill existing vacancies. While the Court is correct that a permanently replaced worker can be disqualified for refusing to apply for available work, it errs when it measures such a refusal under \u00a7 29(8) of the mesa, rather than the other subsections of \u00a7 29 that deal explicitly with the duty of an unemployed worker to apply for or accept available work.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">By conditioning eligibility for unemployment compensation on the nonexistence of a vacancy a particular worker was qualified to fill, the Court posits a duty on the part of permanently replaced workers unconditionally to apply for work at their former place of employment as a precondition for eligibility for unemployment compensation. In creating this duty, the Court completely ignores the language of the mesa wherein the Legislature, the body with plenary authority to make law in this area, has delineated the duty of an unemployed worker to apply for and accept available work. The Legislature has indicated that workers <em>do not </em>have a duty to apply for available work unconditionally, but that workers have a duty to apply for and accept only \"suitable work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In \u00a7\u00a7 29(l)(c) and 29(l)(e), the mesa provides that an individual is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits when that individual \"[fjailed without good cause to apply for available <em>suitable </em>work of which the individual was notified\u201d or \"[f]ailed without good cause to accept <em>suitable </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>work when offered the individual . . <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Assuming that, on remand, the company can prove that the permanently replaced workers had been notified of any available work at Plymouth Stamping,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> under the language of \u00a7 29(l)(c) and \u00a7 29(l)(e), they are not disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits absent some indication that the available employment was also \"suitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The suitability of available work is determined under \u00a7\u00a7 29(6) and 29(7) of the mesa. The language of these subsections indicates that their provisions must be used to measure the suitability of <em>any </em>work the nonacceptance of which affects an individual\u2019s qualification to receive unemployment benefits. Section 29(6) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">In determining whether or not work is suitable for an individual, the commission <em>shall consider </em>the degree of risk involved to the individual\u2019s health, safety, and morals, the individual\u2019s physical fitness and prior training, the individual\u2019s experience and prior earnings, the individual\u2019s length of unemployment and prospects for securing local work in the individual\u2019s customary occupation, and the distance of the available work from the individual\u2019s residence. [MCL 421.29(6); MSA 17.531(6). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Section 29(7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">Work <em>shall not be considered suitable </em>and bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>fits <em>shall not be denied </em>under this act to an otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions: (a) if the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute; (b) if the remuneration, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality; (c) if as a condition of being employed, the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining a bona fide labor organization. [MCL 421.29(7); MSA 17.531(7). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Section 29(6) establishes the factors that the unemployment compensation commission \"shall\u201d consider when determining whether an offer of work is \"suitable,\u201d so that its refusal would subject an individual to disqualification. Section 29(7), on the other hand, establishes three mandatory, minimum substantive requirements which all new work must meet in order to be \"suitable\u201d under the act. As the Precedent Manual used by mesc hearing referees points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">Each of the three (3) standards above are <em>minimum </em>standards. It is mandatory that these standards be considered in all cases of job offers or referrals to work. This imposes a duty on the mesc staff to assure themselves that the work offered meets these minimum standards before denying a claimant benefits if he refuses to accept such new work, regardless of whether he raises the issue himself. [Emphasis in original.][<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Thus, the Court errs by ordering a remand to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>determine when work became available to each worker without also ordering a determination regarding whether any available work was also \"suitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">At first blush, it appears that \u00a7 29(7) directly contradicts \u00a7 29(8) since they both arguably apply to situations where a labor dispute \"causes\u201d unemployment. Section 29(8) disqualifies claimants who have left work because of a labor dispute; \u00a7 29(7) specifically forbids the disqualification of those who refuse to take work at a struck plant. A closer look at the principles behind \u00a7 29(7), however, reveals that it is meant to apply in a slightly different situation from that in which \u00a7 29(8) applies. While \u00a7 29(8) applies to situations in which workers temporarily leave work because of a strike and refuse to go back to their jobs at the struck establishment,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u00a7 29(7) entitles workers to refuse as unsuitable \"new work\u201d with any employer when that work falls into any of three categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Section 29(7) of the mesa contains \"labor standards\u201d provisions which Congress mandated all state unemployment compensation schemes should have in order to qualify employers for federal unemployment tax credit. It has been part of the mesa since its enactment and copies language mandated by the federal Social Security Act of 1935. The intent of Congress in requiring states to enact labor standards provisions was the protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>tion of workers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The labor standards provisions prevent employers from using unemployment compensation entitlements to depress wage rates or other working conditions substantially below those prevailing for similar work in the locality or to break strikes or unions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">It appears that \u00a7 29(7) has been construed in only a handful of published opinions. One of those opinions, <em>Anderson v Top O\u2019Michigan Rural Electric Co, </em>118 Mich App 275; 324 NW2d 603 (1982), illustrates its applicability to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In <em>Anderson, </em>the claimants were line trade employees and field technicians. Clerical workers, members of the same union in another bargaining unit, called a strike, and the claimants followed their union\u2019s instruction and honored the clerical workers\u2019 picket line, in violation of a no-strike provision in their contract. They were initially disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation under \u00a7 29(8), but during the course of the strike, they began working for other companies which subsequently laid them off. After their layoff from their subsequent employment, the workers were pronounced eligible for unemployment benefits.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Upon learning of the removal of the claimants\u2019 disqualification, Top O\u2019Michigan sent the claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ants letters offering them their old jobs. The claimants refused because the union\u2019s picket line remained. The employer then challenged the claimant\u2019s eligibility for compensation under \u00a7 29(l)(e) of the act, charging the claimants with refusing an offer of suitable work and noting that the union\u2019s refusal to allow these claimants to cross a picket line established by workers in another bargaining unit violated the no-strike provisions in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The Court of Appeals upheld an award of benefits, citing \u00a7 29(7), and rejecting Top O\u2019Michigan\u2019s argument that the section did not apply because the offer was not an offer of \"new work,\u201d but, rather, an offer of their old jobs under the same terms and conditions. The court held that the claimants\u2019 disqualification ended upon their brief employment elsewhere and their renewed eligibility for unemployment benefits did not terminate when they refused specific offers of employment at exactly the same terms. They were still eligible precisely because a labor dispute caused their failure to accept available work. In other words, the court recognized that the Legislature did not create a duty to cross a picket line in order to receive unemployment compensation. Neither did the Legislature create a duty in the union to remove that picket line to enable the workers to take their old jobs back, even where the picket line is established in violation of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Of course, the applicability of \u00a7 29(7) to this case depends upon a determination that any work available at Plymouth Stamping was \"new work.\u201d To answer that question, I look to cases in which the labor standards provisions were used to evaluate employment offered to workers who were on indefinite layoff status before being recalled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>take jobs at their struck former employers. The status of indefinitely laid-off workers is directly analogous to that of permanently replaced workers. In both situations, the workers are unemployed with no indication of whether or when they might be recalled, and both classes of workers have rights to be recalled first when vacancies occur.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">In <em>Campos v California Employment Development Dep\u2019t, </em>132 Cal App 3d 961; 183 Cal Rptr 637 (1982), the California Court of Appeals addressed the question whether workers on indefinite layoff are disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits when they refuse to accept recall offers in the course of a trade dispute. In that case, claimants, seasonal workers in food processing plants, were initially denied unemployment benefits when they refused to cross picket lines established by their union when recalled to work from indefinite layoff status. The California Court of Appeals held that the workers were not disqualified on the basis of a labor dispute disqualification provision because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the labor standards provision.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court reasoned that the employer\u2019s recall notice constituted an offer of \"new work\u201d within the meaning of the strike-breaker provision, because it was an offer of a new contract of employment, especially since the workers had no contractual right to recall within any specified time period and because the previous employment relationship was terminated prior to recall.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Although <em>Campos </em>is clearly not binding upon this Court, I find its analysis compelling, especially in light of the reliance the California court placed on federal authority. The court noted that because strike-breaker provisions of the unemployment insurance statutes are mandated by federal statute, interpretations of the federal statute by federal agencies such as the Department of Labor are entitled to great weight. See <em>Brennan v Owensboro-Daviess Co Hosp, </em>523 F2d 1013 (CA 6, 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The California court cited the Department of Labor\u2019s Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 984 (1968), in which the Secretary of Labor considered the application of the term \"new work\u201d under the federal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 USC 3304(a)(5)(B).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The program letter states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\"[A]n offer of new work includes ... an offer of re-employment to an unemployed individual by his last (or any other) employer with whom he does not have a contract of employment at the time the offer is made. . . . The question is whether the offer of re-employment is an offer of a new contract of employment. . . . An indefinite layoff, that is a layoff for an indefinite period with no fixed or determined date of recall, is the equivalent of a discharge.\u201d . . . \"[I]f the phrase 'new work\u2019 were limited to work with an employer for whom the individual has never worked, it is plain that the purpose of section 3304(a)(5) would be largely nullified. It can make no difference, insofar as that purpose is concerned, that the unemployed worker is offered re-employment by his former employer rather than re-employment by one in whose employ he has never been. . . . The question is whether the offer of re-employment is an offer of a new contract of employment.\u201d <em>[Campos </em>at 968.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">I agree with the California Court of Appeals that the interpretation of the Department of Labor is entitled to great weight, particularly since that department is under Congressional mandate to ensure that all states\u2019 unemployment schemes contain labor standards provisions in order to qualify employers for federal unemployment tax credit. See 26 USC 3304(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The interpretation of \u00a7 29(7) by the mesc Board of Review is also entitled to some weight in our analysis since it is that body whose job it is to interpret and apply the provisions of the mesa. The Board of Review interpreted \u00a7 29(7) in <em>Wells v Detroit Coil Co, </em>B76-2593-53446 through B76-259453457 (1978), when it ruled that indefinitely laid-off workers were not disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation when they refused to answer recall notices at their struck former em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ployer. The claimants were initially unemployed for lack of work, and their names were on a seniority list for recall to vacancies if and when they might occur. During the period they were laid off, the workers\u2019 union struck the plant, at which time the company sent each laid-off worker a notice to report to work the following day. The plant manager testified that all recalled workers who reported for work would have been assigned work within their job classifications. These claimants, however, refused to report. The employer challenged the claimants\u2019 continued qualification for unemployment benefits under \u00a7 29(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The Board of Review determined that the claimants were entitled to refuse to return to work on the authority of \u00a7 29(7), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">It would appear that the question of whether or not the claimants should be disqualified under the labor dispute provisions of Section 29(8)(a) of the Act is not properly involved in these matters .... <em>[Wells </em>at 1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The board noted that the employer admitted that the vacancies to which the claimants were recalled existed only because of the strike and for that reason held, citing \u00a7 29(7), that \"benefits cannot be denied under the Act to these claimants for refusing to accept work offered under the conditions established by this record.\u201d <em>Wells </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Assuming the opinion for reversal is correct, and the cause of the permanently replaced workers\u2019 unemployment was their refusal to take vacant jobs at the plant they struck, their situation is directly analogous to the situations of the indefinitely laid-off workers in <em>Top O\u2019Michigan, Campos, </em>and <em>Wells. </em>They were workers without jobs but with seniority rights to existing vacancies which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>they refused to exercise because of a labor dispute. They refused new work at Plymouth Stamping, work under a new contract with new terms and conditions. Their refusal to take the work, therefore, must be evaluated under \u00a7 29(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">There are numerous reasons why the vacancies at Plymouth Stamping might not constitute \"suitable work\u201d under \u00a7 29(7). The work might be considered vacant \"due directly to\u201d a labor dispute under \u00a7 29(7)(a). Or, to take the jobs, the workers might have been forced to resign from their union, running afoul of \u00a7 29(7)(c).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Similarly, the terms and conditions of the work might have been \"substantially less favorable\u201d than those prevailing for similar work in the Plymouth area at the time under \u00a7 29(7)(b), particularly given the record evidence that the terms offered the replacements included wages and benefits worth only two-thirds of that available under the previous contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We cannot make these determinations on the record before us. However, I believe that, since the Court believes it is necessary to remand this case for a determination regarding the availability of work, it is also necessary for the mesc to determine whether any work that was available was also suitable. The mandatory language of \u00a7 29(7) requires it.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Even were I to agree that a remand was prudent today to make factual findings regarding events nearly a decade old, I do not believe a remand is necessary because I do not believe the issue regarding a permanently replaced worker\u2019s duty to apply for work with a former employer is properly before this Court. The employer raised a challenge to the claimants\u2019 eligibility for unemployment compensation under the labor dispute disqualifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>tion of \u00a7 29(8) and did not charge under \u00a7\u00a7 29(l)(c) and (e) that the workers refused suitable work. As stated in parts i-iii above, I believe the labor dispute disqualification ends upon a striker\u2019s permanent replacement. While I agree with the Court that a permanently replaced worker could again be disqualified for refusing to apply for or accept available suitable work, that disqualification would occur under \u00a7\u00a7 29(l)(c) and 29(l)(e) of the act, and the employer did not challenge the workers\u2019 eligibility under those sections. The employer has the burden of proving disqualification, <em>Michigan Tool Co v Employment Security </em>Comm, 346 Mich 673; 78 NW2d 571 (1956), and I do not believe the employer has sustained that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Apart from the Court\u2019s failure to deal with \u00a7 29(7), it errs in another way when it disqualifies the workers because of their refusal to apply individually for work at Plymouth Stamping. By conditioning eligibility for compensation on the nonexistence of a vacancy that a worker could have filled, the Court creates a duty on the part of permanently replaced workers to become, themselves, permanent replacements. In other words, the Court disqualifies these individual workers because of their union\u2019s collective decision to demand group reinstatement. In effect, the Court disqualifies any workers who declined to accept work because of their refusal to cease acting as a union.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">It is far from clear that the Legislature intended to create a duty on behalf of the union to drop a demand for group reinstatement as a precondition for its member\u2019s receipt of unemployment benefits. Given the basic premise that the reason for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>union\u2019s existence is to enable workers to act collectively, it is untenable to conclude that the union <em>could </em>decide to apply for work that initially would be granted only a minority of its membership, absent any guarantees that the majority would be hired in the near future. To create such a duty in the union is to force the union to abandon collective action, to cease being a union.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Furthermore, there are serious doubts that a union could have dropped its demand for group recall without violating federal labor law. In order for the union to have accepted the seven openings \"offered\u201d the union in March, or to have asked to fill available vacancies at any other time, the union would have gained a benefit for only a minority within the bargaining unit. Such an action would have opened the union to charges that it violated federal law by failing to fulfill its duty of fair representation. Cf. <em>O\u2019Neill v Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, </em>886 F2d 1438 (CA 5, 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The opinion for reversal places great emphasis on the fact that the union, for a brief period, capitulated to the company\u2019s demand that the workers return only as vacancies became available before changing its position and demanding again that the workers be rehired as a group. There is nothing in the record, however, to indicate the reason for the union\u2019s change in position. One can only surmise that the union reaffirmed its demand that the workers be rehired as a group for one, or both, of two reasons. Either the union realized that it could not obey its mandate to bargain for the benefit of <em>all </em>the workers by agreeing to the reemployment of only a minority of its members, or the issue was put to a vote among the strikers and a majority decided that it would not agree to a term that would benefit only a minority. In either situation, the hands of the union negotiator were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tied, and he was incapable of doing that which the majority would require of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Finally, I write separately to urge the Legislature to take action in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The Legislature has plenary power to fix entitlements to unemployment compensation. The United States Supreme Court held that states are free to set entitlements to unemployment compensation, even in the context of a labor dispute, without intruding on the power of Congress to enact federal labor laws. <em>New York Telephone Co v New York Dep\u2019t of Labor, supra. </em>The Legislature is free to grant or deny unemployment compensation to striking workers who have been permanently replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">I urge the Legislature to make its intent in this area explicit because of the extreme importance this issue has for the working men and women of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">As of January, 1981, the substantial contributing cause of the workers\u2019 unemployment was the fact that their jobs ceased to exist. Because the workers no longer voluntarily caused their unemployment after they had been permanently replaced, they were eligible for unemployment compensation. To the extent the workers\u2019 refusal to apply for work at Plymouth Stamping after their replacement caused their unemployment, they cannot be disqualified absent a finding that they refused to apply for available work that was suitable under \u00a7\u00a7 29(6) and 29(7) of the mesa. I would affirm the decisions of the mesc, the circuit court, and the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>While the Court\u2019s order in this case does not instruct the mesc to determine the suitability of any work found to be available, I note that the order does not foreclose this possibility. Justice Levin\u2019s opinion, in which the opinion for reversal concurs, specifically allows parties on remand to \"develop a factual record respecting other bases on which the claimants are, or are not, eligible for benefits.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 46. Thus, if the workers can establish on remand that any vacancies at Plymouth Stamping were \"due directly to a labor dispute,\u201d or offered wages or benefits \"substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality,\u201d or that accepting the work would require resignation from their union, then they can argue to the mesc that \"benefits shall not be denied\u201d them under \u00a7 29(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Boyle, J. I concur in Justice Archer\u2019s conclusion, stated in parts iii(a) and (c) of his opinion for affirmance, that the labor dispute disqualification provision of the Michigan Employment Security Act, MCL 421.29(8); MSA 17.531(8), no longer applied to the claimants once they were informed that they had been permanently replaced. I would hold that permanent replacement severs the causal connection between the strike and the unemployment, and thereby terminates the labor dispute disqualification. I write separately to respond to specific criticism aimed at my opinion and to clarify my view with regard to other questions raised by the several opinions filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Both parties agree that the claimants <em>were </em>permanently replaced, and the referee, the circuit court, and the Court of Appeals all so held. All lower bodies and courts implicitly or expressly held that the employer failed to carry the burden of proof regarding disqualification, and no party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>this proceeding has argued at any level, including before this Court, that these employees will not be permanently replaced. Both parties and all amici curiae have also structured the question in this case in the simplest terms possible, asking only whether such permanent replacement removed the disqualification under \u00a7 29(8). Like Justice Archer, I would answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The fundamental assumption of the labor dispute disqualification provision is that there exists a job from which the striking employee has voluntarily absented himself because of a labor dispute and to which he will return at the end of that dispute. When, however, the striking employee is notified that his position has been filled\u2014that he has been permanently replaced by another employee\u2014that assumption no longer obtains. In the language of the statute, once the striker has been permanently replaced, his unemployment ceases to be \"due to\u201d the strike. At that juncture, the <em>only </em>\"substantial contributing cause,\u201d <em>Baker v General Motors Corp, </em>409 Mich 639, 660; 297 NW2d 387 (1980), of the striker\u2019s unemployment is his permanent replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The employer in this case makes much of its \"offer\u201d during negotiations to allow the strikers to return to work as openings became available.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the employer, that offer, and its subsequent refusal by the union, which demanded the immediate return of all of the employees to their former positions should an agreement be reached, kept the labor dispute alive and required the continued application of the disqualification provision. I disagree. In my view, an employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>enjoys the protection of \u00a7 29(8) only so long as it does not act to alter the employment relation. Permanently replacing an employee disturbs the status quo of that relation and destroys both the policy considerations and the fundamental underlying assumption behind the disqualification. Section 29(8), therefore, ceased to control this case when the employer notified the strikers that they had been permanently replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">In my view, it is inappropriate given the parties\u2019 presentation of the issue before this Court, to address the question whether some other provision may bar the claimants\u2019 recovery. In particular, I do not believe that the suitability of the \"offered\u201d employment is before this Court. MCL 421.29(l)(d), (e); MSA 17.531(l)(d), (e). While the employer did argue that the union turned down offered work, it made that argument only in the context of \u00a7 29(8), as evidence that there was an ongoing labor dispute. At no time did the employer argue that its offer disqualified the claimants from receiving benefits under another section of mesa. The failure to make that argument is understandable, since it is debatable whether the employer proved such an offer during the proceedings below. Thus, I would leave to another day when the issues have been raised below and briefed and argued here the question whether \u00a7 29(8) is resurrected as a bar because of an employee\u2019s refusal of a specific offer of a job until all striking employees are rehired as a group (as well as other issues arguably apposite to that question).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Justice Brickley contends that the \"heart of the problem\u201d in this case is the lower courts\u2019 failure to recognize the \"legal distinction\u201d between a discharge and a permanent replacement. <em>Post, </em>p 53. He attempts to distinguish cases from this and other jurisdictions finding that permanent replace<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ment removes the disqualification, such as <em>Knight-Morley Corp v Employment Security Comm, </em>352 Mich 331; 89 NW2d 541 (1958), <em>Baugh v United Telephone Co, </em>54 Ohio St 2d 419; 377 NE2d 766 (1978), and <em>Brannan Sand &amp; Gravel v Industrial Claim Appeals Office of Colorado, </em>762 P2d 771 (Colo App, 1988), on the ground that they are discharge or \"replacement 'plus\u2019 \u201d cases. <em>Post, </em>p 57. Yet, whether the employer intended to discharge or merely replace the striking employees is irrelevant to our resolution of this case. It is the fact of permanent replacement, not the particular intent of the employer, that destroys the underlying assumption behind the labor dispute disqualification and thereby prevents its application to the replaced striker.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Justice Brickley contends that we should not place too much emphasis on the term \"permanent replacement.\u201d The act of permanent replacement does not, Justice Brickley states <em>(post, </em>p 55, n 9), \"inexorably signify] that no positions exist or will ever become available for displaced strikers.\u201d To so conclude ignores the \"labor law meaning of permanent replacement which mandates preferential hiring rights . . . .\u201d According to Justice Brickley, a rule which recognizes that the fact of permanent replacement severs the causal connection between the unemployment and the labor dispute would work unimaginable results, such as ninety-nine out of one hundred striking workers, who had been permanently replaced but subsequently offered positions, receiving benefits so long as the one remaining worker was without such an offer._</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Aside from the fact that the employer never proved in this case which plaintiffs, if any, were offered reinstatement, it must be pointed out that it is the converse of Justice Brickley\u2019s hypothetical case that is true under his formulation of the rule. To state the extrapolated proposition as Justice Brickley would apparently conclude, ninety-nine out of one hundred workers would be ineligible for compensation because one had arguably declined employment. In this case, that means that nine of sixteen employees whose jobs were \"gone\u201d by way of permanent replacement are denied compensation even though their unemployment is caused by their employer\u2019s having permanently replaced them. Thus, Justice Brickley would apparently require that if there is any job to which an employee could arguably return, the strike must be abandoned as a condition for the labor dispute disqualification to become inoperative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Unlike Justice Brickley, I do not believe that the distinction between discharge and permanent replacement has been lost at any level in this dispute. Rather, it is the opinion for reversal that fails to recognize the most significant factual and legal distinction in this case: that which exists between the hiring of temporary replacements to fill the striking employees\u2019 positions during the course of the labor dispute and the hiring of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>permanent replacements to fill positions that the strikers, in all probability, will never be asked to fill again themselves. It is the distinction between temporary and permanent replacement that the striking employee is likely to consider tangible and real, not the distinction between permanent replacement and discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">While Justice Brickley complains that too much emphasis is placed in this opinion on the words \"permanent replacement,\u201d the fact is that his opinion places <em>no </em>emphasis on the reality those words describe in most cases. He would, in effect, hold that an employer\u2019s decision to depart from the usual practice of hiring temporary replacements for the duration of the strike is of no consequence. I cannot agree that there is no practical difference, even given the \"labor law meaning\u201d of the terms, between temporary and permanent replacement, for purposes of receiving unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Finally, I wish to make clear what may otherwise be obscured by the three seemingly divergent opinions in this case. Four justices agree clearly that any striker who is permanently replaced is thereby entitled to benefits from that time forward unless and until some succeeding event again renders the labor dispute a substantial contributing cause of the unemployment. A majority of this Court, in three separate opinions, answers the question upon which we granted leave in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Thus, I fully concur in all of Justice Levin\u2019s opinion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> except the result of remand. If there is a paucity of record evidence, it should be outcome-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>determinative depending on who has the burden of proof. Here the employer failed to prove which of the sixteen employees it would have reinstated to any specific job.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Because I believe it is neither necessary nor prudent to remand for development of a record which would attempt reconstruction of events that occurred ten years ago, I would prefer to affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals. A majority of the Court having agreed to remand, I agree nonetheless with Justice Archer that all issues may be reopened including whether (after permanent replacement entitling a worker to unemployment compensation) a worker\u2019s refusal to return to work upon the offer of a specific job is a disqualifying condition exempted by \u00a7 29(7).</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-5\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b145-6\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ala\">The Court granted leave to appeal \"[l]imited to the issue whether the employee-claimants, who were engaged in a strike against their employer, were disqualified for unemployment benefits pursuant to the labor dispute provisions of \u00a7 29(8) of the Employment Security Act, MCL 421.29(8); MSA 17.531(8), when they were permanently replaced during the course of the strike.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">We all agree that resolution of that issue depends on whether \"a labor dispute in active progress\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was a \"substantial contributing cause\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the claimants\u2019 unemployment.

This case presents us with the issue whether the Michigan Employment Security Act\u2019s labor dispute disqualification provisions preclude permanently replaced economic strikers from receiving unemployment benefits.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An mesc referee and the mesc Board of Review determined the claimant-appellee strikers eligible for benefits from the date the employer hired permanent replacements. The Wayne Circuit Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed the board\u2019s decision as supported by competent evidence and not contrary to law. We would reverse because the lower courts based their decisions on legally erroneous analyses of the facts presented. We would hold that where, as in the instant case, the facts presented indicate that economic strikers decline to accept a limited number of vacancies offered by an employer, and as a condition of ending the strike demand immediate reinstatement of all strikers, all such strikers remain dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>qualified from receiving unemployment benefits due to the continuance of a labor dispute in active progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The claimant-appellees in this case, all production employees of Plymouth Stamping, had a contract with employer Plymouth Stamping due to expire on September 1, 1980. The parties began negotiations over wages and other terms of employment in August, 1980. A local branch of the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America represented the employees for collective bargaining. Despite negotiations, the parties failed to reach an agreement by the expiration date, and the employees went on strike on September 9, 1980. Although the union and the employer continued to negotiate throughout the strike, the parties could not reach an agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The company continued production during the strike, initially by using management personnel, relatives, and friends, subsequently by hiring replacements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">During negotiations on January 15, 1981, the employer\u2019s attorney announced that the company considered the replacements hired during the strike permanent employees. The company reaffirmed its position regarding the permanent sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>tus of the replacement employees during continuing negotiations on February 26, 1981. The employer also advised the union of seven openings the sixteen strikers could immediately fill if the union accepted the employer\u2019s latest contract offer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The company formalized this position in a written proposal submitted on March 12, 1981.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The union initially rejected the company\u2019s proposal on the retention of the permanent replacements. The union advocated the position that no strikers would return as long as any replacements worked for the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The union amended this position by a letter to the company on September 15, 1981. The union\u2019s letter expressed a willingness to return unconditionally to work pending continued negotiations. However, during negotiations on October 2, 1981, the union\u2019s representative repudiated the September 15 letter. The representative indicated that the strikers would not unconditionally return to work. Instead, the union\u2019s position remained that the strikers would only return as a group after the company fired or laid off all replacements.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The employee-claimants applied for unemploy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>ment benefits. The Michigan Employment Security Commission initially denied them unemployment benefits on the basis of MCL 421.29(8); MSA 17.531(8), and they appealed. An mesc referee reversed this initial administrative decision after an evidentiary hearing in May, 1982. The referee, relying on <em>Knight-Morley Corp v Employment Security Comm, </em>352 Mich 331; 89 NW2d 541 (1958), and <em>Intertown Corp v Unemployment Compensation Comm, </em>328 Mich 363; 43 NW2d 915 (1950), held that the evidence indicated that the strikers \"were terminated at least as of January 15, 1981, when according to the claimants they were so [informed] by . . . the negotiator for that employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The mesc Board of Review affirmed the referee\u2019s decision in a two-to-one decision mailed in January, 1985. Board member Hall stated that the employer\u2019s hiring of permanent replacements combined with its failure to present evidence that the strikers remained on its employment rolls or that the employer retained their insurance coverage indicated that the employer no longer considered the strikers its employees. Board member Hogan, concurring, stated simply his \"opinion that the Referee\u2019s decision represents a proper application of the law to the facts and should be affirmed.\u201d Board member Carter, dissenting, disagreed with the board\u2019s decision on three grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">First, Carter noted that under federal labor law, permanent replacement of striking employees does not equal discharge. An employer may lawfully replace economic strikers and retain the replacements when the strike ends. Second, Carter cited an unpublished Court of Appeals opinion <em>Trombly v St Francis Hosp, </em>decided September 20, 1983 (Docket No. 64505), for the proposition that notice of permanent replacement in itself does not consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>tute discharge of strikers. Third, Carter distinguished the cases relied on by the majority, <em>Inter-town Corp v UCC </em>and <em>Knight-Morley Corp, supra. </em>In Carter\u2019s view a labor dispute constituted the substantial contributing cause of the strikers unemployment and \"said labor dispute had not terminated at least through the date of the Referee\u2019s hearing in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The Wayne Circuit Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed the board\u2019s decision entitling the claimant-appellants to unemployment benefits. Also relying on <em>Knight-Morley Corp, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals held that \"[although strikers should be disqualified from receiving benefits during a strike even if the employer hires replacements, the disqualification should end when and if the employer announces that the replacements will be kept permanently.\u201d 168 Mich App 21, 32; 424 NW2d 530 (1988). Plymouth Stamping appeals the award of benefits to the claimant-appellee strikers.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The Employment Security Act reflects a primary legislative purpose of protecting wage earners against the evils incident to involuntary unemployment. <em>Renown Stove Co v Unemployment Compensation Comm, </em>328 Mich 436, 440; 44 NW2d 1 (1950). However, the labor dispute disqualification provisions of the Employment Security Act also enunciate an explicit legislative policy preference: denial of compensation for employees unemployed due to their direct participation in an active labor dispute. For better or worse, this Court may not superimpose our own policy preferences on a legislative scheme evincing a clear enactment of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The labor dispute disqualification provision explicitly precludes the strikers from receipt of unemployment benefits because a labor dispute continued in active progress even after the employer permanently replaced them. This Court' has stated that \"[a labor dispute] means no more than a controversy between employer and employees regarding hours, wages, conditions of employment or recognition of a bargaining representative.\u201d <em>General Motors Corp v Employment Security Comm, </em>378 Mich 110, 117; 142 NW2d 686 (1966). In the instant case, the union initially offered to unconditionally return to work and therefore to end the labor dispute. However, the striker\u2019s subsequent demand to return only as a group rather than as vacancies occurred constituted a new demand, separate from earlier economic demands, which continued the labor dispute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Had the union stuck to its original announced position of being willing to return to work, those strikers whose positions were filled by permanent replacements would undoubtedly have been entitled to unemployment compensation until such time that vacancies became available. However, the strikers\u2019 demand to return as a group constituted a \"substantial contributing cause\u201d of the strikers unemployment. <em>Baker v General Motors Corp, </em>409 Mich 639; 297 NW2d 387 (1980). The strikers remained on strike over the issue of reinstatement. The strikers\u2019 demand for group reinstatement also precluded reemployment of those strikers for whom vacancies existed._</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>In our view, the refusal of the strikers to return except as a group also foreclosed a determination in this case of which strikers would have been eligible for benefits due to the presence of replacement employees, and also foreclosed the reemployment of strikers that would have been rehired as future openings became available. The record indicates the strikers unequivocally pronounced themselves unavailable for reinstatement until the employer acceded to their demand for group reinstatement. Thus an active labor dispute remained as the immediate and substantial contributing cause of the striker\u2019s unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We agree with the lower courts\u2019 articulation of the appropriate standard of review in determining whether the Employment Security Act disqualifies the appellee strikers from unemployment benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">This Court may reverse an mesc referee and the board of review only if their decision is contrary to law or not supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. [168 Mich App 24.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">However, we disagree with the legal conclusions of the mesc board and the courts below in concluding that MCL 421.29(8); MSA 17.531(8) did not disqualify the strikers from unemployment benefits. The mesc and the courts below failed to correctly distinguish cases which have equated the lawful act of permanent replacement to the unlawful act of termination or discharge from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The circuit court noted in affirming the award of benefits that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">[t]he referee\u2019s disinclination to accept the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>er\u2019s argument that there is a meaningful distinction in this case between being permanently replaced and being discharged is supported by the referee\u2019s findings of fact. No matter what the employer chooses to call them, the referee found that the employees were discharged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Similarly, the Court of Appeals failed to distinguish between permanent replacement and termination or discharge, as illustrated by its holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">[although a close case, we believe that the referee\u2019s decision was correct and not contrary to law. Because there are cases which hold that permanent replacement is equivalent to termination of employee status and that the labor dispute disqualification ends when the claimant is permanently replaced, the referee\u2019s decision can not be said to be contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">. . . Since there is no Michigan case having precedential value which says that a situation like the instant case should be distinguished from <em>Knight-Morley, </em>we believe that <em>Knight-Morley </em>should be followed. [168 Mich App 32.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">These statements illustrate the heart of the problem in this case: the failure to recognize any legal distinction between the termination or permanent discharge of strikers during a strike as compared with the situation of strikers whose positions have been permanently filled but who retain first call on immediately available and future vacancies but nonetheless continue to strike.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The Court of Appeals erred in relying on <em>Knight-Morley Corp, supra, </em>to uphold the mesc\u2019s award of benefits to the claimant employees. In <em>Knight-Morley, </em>we held that permanently replaced economic strikers were entitled to unemployment compensation where the employer informed the strikers that they must either return to work or face termination. The employer subsequently announced that the strikers were terminated and removed their names from payroll records, canceled the strikers\u2019 life and medical insurance policies, and published a letter in a newspaper \"which stated [that] with respect to those on strike that 'they are no longer employees of this company.\u2019 \u201d 352 Mich 333. In contrast, the strikers did not allege that the employer in the instant case informed them of termination. To the contrary, the employer testified that it notified the union of the existence of vacancies as such occurred. Unlike the strikers in <em>Knight-Morley, </em>the strikers in the instant case did not present evidence indicating an intent by the employer to discharge or terminate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In <em>Knight-Morley, </em>the employer made it so obviously clear that the remaining strikers would no longer have an opportunity to work for the company that the underlying labor dispute became irrelevant to the strikers\u2019 unemployment. In the present case, however, the record indicates that at least seven of the fourteen strikers had jobs waiting for them, and the others had reasonable prospects of future reemployment. This illustrated that the labor dispute continued \"to be a substantial contributing cause of . . . unemployment.\u201d <em>Baker v General Motors, supra, </em>680.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Knight-Morley, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>the termination of the strike would not have returned any of the remaining strikers to their jobs. In the case at bar, the end of the strike would have returned nearly half of the claimants to their jobs and would have removed the \"due to a labor dispute\u201d disqualification for those strikers whose jobs were not available because of the presence of permanent replacements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The case of <em>Intertown Co v Unemployment Compensation Comm, supra, </em>similarly does not dispose of the instant case. The employer in <em>Intertown </em>replaced striking employees and sent a letter that the strikers \"interpreted as a termination of their employment.\u201d 328 Mich 365. In contrast, the employer in the instant case did not evidence an intent to terminate the strikers, nor did the strikers indicate a subjective sense of termination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The record in this case indicates quite the contrary. The strikers continued to picket the employer even after the hiring of replacements. The employer testified it considered those who replaced the strikers to be employees with preferential rights to reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The instant case is also factually distinguishable from cases in other jurisdictions which have held that an employer\u2019s permanent replacement of strikers removes the bar to unemployment com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>pensation under labor dispute disqualification provisions analogous to MCL 421.29(8); MSA 17.531(8). These cases might more properly be characterized as replacement \"plus\u201d cases\u2014i.e., the cases comprise fact patterns manifesting intent by the employer not merely to permanently replace but to terminate the employment relationship. In <em>Baugh v United Telephone Co, </em>54 Ohio St 2d 419; 377 NE2d 766 (1978), the Ohio Supreme Court held that the statutory labor dispute disqualification provision<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> did not disentitle permanently replaced strikers to unemployment compensation. However, unlike the instant case, the employer, in <em>Baugh </em>sent a letter informing the strikers that if they failed to report by a certain date \"the immediate hiring of permanent replacements would commence and, if at the end of the strike a replacement occupied the employee\u2019s former job, the employee had no job.\u201d 54 Ohio St 2d 424-425. The employer then sent the strikers a second letter \"informing them that their positions had been filled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425. From these facts the <em>Baugh </em>court concluded that the employer\u2019s action constituted the proximate cause of the strikers unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Similarly, in <em>Brannan Sand &amp; Gravel v Industrial Claim Appeals Office of Colorado, </em>762 P2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>771 (Colo App, 1988), a Colorado appellate court set aside the employment agency\u2019s decision that permanently replaced strikers could not receive unemployment compensation under the statutory labor dispute disqualification provision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court held that \"whether an employer has permanently replaced an employee, and thereby severed the labor dispute as the cause of unemployment, is a question of fact to be determined by the employer\u2019s actions in every case.\u201d 762 P2d 774. Significantly, and in contrast to the instant case, the employer in <em>Brannan Sand &amp; Gravel </em>sent a letter advising the strikers that \" 'if such a replacement is hired before you make an unconditional offer to return to work, you will not have a job with us at that time.\u2019 \u201d 762 P2d 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The California Supreme Court in <em>Ruberoid Co v California Unemployment Ins Appeals Bd, </em>59 Cal 2d 73; 27 Cal Rptr 878; 378 P2d 102 (1963), similarly held that the statutory labor disqualification provision<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> did not preclude economic strikers from receiving unemployment compensation. In contrast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>to the instant case, the employer in <em>Ruberoid </em>hired replacements and then \"mailed to all employees still on strike notice that they had been permanently replaced and enclosed a check for their pro rata vacation pay to the date of the strike.\u201d 59 Cal 2d 75. The <em>Ruberoid </em>court interpreted these actions as evidence that the employer \"liquidated the strikers\u2019 jobs, which were the cause and occasion of the trade dispute.\u201d 59 Cal 2d 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The above cases all illustrate that courts which have refused to apply labor dispute disqualification provisions in the permanent replacement context have also found employer intent to terminate or sever the employment relationship with the strikers. However, none of the above cases indicate that, as in the case at bar, strikers perpetuated a labor dispute by substituting a demand for group reinstatement in place of their original economic demands over wages and other terms of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Significantly, a California appellate court in <em>Windigo Mills v California Unemployment Ins Appeals Bd, </em>92 Cal App 3d 586; 155 Cal Rptr 63 (1979), declined to apply the <em>Ruberoid </em>decision to a factual situation where numerous positions remained open after strikers had been replaced. The court noted that \"there was no evidence suggesting that any employee who wanted to work had been refused a job. Moreover, even if there were insufficient openings for <em>all </em>the strikers, this would not compel the trial court to find all of the claimants eligible.\u201d 92 Cal App 3d 600 (emphasis in original).
