We hold that the statute does not require that a fourth offender\u2019s three prior convictions, the sentences for those convictions, or the offenses upon which those convictions and sentences are based, occur in any particular sequence. The statute requires only that the fourth offense be preceded by three convictions of felony offenses, and that each of those three predicate felonies arise from separate criminal incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">The defendant in this case was charged with breaking and entering an occupied dwelling with the intent to commit larceny and with possessing cocaine. Defendant allegedly committed both of these offenses on November 24, 1986. Defendant was also charged with being a fourth offender. The habitual-offender information alleged three prior convictions for breaking and entering, one for which defendant was sentenced June 26, 1986, and two for which he was sentenced December 3, 1985.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Defendant pled guilty of the breaking and entering and fourth-time habitual-offender charges, admitting the three prior convictions alleged in the habitual-offender information. After an unsuccessful motion to withdraw his guilty plea, defendant appealed in the Court of Appeals. In defendant\u2019s supplemental brief he argued, relying upon <em>People v Stoudemire, </em>429 Mich 262; 414 NW2d 693 (1987), that his habitual-offender conviction should be reduced from a fourth-offender conviction to a third-offender conviction because the two prior convictions for which he was sentenced on the same date should count as only one prior conviction. The Court of Appeals agreed with the defendant that defendant\u2019s two convictions resulted in only one opportunity to reform, and ordered resentencing. We granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal to determine whether \"defendant was properly convicted as a fourth-time habitual offender.\u201d 432 Mich 891 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">In <em>Stoudemire, </em>p 278, we held that under the fourth-offender statute, \"multiple convictions arising out of a single incident may count as only a single prior conviction . . . .\u201d This holding, we stated, was consistent with the purpose of the statute, which we divined from the history of the statute. We reasoned that in order to be convicted as a fourth offender, a defendant must have been involved previously in three, separate criminal incidents, because_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>[t]he Legislature intended that the habitual offender statute\u2019s fourth-felony provision . . . should apply only to a person who had had three opportunities to reform\u2014who had been convicted and sentenced and then subsequently committed another felony for which he was also convicted and sentenced, and then subsequent to the second conviction committed yet another felony, for which he was again convicted and sentenced. Upon this person\u2019s conviction for yet a fourth felony, he would be subject to the habitual offender act\u2019s fourth-felony provision. He would be subject to mandatory life imprisonment because he had three times failed to reform, \"because of the apparent persistence in the commission of crime by the person convicted and his indifference to the laws . . . .\u201d [Id., p 271 (quoting <em>People v </em>Palm, 245 Mich 396, 401; 223 NW 67 [1929]). See also <em>Stoudemire, </em>pp 266, 268.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Since <em>Stoudemire, </em>several panels of the Court of Appeals have applied its reasoning to varying factual scenarios to determine when a defendant\u2019s prior convictions may be counted separately. Some panels have interpreted Stoudemire\u2019s opportunity-to-reform rationale in a limited manner, holding that a defendant rejects an opportunity to reform each time he commits another crime, even if he was not convicted or sentenced for one crime before committing the next, as long as the offenses arose from separate incidents. Others, like the panel below, have adopted the Court\u2019s statements in <em>Stoudemire </em>that in order for a conviction to count as a prior conviction under the statute, each conviction must be for an offense committed after conviction and sentence for a prior offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">The prosecutor in this case asks that we reevaluate our statutory analysis in <em>Stoudemire </em>and reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>the conclusions in that case concerning the Legislature\u2019s intent to limit the reach of the fourth-offender provision to defendants whose prior offenses are separated by intervening convictions and sentences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the prosecutor that our statutory analysis of the habitual offender statute in <em>Stoudemire </em>was flawed. Although we need not disturb the precise holding of that case\u2014that multiple convictions arising out of a single incident may count as only a single prior conviction under the statute\u2014we conclude that a more accurate interpretation of the statute precludes many of the statements made there concerning the intent and purpose of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Since 1978, the fourth-offender statute has provided,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-8\">If a person has been convicted of 3 or more felonies, attempts to commit felonies, or both, . . . and that person commits a subsequent felony within this state, the person shall be punished upon conviction as follows .... [MCL 769.12; MSA 28.1084.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">Before that, the language was somewhat different:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-10\">A person who after having been 3 times convicted ... of felonies or attempts to commit felonies, . . . commits any felony within this state . . . may be sentenced upon conviction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>such fourth or subsequent offense to ... . [1949 PA 56; 1929 PA 24; 1927 PA 175.]\u2122</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">While the original language of the statute clearly requires that the fourth offense be committed after the three prior convictions, and the present language probably requires the same, neither contains any requirement that a fourth offender\u2019s three prior offenses, convictions, or sentences occur in any particular sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The Legislature\u2019s specification that the fourth offense must follow three convictions, combined with its omission of any similar requirement for the second and third offenses, implies that no particular sequence for the first three offenses or convictions was intended. However, recognizing the well-established principle that a literal reading of a statute may be modified if that reading leads to a clear or manifest contradiction of the apparent purpose of the act, or if necessary to correct an absurd and unjust result,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we must turn to sources of legislative intent other than the language to determine whether declining to read into the statute a sequentiality requirement for predicate offenses would contradict the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">As in <em>Stoudemire, </em>we find it appropriate to begin our analysis of legislative purpose with the original enactment of 1927. 1927 PA 175 was the culmination of the work of the Commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Inquiry Into Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sections 10, 11, 12, and 13 of chapter IX of the act mandated specific punishment and procedures for prior offenders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In its report to the Legislature, the commission made special mention of these sections, suggesting that they were intended to remedy perceived deficiencies in the former statutes governing repeat offenders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-6\">We also call your attention to sections eleven, twelve, and thirteen of this chapter. These sections deserve your most earnest consideration. It will be observed that section thirteen provides that a person who has four times been convicted of a felony shall be imprisoned for life. It is interesting to note that section 15,613 of the Compiled Laws of 1915, one of the oldest criminal enactments of this State, has provided that a person who has been twice sentenced for the commission of a felony may be sentenced upon third conviction to life imprisonment. We do not find that this statute has been put into operation. We have, therefore, adopted section thirteen, which makes it mandatory to sentence to life imprisonment upon the fourth conviction.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">This passage from the report does not contain any express statement concerning the commission\u2019s intent regarding whether a defendant\u2019s prior convictions, offenses, or sentences must occur in any particular sequence in order for him to be subject to the fourth-offender penalties. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>because the commission regarded the prior repeat-offender statute as ineffectual, an examination of its provisions is instructive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">When any person shall be convicted of any offense, and shall be duly sentenced therefor to confinement in the state prison of this state, for one year or more, and it shall be alleged in the indictment on which such conviction is had, and admitted or proved on the trial, that the convict has before been <em>sentenced to a like punishment </em>by any court in this state, or in any other of the United States, <em>for a period not less than one year, </em>he shall be sentenced to be punished by imprisonment in the state prison not more than seven years, in addition to the punishment prescribed by law for the offense of which he shall then be convicted. [1915 CL 15612. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-7\">When any such convict shall have been twice before <em>sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor, for a period of not less than one year at each time, </em>by any court in this state, or in any other of the United States, he shall be sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor for life, or for a term of not less than seven years in addition to the punishment prescribed by law for the offense of which he shall then be convicted. [1915 CL 15613. Emphasis added[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The repeat-offender provisions proposed by the commission were substantially different from these earlier provisions in several ways.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Most pertinent for our inquiry in this case, the new provisions did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>not require that the defendant have previously been twice sentenced to prison, for at least a year each time, before the enhanced punishment could be imposed. The 1927 act required only that the person have been \"three times convicted\u201d prior to committing the fourth offense. Thus, the new provision literally applied to defendants who had previously been convicted three times before they committed their fourth offense, even if they had not yet been sentenced on any or all of those prior convictions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The commission\u2019s decision to delete the sentencing requirement, combined with its statements that the overall purpose of the act was to make it tougher for criminals to avoid apprehension, conviction, and adequate punishment,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> suggest that the commission\u2019s intent was that \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11, and 12 apply to a broader class of criminals than they would have applied to had the prior language about prior sentences been retained. This history suggests that the commission did not intend \u00a7 12 to apply only to defendants who commit four felonies, each of the last three being committed after a previous <em>sentence, </em>as <em>Stoudemire </em>concludes was the Legislature\u2019s intent. The commission\u2019s report reflects the goal of punishing repeat offenders harshly, but does not particularly support an objective of punishing them only after they have three <em>separate times </em>disregarded the sobering message of a conviction <em>and </em>sentence._</p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Because the Legislature ultimately adopted these sections of the commission\u2019s proposed code without change, the commission\u2019s views on these issues were presumably shared by the members of the Legislature who adopted its recommendations. See 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 48.09, p 316. Declining to read into the statute a requirement that a defendant\u2019s second offense must follow the conviction and sentence for his first offense, and that his third offense must follow the conviction and sentence for his second offense, certainly does not violate any expressed purpose of the commission or the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">In <em>Stoudemire, </em>as guidance for determining our own Legislature\u2019s intent in adopting \u00a7\u00a7 10-13 of chapter IX of 1927 PA 175, we relied upon certain authorities interpreting the intent of the New York Legislature in adopting its \"Baumes Laws.\u201d We reasoned, \"By borrowing New York\u2019s statute in its entirety, the Legislature indicated that it was motivated by the same purpose that underlay the New York statute.\u201d <em>Stoudemire, </em>p 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">While it is certainly possible that our Legislature adopted identical language for different reasons, the report of the commission bolsters our conclusion in <em>Stoudemire </em>that the 1927 Legislature was aware of the motivations behind the New York law, and that the intent of the New York Legislature in passing similar provisions, and to some extent the views of Senator Baumes, may reflect the purposes of our own Legislature in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>passing these sections of 1927 PA 175.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 51.06, p 510; cf. <em>Evening News Ass\u2019n v City of Troy, </em>417 Mich 481, 494-495; 339 NW2d 421 (1983). However, regarding the nature of either Senator Baumes\u2019 or the New York Legislature\u2019s intent, we must depart from our prior conclusions in <em>Stoudemire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The language at issue in this case, in the New York statute, and our own statute\u2014having been three times convicted\u2014had been part of New York law since 1907. Neither New York\u2019s 1907 law nor the law as amended in 1926<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> contained language concerning the sequence of the first three convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>tions, and sequentiality of the convictions was not litigated prior to the 1926 amendment. <em>People v Morse, </em>62 NY2d 205; 476 NYS2d 505; 465 NE2d 12 (1984). So, at the time our Legislature adopted the New York law, there were no New York decisions interpreting whether this language required that a former offender\u2019s prior convictions be sequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Furthermore, even though their decisions shed little light on what our Legislature intended when it enacted 1927 PA 175, New York courts eventually interpreted the language at issue in this case <em>not </em>to require that the prior offenses or convictions occur in any particular sequence. All except one held that the three prior convictions need not be sequential. <em>Morse, supra, </em>pp 219-220.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>Stoudemire, </em>we relied erroneously on the only New York decision that held that a fourth offender\u2019s second and third offenses must each follow conviction and sentence on the earlier offense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>not only clearly at odds with the weight of authority in New York and unavailable when our Legislature adopted the pertinent language, it relied on three cases that did not address the same issue.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">In <em>Stoudemire, </em>we quoted statements of Senator Baumes<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and relied on them for our conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>that the New York Legislature intended the act to punish only those \"who had been convicted and sentenced and then subsequently committed another felony for which he was also convicted and sentenced, and then subsequent to the second conviction committed yet another felony, for which he was again convicted and sentenced.\u201d <em>Stoudemire, </em>p 271. However, even assuming that our Legislature or the commission was exposed to the quoted statements or similar ones by Senator Baumes,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> those comments do not establish Senator Baumes\u2019 intent on the issue of the sequentiality of prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The quoted portion suggests only that Senator Baumes considered that the fourth-offender provision was directed at a defendant who had been previously convicted three times and committed his fourth offense after serving his sentences and after he had been given \"a chance to watch his step.\u201d It suggests nothing about whether he or other New York legislators in 1907 or 1926 intended that the second offense occur after sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>ing for the first offense and the third offense occur after sentencing for the second offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Not only are Mr. Baumes\u2019 views ambiguous on sequentiality of a fourth offender\u2019s three prior convictions, his suggestion that the fourth offense must follow a <em>completed sentence </em>conflicts with the language of 1927 PA 175, which literally requires only that the commission of the fourth offense follow three prior \"convictions,\u201d not sentences. The language of \"conviction\u201d replaced the language of our earlier statute which expressly required that the offender have previously been not only convicted but sentenced. See part iii(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Finally, we concluded in <em>Stoudemire </em>that the New York Legislature endorsed the sequentiality theory for prior offenses by amending the statute in 1936 to prevent the separate counting of two or more crimes consolidated for charging or trial purposes. However, that conclusion is questionable, since it is contrary to New York\u2019s own courts\u2019 interpretation of that amendment. As the court stated in <em>People v Schultz, </em>23 Misc 2d 620, 625; 198 NYS2d 814 (1960), aff\u2019d 15 AD2d 948; 226 NYS2d 680 (1962), app dis 11 NY2d 1058 (1962), cert den 371 US 866 (1962),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-6\">Some habitual offender statutes of other States require that each succeeding conviction to be counted must be subsequent to a previous conviction both in time of commission and in time of conviction. . . . This eliminates \"same time\u201d convictions altogether. <em>This is not the law in this State. The only exception to our general policy is the one specified in the consolidation clauses adopted in 1936.[</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>[Emphasis added.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>In contrast to New York\u2019s history, our Legislature has never adopted any provision barring separate counting of multiple convictions for offenses consolidated for charging or trial, despite the Legislature\u2019s revisions of the statute in 1949, 1978, and 1988. See n 3 and 1988 PA 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">In sum, a requirement that a fourth offender\u2019s three prior offenses be separated by intervening convictions and sentences need not be read into' the language of our statute in order to accommodate any legislative purpose gleaned from New York law. Accord <em>Castle v Gladden, </em>201 Or 353, 369-370; 270 P2d 675 (1954) (relying on New York law to interpret identical language, finding no sequentiality requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Stoudemire\u2019s reliance on our own precedents as authority for a legislative purpose to limit the timing of prior convictions was misplaced as well. The statement we quoted from <em>Palm, supra, </em>p 401 in <em>Stoudemire, </em>p 270, is neutral regarding whether a fourth offender\u2019s prior offenses must be separated by intervening convictions. It states that there must be \" 'repeated commissions\u2019 \u201d of felonies, and that the person convicted must demonstrate \" 'persistence in the commission of crime\u2019 \u201d and \" 'indifference to the laws ....\u2019\u201d Both of these attributes are demonstrated by a person who commits three separate felonies, is convicted and sentenced for them, and then commits a fourth offense, as well as by a person who commits one offense, is convicted and sentenced, commits another offense, is convicted and sentenced, commits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>a third offense, is convicted, then commits a fourth offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The <em>Palm </em>Court stated that the statute \"evidence^] a desire on the part of the people of the State to protect themselves from the acts of habitual violators of law.\u201d It reasoned that repeat offenders \"are a menace to society, unfit for liberty, and should be deprived thereof.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 401. These statements describe a legislative purpose to punish repeat offenders harshly, regardless of whether they committed each of their offenses after a conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Also, for the reasons stated by Justice Archer in his dissent in <em>Stoudemire, </em>our reliance on <em>People v Podsiad, </em>295 Mich 541; 295 NW 257 (1940), and <em>People v Lowenstein, </em>309 Mich 94; 14 NW2d 794 (1944), was misplaced. <em>People v Sawyer, </em>410 Mich 531; 302 NW2d 534 (1981), like <em>Podsiad </em>and <em>Lowenstein, </em>stands for the principle that an enhanced penalty for a second offense may.be imposed only when a defendant commits the second offense after conviction of his first offense. That is not the question in this case, where the statute already requires that the commission of defendant\u2019s fourth offense follow the convictions of his prior offenses. Here, we are concerned only with whether the Legislature intended that those prior offenses and convictions be sequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Not only is the dicta in <em>Stoudemire </em>an unneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>sarily broad reading of <em>Palm, Podsiad, Lowenstein, </em>and <em>Sawyer, Stoudemire\u2019s </em>statements that the second, third, and fourth offenses committed by an habitual fourth offender must each follow a <em>sentence </em>for a prior offense conflict with our decision in <em>People v Funk, </em>321 Mich 617; 33 NW2d 95 (1948). In <em>Funk, </em>we rejected a defendant\u2019s contention that a conviction for which no sentence was imposed could not be counted as a prior offense under the fourth-offender provision and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\"><em>The statute does not make imposition of sentence upon the previous convictions a prerequisite to the enhancement of punishment upon the fourth conviction. </em>The <em>conviction </em>is the finding of guilt. Sentence is not an element of the conviction but rather a declaration of its consequences. <em>[Id., </em>p 621. Emphasis added. See also <em>People v Hatt, </em>384 Mich 302; 181 NW2d 912 (1970).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Like the statute\u2019s legislative history, the decisions of this Court preceding <em>Stoudemire </em>fail to demonstrate a legislative purpose that would be contradicted by declining to read into the statute a requirement that the first, second, and third offenses be separated by intervening convictions or sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">In <em>Stoudemire </em>we also examined cases from other jurisdictions interpreting statutes similar to our own fourth-offender provision to determine what our Legislature had in mind when it enacted what is now MCL 769.12; MSA 28.1084. To the extent that statements in <em>Stoudemire </em>suggest that other jurisdictions support the conclusion that our Legislature intended that a fourth offender\u2019s prior offenses be separated by intervening convictions, we reject those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>First, other jurisdictions\u2019 interpretations of similar, or even identical, language, is of only limited value in determining what our own Legislature intended, absent circumstances which suggest our Legislature considered these statutes or the decisions interpreting them when it enacted or amended the fourth-offender provision. See 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 51.06, p 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">More important, the difference of opinion on the question in this case is much more balanced than that on the question examined in <em>Stoudemire. </em>As we noted in <em>Stoudemire, </em>almost every jurisdiction with similar statutory language has interpreted that language and its legislative history to require that predicate offenses arise from separate transactions. However, the same weight of authority does not support Stoudemire\u2019s reasoning that the Legislature intended to apply the fourth-offender statute only to defendants whose predicate offenses are separated by intervening convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">For example, several of those jurisdictions specifically relied upon in our opinion in <em>Stoudemire </em>do not support defendant\u2019s claim in this case.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nevada has held that its statute, containing the phrase \"previously been three times convicted\u201d \"does not require that the convictions and commissions of prior offenses occur in any particular sequence.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Hawaii adopted the same rule prohibiting the separate counting of convictions imposed for related offenses while allowing the separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>counting of simultaneously entered convictions for separate offenses.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In addition, every United States Court of Appeals that has examined this issue has rejected the claim that predicate offenses under the federal habitual offender statute must be separated by intervening convictions or sentences, despite their equally unanimous agreement that the same statute prohibits separate counting of multiple convictions for offenses arising from the same incident.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Among the states that enacted laws with wording like that in our statute which does not specify whether a third or fourth offender\u2019s prior crimes must be separated by intervening convictions or sentences, there is a split on this question. Some courts have held that their Legislatures intended that the sequentiality requirement be read into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>the statute,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> others have held that the same language, combined with legislative history, evidenced no such intent or purpose.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">These decisions illustrate that the policy concerns that our Legislature might have considered before adopting the 1927 act were not so one sided that we must now conclude it meant something it did not say. In defendant\u2019s favor is the view expressed in <em>State v Carlson, </em>560 P2d 26, 30 (Alas, 1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-7\">[W]hen a convicted criminal has not taken advantage of the opportunity to reform and subsequently commits another crime, he may be considered a worse offender than one with no previous convictions. It is then reasonable to subject him to harsher sanctions. However, where . . . two convictions occur on the same day, the opportunity for reformation is afforded to him only once, not twice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">One cannot refute the argument that a defendant who is proven to have ignored three, separate, postconviction opportunities to reform is \"reasonably\u201d deemed a \"worse\u201d offender, and more deserving of the harsh penalties in the habitual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>offender statute, than a defendant who is shown to have ignored only one postconviction opportunity to reform, even if both defendants have the same total number of convictions. But this argument certainly does not preclude a Legislature from deciding that the latter type of criminal is also worthy of the fourth-offender penalties. Just because a particular statutory scheme is more favorable to defendants, does not require a Legislature to choose it. See <em>Gimmy v People, </em>645 P2d 262, 265-267 (Colo, 1982); <em>United States v Balascsak, </em>873 F2d 673, 687 (CA 3, 1989) (Greenberg, J., dissenting). Also, our Legislature may very well have considered a sequentiality requirement unwise, given a defendant\u2019s ability to elude separate prosecutions for separate crimes and the advantages of resolving multiple charges at one plea or sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Without belaboring further the reasoning of the conflicting decisions from other jurisdictions, suffice it to say that they do not persuade us that we must give effect to a requirement concerning a fourth offender\u2019s prior convictions under our statute that does not appear in its language.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Although we conclude that the legislative purpose behind the fourth-offender statute does not require that we read into the statute a requirement that a defendant\u2019s first, second, and third offenses be separated by intervening convictions or sentences, we believe there is sufficient indicia of legislative intent to support the narrow holding in <em>Stoudemire </em>that a defendant\u2019s prior offenses must arise from separate incidents. Therefore, although we no longer rely on much of the reasoning in <em>Stoudemire, </em>we do not overrule its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>The legislative history of the statute suggests that it was directed at the \"persistent\u201d or \"repeat\u201d offender. See parts iii(b), (c), and (d). A commonsense interpretation of these phrases is that the Legislature did not have in mind the person who had only one criminal episode in which he managed to commit several different crimes. Instead, \"repeat\u201d suggests some time interval between crimes, and \"persistent\u201d suggests a criminal who continues in his criminal pursuits after these intervals. Neither of these concepts may easily be reconciled with an interpretation of the statute which would allow a court to impose fourth-offender penalties on a defendant whose three prior convictions arose out of the same criminal incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">We need not take on the task of defining the scope of a criminal \"transaction,\u201d \"incident,\u201d or \"episode\u201d for purposes of the fourth-offender statute in this case, except to note that because defendant\u2019s two breaking and entering charges from June of 1985 were separated by several days and occurred at different locations, they were properly counted separately.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Because we conclude that even under Stoudemire\u2019s Same-incident test this defendant was properly convicted as a fourth offender, we need not reach whether <em>Stoudemire </em>is to be applied retroactively, a question raised by the prosecutor in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">The language of the fourth-offender statute contains no requirement that a fourth offender\u2019s three prior convictions must be for three offenses separated by intervening convictions or sentences. We find no legislative purpose or policy that is clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>contradicted by failing to read such a requirement into the statute\u2019s language, nor does this plain reading of the statute generate absurd or unjust results. To the extent that some of the reasoning in <em>Stoudemire </em>conflicts with our decision in this case, it is modified. Because the defendant in this case had previously been convicted of three felonies when he committed his fourth offense, each of those three prior felonies having arisen from separate criminal incidents, he was properly convicted and punished as a fourth offender. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b841-4\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-10\"> In Ms application for leave to appeal, the prosecutor alleged that defendant committed the earliest breaking and entering on June 8, 1985, and pled guilty of that crime on August 20, 1985, that he committed the next breaking and entering on June 13, 1985, and pled guilty on November 20, 1985, and that he committed the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>breaking and entering on May 15, 1986. Defendant does not dispute these allegations except to suggest that not only was he sentenced, but he was convicted, of the two earlier breaking and entering charges on the same day, December 3, 1985. The parties do not dispute that defendant committed two of his three prior offenses before he was convicted of either.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-11\"> Although not expressly solicited by our grant order, arguments concerning the continuing validity of the <em>Stoudemire </em>rationale have been offered by both parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b823-10\"> The amendments of 1929 and 1949 changed only the penalties.

Another significant change was the procedural change contained in \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 13.

Some defendants who have had one opportunity to reform will be subject to punishment as a second offender, others as a third offender,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and still others as a fourth offender.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Some defendants who have had two opportunities to reform will be subject to punishment as a third offender and others as a fourth offender.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">This possibility of dissimilarity in treatment is not confined to defendants who have had the same number of opportunities to reform but who have a different number of felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">A defendant who committed three separate felonies before he was first prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced, and then committed, and was convicted of, one felony, could be sentenced as a fourth offender, but a defendant who committed one felony before he was first prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced, and then committed, and was convicted of, three separate felonies, could only be sentenced as a second offender. Although each defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>would have had one opportunity to reform and have four separate felony convictions, one is subject to not more than a fifty percent increase in the possible maximum sentence<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> while the other is subject to a possible sentence of life imprisonment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant who had most recently committed three felonies\u2014the person who had \"learned his lesson\u201d the least well\u2014would face <em>less severe </em>sentence enhancement than the defendant who had most recently committed only one felony. This is backwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">I do not believe the Legislature intended that the habitual offender provisions would be, or could be, applied in such an haphazard manner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> I am not aware of, nor does the majority suggest, any legislative purpose that would be served by allowing a defendant who is \"less incorrigible\u201d to be sentenced more severely than a defendant who is \"more incorrigible.\u201d The premise of the majority\u2019s analysis\u2014that the Legislature intended that after a defendant has once been convicted, it is only the number of felony convictions that determines his correct place on the habitual offender continuum\u2014 is inconsistent with a statutory regime that emphasizes in its literal language not only the total number of felony convictions, but also that there was a prior felony conviction at the time the most recent felony was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">The question is not whether Preuss, or any other defendant with multiple felony convictions, is an \"habitual offender.\u201d The question is whether an \"habitual offender\u201d is to be sentenced\u2014consis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>tent with the gradations established by the Legislature\u2014as a second, third, or fourth felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s critique of the analysis in Stoudemire\u2014some of which appears valid\u2014I adhere to the belief that the opportunity-to-reform rationale set forth in <em>Stoudemire </em>is an accurate description of the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the habitual offender provisions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-6\"> If a person has been convicted of a felony . . . and that person commits a subsequent felony within this state, the person shall be punished upon conviction as follows ....</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Preuss did not commit his second felony offense after he had been convicted of his first felony offense.
