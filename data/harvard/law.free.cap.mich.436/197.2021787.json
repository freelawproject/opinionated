Thus, the issue cannot be avoided by holding as the dissent does that if there was error it does not require reversal of McReavy\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(Post, </em>p <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>223.) Instead, pursuant to a construction of <em>Bobo </em>as coextensive with federal constitutional law, <em>People v Cetlinski, </em>435 Mich 742; 460 NW2d 534 (1990), the constitutional question is properly analyzed under the test set forth in <em>People v Walker (On Rehearing), </em>374 Mich 331; 132 NW2d 87 (1965), i.e., whether the trial court erred in finding that defendant waived his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination until he invoked his rights on the morning following the inquiry in question. The evidentiary issue should be analyzed as a party admission under MRE 801(d)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Where the record indicates that a defendant\u2019s silence is attributable to an invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege or a reliance on <em>Miranda </em>warnings, use of his silence is error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>(1966). There is no basis here, however, to conclude that the trial court erred in finding that defendant waived his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and that the defendant did not invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege until the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>morning. <em>People v Robinson, </em>386 Mich 551; 194 NW2d 709 (1972). It follows that there is no basis to conclude that defendant\u2019s unresponsiveness was attributable to invocation of that privilege or reliance on <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Thus, in this case, there is no violation of the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\"><em>Miranda v Arizona </em>enunciated the obligation owed to a defendant in custody and the procedures that must be fulfilled prior to substantive use of his statements or assertive conduct. There being no question in the instant case of compliance with the procedural requirements of <em>Miranda, </em>anything defendant said thereafter is admissible as the statement of a party opponent, so long as it is relevant. MRE 801(d)(2)(A). What defendant did, that is, his lack of responsiveness during the interview, was not evidence of silence. Rather, it was nonverbal nonassertive conduct evidence that was admissible along with the defendant\u2019s express statements indicating consciousness of guilt so as to allow the factfinder to more fully determine the probative significance of the defendant\u2019s complete statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Construing the Michigan Constitution consistently with developments in Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence there was no constitutional violation. The admission for substantive purposes of evidence of the defendant\u2019s demeanor and statements made during custodial interrogation after a valid waiver of his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination and prior to invoking the right to remain silent is neither error of constitutional dimension nor a violation of the Michigan Rules of Evidence. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Appeals for consideration of the remaining issues raised on appeal.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Defendant McReavy was convicted by a jury of armed robbery,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> kidnapping,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He subsequently was convicted of being a third-time habitual offender<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and was sentenced to a term of from eight to twenty years plus a consecutive two-year term for the felony-firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">During the trial, it was established that sometime during the night of February 21 and 22, 1985, the attendant of a gas station in Mount Pleasant was robbed. The victim testified that the defendant walked into the station at approximately 11:30 p.m. and asked to use the phone, claiming to be having car problems. The victim stated that after the defendant made several calls over the period of approximately an hour and a half, he asked for a bag and, while pointing a small silver pistol at the victim, told him to put the money from the cash register into the bag. The victim then stated that he and the defendant left in the victim\u2019s car and that he was finally told to get out of the car and warned that if he went to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>authorities the defendant would come back and get him.* *****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The victim\u2019s car and the gun used in the robbery were found the following day. The gun was registered to the defendant\u2019s landlord, who testified at trial that he had never given defendant or anyone else permission to use his gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The defendant did not testify at the trial. In its case in chief, the prosecution presented testimony of the arresting officers that at the time of his arrest the defendant was twice given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and agreed to speak with the officers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The first officer testified that during the interview the defendant appeared very dejected, sat with his head in his hands, and told police that everything was going fine until \"this happened.\u201d The officer stated that the defendant then discussed his desire to have custody of his daughter and said that when he had seen her the past weekend she had not recognized him, a subject the robber had also discussed with his victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Further, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry as to what happened next, the officer testified that the defendant did not respond to direct questions regarding the robbery or deny his involvement, but simply put his head in his hands and looked down, that he didn\u2019t respond yes or no to those questions. At that point defense counsel objected,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">Now my client\u2019s silence is being used against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>him. I\u2019d object to that question, that answer, and I\u2019d like the court to now instruct the jury that my client\u2019s silence may never be used against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The prosecutor argued that the detective was telling the jury only that the defendant answered some questions and not others, and not that the defendant invoked his right to silence. The objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">The officer then testified that at this point they began to employ negative questions. When they asked the defendant whether he had borrowed the gun used in the robbery from his landlord, the defendant denied that his landlord had loaned him the gun. When asked whether it was safe to assume the landlord had nothing to do with the robbery, the defendant answered, \"yes, he\u2019s a real nice guy.\u201d When asked whether he was saying he didn\u2019t pull the robbery the defendant stated, \"no.\u201d Finally, the officer stated that the defendant said that he did not want to answer any more questions about the robbery and wanted time to think. He told the officers to contact him in the morning and he \"would clear up everything.\u201d When asked whether he meant clear up the robbery, the defendant said, \"yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">The prime investigator, Detective Fox, testified that the defendant appeared very nervous during the interview and at times it appeared as though tears were coming into his eyes. Fox further testified that the defendant indicated that he knew about the robbery from the paper and radio reports. The detective\u2019s testimony was consistent with that of the other detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">On cross-examination, in response to defense counsel\u2019s question, Detective Vincent stated that the interview with the defendant had lasted between thirty and forty minutes. Twice defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>counsel asked whether the defendant had answered any direct questions, and then whether the detectives had asked the negative questions in an attempt to trip the defendant up during the interrogation. Defense counsel then asked in regard to the answers the defendant gave to the negative question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">Now you felt that to mean that he [defendant] wasn\u2019t denying the robbery? I mean you were there. You perceived, right, what he was saying, his actions, his mannerisms?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The witness answered that \"[f]rom these answers he [defendant] convinced me he was involved in the robbery . . . .\u201d Further, defense counsel asked questions concerning the time defendant indicated he did not wish to answer any more questions and his statement that he would clear up everything in the morning, noting that at no time did the defendant ever confess to the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Detective Fox regarding why the interrogation had not been recorded, suggesting that the detective\u2019s report was inaccurate and written in a manner which indicated that defendant had essentially confessed to the robbery, when in fact he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">During the closing argument, the prosecutor reviewed the evidence presented, including the testimony of the detectives who interrogated the defendant, focusing on what the defendant meant by his postarrest statements. The full context of this section of the argument follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">And look at the consistency of all the evidence as it fits together. I mean there has got to be fifteen things that tie in in this case, and it just can\u2019t be by accident. It would cause the mind to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>boggled based on the evidence you\u2019ve heard not to believe the story of Mr. Martinez. You can pack up and go home based on this evidence. Now the last thing I\u2019m going to say, and I\u2019ll say it very briefly, is put all that together. Put together the fact that there was an arrest made on the night of Monday. They go back to the office with the police officers. The police officers will tell you. They\u2019re honest. One of the major points of anytime you make an arrest is to talk to the suspect. Hopefully you can clear it up. Hopefully he\u2019ll admit it. It\u2019s not the most important thing. It may be one of the most important things. It\u2019s certainly a very large factor if the person makes a confession, makes a statement, makes an admission. Look what we have here. You\u2019re asking Mr. McReavy point blank, are you telling us you didn\u2019t commit the robbery? No. What does he say when the conversation is over? I\u2019ll talk to you about it tomorrow. I don\u2019t want to talk about it any more. I\u2019ll clear it all up tomorrow. Clear up all what? You mean clean up the robbery, clear up the robbery? Yeah, I\u2019ll clear up the robbery for you tomorrow. Did Joel have anything to do with it? No, he\u2019s a nice guy. He didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. This man is talking with first-hand knowledge. If anybody can\u2019t see it, we\u2019re all in trouble based on this evidence. This man has first-hand knowledge. The police officers said he convinced me. Remember what Detective Vincent said? There\u2019s no doubt in my mind about the robbery, that he was involved in it. The questioning ceased. Not one denial, not one suggestion that it wasn\u2019t me. To the contrary, passive admissions. The man feels bad, he\u2019s got his head down, he\u2019s upset, doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. What does he talk about? He talks about his problems with his little girl, the same thing that our victim talked about. He said this guy is driving along, and he\u2019s telling me I\u2019m not going to hurt you, I\u2019m just doing it because I have problems with my girl. He\u2019s not going to tell him that her name is Megan and she lives in Gladwin. Well, it\u2019s my wife, not my woman. It\u2019s my wife, and she\u2019s in Lansing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>He\u2019s not going to be exactly honest with him. The guy is pouring out his heart to him. He\u2019s kind of embarrassed about committing the robbery. You know, I\u2019m not going to hurt you. But he did, ladies and gentlemen. He did. And there isn\u2019t any doubt, based on the evidence that he did it. He was telling the victim about his girl just like he told the police officers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">On appeal, defendant argued that his failure to deny the armed robbery during custodial interrogation was admitted into evidence at trial in violation of <em>People v Bobo. </em>He argued that his silence may have been nothing more than the exercise of his right to remain silent, and thus because evidence of his refusal to answer some questions was prohibited this type of evidence is \"insolubly ambiguous.\u201d <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US 610, 617; 96 S Ct 2240; 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976). Defendant also argued that in closing argument the prosecutor called the defendant\u2019s demeanor \"passive admissions\u201d of guilt. In sum, defendant\u2019s argument on appeal was that the testimony and argument impermissibly infringed on the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">In response, the prosecutor argued that the testimony of the defendant\u2019s interview was properly admitted at trial. He argued that the defendant had voluntarily waived his Fifth Amendment privilege and that the defendant\u2019s failure to answer some of the questions with either yes or no was not intended to end the interview. Nor was it an attempt by defendant to invoke his previously waived Fifth Amendment right to remain silent in light of the fact that the defendant continued to answer some questions. Further, the prosecutor noted that his remarks were consistent with the court\u2019s earlier <em>Walker </em>ruling and that his closing argument was simply a summation of the descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>tion of an interview, as the detectives testified, in which the defendant did give a statement and did not remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The Court of Appeals held that it was error to admit the testimony, stating that \"under <em>Bobo, </em>evidence of a defendant\u2019s failure to respond to an accusation of wrongdoing is inadmissible to prove guilt even if the defendant had, prior to his silence, waived his right to remain silent.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The panel found that on the basis of the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s statement to the detective it was not clear that defendant\u2019s failure to respond to direct questions regarding the armed robbery reflected an admission of wrongdoing.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The panel concluded that the evidence of defendant\u2019s failure to answer some questions was not properly admitted and constituted impermissible comment on the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Further, it found that the error was not harmless and, on the basis of that conclusion, reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded for a new trial. This Court granted leave to appeal, and we now determine whether the admission of the testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing argument constituted a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights under federal or Michigan law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The Court of Appeals relied on this Court\u2019s holding in <em>People v Bobo </em>to conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Fifth Amendment precluded the admission of testimony by the interrogating detective relaying the defendant\u2019s waiver of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and the subsequent interrogation during which the defendant answered some questions but was not directly responsive on the crucial question of the robbery.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The instant case presents the constitutional issue addressed in <em>Miranda, </em>that is, the substantive use of a defendant\u2019s statements and comments on a defendant\u2019s behavior, demeanor, and nonresponsive conduct after a valid waiver of his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. The constitutional question is resolved by asking first whether the trial judge correctly found a waiver, and second whether <em>Bobo </em>is to be read to provide any additional constitutional limitations on the substantive use of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">We can hypothesize situations in which a defendant\u2019s continued failure to respond might constitute an invocation of rights previously waived. We need not reach that question here. We are convinced that in the totality of these circumstances, the trial court correctly concluded that defendant did not invoke his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent until the morning following his arrest. This is not a case of a mute defendant whose silence is \"insolubly ambiguous\u201d because it may be \"nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d <em>Doyle, supra </em>at 617. Nor is it a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>case of a defendant who answers some questions and then asks for counsel, or even a case where a defendant expressly refuses to answer questions. This is a case of a defendant who did not respond to some questions while responding to others during the period of time in which the trial court found that the state had carried the heavy burden of proving that defendant had waived his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Thus, while it remained open to defendant to contend that the reason for answering neither yes nor no to certain questions was fear or confusion or other reasons consistent with innocence, the trial court did not err in holding that the defendant\u2019s conduct did not constitute an invocation of his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. The record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant did not invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege until the morning following the interrogation in issue. Not until then could the defendant again reasonably believe that the state was assuring him his conduct during the course of making a statement would not be used against him. <em>United States v Hale, </em>422 US 171, 182-183; 95 S Ct 2133; 45 L Ed 2d 99 (1975) (White, J., concurring).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s comment in his closing argument and the testimony in his case in chief referring to McReavy\u2019s failure to respond was not violative of <em>People v Bigge, </em>288 Mich 417; 285 NW <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>5 (1939). The prosecutor\u2019s theory of relevancy in <em>McReavy </em>was that although the defendant did not directly admit his involvement in the case, his responsive answers to some questions, i.e., that his landlord was not involved, that he was not saying that he was not involved, and that he would \"clear it all up tomorrow,\u201d were tacit indications of guilty knowledge. These are the statements of a party opponent under MRE 801(d)(2)(A), which are admissible if relevant. <em>Bigge, </em>on the other hand, precludes admissibility of a defendant\u2019s failure to say anything in the face of an accusation as an adoptive or tacit admission under MRE 801(d)(2)(B) unless the defendant \"manifested his adoption or belief in its truth . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The <em>Bigge </em>rule denies admissibility because the inference of relevancy rests solely on the defendant\u2019s failure to deny. As Wigmore states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">Silence, when the assertion of another person would naturally call for a dissent if it were untrue, may be equivalent to an assent to the assertion. This, however, fixes the party, by adoption, with the other person\u2019s assertion, and thus it ceases to be a question of conduct evidence, and involves a genuine admission in express words. [2 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn rev), \u00a7 292, pp 229-230.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In <em>McReavy, </em>we are addressing the admissibility of evidence of a party-opponent\u2019s demeanor and nonresponsive conduct. Unlike the <em>Bigge </em>adoptive admission preclusion, the relevancy of defendant\u2019s behavior in the instant case in neither denying nor admitting the direct inquiry rests not on a third party\u2019s assertion but on the admissions de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>fendant himself made, answers which circumstantially indicated defendant\u2019s knowledge of and involvement in the robbery.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s holding of his head in his hands is nonassertive conduct which in itself might not indicate his consciousness of guilt, but which in relation to his other answers is relevant to the jury\u2019s understanding of what defendant in fact said.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Under the rule of completeness, all is admissible.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The premise of the rule is that a thought or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>act cannot be accurately understood without considering the entire context and content in which the thought was expressed. That is what was done in <em>McReavy. </em>Defendant waived his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and gave statements, and neither a constitutional issue nor the <em>Bigge </em>evidentiary question of the probative significance of a defendant\u2019s failure to deny in the face of accusation is implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In <em>Rowan v Owens, </em>752 F2d 1186 (CA 7, 1984), cert den 476 US 1140 (1986), the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit considered a situation similar to that presented in <em>People v McReavy, </em>in which police officers testified on direct examination regarding limited statements made by a defendant after arrest, concluding with the defendant\u2019s statement that he did not want to say anything else. Distinguishing the situation in <em>Owens, </em>from that in <em>Doyle, </em>the court held that the officers\u2019 testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s post-Miranda admissions and his final statement that he \"didn\u2019t want to say anything else\u201d was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\"><em>If Rowan had refused </em>to say anything <em>after </em>being given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, <em>testimony about that refusal would have been improper </em>un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>der a long line of cases illustrated by <em>Doyle v Ohio, . . . </em>and <em>United States v Shue </em>[766 F2d 1122 (CA 7, 1985)], <em>because it would have invited the jury to infer Rowan\u2019s guilt from his refusal to incriminate himself. But since Rowan chose to waive his right of silence, the police were entitled to testify to any incriminating statements he made. </em>[The statement] that he had not been in the [victim\u2019s] home since 1970 . . . was an admission to which the police could testify, as they did, once Rowan had waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. And it was lawful for the police to indicate (provided they did not do so with undue emphasis, and they did not) the end as well as beginning of the interrogation, so that the jury would know that the officers\u2019 testimony was complete. <em>[Owens, supra </em>at 1190. Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">As the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit noted in <em>United States v Goldman, </em>563 F2d 501 (CA 1, 1977), cert den 434 US 1067 (1978), in addressing a defendant\u2019s objection to the use in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief of two questions asked during interrogation to which the defendant did not respond:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">After hearing the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, [the defendant] chose to make an exculpatory statement, and he answered most of the agent\u2019s questions probing that statement. We find that these facts meet the high standards of proof of waiver that <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 US 475; 86 S Ct 1602, sets out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">\"A defendant cannot have it both ways. If he talks, what he says or omits is to be judged on its merits or demerits, and not on some artificial standard that only the part that helps him can be later referred to. This was not a case where the government commented upon ... a prior exercise of rights. The government asked the jury to measure what the defendant said when he had no rights because he had voluntarily waived them.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>[Goldman, supra, </em>p 503, citing <em>Vitali v United States, </em>383 F2d 121, 123 (CA 1, 1967).[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Thus, a description of a defendant\u2019s behavior which serves to explain the circumstances and conduct of a defendant who has not invoked his right to remain silent will not be considered improper comment on the \"defendant\u2019s postarrest silence.\u201d <em>United States v Shaw, </em>701 F2d 367, 381 (CA 5, 1983), cert den 465 US 1067 (1984).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">S\u00dcMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">If the defendant had refused to say anything after being given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>about that refusal would have been improper. <em>Miranda, supra </em>at 468, n 37. The relevant inquiry is first whether the defendant has remained silent. If so, there is an irrebuttable presumption of irrelevancy, and such silence may not be used substantively or for impeachment purposes since there is no way to know after the fact whether it was due to the exercise of constitutional rights or to guilty knowledge.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Where the defendant has not maintained \"silence,\u201d but has chosen to speak, the Court has refused to endorse a formalistic view of silence. <em>Anderson, Warden v Charles, </em>447 US 404; 100 S Ct 2180; 65 L Ed 2d 222 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Unlike the situation in <em>Anderson, Warden v Charles </em>or <em>People v Cetlinski, </em>the instant case involves the use of defendant\u2019s statements and demeanor as substantive evidence of guilt. In situations where a defendant voluntarily waives his Fifth Amendment right to be silent, makes some statements, and then fails to respond to other questions, the focus of the inquiry is whether the defendant is now manifesting either a total or selective revocation of his earlier waiver of Fifth Amendment rights and whether that revocation is induced by the implicit assurances contained in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> If it is concluded that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>defendant\u2019s lack of response constituted invocation of the right to remain silent which was induced by the government, the failure to respond would again present the \"insoluble\u201d ambiguity that <em>Doyle </em>forbids.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> While we have no occasion here to state what conduct short of a formal exercise of the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent or a request for counsel would constitute an invocation, wherever that line is eventually to be drawn, it is not on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">We have found no authority for the proposition that a defendant\u2019s nonverbal conduct<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> during interrogation, after a valid waiver of the right to remain silent, is an exercise of that Fifth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>ment right to remain silent or that the \"description of partial silence\u201d in such a setting is an error of constitutional dimension.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We conclude that admission of testimony regarding defendant\u2019s conduct during the conversation did not violate the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment or the Michigan Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">There being no constitutional barrier to admission, the defendant\u2019s statement was admissible as the admission of a party opponent, subject to relevancy limits. The prosecutor used the defendant\u2019s statements and nonverbal conduct to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>that the defendant had in fact admitted the robbery when he said he would clear it up in the morning.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> While the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent undoubtedly may be invoked during interrogation, the facts of this case do not support a finding that defendant McReavy invoked that right.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The Fifth Amendment does not preclude substantive use of testimony concerning a defendant\u2019s behavior and demeanor during a custodial interrogation after a valid waiver of his Fifth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ment right against compelled self-incrimination. When a defendant speaks after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, a momentary pause or even a failure to answer a question will not be construed as an affirmative invocation by the defendant of the right to remain silent. Moreover a defendant\u2019s nonverbal conduct cannot be characterized as \"silence\u201d that is inadmissible per se under the Michigan Constitution. When constitutional obligations are fulfilled, use of a party opponent\u2019s statements and conduct are to be evaluated pursuant to MRE 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The trial court did not err in finding that defendant\u2019s failure to answer some questions was not an affirmative invocation of his right to remain silent. There was no impermissible comment at trial regarding the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. The Court of Appeals erred in reversing the defendant\u2019s convictions on the basis that the Fifth Amendment precluded testimony at trial describing the defendant\u2019s custodial interrogation, including a description of the defendant\u2019s behavior and demeanor and his failure to answer some questions during the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">We remand this case to the Court of Appeals for review of the defendant\u2019s remaining issues on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b324-8\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-11\"> <em>People v McReavy, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, decided January 14,1987 (Docket No. 88620).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">The dissent\u2019s position is made more problematic, given the Court of Appeals citation of <em>People v Staley, </em>127 Mich App 38; 338 NW2d 414 (1983) (where the Court of Appeals held that silence in the course of a statement was inadmissible under <em>Bobo), </em>and that Court\u2019s rejection of the holding in <em>People v Karam, </em>106 Mich App 383, 391; 308 NW2d 220 (1981), lv den 414 Mich 870 (1982) (where another panel of the Court of Appeals held that <em>Bobo </em>permits the use of nonutterances where \"silence is not maintained\u201d). In <em>Karam, </em>the Court noted that \"[rjecent decisions by the United States Supreme Court render <em>Bobo </em>of dubious precedential value relative to the proper construction of the Fifth Amendment\u201d and that \"it is not obvious that the Michigan Supreme Court would renounce <em>Bobo </em>as a matter of state constitutional law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388-390.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\"> See <em>United States v Ghiz, </em>491 F2d 599, 600 (CA 4, 1974), where the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">[I]f, in declining to answer certain questions, a criminal accused invokes his fifth amendment privilege or in any other manner indicates he is relying on his understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>warning, evidence of his silence or of his refusal to answer specific questions is inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">See also <em>United States v Williams, </em>665 F2d 107 (CA 6, 1981), where the defendant made incriminating statements during a postarrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>interview but refused to answer questions regarding the manner and amount of payment for a stolen truck. The Sixth Circuit found a violation of defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege when the fbi agent was examined at trial during the prosecution\u2019s case in chief as to the defendant\u2019s refusal to answer these questions. That court also held that testimony during the defendant\u2019s cross-examination that he did not answer certain questions violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Similarly, in <em>United States v Lewis, </em>651 F2d 1163 (CA 6, 1981), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held it was improper for the prosecution to comment upon the appellant\u2019s exercise of his constitutional right not to incriminate himself and to consult with counsel and thus required a reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction and a remand for a new trial. The agent had commented on the defendant\u2019s three refusals to answer the agent\u2019s questions and his two assertions of his right to counsel after which the interview was concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"AYG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Again, in <em>Odell v State, </em>90 Wis 2d 149; 279 NW2d 706 (1979) (per curiam), the Wisconsin Supreme Court also held the prosecutor\u2019s questioning and a detective\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s refusal to answer certain questions was constitutional error \"because . . . [t]he purpose of the evidence was to allow the jury to draw an inference of defendant\u2019s guilt from his refusal to explain the presence of the money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152. This, the court concluded, was a violation of the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination. Next, the <em>Odell </em>court addressed the impeachment use on cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s refusal to answer and found error under <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US 610; 96 S Ct 2240; 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976), noting: \"Upon rereading the record we conclude that the defendant\u2019s silence during the custodial interrogation is consistent with his exercise of his constitutional rights. After answering some questions <em>the defendant chose to assert his right to remain silent </em>... a defendant has a right to answer some questions after the <em>Miranda </em>warning and then to reassert the privilege and break off all questioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">These cases all involve factual situations where the defendant refused to speak or the Court of Appeals found that given the factual circumstances present in that case the defendant\u2019s refusal must he considered as a matter of law to be an exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. That is not the case here. In the instant case, we have a trial court determination that the defendant <em>did </em>waive his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and that he did not invoke that privilege until the morning following the challenged interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Upon the basis of a review of the <em>Walker </em>hearing transcript, there is no factual basis for the conclusion that the defendant refused to answer questions in such a manner that he was selectively relying on his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. (See <em>post, </em>pp 233, 235). At the <em>Walker </em>hearing, the prosecutor presented testimony that the procedural safeguards of <em>Miranda </em>were complied with and thus the prosecutor carried his burden in establishing the defendant voluntarily waived his Fifth Amendment privilege. At that point, the burden of going forward shifted to the defendant. The defendant had the opportunity to take the stand and assert that his \"nonutterances\u201d were refusals and that he understood that he was relying on his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, but he did not do so. Thus, the dissent attempts to (1) recharacterize the facts; and (2) regardless of the record, asserts that the defendant\u2019s \"nonutterances\u201d constitute a refusal' to answer questions. The only way to reach the result the dissent advocates is to characterize as a matter of law nonutterances as being the equivalent of an affirmative exercise of Fifth Amendment rights. There simply is no case support for that position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\"> The Court of Appeals found the <em>Bobo </em>issue dispositive and therefore did not address the defendant\u2019s remaining issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">1.

It also acknowledges that there is a line of cases to the contrary and thus feels it is unnecessary for this Court to adopt one line over another. What the dissent fails to observe is that there is no case supporting the claim that a defendant\u2019s absence of response in the course of making a statement as opposed, for example, to a statement that he refused to answer questions, or wanted counsel, constituted an invocation of a defendant\u2019s previously waived Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\"> <em>Bigge </em>concerns adoptive or tacit admissions.

The jury might have understood that term either as a reference to defendant\u2019s statements, i.e., his statement that he was not denying he was involved in the robbery, or understood that the term referred to defendant\u2019s \"silence.\u201d However, in this case, we find that any potential prejudice from that ambiguity was mitigated not only by the standard charges regarding the presumption of innocence and the fact that the attorney\u2019s comments are not evidence, but also by a specific charge regarding the appropriate manner of evaluating the detective\u2019s testimony regarding his interview of the defendant. The court said: \"Obviously words said to be written or spoken by a defendant should not be used against him unless he actually spoke or wrote those words.

On cross-examination defense counsel might or might not explore the fact that defendant did not directly admit the robbery; if he did explore it, on redirect the prosecutor would inquire regarding what defendant did not say and how he reacted to the questions. While the trial judge undoubtedly retains control of the order of proofs, and in cases where relevancy is not apparent, may direct and limit lines of inquiry, no such artificial parsing of testimony is required.

In that case, the suspect told the interrogating officers he wanted a lawyer if he was a suspect in the crime at issue. The officer\u2019s knowledge that defendant was a suspect rendered that invocation effective immediately.

Because we conclude that any error does not require reversal of Mc-Reavy\u2019s convictions, we join in reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and in remanding the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of issues raised by McReavy that were not addressed by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">McReavy\u2019s convictions stem from an armed robbery of a gas station and the abduction of the station attendant in the attendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">During the people\u2019s case in chief, the prosecutor elicited testimony from the two arresting officers regarding McReavy\u2019s postarrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>interrogation. The testimony included a reference to McReavy\u2019s failure to respond to \"direct\u201d questions about the robbery and a description of his de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>meanor when failing to respond.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> McReavy\u2019s objection was overruled. The officers also testified about McReavy\u2019s answers to other questions, including \"indirect\u201d questions about his involvement in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">McReavy did not testify. Under the circumstances of this case, the evidence was admissible, if at all, as substantive and not impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In closing argument, the prosecutor asserted that McReavy\u2019s failure to respond to the direct questions and his demeanor when he failed to respond were \"passive admissions.\u201d The prosecutor thus adverted to McReavy\u2019s failure to respond as substantive evidence of his guilt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">On appeal, McReavy claimed <em>Bobo </em>error and raised two other issues. The Court of Appeals found <em>Bobo </em>error requiring reversal in the admission over objection of the testimony concerning McReavy\u2019s failure to answer the direct questions and in the prosecutor\u2019s reference in closing argument to McReavy\u2019s \"passive admissions.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Court of Appeals did not address the other two issues raised by McReavy.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We agree with the majority that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed. We so conclude because any error in the testimony and argument concerning McReavy\u2019s failure to answer the direct questions does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">During his postarrest interrogation, McReavy responded to \"indirect\u201d questions. As related in the officers\u2019 testimony, McReavy stated that he had not received the gun used in the robbery from his roommate, that his roommate was not involved in the robbery, and that he was not denying that he was involved in the robbery. The first-hand knowledge manifested by these responses tended to incriminate McReavy.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Additionally, the victim identified McReavy at trial. A gun and the victim\u2019s car were found near McReavy\u2019s residence. Articles of clothing similar to those worn by the robber were found in Mc-Reavy\u2019s residence and did not belong to McReavy\u2019s roommate. McReavy owed his roommate rent, and paid him before he was able to cash his paycheck.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Whatever weight the jury may have placed on the testimony and argument concerning McReavy\u2019s failure to answer the \"direct\u201d questions was overshadowed by the probative significance of McReavy\u2019s \"indirect\u201d admissions and the other evidence tending to establish his guilt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">No more needs to be said to decide this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">The majority nevertheless employs the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>cutor\u2019s appeal in the instant case as a \"vehicle\u201d to opine on whether the substantive use of McReavy\u2019s \"silence\u201d was violative of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. It predicates reversal of the Court of Appeals in part on the conclusion that the officers\u2019 testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s argument concerning McReavy\u2019s failure to answer the direct questions did not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The majority thus ignores the well-established rule that this Court does not grapple with constitutional issues if there is a nonconstitutional basis on which the case can properly be decided. The course chosen is especially inappropriate under the circumstance that the United States Supreme Court, although it no doubt has had the opportunity to do so, has avoided deciding whether reference to \"partial silence\u201d as substantive evidence of guilt is violative of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Parenthetically, this case does not involve <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US 610; 96 S Ct 2240; 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976), where the United States Supreme Court held that the <em>impeachment </em>use of a defendant\u2019s silence violates the <em>Due Process Clause </em>where the defendant remained silent after the receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Because, and only because, the majority unnecessarily addresses the Fifth Amendment issue, we add the following commentary to its analysis of McReavy\u2019s claim under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The majority asserts that \"[t]he instant case presents the constitutional issue addressed in <em>Miranda, </em>that is, the substantive use of a defendant\u2019s statements and comments on a defendant\u2019s behavior, demeanor, and nonresponsive conduct after a valid waiver of his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and further describes the constitutional question as \"whether the trial court erred in finding that defendant waived his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination until he invoked his rights on the morning following the inquiry in question.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The majority would answer the question so posed in the negative.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">We disagree with the suggestion that the constitutional issue presented in this case was decided in <em>Miranda. </em>The issue in <em>Miranda </em>was the admissibility of <em>statements </em>made during custodial interroga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We all agree that McReavy\u2019s statements were admissible. We are not aware of any basis in the <em>Miranda </em>opinion for the majority\u2019s assertion that <em>Miranda </em>also involved the admissibility of a defendant\u2019s \"behavior, demeanor, and nonresponsive conduct.\u201d Nor did <em>Miranda </em>involve the admissibility of \"statements,\u201d or \"behavior, demeanor, and nonresponsive conduct,\u201d after a valid waiver of Fifth Amendment rights. Rather, the <em>Miranda </em>opinion dealt with the procedural safeguards necessary to validate a waiver of the rights discussed in <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The majority\u2019s emphasis on McReavy\u2019s \"waiver\u201d of his \"Fifth Amendment privilege\u201d is misplaced. The assertion that McReavy waived his privilege against self-incrimination is a legal conclusion that the custodial interrogation was conducted in compliance with the procedural requirements of <em>Miranda, </em>and that as a result McReavy\u2019s <em>statements </em>were the product of a knowing and intelligent decision not to exercise one of his Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The \"waiver\u201d is coextensive with the statement. McReavy had a right not to answer the direct questions about his involvement in the robbery, and this right was not waived because he answered indirect questions on the same subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The procedural requirements of <em>Miranda </em>are designed to ensure that an accused\u2019s statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>are voluntary and not the product of coercion inherent in custodial interrogation. The procedures seek to promote the intelligent exercise or nonexercise of Fifth Amendment rights by ensuring that the accused is informed of those rights at the outset of the interrogation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Miranda </em>thus requires, in addition to informing an accused that he has the right to remain silent, that he be informed of the possible consequences of not exercising that right,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> namely, \"that anything he says can be used against him.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7m5\"><em>Miranda </em>does not, however, provide that the accused must be advised that if he makes a statement, both what he says <em>and </em>what he fails to say can then be used against him.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Miranda </em>does not require that an accused be told that his <em>failure </em>to say something can be used against him. Without knowledge of the costs the majority would associate with making a statement, an accused is unable to make an intelligent decision whether to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination. The introduction of a defendant\u2019s failure to answer a particular question on the basis that the defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>answering other questions is thus inconsistent with the rationale of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">We acknowledge that some courts appear to have adopted the majority\u2019s approach.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Other courts, however, have held that the Fifth Amendment bars the substantive use of a defendant\u2019s failure to answer questions during custodial interrogation <em>in the course of which he answered other questions. </em>We advert to these decisions only because the majority has chosen to opine on the Fifth Amendment question.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In <em>United States v Williams, </em>665 F2d 107, 109 (CA 6, 1981), the defendant made incriminating statements during a postarrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>interview but refused to answer questions regarding his acquisition of a stolen truck. In its case in chief, the government elicited testimony from the interviewing agent that Williams had refused to discuss his purchase of the truck. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found <em>plain error, </em>and held that \"it clearly violated Williams\u2019 Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when the fbi agent was examined as to Williams\u2019 refusal to answer these questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">In <em>United States v Lewis, </em>651 F2d 1163 (CA 6, 1981), an irs special agent testified during the case in chief concerning an interview with Lewis. After describing the statements made by Lewis, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>agent testified that Lewis had refused to answer questions on three occasions and that he had twice requested counsel. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the testimony regarding Lewis\u2019 refusal to answer particular questions violated the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In <em>Odell v State, </em>90 Wis 2d 149, 152-153; 279 NW2d 706 (1979), a detective testified in the case in chief that Odell had made extensive statements during custodial interrogation, but that he had refused to answer questions concerning the source of money in his possession. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin held that the detective\u2019s testimony regarding Odell\u2019s refusal to answer those questions was violative of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because the testimony was used as a tacit admission of Odell\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In <em>United States v Ghiz, </em>491 F2d 599 (CA 4, 1974), the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of testimony during the case in chief that post-Miranda interrogation was terminated when Ghiz stated he did not wish to answer any questions about a stolen tractor. The court first noted that evidence of a defendant\u2019s refusal to answer particular questions is inadmissible if in so refusing, the defendant either expressly invoked the Fifth Amendment or otherwise indicated that he was relying on his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The court then held that Ghiz\u2019 statement, that he did not wish to talk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>about the tractor, was a clear indication of his reliance on the right to remain silent.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In most of the cases discussed in subsection 1 above, custodial interrogation appears to have been terminated after the accused \"refused\u201d to answer certain questions. The instant case might thus be \"distinguished\u201d on the ground that Mc-Reavy\u2019s interrogation continued after he \"refused\u201d to answer the direct questions about his involvement in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">With the possible exception of <em>Lewis, </em>the defendants in the cited cases did not state they would answer no further questions. Rather, after answering some questions the defendants \"refused\u201d to answer others, and the questioning was then terminated by the interrogating officer. These cases thus do not involve defendants who were asserting the right to terminate custodial interrogation,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> but rather defendants who were exercising the right not to answer a particular question.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">If an interrogator has fifteen questions and an accused is only willing to answer fourteen, it would be strange if the admissibility as substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>tive evidence of a failure to respond to one question depended on whether the interrogator asked that question first, fifth, tenth, or last.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">When a defendant is challenging the admissibility of <em>statements </em>made after he failed to answer a particular question, it may indeed be appropriate to require the defendant to have more clearly expressed his desire to invoke the \"right to remain silent.\u201d Absent such a clear expression, the interrogator may not have known that questioning should have stopped. Such concerns are not present in the instant case since the question here opined on does not concern the admissibility of statements.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The majority distinguishes the cited cases on the basis that those cases involved \"factual situations where the defendant refused to speak,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and that this case involves \"a defendant\u2019s absence of response in the course of making a statement as opposed, for example, to a statement that he refused to answer questions, or wanted counsel . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We do not find persuasive the suggested distinction between a \"refus[al] to answer questions\u201d and an \"absence of response,\u201d and neither did the courts in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Odell.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The majority also distinguishes the cited cases on the basis that in the instant case, \"we have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>trial court determination that the defendant <em>did </em>waive his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and that he did not invoke that privilege until the morning following the challenged interview.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In all the cited cases, however, the defendant made statements during custodial interrogation, and testimony concerning those statements was elicited in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief. There was thus a trial court determination, or it was uncontested, that the defendant had \"waived\u201d his Fifth Amendment rights. Again, we disagree with the majority concerning the significance of that \"waiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The majority goes on to say that \"[t]he defendant had the opportunity to take the stand [at the <em>Walker </em>hearing <em>(People v Walker [On </em>Rehearing], 374 Mich 331; 132 NW2d 87 [1965])] and assert that his 'nonutterances\u2019 were refusals and that he understood that he was relying on his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, but he did not do so.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The defendant does not have the burden of proof respecting the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation. It is the prosecutor who has that burden, a burden which applies to a defendant\u2019s \"nonutterances,\u201d at least where those \"nonutterances\u201d are said to be the defendant\u2019s admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">In sum, there appears to be a split of authority whether the Fifth Amendment permits the substantive use of a defendant\u2019s failure to answer particular questions during postarrest, post-<em>Miranda </em>interrogation.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Decision in the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>case does not require the Court to adopt one line of authority or the other, and we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u25a0 v</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Because, and only because, the majority unnecessarily addresses the constitutional question, we note that in addition to implicating the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the substantive use of a defendant\u2019s failure to respond to an incriminatory accusation also implicates decisions of this Court that are <em>not </em>based on the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In <em>People v Bigge, </em>288 Mich 417; 285 NW 5 (1939), the Court found error requiring reversal in the prosecutor\u2019s reference in his opening statement to Bigge\u2019s failure to deny an incriminatory accusation made in his presence.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The Court was required to decide whether evidence of Bigge\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d was admissible because if such evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>were admissible,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the prosecutor\u2019s remarks would have been proper as a statement of intended proof. The Court ruled that evidence of an incriminatory accusation made in the defendant\u2019s presence and his failure to deny the accusation could not be used as substantive evidence of guilt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">The time has not yet come when an accused must cock his ear to hear every damaging allegation against him and, if not denied by him, have the statement and his silence accepted as evidence of guilt. There can be no such thing as confession of guilt by silence in or out of court. The unanswered allegation by another of the guilt of a defendant is no confession of guilt on the part of a defendant. Defendant, if he heard the statement, was not morally or legally called upon to make denial or suffer his failure to do so to stand as evidence of his guilt. He said nothing, and what was said in his presence by another was inadmissible, just as the court later held. <em>[Id., </em>p 420.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The Court of Appeals has in a number of cases interpreted <em>Bigge </em>as generally prohibiting the use of tacit admissions in criminal trials.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Factors that may be germane to the question whether the substantive use of a defendant\u2019s silence violated the Fifth Amendment are <em>not </em>germane where the question is whether this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Bigge </em>was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The admissibility of tacit admissions in criminal cases does not depend on whether the defendant received the <em>Miranda </em>warnings before he failed to respond to an accusation made in his presence.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It is thus not controlling that the defendant was, or was not, relying on <em>Miranda </em>warnings when he failed to respond to the incriminatory accusation.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The admissibility of tacit admissions also does not depend on whether the defendant was in custody when he failed to respond to the accusation.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Nor does it depend on whether the defendant had already been arrested or otherwise formally accused.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It is thus not controlling whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>defendant was relying on any particular constitutional right that may have attached at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Further, the admissibility of tacit admissions does not depend on whether the defendant did, or did not, make statements during the conversation in which he failed to respond to an incriminatory accusation. In <em>Bigge, </em>the defendant\u2019s purported tacit admission occurred during a lengthy conversation in which he made statements, including inculpatory statements.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> It is thus not controlling that the failure to respond may be characterized as \"partial,\u201d rather than \"total,\u201d silence.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bigge </em>stands for the proposition that in a criminal case a defendant\u2019s failure to respond to an incriminatory accusation made in his presence is not admissible as substantive evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. The decision in <em>Bigge </em>was not based on the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Subsequent developments in Fifth Amendment jurisprudence do not affect, or put in question, the Court\u2019s holding in that case._</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Because, and only because, the majority unnecessarily addresses the substantive issues raised in this appeal, we consider whether this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bigge </em>applies to the facts of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">An officer testified on direct examination that \"I started asking [McReavy] questions directly about the robbery, his involvement. He would just sit and look down. He wouldn\u2019t respond yes or no.\u201d In closing argument, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">Remember what Detective Vincent said? There\u2019s no doubt in my mind about the robbery, that [McReavy] was involved in it. The questioning ceased. Not one denial, not one suggestion that it wasn\u2019t me. To the contrary, passive admissions. The man feels bad, he\u2019s got his head down, he\u2019s upset, doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The prosecutor asserted that McReavy\u2019s failure during custodial interrogation to respond to the direct questions and his accompanying demeanor was evidence of his guilt. The prosecutor\u2019s argument, and the testimony on which that argument was based, was thus violative of <em>Bigge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">We would not, however, reverse McReavy\u2019s convictions on the basis of that error.

The prosecutor may not make an impermissible argument to the jury simply because the evidence on which that argument is based was admissible for another purpose.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The majority also announces and then invokes a \"rule of completeness,\u201d under which \"all is admissible.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The premise of the asserted \"rule of completeness,\u201d under which all becomes admissible, is that a thought cannot be accurately understood without eliciting the entire utterance by which the thought was expressed.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The \"rule of completeness\u201d does not support the <em>unbounded </em>admissibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ity of a defendant\u2019s failure to answer questions. Silence in the face of accusation is not an utterance, and to suggest otherwise is to ignore this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bigge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Evidence of a defendant\u2019s failure to respond to particular questions and his accompanying demeanor is not admissible, or even relevant, simply because the defendant answered other questions.. A defendant\u2019s failure to respond to an incriminatory accusation or question\u2014which generally has no more probative significance than a failure to answer a question that was never asked\u2014is not per se transformed into a relevant \"omission\u201d once the defendant answers another question.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">That is not to say that a defendant\u2019s failure to respond to a question is per se irrelevant. The relevance of a defendant\u2019s failure to answer particular questions depends on the content of those questions and of the statements the defendant actually made. In this case, for example, there was a close similarity between the questions McReavy failed to answer and the questions he did answer, in particular, his response \" 'no\u2019 \u201d to the question whether he was denying that he had committed the robbery.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">We now consider other federal cases cited by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">The majority relies on <em>United States v Shaw, </em>701 F2d 367 (CA 5, 1983), to support the proposition that \"a description of a defendant\u2019s behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>which serves to explain the circumstances and conduct of a defendant who has not invoked his right to remain silent will not be considered improper comment on the 'defendant\u2019s postarrest silence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> <em>Shaw </em>is at most ambivalent support for the majority\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In <em>Shaw, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that testimony elicited on direct examination of a government witness concerning Shaw\u2019s reaction when he was informed why he was being questioned was proper.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">The lack of response to which the sheriff alluded merely expressed Shaw\u2019s demeanor during one point of the questioning. <em>Even if death were accidental, a few moments of speechless silence upon hearing of the death would be a normal reaction. </em>These remarks could not have been an impermissible comment on Shaw\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to silence following arrest because Shaw was not, at this time, exercising such a right. There was neither silence nor a comment, but simply a description of an interview where Shaw did give a statement and did not remain silent. <em>[Id., </em>p 385.
