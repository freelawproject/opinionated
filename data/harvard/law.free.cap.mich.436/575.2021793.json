Not only did he fail to object to the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant, counsel thereafter affirmatively sought to create the impression that the defendant\u2019s trial testimony, that he had told the police that the shooting was an accident, was truthful. Therefore, impeachment with inconsistent conduct, the refusal to give a statement, was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">There is no conflict on this record between <em>People v </em>Bobo, 390 Mich 355; 212 NW2d 190 (1973), and federal decisions construing the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Where a defendant claims that he gave an exculpatory statement to the police after arrest and warnings, neither <em>Bobo </em>nor any federal constitutional authority would preclude impeachment with prior inconsistent conduct, including silence. <em>Harris v New York, </em>401 US 222; 91 S Ct 643; 28 L Ed 2d 1 (1971). The Court of Appeals thus erred in holding that <em>Bobo </em>required reversal. On this point it has never been questioned that <em>Bobo </em>is coextensive with federal law. <em>People v Graham, </em>386 Mich 452; 192 NW2d 255 (1971). We would therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">To the extent that the Court of Appeals relied on <em>Bobo </em>to conclude that the Fifth Amendment prevented impeachment with all reference to post-arrest silence, the court erred. As a matter of constitutional law, the federal and Michigan Constitutions do not preclude the use of a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>prearrest or postarrest, <em>pre-Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>silence for purposes of impeachment at trial. <em>People v Cetlinski, </em>435 Mich 742; 460 NW2d 534 (1990). Nor is there any constitutional barrier to the impeachment use of postwarning silence where the defendant claims at trial that he did not remain silent but made statements to the police consistent with his exculpatory testimony. The prosecution cannot use postwarning silence to impeach a defendant\u2019s exculpatory trial testimony, but both <em>Bobo </em>and <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US 610; 96 S Ct 2240; 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976), recognize that silence is admissible to impeach a defendant\u2019s claim that he did not remain silent. <em>Bobo, supra, </em>p 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">To the extent the prosecutor\u2019s initial question might have been aimed intentionally at the defendant\u2019s postarrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>silence the question would have been objectionable under the rule of <em>Doyle </em>or <em>Greer v Miller, </em>483 US 756; 107 S Ct 3102; 97 L Ed 2d 618 (1987).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To the extent the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry called for an irrelevant answer, it would have been objectionable under <em>People v Collier, </em>426 Mich 23; 393 NW2d 346 (1986). However, these issues cannot be addressed on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The defendant\u2019s failure to object prevented development of a record that would allow us to decide whether the prosecutor\u2019s question was (1) a legitimate inquiry testing the credibility of defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>dant\u2019s testimony on direct examination implying that he would have made an explanation consistent with his trial testimony but for the police conduct in \"grabbing him,\u201d or (2) an attempt to make less probable the inference that the defendant sought to establish, i.e., that his prearrest conduct indicated his innocence, by exploring the defendant\u2019s statement on cross-examination that he had told Mr. Brandywine of the accident prior to going to the police and that he voluntarily went to the police. Thus, it is not possible to determine whether the inquiry was improper for constitutional or evidentiary reasons.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">We would resolve this case on the basis that the defendant failed to object and thereafter claimed that he had made a <em>post-Miranda </em>statement to the police consistent with his trial testimony. It was the defendant\u2019s position at trial that he did not remain silent. Moreover, the defendant affirmatively sought to establish that he did in fact make a pretrial statement and used that testimony to bolster his accident defense. Defendant thus converted a potentially objectionable situation into a claim of postarrest, postwarning conduct consistent with innocence. Evidence of Sutton\u2019s post-arrest, postcustody behavior was permissibly used not to impeach defendant\u2019s exculpatory story, but rather to directly contradict the claim that defendant <em>had </em>told his story after arrest. <em>People v Bobo, supra; Doyle v Ohio, supra, </em>pp 619-620, n 11. \"The shield provided by <em>Miranda </em>cannot be perverted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>into a license to use perjury by way of a defense, free from the risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances.\u201d <em>Harris, supra, </em>p 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">On February 14, 1982, the defendant, accompanied by the lawyer who ultimately became trial counsel, voluntarily came to the Taylor police station after learning that the police wanted to question him regarding the shooting death of Milton Taylor which took place the previous evening during a dance the defendant had attended with his brother. Upon arrival at the station, the police arrested the defendant and charged him with first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">At the defendant\u2019s trial,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the prosecution presented proofs that prior to the shooting incident, which took place sometime after midnight, the defendant\u2019s brother and the victim began to fight. As people tried to break up the fight, a shot was fired, hitting the victim. A witness testified that he saw the defendant pull out a gun and shoot the victim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The prosecutor also called Sergeant Thomas Bonner. He testified that, as part of the investigation, he had learned that the deceased uttered the words, \"Sutton shot me, Thomas Sutton shot me.\u201d The officer further testified that he learned that David Sutton, the defendant\u2019s brother, had no brother named Thomas and that he and the defendant were the only Suttons.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>During cross-examination of Sergeant Bonner, defense counsel began to suggest defendant\u2019s cooperation with the authorities by establishing that the defendant had initially voluntarily submitted himself to the police and was immediately charged with the crime, and further, that the defendant had voluntarily returned from Ohio following his flight from prosecution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No reference was made by the prosecution to any conduct of the defendant which might be construed as silence. The prosecution rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">The defendant took the stand and on direct examination by his counsel said that his brother had given him the gun to hold during the dance, and that around 2:00 A.M., while he was helping collect money from people at the doorway, somebody said a fight had started. The defendant stated that he rushed over when he saw that it was his brother fighting and that he pulled out the gun, and said \" 'Why don\u2019t somebody stop the fight?\u2019 \u201d At that point while he was trying to move closer to where his brother was fighting, the defendant stated that someone hit him and knocked the gun out of his hand. As he fell against one of the tables and tried to catch his balance he heard a weapon discharge. Defendant testified that he last saw the gun in the possession of a person named Hans-bury. He stated that he left the dance approximately one-half hour later, and that he never knew that anyone had been shot until the next day. The defendant testified that his only interest had been to protect his brother, and asserted that when he heard that someone had been shot he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>voluntarily went to the police department. He implied that he was prevented from relating his exculpatory version of the event when he added that he had no idea that he was going to be charged with murder and that Sergeant Bonner \"just grabbed me\u201d and said, \" 'You are being charged with first-degree murder.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>During cross-examination the defendant said that he did hear the gun go off after he dropped it, and that he did not look for the gun after he regained his balance and was on his feet. After composing himself, he looked around and saw a Mr. Hansbury walking down a hallway holding the gun. The prosecutor then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\"><em>Q. </em>You are telling me as soon as you got up from the table, Mr. Hansbury had the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\"><em>A. </em>When I seen [sic] him, he had it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\"><em>Q. </em>And what was Mr. Hansbury doing with the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\"><em>A. </em>He was walking down the hallway with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\"><em>Q. </em>Did he give it to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-11\"><em>A. </em>No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-12\"><em>Q. </em>Did you ask him for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-13\"><em>A. </em>No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-14\">' <em>Q. </em>How many people <em>at that point, </em>Mr. Sutton, did you tell that [it] was an accident, [that] the gun was knocked from your hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-15\"><em>A. </em>I told Mr. Brandywine.\u2122</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-16\">The prosecutor also asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-17\"><em>Q. </em>How many times did you inquire when you composed yourself from hitting that table, how many times did you inquire if anyone got shot because the gun went off?_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number><em>A. </em>I asked Mr. Brandywine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-3\">The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-4\"><em>Q. </em>Now, when, Mr. Sutton, did you first learn that someone had been shot at the Fandango Hall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\"><em>A. </em>The day after the cabaret.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\"><em>Q. </em>When did you tell the police it was an accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\"><em>A. </em>I can\u2019t remember exactly when.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\"><em>Q. </em>You did tell the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-9\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\"><em>Q. </em>Do you have any idea when you told the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-11\"><em>A. </em>No. I can\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-12\"><em>Q. </em>Do you have any idea what police you told?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-13\"><em>A. </em>Sergeant Bonner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-14\"><em>Q. </em>Sergeant Bonner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-15\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-16\"><em>Q. </em>What year was that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-17\"><em>A. </em>\u201982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-18\"><em>Q. </em>\u201982. Was that the same month of the shooting at the hall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-19\"><em>A. </em>I think so, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-20\"><em>Q. </em>Well, how did that occur? Did you call the police and tell them what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-21\"><em>A. </em>I was in police custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-22\">At this point, although no objection was made, the prosecutor asked no more questions regarding this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-23\">Thereafter the defendant rested. The prosecutor recalled Sergeant Bonner and asked one question, that is, \"at any time in 1982, did this defendant, ever, Mr. Sutton, ever, tell you that the shooting at the Fandango Hall was an accident?\u201d No objection was interposed, and Sergeant Bonner re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>sponded, \"No he did not.\u201d Defense counsel then cross-examined the witness and asked a series of questions suggesting that the defendant had told Sergeant Bonner the shooting was an accident when he was out of defense counsel\u2019s presence and that the Sergeant was lying when he said otherwise. Defense counsel\u2019s first question on recross was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\"><em>Q. [Mr. Henry]: </em>Sergeant Bonner, first of all, when I brought Mr. Sutton out there to you, you took him off to mug him and do whatever else had to be done out of my presence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\"><em>A. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\"><em>Q. </em>So then what\u2014when he said he told you it was an accident and you said he didn\u2019t tell you, then, it is you and him, he is lying. You can\u2019t be lying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\"><em>A. </em>I am not lying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\"><em>Q. </em>I know that you are just like Caesar\u2019s wife, honest and impeccable to the very last. You wouldn\u2019t say anything wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-11\"><em>A. </em>I am telling you the truth. I don\u2019t know what you want.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-12\"><em>Q. </em>I know. I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-13\"><em>Q. </em>But you are [sure] of what he said? Did he ever tell you that he deliberately shot anybody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-14\"><em>A. </em>No. He didn\u2019t say that, either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-15\">[Q.] Well, if you were so anxious to protect his rights, why couldn\u2019t I have gone back with him while you were there fingerprinting him and going through these very items with him? What reasons do you have to keep me from going back with him?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-16\">Once again the prosecution recalled Sergeant Bonner for a single question. When asked if the defendant had made any statement, Bonner re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>sponded that after receiving warnings regarding his constitutional rights the defendant said he did not want to make any statements. No objection was made, and again defense counsel recross-examined Sergeant Bonner and pursued a line of questioning which implied that the defendant had told the detective of his claim of accident when he was separated from counsel at the police station for the purpose of fingerprinting, that Bonner was \"running around trying to get people. ... to come in and testify against him,\u201d and then concluded, \"You are not supposed to make up a case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">In his closing argument, the prosecutor without objection referred to the fact that the police officer indicated that the defendant had not made a statement to the police that the shooting was an accident.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In closing, defense counsel stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">He said that he told them it was an accident. To say that he didn\u2019t make a formal statement when I am the one that said we don\u2019t want any formal statements made, period, and that\u2019s my judgment, not his.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">But when they take him back to talk to him, to fingerprint him, what-not, he said that he told them it was an accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">But who in the world\u2014How do you think they are ever going to believe him. They still are charging him with first-degree murder. They have shown him nothing but this hard side of the mountain. That\u2019s all they want to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Defendant Sutton was convicted by a jury of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>second-degree murder<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and subsequently was sentenced to prison terms of eight to twenty years and two years. The Court of Appeals reversed the convictions and held that the Fifth Amendment precluded cross-examining the defendant regarding when he had told the police the shooting was an accident.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Specifically noting <em>Collier </em>and citing <em>Bobo, </em>the panel observed that the <em>Collier </em>decision \"does not cast doubt on this Court\u2019s application of the <em>Bobo </em>rule\u201d and found,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">By asking defendant when he told the police that the shooting was an accident, the prosecutor infringed on defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The panel concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s argument deprived the defendant of a fair trial, citing <em>People v Sain, </em>407 Mich 412; 285 NW2d 772 (1979).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">The sequence of events in the instant case is critical to our conclusion that error, if any, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>waived. After direct examination of the defendant by defense counsel, the prosecutor directed cross examination to the defendant\u2019s testimony on direct examination that the shooting was an accident. After the defendant testified that he told Mr. Brandywine the gun was accidentally knocked from his hand, the prosecutor asked Sutton .when he told the police the shooting was an accident. It was at this point that the defendant testified that he made a postarrest, postcustody statement to Sergeant Bonner consistent with the exculpatory story he was now giving at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">After the defense rested, the prosecutor recalled Sergeant Bonner and asked one carefully worded question\u2014whether Sutton ever told Bonner that the shooting was an accident, and Sergeant Bonner replied that he had not. All this was done without objection by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">At this point, defense counsel cross-examined Sergeant Bonner and asked a series of questions suggesting that Sutton had made such a statement out of his attorney\u2019s presence and inferring that Sergeant Bonner was lying. Once again, on surrebuttal, the prosecution asked a single question\u2014 whether the defendant had made any statement to Sergeant Bonner. Sergeant Bonner responded that after giving Sutton <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Sutton said he wished to make no statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Presumably, both counsel were surprised by Sutton\u2019s answer, since there is no record evidence that Sutton said anything to the police. When, contrary to what the lawyers presumably anticipated, Sutton claimed that he had made such a statement to the police, the prosecutor was faced with the following conundrum, i.e., how to counter that statement without making reference to the defendant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>prosecutor did that in the only way he could\u2014by asking the officer one carefully worded question\u2014 whether the defendant had told the officer the shooting was an accident.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Defense counsel then had a tactical decision to make: (1) either to object to further questions and drop the subject or (2) to permit the questions to proceed and attempt to buttress his client\u2019s testimony by suggesting through his own examination of the police officer that the statement was in fact made. Defense counsel chose the latter course by suggesting through his cross-examination of Bonner that Bonner was lying and then resting without recalling his client. The prosecutor\u2019s single question of Sergeant Bonner on redirect examination was directly responsive to defense counsel\u2019s tactical decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The same able and experienced retained counsel who represented defendant when he surrendered to the police and who advised defendant not to make a statement, did not object to the question regarding whether defendant had told the police as well as Mr. Brandywine his exculpatory version <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>of the event.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nor did counsel object to seven subsequent questions regarding the same subject matter. Counsel thereafter strategically and affirmatively employed the defendant\u2019s answer that he told the police, \"when he was in custody,\u201d that the shooting \"was an accident\u201d to buttress the accident defense. It is our conclusion that the defendant intentionally waived any plausible objection and thus invited impeachment with his inconsistent postarrest, postcustody behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Defendant cannot assert that the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment confers a right to create the impression, free from contradiction, that he cooperated with the police and made a statement after arrest. <em>Bobo </em>and <em>Doyle </em>both grant a defendant the right to bar impeachment of the defendant\u2019s trial testimony where the government\u2019s impeachment theory is that maintaining silence is inconsistent with innocence. But both cases also expressly recognize that the bar to impeachment by silence of exculpatory trial testimony does not extend to impeachment with a refusal to speak during interrogation which is inconsistent with defendant\u2019s own statements at trial claiming that he made postarrest statements while in custody. As the court observed in an analogous situation in <em>United States v Fairchild, </em>505 F2d 1378, 1383 (CA 5, 1975), on this record, there is no doubt that \"the bar was lowered and [the defendant] discarded the shield which the law had created to protect him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The fact that a defendant\u2019s silence might ini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>tially have been excluded for constitutional reasons does not grant a defendant immunity from impeachment with inconsistent conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">Constitutional rights, like others, may be waived; and a criminal defendant may, by his conduct, make otherwise constitutionally inadmissible evidence admissible for certain purposes. <em>Harris v New York, </em>401 US 222; 91 S Ct 643; 28 L Ed 2d 1 (1971). Here the evidence of Fairchild\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>silence was admissible for the purpose of rebutting the impression which he attempted to create: that he cooperated fully with the law enforcement authorities. Thus, it was not error for the trial court to admit Detective Hobbs\u2019 testimony concerning Fairchild\u2019s silence at the police station following his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>[Fairchild, supra, </em>p 1383.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">United States Supreme Court cases decided subsequent to our holding in <em>Bobo </em>establish that when a defendant takes the stand and testifies the privilege against self-incrimination is waived and the defendant may be impeached with both prearrest silence and postarrest <em>pre-Miranda </em>silence without violating the Fifth Amendment. <em>Jenkins v Anderson, </em>447 US 231; 100 S Ct 2124; 65 L Ed 2d 86 (1980); <em>Fletcher v Weir, </em>455 US 603; 102 S Ct 1309; 71 L Ed 2d 490 (1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Where silence follows <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Fourteenth Amendment due process bars the use of such evidence to impeach a defendant\u2019s exculpatory explanation at trial provided that the defendant does not claim \"to have told the police the same version upon arrest.\u201d <em>Doyle v Ohio, supra, </em>pp 619-620, n 11. Thus <em>Doyle </em>establishes that the discrepancy between a defendant\u2019s exculpatory story at trial and his postarrest, postwarning silence is not available to the state to impeach the credibility of the defendant\u2019s exculpatory testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>mony. In this situation, silence has no probative value because \"[s]ilence in the wake of these warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d <em>Doyle, </em>p 617.

On cross-examination, defense counsel thereafter suggested that the defendant had made consistent exculpatory statements when Bonner separated defendant from counsel to fingerprint him, asking Bonner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">Well, if you were so anxious to protect his rights, why couldn\u2019t I [defense counsel] have gone back with him while you were there fingerprinting him . . . ?

This testimony, if believed by the factfinder, would surely be seen as significantly enhancing the truthfulness of the defendant\u2019s accident defense and of the defense sub theme that the police had \"pinned\u201d the crime on an innocent man. For precisely this reason, we can find no fundamental unfairness in admitting evidence of the defendant\u2019s inconsistent conduct in declining to make a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Inquiry regarding postarrest <em>post-Miranda </em>silence is not error where the prosecutor is seeking not to impeach the defendant\u2019s exculpatory story with silence, but rather to challenge the defendant\u2019s trial testimony regarding his postarrest behavior.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Indeed, <em>Doyle </em>itself recognizes that impeachment with postarrest <em>post-Miranda </em>silence is permissible to contradict a defendant\u2019s trial testimony of an exculpatory version of events and claim that the same story had been told on arrest, an exception recognized by this Court in <em>People v Graham, supra, </em>whose continued vitality was approved in <em>Bobo </em>itself, p 359. We reiterate the Court\u2019s observation in <em>Doyle:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">It goes almost without saying that the fact of post-arrest silence could be used by the prosecution to contradict a defendant who testifies to an exculpatory version of events and claims to have told the police the same version upon arrest.

Cf. <em>United States v Fairchild, </em>505 F2d 1378, 1383 (CA 5, 1975). <em>[Doyle v Ohio, supra, </em>p 619, n 11.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The constitution protects the rights of all. It does not license a defendant to present testimony directly contradictory of other proven facts to the factfinder, free from the risk that he will not be impeached. \"It goes almost without saying\u201d that at the bottom of this is the claim of a constitutional right to immunity from contradiction, a claim that has not been endorsed by this Court or any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Construing <em>People v Bobo </em>as coextensive with federal precedent, we hold that impeachment of exculpatory testimony with pre- or postarrest, preMiranda silence is permissible under the Michigan Constitution. Likewise, a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment which precludes the use of a defendant\u2019s silence following <em>Miranda </em>warnings to impeach an exculpatory story.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">However, defendant Sutton did not offer only an exculpatory story, but affirmatively stated and pursued the theory that he had made a postarrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>warning statement to the police consistent with his trial testimony. Nothing in the Fifth Amendment or <em>Bobo </em>itself allows a defendant to so testify free from contradiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">In these circumstances, the prosecution was not precluded from rebutting defendant\u2019s claims of postcustody statements consistent with his accident defense with evidence of the defendant\u2019s post-warning silence. Defendant chose to make affirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>tive use of his purported cooperation with the police and thus waived the protection the constitution would otherwise have afforded.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Accordingly, we reinstate the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b702-7\">Riley, C.J., and Griffin, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-9\"> However, had the prosecution intended to pursue an impermissible line of inquiry, no actual <em>Doyle </em>violation occurred in this case. The prosecutor\u2019s question produced the answer that the defendant had told the police it was an accident. Thus, there was not a <em>use </em>of the defendant\u2019s silence after invoking his <em>Miranda </em>rights, violative of the defendant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights. Had the defendant objected, the question would be analyzed as an attempt to violate <em>Doyle </em>evaluated under the fair trial standards of <em>Greer, supra, </em>and <em>People v Sain, </em>407 Mich 412; 285 NW2d 772 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b683-5\"> The dissent observes there are only three possible responses by Sutton to the prosecutor\u2019s question when he told the police the shooting was an accident. <em>(Post, </em>pp 602-603.) There is, however, a fourth possibility: defendant could have responded that he did inform the police and this statement was made prearrest and <em>pre-Miranda. </em>This logical fallacy of the dissent is the assumption that the question called for a response directed at <em>post-Miranda </em>silence.

It was only after these additional questions were asked that the prosecutor ended his inquiry. Moreover, all these questions were asked and answered without objection from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">The fact that the prosecutor did not go further is perhaps explained by the fact that he knew Sutton had not made a statement. Thus, rather than bring out what Sutton had purportedly said through Sutton\u2019s own words on cross-examination, he wisely left to defense counsel the choice whether to drop the subject or to pursue an inquiry regarding what Sutton actually said. Defense counsel chose to pursue the <em>content </em>of the purported statement through suggestive questioning of Bonner. It is not <em>who </em>was questioned, but the fact that the theory was pursued that evidences the tactical decision of defense counsel. <em>(Post, </em>pp 606-607.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b693-6\"> It is arguable that defendant had already opened the door to a full, and not merely selective, development of the subject of cooperation which he himself broached during his direct testimony. Assuming, however, that defendant had not yet opened the door, a timely objection to the prosecutor\u2019s question on cross-examination would have at a minimum forced the prosecutor to clarify the theory on which he based the impeachment. An objection might have resulted in a direction from the trial court that the prosecutor\u2019s question was to be limited to the prearrest <em>pre-Miranda </em>warning period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\"> In <em>Anderson, Warden v Charles, </em>447 US 404; 100 S Ct 2180; 65 L Ed 2d 222 (1980) (per curiam), the Court held it was not a violation of due process for the state to admit evidence of the defendant\u2019s post-arrest <em>post-Miranda </em>statement if there is a factual inconsistency between the defendant\u2019s postarrest statement and his trial assertions. <em>Id., </em>p 409.

The <em>Doyle </em>Court, however, made no such distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\"> Some courts hold that where postarrest post <em>-Miranda </em>silence is arguably in question, the burden is on the prosecutor to establish that there is a permissible line of inquiry. In <em>State v Lofquest, </em>227 Neb 567; 418 NW2d 595 (1988), the prosecutor\u2019s questions and statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>were directed specifically to the postarrest time period. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the prosecutor continued with a line of questioning and remarks as to what police might have done had the defendant told his story as he should have, and the court found <em>Doyle </em>error on the basis that it was impossible to discern for purposes of a <em>Doyle </em>inquiry, what period of silence the prosecutor was referring to, preMiranda or <em>post-Miranda. Id., </em>p 570. See also <em>United States ex rel Allen v Franzen, </em>659 F2d 745 (CA 7, 1981), cert den 456 US 928 (1982). Further, in both <em>Lofquest </em>and <em>Franzen </em>credibility was closely contested, and the prosecutorial comments and questions, directed to the postarrest time periods, made it impossible to determine whether the references were to silences occurring during the pre- or post-Miranda time periods and constituted violations of the defendants\u2019 rights to due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b697-5\"> No \"use\u201d was made of defendant\u2019s silence because defendant claimed he had not remained silent. In constitutional terms, the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry might only have been a <em>Greer </em>error, i.e., an intentional attempt to use the defendant\u2019s silence, requiring reversal where it has so infected the process as to deprive defendant of a fair trial. It might also have been a permissible reference to prearrest silence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b697-6\"> It could fairly be said that both the defense and prosecuting attorneys engaged in sharp practice. Had the prosecutor made affirmative use of the defendant\u2019s silence in his closing argument, and the defendant had objected, <em>People v Sain, supra, </em>might require reversal. The record, however, does not reveal \"that the prosecutor seized upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the response of the police officer and used it to maximum advantage.\u201d Here, unlike in <em>Sain, </em>the prosecutor did not \"clearly and repeatedly ask[ ] the jury to consider, as a factor in favor of a finding of guilt, that the defendant, when confronted by the police at the time of his arrest, remained silent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 415-416.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\"> Thus, <em>Lofquest </em>and <em>Franzen </em>are distinguishable from the facts and issues presented in <em>Sutton. </em>Unlike the instant case, in <em>Lofquest </em>and <em>Franzen </em>the defendant did <em>not </em>testify at trial that he gave a statement to the police that was consistent with his exculpatory story given at trial. As noted in <em>Doyle, supra, </em>pp 619-620, n 11, in <em>Sutton </em>the defendant\u2019s silence was not used to impeach his exculpatory story given at trial. Rather, it was used to impeach the defendant\u2019s trial testimony that he gave that exculpatory story \"while in custody\u201d with his inconsistent behavior following his arrest. Thus, there could be no <em>Doyle </em>error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b698-10\"> In <em>United States v Havens, </em>446 US 620; 100 S Ct 1912; 64 L Ed 2d 559 (1980), the Supreme Court rejected the claim that rebuttal evidence was limited to contradiction of a particular statement made by a defendant during his direct examination. The court held that \"a defendant\u2019s statements made in response to proper cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>reasonably suggested by the defendant\u2019s direct examination are subject to otherwise proper impeachment by the government, albeit by evidence that has been illegally obtained and that is inadmissible on the government\u2019s direct case, or otherwise, as substantive evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 627-628.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">We agree with Chief Justice Riley\u2019s position in <em>People v Dyson, </em>106 Mich App 90; 307 NW2d 739 (1981). The facts in <em>Dyson </em>are similar to those in <em>Sutton. </em>In <em>Dyson, </em>the defendant took the stand and presented an alibi defense. He was then asked on cross-examination whether he told his alibi to the complainant when she identified him, and he responded that he had. Moreover, he testified that he also told the police when they first stopped him. On redirect examination, the defendant maintained that he attempted to tell the officers but they told him to \"shut-up.\u201d On recross-examination, the defendant testified that he offered his story to the police but they were not interested in hearing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In rebuttal to the defendant\u2019s testimony, the prosecution recalled the two arresting officers. In response to narrow specific questions, both testified contrary to the defendant\u2019s testimony that he had not told them at the time of arrest of his alibi. The <em>Dyson </em>Court concluded, \"[o]n these facts, we find that the officers\u2019 testimony was proper rebuttal testimony. . . .

Either:</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">\u2014Sutton would respond that he had not so informed the police; such a response would convey to the jury that Sutton did not, after he had received the <em>Miranda </em>warnings,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> tell the police that the shooting was an accident, which would have been violative of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US 610; 96 S Ct 2240; 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976); such a response might also convey to the jury that Sutton did not, before he was arrested and given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> tell the police that the shooting was an accident, which would have been violative of the interpretation of <em>Bobo </em>that prevailed when Sutton was tried; or</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\u2014Sutton\u2019s lawyer would object to the question, and the objection would be sustained, with the result that the jury would assume that Sutton did not tell the police that the shooting was an accident; this would have the same effect as a practical matter as if Sutton\u2019s lawyer had not objected and Sutton had testified that he did not so inform the police; or_</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>\u2014Sutton would respond that he did inform the police that the shooting was an accident, and the prosecutor would call the police officer who would testify that Sutton did not so inform the police. That is what occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Thus, by asking the question, the prosecutor assured that\u2014regardless of what Sutton or his lawyer did or did not say\u2014the jury would learn that the prosecutor claimed that Sutton had not informed the police that the shooting was an accident. This case does not involve <em>Cetlinski, McReavy, </em>or <em>Bobo. </em>It involves <em>Ignofo.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We agree with the Court of Appeals that Sutton did not receive a fair trial, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Sutton\u2019s convictions stem from a shooting at a party during the early morning hours of February 13, 1982. During the people\u2019s case in chief, the prosecutor presented evidence that immediately before the shooting there was a fight between the decedent and Sutton\u2019s brother and that as other persons were attempting to break up the fight a shot was fired, hitting the decedent. One witness testified that he saw Sutton pull a gun and shoot the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Sutton claimed the shooting was accidental. On direct examination, he testified that he had taken the gun in hand in an attempt to break up the fight between his brother and the decedent. He said that someone knocked him into a table causing him to drop the gun and that the gun discharged when it hit the floor. He said that on the night of the incident he did not know that anyone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>had been shot and that when he left the party the police had not arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor sought to impeach Sutton\u2019s testimony by asking him when he first told the police the shooting was an accident. Sutton responded that while \"in police custody\u201d in February, 1982, he informed Sergeant Bonner, the arresting officer, that the shooting was an accident.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Sutton\u2019s lawyer did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">After the defense rested, the prosecutor recalled Bonner who testified that Sutton did not at any time in 1982 tell him the shooting was an accident.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Sutton\u2019s lawyer did not object. On cross-examination, Sutton\u2019s lawyer implied that Bonner was lying and that the police had kept the lawyer from Sutton when Sutton was being processed at the police station. Once again, the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>called Bonner who testified that he gave Sutton the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and that Sutton said that on the advice of his lawyer he did not want to make a statement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Again, Sutton\u2019s lawyer did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">In closing argument, the prosecutor, without objection, referred to both Sutton\u2019s failure to relate his exculpatory version to the police when he was arrested and Sutton\u2019s exercise of the right to remain silent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed Sutton\u2019s convictions on the grounds that the prosecutor violated <em>Bobo </em>by asking Sutton when he told the police the shooting was an accident, and that Sutton had been denied a fair trial in light of the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination, Bonner\u2019s testimony that when advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights Sutton told him he did not wish to make a statement, and the prosecutor\u2019s reference in closing argument to Bonner\u2019s rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Analysis should begin with and focus on the prosecutor\u2019s initial inquiry\u2014during cross-examination of Sutton\u2014whether Sutton had informed the police that the shooting was an accident.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>that inquiry\u2014not Sutton\u2019s testimony on direct examination<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>\u2014that set in motion the chain of events that culminated in the repeated introduction of Sutton\u2019s failure to inform the police that the shooting was an accident and of his exercise of the right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">When the prosecutor asked Sutton whether he had informed the police that the shooting was an accident, he was attempting to accomplish one of two purposes: 1) to elicit a prior statement that was inconsistent with Sutton\u2019s testimony on direct examination, or 2) to elicit Sutton\u2019s \"silence\u201d (i.e., his failure to tell the police that the shooting was an accident). It is manifest from the record in this case that the prosecutor was attempting to bring out Sutton\u2019s \"silence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Sutton responded to the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry on cross-examination that he had made a statement. Instead of searching for inconsistencies between Sutton\u2019s \"statement\u201d and his testimony on direct examination, the prosecutor \"asked no more questions regarding this subject\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> after Sutton testified that while \"in police custody\u201d in February, 1982, he told Bonner that the shooting was an accident. If the prosecutor\u2019s intention had been to impeach Sutton\u2019s direct testimony with a prior inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>statement, he would have inquired further about the statement Sutton allegedly made to Bonner.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The prosecutor sought to bring out that Sutton had not stated that the shooting was an accident. The question remains whether it was permissible to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The prosecution\u2019s evidence indicated that Sutton remained completely silent after he was arrested and given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The Due Process Clause as elucidated in <em>Doyle, supra, </em>barred the impeachment of Sutton\u2019s direct testimony with his postarrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>failure to inform the police that the shooting was an accident.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Parenthetically, impeachment of Sutton\u2019s direct testimony with his prearrest or postarrest, preMiranda \"silence\u201d would not have been constitutionally impermissible. <em>Jenkins v Anderson, </em>447 US 231; 100 S Ct 2124; 65 L Ed 2d 86 (1980); <em>Fletcher v Weir, </em>455 US 603; 102 S Ct 1309; 71 L Ed 2d 490 (1982). The impeachment use of such evidence would, however, have been impermissible under the interpretation of <em>Bobo </em>that prevailed when Sutton was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The record in the instant case indicates that the prosecutor failed to confine his initial inquiry on cross-examination to the constitutionally permissible <em>pre-Miranda </em>time frame. The prosecutor narrowed his inquiry no further than the month of February, 1982, which included both a preMiranda period (February 13-14)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and a <em>postMiranda </em>period (February 14-28).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Where prosecutorial questioning has been found to refer to both pre- and <em>post-Miranda </em>silence, courts have found <em>Doyle </em>error.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">In <em>State v Lofquest, </em>227 Neb 567, 570; 418 NW2d 595 (1988), the Supreme Court of Nebraska held that prosecutorial questioning and comment which \"could be construed as referring to [Lofquest\u2019s] silence from the first police contact through the moment before Lofquest told his story at trial\u201d violated the Due Process Clause where the record established that Lofquest had received the <em>Miranda </em>warnings at some point before his trial.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>In a case such as this where a pr <em>e-Miranda </em>and <em>post-Miranda </em>timeframe may exist, difficulties arise when general references are made to a defendant\u2019s silence, which a reasonable juror could construe as including the post-Miranda silence period. We cannot allow prosecutors to sidestep the <em>Doyle </em>protections by skirting the edge of the law with vague and imprecise references to a defendant\u2019s silence. [Id]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">We share those concerns. The United States Constitution provides that a defendant has the right not to be impeached with his <em>post-Miranda </em>silence. Prosecutors who intend to introduce evidence of a defendant\u2019s pretrial silence are obliged to clearly limit their questioning\u2014with or without objection<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>\u2014to the pr <em>e-Miranda </em>period.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Pursuant to the evidentiary framework adopted in <em>People v Collier, </em>426 Mich 23; 393 NW2d 346 (1986),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Sutton\u2019s failure to inform the police that the shooting was an accident was inadmissible on the additional basis that such evidence did not have probative value to impeach Sutton\u2019s direct testimony that the shooting was an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">This is a case in which the defendant\u2019s \"exculpatory\u201d version of the events was incriminatory. Sutton\u2019s testimony indicated that at the time of the shooting he was carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. Informing the police of his \"exculpatory\u201d version would thus have meant confessing to the commission of a firearms violation<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and to whatever offense might attach to an accidental killing.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, it would not have been natural for Sutton to have come forward.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As a result, his failure to do so did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>have probative value to impeach his testimony that the shooting was an accident, and such evidence was inadmissible for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">When the prosecutor asked Sutton whether he had informed the police in February, 1982, that the shooting was an accident, his manifest intention was to impeach Sutton\u2019s testimony that the shooting was an accident by showing that Sutton had not previously asserted this exculpatory version of the shooting.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> However, Sutton\u2019s \"silence,\u201d as defined by the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry, was not at the time admissible for that purpose under either the United States Constitution<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> or this state\u2019s evidence law.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Sutton was thus asked a question to which either response would have led to the introduction of inadmissible evidence. He could have responded that he had not informed the police that the shooting was an accident, or\u2014as occurred\u2014Bonner could so testify to rebut Sutton\u2019s response that he had related the exculpatory version to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Sutton might have prevented the introduction of <em>testimony </em>concerning his silence if his lawyer had objected to the prosecutor\u2019s initial question on cross-examination. It could thus be said that Sutton \"waived\u201d his right not to be impeached with <em>post-Miranda </em>silence when his lawyer failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Under the circumstances of this case, we decline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>to so construe the failure of Sutton\u2019s lawyer to object. There was a significant probability that an objection would have conveyed to the jury that Sutton had not told the police that the shooting was an accident. The failure to take an action that would itself have undermined the right not to be impeached with post <em>-Miranda </em>silence cannot fairly be deemed a waiver of the right not to be impeached with <em>post-Miranda </em>silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">If Sutton\u2019s lawyer had objected and the objection had been sustained, the jury probably would have speculated whether Sutton had informed the police that the shooting was an accident. If the jury had so speculated, it likely would have assumed that Sutton had not informed the police that the shooting was an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">There were in essence only two answers to the prosecutor\u2019s question. Either Sutton told the police that the shooting was an accident, or he did not. The jury likely would have assumed that if Sutton had told the police that the shooting was an accident, he would have so testified on direct examination<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> or he would have sought to so testify on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">If Sutton\u2019s lawyer had objected and the objection had been sustained, it is thus likely the jury would have disregarded one of the two possible answers to the prosecutor\u2019s question. The other answer\u2014 that Sutton had not informed the police that the shooting was an accident\u2014is, of course, something the prosecutor could not permissibly have proved during cross-examination of Sutton.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>stant case, the harm was in the asking.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Analogous is <em>People v Ignofo, </em>315 Mich 626; 24 NW2d 514 (1946). There, the prosecutor cross-examined Ignofo about a conversation with his ex-wife in which they allegedly discussed Ignofo\u2019s involvement in a murder. Ignofo\u2019s lawyer did not object. Because of the statutory privilege pertaining to confidential marital communications,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Ignofo\u2019s ex-wife could not have testified about any statements she had made. In answering the prosecutor\u2019s questions, Ignofo did not disclose any privileged marital communications, but instead denied that his former wife had made any statements regarding his involvement in the murder.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Relying on <em>People v Salisbury, </em>218 Mich 529; 188 NW 340 (1922),<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> the Court found prejudicial error in the cross-examination and said that \"[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>failure of counsel to object to this line of questioning did not nullify the error.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">As in <em>Ignofo, </em>the prosecutor in the instant case could not have introduced the challenged evidence in the case in chief.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In both <em>Ignofo </em>and the instant case, the prosecutor' sought on cross-examination of the defendant to put before the jury otherwise inadmissible evidence. We see no reason to distinguish between creating an impression through questioning <em>(Ignofo), </em>and creating an impression by causing an objection or questioning to establish a predicate for the subsequent introduction of rebuttal testimony <em>(Sutton).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">On cross-examination and recross-examination of Bonner, Sutton\u2019s lawyer implied that Bonner was lying, and in closing argument the lawyer again stated that Sutton had informed the police that the shooting was an accident. It could thus be said that Sutton waived his right not to be impeached with <em>post-Miranda </em>silence on the theory that Sutton\u2019s lawyer placed in issue his postarrest conduct when he adopted the position that Sutton had informed Bonner that the shooting was an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Under the circumstances of this case, the position taken by Sutton\u2019s lawyer cannot fairly be deemed a waiver of Sutton\u2019s right not to be impeached with post-Miranda silence. The assertions of Sutton\u2019s lawyer that Bonner was lying came after Bonner asserted that Sutton was lying. A defense lawyer is not expected to allow testimony that directly contradicts the testimony of his client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>to go unchallenged. Enforcement of a defendant\u2019s right not to be impeached with post <em>-Miranda </em>silence cannot properly be conditioned on surrender at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">It may seem that our ruling allows a defendant to have his cake and eat it too. In the instant case, however, it was the prosecutor, and not the defendant, who baked the cake.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The reference to Sutton\u2019s silence was not an isolated occurrence. Not only did Bonner testify regarding Sutton\u2019s failure to disclose the exculpatory version, he also testified regarding Sutton\u2019s post-Miranda exercise of the right to remain silent. The prosecutor referred to this testimony in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The prosecutor asked an impermissible question during his cross-examination of Sutton. The result was a side show, a minitrial concerning a subject that should not have been broached and should not have been permitted to go further.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that Sutton did not receive a fair trial. Sutton\u2019s trial was a close credibility contest in which Sutton denied shooting the decedent, and one witness alone, among many present at the incident, testified that he saw Sutton shoot the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The lead opinion places emphasis on several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>decisions sustaining the use of a defendant\u2019s post-Miranda silence to impeach trial testimony regarding his postarrest conduct. This exception to the general rule against impeachment with post-Miranda silence was recognized by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Doyle.</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If Sutton had testified on <em>direct </em>examination that he had informed the police that the shooting was an accident, this exception would indeed be applicable to the prosecutor\u2019s initial inquiry on cross-examination of Sutton. On the facts of this case, however, the authorities cited by the lead opinion are inapplicable <em>to the prosecutor\u2019s initial inquiry on cross-examination.</em><footnotemark><em>42</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In <em>United States v Mavrick, </em>601 F2d 921 (CA 7, 1979), the defendant testified on direct examination that when he was arrested he was not given an opportunity to oifer his exculpatory version of events to the police. In light of the impression created by Mavrick\u2019s testimony, the court concluded that it was permissible for the prosecutor to ask Mavrick whether he had been given an opportunity to explain his conduct to the fbi agents who took him into custody shortly after he was arrested.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In the instant case, Sutton\u2019s testimony on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>direct examination did not create the impression that when he was arrested he had been denied an opportunity to tell the police that the shooting was an accident.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">In <em>United States v Fairchild, </em>505 F2d 1378 (CA 5, 1975), the prosecutor elicited testimony from a police officer that after receiving the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the defendant had refused to make a statement. However, unlike <em>Sutton, </em>the defendant\u2019s lawyer in <em>Fairchild </em>created the impression through cross-examination of a different government witness that his client had cooperated fully with the authorities.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry was permissible to rebut the impression that Fairchild had cooperated with the authorities. In the instant case, Sutton\u2019s lawyer did not create a similar impression through his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>cross-examination of Bonner during the prosecution\u2019s case in chief.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">In <em>United States v Conlin, </em>551 F2d 534, 537 (CA 2, 1977), the defendant\u2019s lawyer \"propounded the theory that Conlin had spoken throughout the incident and had maintained from the outset that he had [an innocent explanation for his apparently unlawful conduct].\u201d This theory was advanced during cross-examination of a government witness and through Conlin\u2019s own testimony. In the instant case, neither Sutton on direct examination nor his lawyer on cross-examination of Bonner during the prosecution\u2019s case in chief advanced the theory that Sutton had continuously asserted his innocence, at the time of the shooting or thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">There is no basis on which it can be said that Sutton\u2019s testimony on direct examination created an inference\u2014\"arguable\u201d or otherwise\u2014that legitimately could be rebutted by testimony about his <em>post-Miranda </em>silence. There is no basis in fact for the lead opinion\u2019s suggestion that the prosecutor\u2019s initial inquiry on cross-examination might have been permissible to test \"the credibility of defendant\u2019s testimony on direct examination implying that he would have made an explanation consis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>tent with his trial testimony but for the police conduct in 'grabbing him\u2019 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_Hh\">It is difficult to imagine a more routine description of an arrest than Sutton\u2019s testimony that the police grabbed him and informed him that he was being charged with first-degree murder.
