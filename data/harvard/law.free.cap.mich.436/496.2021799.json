She filed for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and obtained an open award of $61 per week.

Fifteen of the petitions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were deemed to have been properly filed, and $22,500 in penalties, $1,500 for each petition, was awarded against M-R Products.

Not more than $1,500.00 in total may be added pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>this subsection. [MCL 418.801(2); MSA 17.237(801)(2). Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The subsection refers to both \"weekly compensation benefits\u201d and \"accrued weekly benefits.\u201d When \"weekly compensation benefits\u201d remain unpaid they are moved out of the category of \"weekly compensation benefits\u201d into \"accrued weekly benefits.\u201d Weekly compensation and accrued weekly benefits are subcategories of \"benefits.\u201d Thus, $50 per day is required to be added for each day \"in which the <em>benefits </em>are not paid\u201d whether unpaid for weekly compensation <em>or </em>accrued weekly benefits or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The last sentence of \u00a7801(2), providing that \"[n]ot more than $1,500.00 in total may be added pursuant to this subsection,\u201d includes both unpaid weekly compensation benefits and unpaid accrued weekly benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Construed in the context of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>entire subsection in which it is embedded, the last sentence of \u00a7 801(2) provides a maximum $1,500 penalty that may be levied against an employer or insurer for delinquent or unpaid compensation benefits owing to a worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Under the dissent\u2019s reading of \u00a7801(2), if payment of benefits were delayed for a year, a worker would be entitled to an award of $1,500 per week, $78,000 annually, in addition to the benefits and statutory interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The dissent would adopt the <em>DeKind </em>rationale that a single $1,500 penalty would not deter employers or insurers from delaying payment of benefits. The dissent further states that \"[t]o believe that a maximum penalty of $1,500 would deter the majority of employers from failing to pay compensation benefits is naive, to say the least.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\"><em>DeKind </em>also argues, and the dissent similarly contends, that there is an investment potential awaiting the employer or insurer who would deliberately withhold payment of benefits. The argument is that if an employer were to withhold benefits for a number of years it could invest the benefits and earn \"much more than $1,500 from investments . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">The argument ignores that ten percent interest is payable pursuant to \u00a7 801(6)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> from the date each payment is due on all late payments. In the instant case, Townsend\u2019s benefits, at $61 per week, provide compensation of $3,172 a year. If M-R <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Products invested $3,172, one year of benefits, at twelve percent interest, then, having in mind that ten percent interest must be paid pursuant to \u00a7 801(6), it would be over <em>twenty years </em>before M-R Products netted $1,500.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">When the $1,500 penalty provision was added in 1977, the workers\u2019 compensation act did not provide for the payment of interest. In 1960, however, this Court had held that interest at the legal rate of five percent per annum was payable on a judgment entered by the circuit court on a workers\u2019 compensation award.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Since that decision, interest was required to be paid by employers and insurers at five percent per annum on workers\u2019 compensation awards without regard to whether a judgment had been sought from or entered by a circuit court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">In 1981, the Legislature amended \u00a7801(5) to provide: \"When weekly compensation is paid pursuant to an award of a hearing referee, the board, or a court, interest on the compensation shall be paid at the rate of 12% per annum from the date each payment was due, until paid.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The interest rate was increased from five percent to twelve percent because the Legislature decided, in light of then current market interest rates, that interest of five percent encouraged employers and insurers to delay paying workers\u2019 compensation benefits. There would, however, have been no cause for such legislative concern if the $50/$l,500 limitations truly meant that $78,000 a year was required to be paid for late payment, and, thus, no need to increase the interest rate from five percent to twelve percent to forestall delay in payment of benefits. Clearly, the Legislature did not understand that it \"intended\u201d that $78,000 a year was to be paid for late payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">We hold that no more than $1,500 may be added for all the weeks involved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b606-6\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\"> MCL 418.801(2); MSA 17.237(801X2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> M-R Products was apparently experiencing financial difficulties.

In March 1982, a hearing referee granted plaintiff an open award.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Defendant M-R Products appealed to the wcab. Plaintiff also appealed, seeking an adjustment in the amount of the award. While the appeal was pending, defendant was ordered to pay plaintiff seventy percent of the weekly award, pursuant to \u00a7 862 of the act. Defendant tendered one compensation payment covering the period of February 3, 1982, through April 9, 1982. In July 1982, plaintiff notified the wcab that she had not received any subsequent payments, and the wcab dismissed defendant\u2019s appeal on August 26, 1982, because of its failure to make the required payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Having received no further payments, plaintiff filed a petition on December 14, 1982, seeking a penalty award against defendant. On April 28, 1983, a hearing referee ordered defendant to pay $1,500 in penalties for defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the March 11,1982, award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">Defendant appealed and requested a hearing to dispute the award of the penalty payment. On February 10, 1984, the wcab affirmed the $1,500 penalty award.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">Despite this ruling, defendant still failed to make the adjudicated payments.

As a result, the hearing referee ordered defendant to pay $22,500 in penalties to plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Defendant appealed to the wcab,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which set aside all but one of plaintiff\u2019s $1,500 penalty awards. The wcab determined that since there were no stipulations by the parties or trial testimony to support the specific enumerated periods in plaintiff\u2019s petitions, plaintiff failed to carry her burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The wcab panel relied on <em>DeKind v Gale Mfg Co, </em>125 Mich App 598; 337 NW2d 252 (1983), lv den 418 Mich 852 (1983), and noted that in <em>DeKind, </em>the Court warned that the penalty provision was not designed as a windfall to injured workers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>but as a measure to ensure prompt benefit payments. The panel emphasized <em>DeKind\u2019s </em>pronouncement that the $1,500 penalty provision only applied to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">\"each period in which compensation benefits are not paid and for which an injured worker has filed a petition for a hearing on the nonpayment. The filing of the petition will put the employer on notice that the worker is seeking not only the missed payment, but also the penalty.\u201d [1987 WCABO 1263, 1264, citing <em>DeKind, </em>125 Mich App 606. Emphasis deleted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">According to the wcab, the intent of <em>DeKind </em>was to encourage plaintiffs to file penalty petitions for the specific weekly periods in which the benefits were not paid, \"not merely [to] file the same xeroxed petition, which did not specify any weekly period but only changed the signatory date, as was done in the instant case.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The panel said it was unable to ascertain, from the language in the petitions, which specific weekly period defendant failed to make payment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The panel also found that several petitions were received by the bureau in \"bundles\u201d and time-stamped the same day. Thus, the panel concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">In the instant case plaintiff did not file a penalty petition every time a payment was missed, instead she filed one nonspecific petition several times. We, therefore, reach the same conclusion as did the <em>DeKind, </em>Court; plaintiff having filed only one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>petition alleging late or improper payments is entitled to only one penalty. <em>[Id., </em>p 1265.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed, focusing on whether the wcab\u2019s application of \u00a7801(2) was erroneous under the <em>DeKind </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Recognizing that, in <em>DeKind, </em>the defendant was ultimately responsible for paying only one $1,500 penalty, the Court nevertheless determined that the wcab had applied <em>DeKind </em>in an \"overly narrow fashion, exalting form over substance.\u201d 173 Mich App 15, 22; 433 NW2d 374 (1988). The plaintiff there had filed only one petition alleging late or improper payments, in contrast to plaintiff in the instant case, who submitted some fifteen petitions for penalty payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The Court stated that the purpose of the petition requirement in the statute is to protect employers by providing them with notification of an employee\u2019s intent to seek a penalty for each week that the due compensation payment is late. While the $1,500 provision applies to each period in which the compensation benefits are not paid, to trigger that entitlement, the employee needs to file a petition to put the employer on notice that the worker is seeking the penalty for that particular period.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reinstated the referee\u2019s $22,500 award, finding that since defendant had chosen to withhold payments after receiving several of plaintiff\u2019s petitions, plaintiff was entitled to collect the multiple penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">The key issue before the Court today is whether \u00a7 801(2) allows a $1,500 penalty for each late weekly payment, or imposes a one-time maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>penalty of $1,500, despite the number of compensation payments missed by an employer. Plaintiff Townsend argues that the penalty applies to each late payment; defendant M-R Products responds that $1,500 is the maximum penalty that can be levied against it. I agree with the plaintiff\u2019s position, finding it to be supported by statutory language, legislative intent, and practical considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">In <em>DeKind, </em>the Court of Appeals confronted interpretation of the \u00a7 801(2) penalty issue for the first time. Reciting the statute, the Court found that it did not refer to a \" 'once-in-a-lifetime\u2019 \u201d penalty, but rather to the <em>weekly </em>compensation benefits that were due. <em>Id. </em>at 605. Furthermore, the Court reasoned, defendant\u2019s contention that the statute is limited to a $1,500 maximum contradicted the Legislature\u2019s intent to encourage prompt benefits payments by employers by enacting a meaningful financial cost for failure to do so. A $1,500 limit could be minuscule compared to the potential cost of paying out workers\u2019 compensation benefits for months, or even years. The money saved by the employer could be invested in other, self-profitable ways, the Court noted, concluding that the Legislature would not have wanted to reward an employer who has violated, or continued to violate, the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">I agree with the <em>DeKind </em>Court on this prong of its analysis: that \u00a7 801(2) allows imposition of multiple penalties. The statute unquestionably refers to <em>\"weekly[</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>compensation benefits,\u201d which supports plaintiff\u2019s contention that each week of nonpayment incurs penalties. As the Court recognized: \u201cUnder the plain language of \u00a7 801 the penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>provision is to ensure that compensation is paid promptly and directly to the person entitled thereto.\u201d <em>DeKind </em>at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The majority nonetheless finds that the maximum amount of penalties allowed is $1,500, which applies to both unpaid weekly and \"accrued\u201d weekly benefits\u2014accrued being those payments which the employer never tendered. Therefore, no matter how many weeks have been missed, all past-due payments become lumped together as \"accrued\u201d benefits, eligible for only one $1,500 penalty award.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The problem with this interpretation, again, is apparent. If an employer misses paying benefits one week, it can simply either pay the $1,500 due at the end of sixty days and not concern itself with paying penalties thereafter, or it can sit back for months or years without rendering a single benefit, knowing that the most it must pay for violating an award order each week is $1,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The majority\u2019s holding today will allow employers to circumvent worker\u2019s compensation obligations towards aggrieved workers with alarming ease. The incentive to provide an aggrieved worker with <em>prompt </em>compensation payments, as noted in \u00a7 801(1), is virtually nonexistent. To believe that a maximum penalty of $1,500 would deter the majority of employers from failing to pay compensation benefits is naive, to say the least.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">The majority appears to find objectionable the possibility that a worker whose benefits were delayed one year might ultimately be entitled to thousands of dollars in penalties under my interpretation of \u00a7 801(2). Assuming that the employer, during this year, has not disputed the claim in an appeal (during which time the imposition of penalties is precluded, <em>Charpentier v Canteen Corp, </em>105 Mich App 700, 705; 307 NW2d 704 [1981]), I agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>that potentially hefty penalty accumulations are possible. However, considering that such a large penalty award undoubtedly reflects the fact that an employer has flagrantly violated its obligation to pay its worker on dozens and dozens of occasions for periods spanning at least two months, this financial repercussion is not harsh or disproportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The majority also points to the fact that, pursuant to \u00a7801(6), interest may be levied at ten percent per year on an award from the date each payment is due until it is paid. This indicates both that 1) defendants such as M-R Products would amass little financial gain from retaining benefit payments due to the statutorily required interest payment, and 2) the Legislature increased the interest rate a few years ago out of concern that employers not delay compensation payments. This interest assessment, states the majority, would not be needed if the Legislature had intended to permit $1,500 for every late benefit payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">I disagree. The purposes, functions, and policy concerns behind the interest provision of \u00a7801(6) and the penalty provision of \u00a7 801(2) are separate and distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Interest on past-due payments is generally imposed, not as a punishment to employers, but because the employer has benefited from the use of money determined to be due the employee, and the employee had to do without it. <em>Drake v Norge Div, Borg-Warner Corp, </em>367 Mich 464, 468; 116 NW2d 842 (1962). On the other hand, the \u00a7 801(2) penalty assessment is designed to ensure that aggrieved workers receive prompt compensation. See <em>McAvoy v H B Sherman Co, </em>401 Mich 419, 455; 258 NW2d 414 (1977) (\" 'The object of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is to provide compensation to persons suffering a disability arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>from their employment. Such compensation, to be effective, obviously must be provided promptly. So the act provides.\u2019 \u201d) The steep $50 a day penalty per unpaid weekly benefit constitutes a sharp stimulus to sluggish employers or insurers to be punctual and timely in compensation payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Although the <em>DeKind </em>Court held that a worker may collect more than $1,500 under \u00a7 801(2), it also noted a limitation: the worker must file with the bureau a penalty petition for every week that a payment is missed. Thus, the Court determined that the penalty provision <em>only applies </em>to \"each period in which compensation <em>bene\u00f1ts are not paid and </em>for which an injured worker has <em>\u00f1led a petition </em>for a hearing on the nonpayment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Although I agree, and would so hold, that the last sentence of \u00a7 801(2) entitles an aggrieved employee to collect up to $1,500 for each delinquent or unpaid weekly benefit, I do not today speak to the propriety of <em>DeKind\u2019s </em>petition-filing requirement, and need not address that issue due to the procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Here, plaintiff Townsend sought penalty payments in the wcab and Court of Appeals only for the penalty petitions she filed in the bureau. The referee\u2019s award of $22,500, reinstated by the Court of Appeals, was arrived at by multiplying each of plaintiff\u2019s fifteen petitions by the $1,500 penalty amount. Plaintiff did not file a petition for each week that defendant failed to pay her, as required by <em>DeKind; </em>all but one of the petitions requested a penalty for periods encompassing several weeks.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because she did not seek a penalty for each week, but sought only affirmance of the referee\u2019s original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>award, it need not be decided here whether plaintiff was required, after filing her initial \u00a7 801(2) petition, to continue filing petitions as a prerequisite to collecting penalty payments. Consequently, I express no opinion relating to the second prong of the <em>DeKind </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Nevertheless, since the instant plaintiff did file multiple petitions, I will consider the issue whether she was properly awarded penalties on the basis of the petitions submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The wcab found that plaintiff\u2019s petitions were insufficiently specific to support the award of multiple penalties. The panel deemed the petitions fatally deficient because they failed to specify the particular week plaintiff was due compensation and did not receive it. Like the Court of Appeals, I reject this rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The panel reasoned that plaintiff was entitled to only a single penalty award because she filed \"one nonspecific petition several times,\u201d which, in essence, was the same as having filed only one petition. However, just the opposite is true. The order issued by the hearing referee reveals that petitions were filed by plaintiff and received by the bureau from September 1983 to May 1985. In reality, each petition recorded in the referee\u2019s schedule (and reproduced in the Court of Appeals opinion) was noted as being received by the bureau in each case no longer than a few days following expiration of the thirty-day nonpenalty period<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> after which the $50 daily penalty commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Defendant argues that it did not have sufficient notice because specific weeks were not delineated in plaintiff\u2019s petitions. That contention is without merit. Here, plaintiff filed successive petitions beginning in 1983 to enforce the referee\u2019s 1982 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>decision requiring defendant to pay weekly benefits. There is no question that defendant was provided with adequate notice during its years of dealing with plaintiff, and knew both that its compensation payments to her were late or not forwarded at all.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AhJ\">As the Court below noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\"><em>In this case, however, plaintiff [Townsend] has consistently complained about late payments and has continuously notified defendant of its missed payments and her intent to seek a penalty. . . . </em>[173 Mich App 22. Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">This defendant had more than ample notice, and its continued failure to meet its obligation to this employee can generously be described as scandalous.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">On the basis of the foregoing analysis, I would hold that \u00a7 801(2) allows the imposition of a penalty upon an employer for each week or period of weeks that compensation payments to a worker are unpaid, and affirm that portion of the Court of Appeals holding.</p>\n<judges id=\"b616-8\">Boyle and Archer, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\"> MCL 418.801(2); MSA 17.237(801X2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">If weekly compensation benefits or accrued weekly benefits are not paid within 30 days after becoming due and payable, in cases where there is not an ongoing dispute, $50.00 per day shall be added and paid to the worker for each day over 30 days in which the benefits are not paid. Not more than $1,500.00 in total may be added pursuant to this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">This provision was amended by 1985 PA 103, which deleted prior reference to medical bills and travel allowance, and created \u00a7 801(3), which allows for imposition of penalties for failure to pay those expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\"> Plaintiff also filed a complaint in Manistee Circuit Court in 1984, seeking payment from defendant.
