N. Kelso, Jr., followed the procedures the expert witness claims should have been followed, the patient, Nena J. Falcon, would have had a 37.5 percent opportunity<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of surviving the medical accident that was a cause of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The trial court dismissed the complaint<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because Falcon\u2019s evidence did not show that Nena Falcon probably\u2014defined as more than fifty percent\u2014 would have survived if the procedure had not been omitted. The Court of Appeals reversed, stating that Falcon need only \"establish that the omitted treatment or procedure had the potential for improving the patient\u2019s recovery or preventing the patient\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Falcon v Memorial Hosp, </em>178 Mich App 17, 26-27; 443 NW2d 431 (1989). The Court added that \"while a plaintiff must show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>some probability that the treatment would be successful, that probability need not be greater than fifty percent.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Plaintiffs claiming medical malpractice ordinarily contend that the act or omission said to have constituted medical malpractice caused physical harm to the patient. Falcon so contends in the instant case, claiming that although Nena Falcon would have had only a 37.5 percent opportunity of surviving the medical accident that was a cause of her death had the defendant physician followed the procedures the expert claims should have been followed, and hence less than a fifty-one percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>opportunity of surviving, the defendants nevertheless caused Nena Falcon\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The defendants contend that because the proofs at a trial of Falcon\u2019s claim would not show that it was probable, measured as more than fifty percent, that Nena Falcon would have avoided physical harm had the procedure not been omitted, Falcon cannot show that the asserted negligence of defendants caused her physical harm. They also contend that Falcon cannot maintain an action for wrongful death because such an action can only be maintained where the plaintiff can establish that the act or omission caused death, and, again, Falcon\u2019s proofs will fall short because they will show only that there would have been a 37.5 percent opportunity of avoiding death and not a more than fifty percent opportunity had the procedure not been omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Some courts disallow recovery for lost opportunity unless the plaintiff can establish that the patient would not have suffered the physical harm but for the defendant\u2019s negligence, or, at least, that it is more probable, measured as more than fifty percent,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that, but for such negligence, the patient would not have suffered the physical harm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Under the more probable, measured as more than fifty percent, approach to causation, a plaintiff who establishes that the patient would have had more than a fifty percent opportunity of not suffering physical harm had the defendant not acted negligently, recovers one hundred percent of the damages. The better than even opportunity is compensated as if it were a certainty, although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>patient\u2019s chances of a better result are significantly less than one hundred percent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">To say that a patient would have had a ninety-nine percent opportunity of survival if given proper treatment, does not mean that the physician\u2019s negligence was the cause in fact if the patient would have been among the unfortunate one percent who would have died. A physician\u2019s carelessness may, similarly, be the actual cause of physical harm although the patient had only a one percent opportunity of surviving even with flawless medical attention.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">All this is simply to say that the more probable than not standard, as well as other standards of causation, are analytic devices\u2014tools to be used in making causation judgments.

Moments after delivery, Nena Falcon coughed, gagged, convulsed, became cyanotic, and suffered a complete respiratory and cardiac collapse. At<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>tempts to revive her were unsuccessful.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> She was pronounced dead soon thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The autopsy report indicated that amniotic fluid embolism,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> an unpreventable complication that occurs in approximately one out of ten or twenty thousand births, was the cause of death. The survival rate of amniotic fluid embolism is, according to Falcon\u2019s expert witness, 37.5 percent if an intravenous line is connected to the patient before the onset of the embolism. In this case, an intravenous line had not been established.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Falcon\u2019s theory is that had a physician or nurse anesthetist inserted an intravenous line before administering the spinal anesthetic to assist the physician in dealing with any of several complications, the intravenous line could have been used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>infuse life-saving fluids into Nena Falcon\u2019s circulatory system, providing her a 37.5 percent opportunity of surviving. By not inserting the intravenous line, the physician deprived her of a 37.5 percent opportunity of surviving the embolism.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The question whether a defendant caused an event is not readily answered,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and is especially perplexing in circumstances such as those present in the instant case where the defendant\u2019s failure to act is largely responsible for the uncertainty regarding causation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Had the defendants in the instant case inserted an intravenous line, one of two things would have happened, Nena Falcon would have lived, or she would have died.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There would be no uncertainty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>whether the omissions of the defendants caused her death.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Falcon\u2019s destiny would have been de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>cided by fate and not possibly by her health care providers. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">When a defendant\u2019s negligent action or inaction has effectively terminated a person\u2019s chance of survival, it does not lie in the defendant\u2019s mouth to raise conjectures as to the measure of the chances that he has put beyond the possibility of realization. If there was any substantial possibility of survival and the defendant has destroyed it, he is answerable. Rarely is it possible to demonstrate to an absolute certainty what would have happened in circumstances that the wrongdoer did not allow to come to pass. The law does not in the existing circumstances require the plaintiff to show to a <em>certainty </em>that the patient would have lived had she been hospitalized and operated on promptly. <em>Harvey v Silber, </em>300 Mich 510; 2 NW2d 483 (1942).[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>] <em>[Hicks v United States, </em>368 F2d 626, 632 (CA 4, 1966).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Emphasis in original.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">In an ordinary tort action seeking recovery for physical harm, the defendant is a stranger to the plaintiff and the duty imposed by operation of law is imposed independently of any undertaking by the defendant. In an action claiming medical malpractice, however, the patient generally is not a stranger to the defendant. Generally, the patient engaged the services of the defendant physician. The physician undertook to perform services for the patient, and the patient undertook to pay or provide payment for the services.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The scope of the undertakings by a physician or hospital to the patient and by the patient to the physician or hospital is not generally a matter of express agreement. There is, however, an understanding that the law enforces in the absence of express agreement. The patient expects a physician to do that which is expected of physicians of like training in the community, and the physician expects the patient to pay or provide payment for the services, whether the likelihood of there in fact being any benefit to the patient is only one through fifty percent or is greater than fifty percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The defendants assert, in effect, that the scope of their undertaking did not include acts or omissions likely to benefit the patient only to the extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>one through fifty percent\u2014or at least they should not be subject to liability for acts or omissions likely to have caused harm to the extent only of one through fifty percent. They contend that they should be subject to liability only for acts or omissions likely, to the extent of more than fifty percent, to have caused physical harm to the patient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">The reasoning of the district court herein (which is similar to the extreme position taken in <em>Cooper v Sisters),[</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>in essence, declares open season on critically ill or injured persons as care providers would be free of liability for even the grossest malpractice if the patient had only a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the disease or injury even with proper treatment. <em>[Roberson v Counselman, </em>235 Kan 1006, 1021; 686 P2d 149 (1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Patients engage the services of doctors, not only to prevent disease or death, but also to delay death and to defer or ameliorate the suffering associated with disease or death. If the trier of fact were to decide, on the basis of expert testimony, that the undertaking of the defendant physician included the implementation of tasks and procedures that, in the case of Nena Falcon, would have enabled the physician and other medically trained persons, who were present at the time of delivery, to provide her, in the event of the medical accident that occurred, an opportunity to survive the accident, a failure to do so was a breach of the understanding or undertaking.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Nena Falcon, if the testimony of Falcon\u2019s expert witness is credited, would have had a 37.5 percent opportunity of surviving had the defendants implemented the procedures Falcon\u2019s expert asserts should have been implemented. In reducing Nena Falcon\u2019s opportunity of living by failing to insert an intravenous line, her physician caused her harm, although it cannot be said, more probably than not, that he caused her death. A 37.5 percent opportunity of living is hardly the kind of opportunity that any of us would willingly allow our health care providers to ignore. If, as Falcon\u2019s expert asserts, the implementation of such procedures was part of the understanding or undertaking, the failure to have implemented the procedures was a breach of the understanding or undertaking. The physician is, and should be, subject to liability for such breach, although Nena Falcon was likely, measured as more than fifty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>percent, to die as soon as the medical accident occurred and the negligence of the physician eliminated a less than fifty percent opportunity of surviving.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We thus see the injury resulting from medical malpractice as not only, or necessarily, physical harm, but also as including the loss of opportunity of avoiding physical harm. A patient goes to a physician precisely to improve his opportunities of avoiding, ameliorating, or reducing physical harm and pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Women gave birth to children long before there were physicians or hospitals or even midwives. A woman who engages the services of a physician and enters a hospital to have a child does so to reduce pain and suffering and to increase the likelihood of her surviving and the child surviving childbirth in a good state of health even though the likelihood of the woman and child not surviving in good health without such services is far less than fifty percent. That is why women go to physicians. That is what physicians undertake to do. That is what they are paid for. They are, and should be, subject to liability if they fail to measure up to the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">A number of courts have recognized, as we would, loss of an opportunity for a more favorable result, as distinguished from the unfavorable result, as compensable in medical malpractice actions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Under this approach, damages are recoverable for the loss of opportunity although the opportunity lost was less than even, and thus it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>not more probable than not that the unfavorable result would or could have been avoided.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Under this approach, the plaintiff must establish more-probable-than-not causation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> He must prove, more probably than not, that the defendant reduced the opportunity of avoiding harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In <em>Aasheim v Humberger, </em>215 Mont 127, 133; 695 P2d 824 (1985), the plaintiff commenced an action against Dr. Humberger alleging that his failure to order diagnostic films of her knee area, resulted in her losing an opportunity for less radical surgery and of preserving her natural knee. The Supreme Court of Montana treated the reduction in the opportunity of avoiding physical harm as actionable in recognition that patients claiming medical malpractice are generally in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>jured or diseased at the time of the alleged malpractice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">We feel that including \"loss of chance\u201d within causality recognizes the realities inherent in medical negligence litigation. People who seek medical treatment are diseased or injured. Failure to diagnose or properly treat denies the opportunity to recover. Including this lost opportunity within the causality embrace gives recognition to a real loss consequence of medical failure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">The trier of fact should determine whether defendant\u2019s negligence was a substantial factor in reducing plaintiff\u2019s chances of obtaining a better result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In <em>DeBurkarte v Louvar, </em>393 NW2d 131, 135 (Iowa, 1986), the Supreme Court of Iowa explained the difference between viewing the injury as a loss of life and viewing it as a loss of opportunity to survive an illness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">We recognize that the plaintiff\u2019s injury may be viewed as a shortening of her life, in which case we would agree with the defendant that the plaintiffs did not produce substantial evidence on causation: there was no evidence the plaintiff\u2019s cancer probably spread after September, 1981, preventing her from being cured. [Citation omitted.] On the other hand, as the Restatement [\u00a7 323(a)][<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>] indicates, her injury may also be viewed as a lost chance to survive the cancer. The jury could then find from the evidence that the defendant\u2019s failure to diagnose and treat the cancer probably caused a substantial reduction in the plaintiff\u2019s chance to survive it.[<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The court concluded: \"We believe the better approach[<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><footnotemark>30</footnotemark>] is to allow recovery, but <em>only </em>for the lost chance of survival.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 136. (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The Supreme Court of Washington permitted the personal representative of the patient to maintain an action where there was expert testimony of a fourteen percentage point reduction\u2014from thirty-nine percent to twenty-five percent\u2014in the patient\u2019s opportunity for survival, which was claimed to have resulted from a delay in diagnosis of lung cancer. <em>Herskovits v Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, </em>99 Wash 2d 609; 664 P2d 474 (1983). The majority, in two separate opinions, agreed, that recovery for \"[c]ausing reduction of the opportunity to recover (loss of chance) by one\u2019s negligence, however, does not necessitate a total recovery against the negligent party for all damages caused by the victim\u2019s death.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANxS\">In a concurring opinion in <em>Herskovits, </em>in which four of six judges comprising the majority joined, the loss of opportunity case law was reviewed and the following conclusions were stated:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>First, the critical element in each of the cases is that the defendant\u2019s negligence either deprived a decedent of a chance of surviving a potentially fatal condition or reduced that chance. To summarize, in <em>Hicks v United </em>States[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>] the decedent was deprived of a probability of survival; in <em>Jeanes v Milner [</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>the decedent\u2019s chance of survival was reduced from 35 percent to 24 percent; in <em>O\u2019Brien v </em>Stover,[<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>] the decedent\u2019s 30 percent chance of survival was reduced by an indeterminate amount; in <em>McBride v United </em>States[<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>] the decedent was deprived of the probability of survival; in <em>Kallenberg v Beth Israel </em>Hosp[<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>] the decedent was deprived of a 20 percent to 40 percent chance of survival; in <em>Hamil v </em>Bashline[<footnotemark>37</footnotemark>] the decedent was deprived of a 75 percent chance of survival; and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>James v United States </em>[483 F Supp 581 (ND Cal, 1980)][<footnotemark>38</footnotemark>] the decedent was deprived of an indeterminate chance of survival, no matter how small.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">The three cases where the chance of survival was greater than 50 percent <em>(Hicks, McBride, </em>and Hamil) are unexceptional in that they focus on the death of the decedent as the injury, and they require proximate cause to be shown beyond the balance of probabilities. Such a result is consistent with existing principles in this state, and with cases from other jurisdictions cited by defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">The remaining four cases allowed recovery despite the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to prove a probability of survival. <em>Three of these cases (Jeanes, O\u2019Brien, </em>and <em>James) differ signi\u00f1cantly from the Hicks, McBride, </em>and <em>Hamil group in that they view the reduction in or loss of the chance of survival, rather than the death itself, as the injury. Under these cases, the defendant is liable, not for all damages arising from the death, but only for damages to the extent of the diminished or lost chance of survival. </em>The fourth of these cases, <em>Kallenberg, </em>differs from the other three in that it focuses on the death as the compensable injury. This is clearly a distortion of traditional principles of proximate causation. In effect, <em>Kallenberg </em>held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>that a 40 percent possibility of causation (rather than the 51 percent required by a probability standard) was sufficient to establish liability for the death. Under this loosened standard of proof of causation, the defendant would be liable for all damages resulting from the death for which he was at most 40 percent responsible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\">My review of these cases persuades me that the preferable approach to the problem before us is that taken (at least implicitly) in <em>Jeanes, O\u2019Brien, </em>and <em>James. [Id., </em>pp 631-632. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Finally, the opinion states \"that the best resolution of the issue before us is to recognize the <em>loss of a less than even chance as an actionable injury.\u201d Id., </em>p 634. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In <em>Ehlinger v Sipes, </em>155 Wis 2d 1, 13-14; 454 NW2d 754 (1990), parents were permitted to maintain an action alleging that the failure to diagnose a multiple pregnancy was a substantial factor in causing injuries to twins suffered when they were born prematurely. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">We conclude that in a case of this nature, where the causal relationship between the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s harm can only be inferred by surmising as to what the plaintiff\u2019s condition would have been had the defendant exercised ordinary care, to satisfy his or her burden of production on causation, the plaintiff need only show that the omitted treatment was intended to prevent the very type of harm which resulted, that the plaintiff would have submitted to the treatment, and that it is more probable than not the treatment <em>could </em>have lessened or avoided the plaintiff\u2019s injury had it been rendered. It then is for the trier of fact to determine whether the defendant\u2019s negligence was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff\u2019s harm.

Recognizing loss of a substantial opportunity of avoiding physical harm as actionable makes it unnecessary to consider whether Falcon\u2019s action for medical malpractice can be maintained as an action for wrongful death. Falcon may maintain a survival action against the defendants for their failure to protect Nena Falcon\u2019s opportunity of living.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The harm resulting from defendants\u2019 asserted malpractice occurred immediately before Nena Falcon\u2019s death when the medical accident occurred and, by reason of the failure to have inserted an intravenous line, it became certain that she would die. At that moment, immediately before her death, Nena Falcon had a cause of action for the harm, the denial of any opportunity of living, that had been caused her.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Her claim therefor survived her death because \"[a]ll actions and claims survive death.\u201d RJA \u00a7 2921.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>We are persuaded that loss of a 37.5 percent opportunity of living constitutes a loss of a substantial opportunity of avoiding physical harm.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> We need not now decide what lesser percentage would constitute a substantial loss of opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>IX</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">In the instant case, while Nena Falcon\u2019s cause of action accrued before her death,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> she did not suffer conscious pain and suffering from the failure to implement the omitted procedures between the moment that the medical accident occurred and the time of her death a few minutes later\u2014she was sedated throughout the entire time period. In this case, 37.5 percent times the damages recoverable for wrongful death would be an appropriate measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The Supreme Court of Iowa differentiated loss of opportunity cases that allow a plaintiff to recover for the underlying injury from those<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> that limit damages to the patient\u2019s lost opportunity of survival. Criticizing the former group of cases, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">Under this reasoning, a patient could recover <em>all </em>damages resulting from an injury for which a defendant may only be partly responsible.

There are two ways of handling such a case. Under the traditional approach, this loss of a not-better-than-even chance of recovering from the cancer would not be compensable because it did not appear more likely [than] not that the patient would have survived with proper care. Recoverable damages, if any, would depend on the extent to which it appeared that cancer killed the patient sooner than it would have with timely diagnosis and treatment, and on the extent to which the delay in diagnosis aggravated the patient\u2019s condition, such as by causing additional pain. A more rational approach, however, would allow recovery for the loss of the chance of cure even though the chance was not better than even. The probability of long-term survival would be reflected in the amount of damages awarded for the loss of the chance.

The recognition of mere chance as a recoverable item of loss fundamentally contradicts the essential notion of causation. By definition, the lost chance theory would compensate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>plaintiff for a mere possibility that defendants\u2019 omission caused the death of Nena Falcon.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">This is a wrongful death action grounded in allegations of medical malpractice. The action arises from the death of Nena J. Falcon on March 22, 1973. Ms. Falcon, then nineteen years old, was delivered of a healthy child at defendant Memorial Hospital, under the care of defendant Dr. S. N. Kelso, Jr. At the request of the decedent, Dr. Kelso administered a saddle block anaesthetic prior to delivery. No intravenous line was inserted before or after the administration of the spinal anaesthetic. Immediately after the delivery of the child at 6:39 a.m., and before the placenta was delivered, Nena Falcon coughed and went into a convulsive state. Nurse Norma Denny attempted to obtain a blood pressure reading but there was none, indicating cardiac arrest. At this time the decedent had no respirations. According to Dr. Kelso, the patient died within a few minutes. Efforts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful. Attempts to start an intravenous line were unsuccessful. A \"cut down\u201d into a central vein was also attempted, but fluids could not be run into the decedent\u2019s circulatory system because there was no circulation at this time. The autopsy revealed that the decedent had suffered an amniotic fluid embolism, an unpredictable and life threatening complication of pregnancy. There is no known way to prevent amniotic fluid embolism. While there are certain predisposing factors, it can occur in a person who is apparently healthy and normal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The primary cause is a rent in the amnion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or chorion,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> together with pressure sufficient to force the amniotic fluid into the circulatory system.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Plaintiff does not allege that defendant\u2019s negligence caused the embolism. Rather, plaintiff claims that the survival rate for women suffering this complication is 37.5 percent, but that due to defendant\u2019s negligence, Nena Falcon was deprived of that chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s claim is based primarily on the testimony of Dr. Ezzat Abouleish. Dr. Abouleish testified at the deposition that spinal anaesthesia should not be given without an intravenous line because spinal anaesthesia can lead to a decrease in blood pressure or respiratory depression. According to Dr. Abouleish, an intravenous line, had it been in place, would have provided Ms. Falcon\u2019s only chance of survival. Dr. Abouleish could not say that the failure to use an intravenous line was the cause of Ms. Falcon\u2019s death. He testified, however, that her chances of surviving the embolism would have been better if she had an intravenous line in place and fluids going into her bloodstream. If an intravenous line had been in place, Ms. Falcon could have been given drugs to stimulate her heart or dilate her bronchi.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Dr. Abouleish testified that the overall survival rate for women suffering amniotic fluid embolism is 37.5 percent. This number was calculated in the following manner: Of one hundred patients experiencing this complication, fifty will die within one hour and fifty will survive. Of the fifty survivors, twenty-five will develop a blood coagulation prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>lem which will be fatal to half of those developing the problem. Thus, the statistical survival rate for amniotic fluid embolism is 37.5 percent. Dr. Abouleish testified that for a patient to have even that chance of survival, an intravenous line is essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Plaintiff also relies on the deposition testimony of Dr. Thomas DeKornfeld. Dr. DeKornfeld generally agreed with Dr. Abouleish\u2019s accounting of the survival statistics for women suffering amniotic fluid embolism, although he would not place the survival rate precisely at 37.5 percent. Dr. De-Kornfeld testified that an intravenous line should be started immediately after the administration of a spinal anaesthetic, so that any complication arising from the spinal anaesthetic could be managed by injecting medication intravenously. While Dr. DeKornfeld opined that it was clearly inappropriate not. to insert an intravenous line in the decedent, he was \"not certain\u201d that the presence of an intravenous line would have made any difference. When questioned further, DeKornfeld stated that intravenous infusion very likely would have made little if any difference in this case, but he conceded that \"[t]here may have been a chance . . . .\u201d DeKornfeld reiterated that opinion in cross-examination: He did not believe the presence of intravenous infusion would have materially affected the outcome, but he could not say it was inconceivable that an intravenous line might have changed the ultimate outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">A trial was held on January 7, 8 and 9, 1985. The trial ended with a directed verdict in favor of defendants after the trial court ruled that plaintiff had failed to present any expert testimony regarding the applicable standard of care for the doctor or nurse-anesthesiologist. That ruling was based on the trial court\u2019s determination that Drs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Abouleish and DeKornfeld were not qualified to testify to the relevant standards of care. The Court of Appeals reversed the order granting the directed verdict, holding that both Drs. Abouleish and DeKornfeld were qualified to testify regarding the standard of care in Monroe, Michigan, or in similar communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">On remand, defendants moved for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendants argued that, since plaintiff conceded that the decedent\u2019s chance of survival was only 37.5 percent, under the best possible circumstances and in the absence of any negligence, plaintiff could not establish that any negligence by the defendants was the proximate cause of Nena Falcon\u2019s death. The trial court granted summary disposition in favor of defendants, stating that plaintiff could only prove \"that the wrongful acts or omissions of the defendants caused her to lose a chance at life (37.5 percent), but could not prove that the defendants\u2019 acts or omissions caused her death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Falcon v Memorial Hosp, </em>178 Mich App 17; 443 NW2d 431 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The decision of the Court of Appeals would require a plaintiff alleging medical malpractice to show only that a negligently omitted treatment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>procedure \"had the potential for improving the patient\u2019s recovery or preventing the patient\u2019s death.\u201d 178 Mich App 26. The Court of Appeals held that \"while a plaintiff must show some probability that the treatment would be successful, that probability need not be greater than fifty percent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 26-27. The analysis of the Court of Appeals turned on the meaning of the word \"probability\u201d in two cases decided by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">In <em>Rogers v Kee, </em>171 Mich 551; 137 NW 260 (1912), the plaintiff\u2019s proofs showed that the defendant physician failed to diagnose a fractured neck and femur. The Court in <em>Rogers </em>noted that the defendant not only had failed to diagnose the plaintiff\u2019s fractures, but had issued three successive diagnoses of conditions that the plaintiff did not have, and treated him for these conditions. <em>Id., </em>p 558. The Court stated that pain and suffering from a wrong treatment are elements of damage, and further noted that some of the advice given could actually have been injurious to the plaintiff\u2019s condition. <em>Id. </em>On the basis of its conclusion that a jury could have found a better result probable but for defendant\u2019s negligence, the Court held that the case was properly submitted to a jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">[A] patient suffering from such an injury, on calling a physician, is entitled to approved methods of treatment from which experience of the profession indicates beneficial results are probable and to be anticipated; and, if not an entire recovery, a better ultimate condition than if left to chance. If so, can it not be legitimately inferred by a jury that plaintiff, a strong man, who, untreated and with his recovery left to chance, \"shows as good results as would ordinarily obtain in a patient of his age under skillful treatment,\u201d if properly and skillfully treated would, in all probability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>have a better recovery and be in yet better condition? We think such testimony presents an issue of fact for the jury\u2014on probability, it is true. The issues of sickness and healing, life and death, are too uncertain to be otherwise forecast, but negligence which deprives a man of such probability is more than <em>injuria sine damno. [Id., </em>pp 561-562.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Although the <em>Rogers </em>Court cited a definition of injury to the plaintiff as \"[a]ny want of the proper degree of skill or care which diminishes the chances of the patient\u2019s recovery, prolongs his illness, increases his suffering, or, in short, makes his condition worse than it would have been if due skill and care had been used,\u201d it based its conclusion on an assessment of testimony tending to show that with proper treatment, \"a bony union was possible and a better fibrous union <em>probable </em>. . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 562 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">This Court again considered the problem of causation in a medical malpractice case in <em>Harvey v S\u00fcber, </em>300 Mich 510; 2 NW2d 483 (1942). In <em>Harvey, </em>the negligence of the defendant doctors resulted in an inaccurate diagnosis of the course of the bullet that struck the decedent. <em>Id., </em>p 520. The Court inferred from the record that the doctor who initially treated the decedent thought he felt the bullet under the skin on the right side of the decedent\u2019s abdomen. The x-rays revealed a bullet on the left side, but the chief of the x-ray department reversed the markings of left and right upon discovering that the treating doctor disagreed with his diagnosis finding a bullet on the left side. <em>Id., </em>p 513. The decedent died after eighteen hours. The autopsy revealed blood in the abdomen sufficient to cause death. It also revealed that the bullet which had entered at the right back had traveled forward from right to left, lodging in the upper left side of the abdominal cavity. <em>Id., </em>p 515. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>bullet had traveled through the intestines causing numerous perforations. <em>Id. </em>There was testimony that only by surgery could the hemorrhaging have been stopped. The Court in <em>Harvey </em>found sufficient evidence to support a finding of proximate cause, finding proof of \"probability\u201d sufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">There is testimony in the record that there was a probability that an operation would have saved Harvey\u2019s life. Therefore the negligent diagnosis could be said to have been the proximate cause of the death. <em>[Id., </em>p 520.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The Court of Appeals carefully considered both <em>Rogers </em>and <em>Harvey, </em>and concluded that the test of \"probability\u201d employed in those cases was not an inquiry whether an event was more likely than not to happen. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals noted that \"the word 'probability\u2019 . . . also refers to the relative chances of an event happening, whether that 'probability\u2019 be low or high.\u201d 178 Mich App 26. Thus, the Court concluded, \"while a plaintiff must show some probability that the treatment would be successful, that probability need not be greater than fifty percent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">That the Court of Appeals misconstrued the rule of <em>Harvey </em>and <em>Rogers </em>is made perfectly clear by the <em>Harvey </em>Court\u2019s approval of an instruction which required the jury to find by a preponderance of the evidence that surgery would \"with reasonable probability\u201d have saved the decedent\u2019s life:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">\"[Y]ou may not return a verdict for the plaintiff if he has shown only that surgical intervention <em>might possibly </em>have saved the life of Garfield Harvey, but, on the other hand, it is not incumbent on the plaintiff to show that <em>to a certainty </em>surgical intervention would have saved his life. It is sufficient if the plaintiff by a preponderance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the evidence has satisfied you that surgical intervention would <em>with reasonable probability </em>have saved his life . . . [300 Mich 521. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\"Probability\u201d thus means neither certainty nor mere possibility. The Court of Appeals conclusion that an omitted procedure need only have the potential for preventing the death necessarily reduces the degree of certitude which is inherent in the notion of causation from \"probability\u201d to mere possibility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The \"lost chance of survival\u201d theory urged by plaintiff thus represents not only a redefinition of the threshold of proof for causation, but a fundamental redefinition of the meaning of causation in tort law. To determine the wisdom of that course, we look to the law of other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The seminal case in the development of the lost chance of survival theory is <em>Hicks v United States, </em>368 F2d 626 (CA 4, 1966). <em>Hicks </em>itself is not a lost chance of survival case, as there was testimony that if the defendant had not negligently failed to diagnose the decedent\u2019s intestinal obstruction, she would have survived. In dicta, the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">When a defendant\u2019s negligent action or inaction has effectively terminated a person\u2019s chance of survival, it does not lie in the defendant\u2019s mouth to raise conjectures as to the measure of the chances that he has put beyond the possibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>realization. If there was any substantial possibility of survival and the defendant has destroyed it, he is answerable. Rarely is it possible to demonstrate to an absolute certainty what would have happened in circumstances that the wrongdoer did not allow to come to pass. The law does not in the existing circumstances require the plaintiff to show to a certainty that the patient would have lived had she been hospitalized and operated on promptly.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] <em>[Id., </em>p 632.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The court in <em>Hicks </em>analogized to the \"lost seaman\u201d case of <em>Gardner v Nat\u2019l Bulk Carriers, Inc, </em>310 F2d 284 (CA 4, 1962), cert den 372 US 913 (1963), where the court recognized a duty on the part of a ship\u2019s master to use every reasonable means to save the life of a man overboard. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that no proximate cause was shown, finding proximate cause implicit in the breach of the duty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">[T]he duty would be empty if it did not itself embrace the loss as a consequence of its breach. Once the evidence sustains the reasonable possibility of rescue, ample or narrow, according to the circumstances, total disregard of the duty, refusal to make even a try, as was the case here, imposes liability. <em>[Id., </em>p 287.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In <em>Hamil v Bashline, </em>481 Pa 256; 392 A2d 1280 (1978), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>\u00a7 323(a) of the Restatement of Torts, 2d,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to similar effect in a medical malpractice case. The <em>Hamil </em>court concluded that where there is evidence that a defendant increased the risk of harm, \"such evidence furnishes a basis for the fact-finder to go further and find that such increased risk was in turn a substantial factor in bringing about the resultant harm . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 272. Thus the court accomplished an extraordinary transformation of traditional causation by allowing the jury to find causation in fact where the most that could be shown is that the defendant increased the risk of harm. As has been noted by courts criticizing the <em>Hamil </em>decision, \u00a7 323 simply establishes a duty where a person undertakes to render services to another to avoid increasing the risk of harm to the recipient. <em>Curry v Summer, </em>136 Ill App 3d 468, 476; 483 NE2d 711 (1985). In order for liability to result from a violation of the duty described in \u00a7 323, the physical harm must \"result[ ] from [the] failure to exercise reasonable care to perform [the] undertaking . . . .\u201d Thus, the causation requirement is not obviated by \u00a7 323, as the court in <em>Hamil </em>effectively held. The court in <em>Hamil </em>need not have so drastically altered traditional concepts of causation, since there was evidence that the decedent would have had a seventy-five percent likelihood of survival absent defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Several courts have employed an inquiry similar to that of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>Hamil. </em>In <em>Thornton v CAMC, </em>305 SE2d 316, 325 (W Va, 1983), the court held that a defendant would be liable where the plaintiff could show that the defendant\u2019s acts or omissions increased the risk of harm and that such increased risk \"was a substantial factor in bringing about the ultimate injury to the plaintiff . . . See also <em>Aasheim v Humberger, </em>215 Mont 127, 146-147; 695 P2d 824 (1985); <em>Sharp v Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Colorado, </em>710 P2d 1153, 1156 (Colo App, 1985), aff\u2019d 741 P2d 714 (Colo, 1987).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">While the court in <em>Hamil </em>openly recognized that the effect of the rule is \"to relax the degree of certitude normally required of plaintiff\u2019s evidence in order to make a case for the jury as to whether a defendant may be held liable for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 269, others have avoided overt alteration of the meaning of causation by redefining the compensable injury not as the ultimate harm, but as the lost chance of avoiding that harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">In <em>Herskovits v Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, </em>99 Wash 2d 609; 664 P2d 474 (1983), the Washington Supreme Court faced a situation where the plaintiff, suffering from lung cancer, had less than a fifty percent chance of survival at all times, but the defendants\u2019 negligence reduced the decedent\u2019s chance of survival by thirty-six percent (from thirty-nine to twenty-five percent). In a concurring opinion, Judge Pearson noted that in medical malpractice cases, cause in fact \"must be established beyond the balance of probabilities.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 622. Furthermore, plaintiff\u2019s expert was unable to state that the defendants\u2019 negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>probably or more likely than not caused the death of the decedent. However, if the injury were viewed as a reduction in the chance of survival, a different result could be reached; the plaintiff\u2019s expert had testified that the failure to diagnose probably caused a substantial reduction in the decedent\u2019s chance of survival.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In <em>Waffen v United States Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>799 F2d 911, 917 (CA 4, 1986), the loss as a substantial chance of survival was recognized as a cognizable harm under Maryland law. The court thus avoided overt alteration of the rules of causation, holding that \"plaintiff must submit proof that the injury complained of was 'more likely\u2019 or 'more probably\u2019 due to defendant\u2019s action rather than to any other cause.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The lost chance theory is most fully explained in King, <em>Causation, valuation, and chance in personal injury torts involving preexisting conditions and future consequences, </em>90 Yale L J 1353 (1981). The theory is premised on the reasoning that chance itself is an injury entitled to redress, and that chance should be measured by a mathematical percentage probability test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">Causation has for the most part been treated as an all-or-nothing proposition. Either a loss was caused by the defendant or it was not. Inexplicably, the all-or-nothing approach of the causation inquiry has been allowed to slip its analytical moorings, influencing the identification and valuation of losses in cases involving preexisting conditions and claims for future consequences. A plaintiff ordinarily should be required to prove by the applicable standard of proof that the defendant caused the loss in question. <em>What </em>caused a loss, however, should be a separate question from what the <em>nature and extent </em>of the loss are. This distinction seems to have eluded the courts, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>result that lost chances in many respects are compensated either as certainties or not at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">To illustrate, consider the case in which a doctor negligently fails to diagnose a patient\u2019s cancerous condition until it has become inoperable. Assume further that even with a timely diagnosis the patient would have had only a 30% chance of recovering from the disease and surviving over the long term. There are two ways of handling such a case. Under the traditional approach, this loss of a not-better-than-even chance of recovering from the cancer would not be compensable because it did not appear more likely [than] not that the patient would have survived with proper care. Recoverable damages, if any, would depend on the extent to which it appeared that cancer killed the patient sooner than it would have with timely diagnosis and treatment, and on the extent to which the delay in diagnosis aggravated the patient\u2019s condition, such as by causing additional pain. A more rational approach, however, would allow recovery for the loss of the chance of cure even though the chance was not better than even. The probability of long-term survival would be reflected in the amount of damages awarded for the loss of the chance. While the plaintiff here could not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was denied a cure by the defendant\u2019s negligence, he could show by a preponderance that he was deprived of a 30% chance of a cure. <em>[Id., </em>pp 1363-1364. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">A number of cases adopting the lost chance of survival theory also adopt Professor King\u2019s statistical approach, holding that if a decedent had, for example, a thirty percent chance of survival, then compensation should be awarded for thirty percent of the value of the decedent\u2019s life. See <em>Boody </em>v <em>United States, </em>706 F Supp 1458, 1465 (D Kan, 1989); <em>McKellips v St Francis Hosp, </em>741 P2d 467, 476 (Okla, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The number of jurisdictions adopting some ver-</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>sion of the lost chance of survival theory is fairly evenly matched by the number of states which continue to require that a defendant\u2019s negligence probably caused the adverse result before a defendant is required to pay for the plaintiff\u2019s damages.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Many of these courts refer to the burden of proof for causation: a plaintiff must prove that the defendant\u2019s negligence more likely than not caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury. See, e.g., <em>Cooper v Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, </em>27 Ohio St 2d 242, 250-252; 272 NE2d 97 (1971); <em>Weimer v Hetrick, </em>309 Md 536; 525 A2d 643 (1987).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A number of courts, even while treating the matter as an issue of burden of proof, have recognized that the question goes to the heart of the meaning of causation. Thus, the New Hampshire Supreme Court wrote that \"[c]ausation is a matter of probability, not possibility.\u201d <em>Pillsbury-Flood v Portsmouth Hosp, </em>128 NH 299, 305; 512 A2d 1126 (1986). The Florida Supreme Court in <em>Gooding v Univ Hosp Bldg, Inc, </em>445 So 2d 1015, 1018 (Fla, 1984), cogently stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>its reasons for declining to relax the causation requirement in medical malpractice cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">Relaxing the causation requirement might correct a perceived unfairness to some plaintiffs who could prove the possibility that the medical malpractice caused an injury but could not prove the probability of causation, but at the same time could create an injustice. Health care providers could find themselves defending cases simply because a patient fails to improve or where serious disease processes are not arrested because another course of action could possibly bring a better result. No other professional malpractice defendant carries this burden of liability without the requirement that plaintiffs prove the alleged negligence probably rather than possibly caused the injury. We cannot approve the substitution of such an obvious inequity for a perceived one. <em>[Id., </em>pp 1019-1020. Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The lost chance of survival theory does more than merely lower the threshold of proof of causation; it fundamentally alters the meaning of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The most fundamental premise upon which liability for a negligent act may be based is cause in fact. <em>Glinski v Szylling, </em>358 Mich 182, 196-197; 99 NW2d 637 (1959). \"An act or omission is not regarded as a cause of an event if the particular event would have occurred without it.\u201d Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 41, p 265. If the defendant\u2019s acts did not actually cause the plaintiff\u2019s injury, then there is no rational justification for requiring the defendant to bear the cost of the plaintiff\u2019s damages. Thus, it is the plaintiff\u2019s burden to show a causal connection between negligence and injury. <em>Glinski, supra, </em>p 201. \"A case cannot go to a jury supported merely by sheer speculation that something might have been a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>cause, or, going one step further, that there was a possibility that something was the cause.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 201-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The recognition of a lost chance as a cognizable injury is necessarily based on the reasoning that but for the defendant\u2019s negligence, the plaintiff <em>might possibly </em>have avoided an adverse result. Thus, recognition of lost chance as a recoverable interest contradicts the very notion of cause in fact. Professor King aptly characterizes a lost chance as a \"raffle ticket\u201d destroyed by the defendant\u2019s negligence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> King, <em>supra, </em>p 1378. King advocates compensation for \"statistically demonstrable losses,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 1377, so that a person deprived of a forty percent chance of survival should be compensated for forty percent of the compensable value of his life. <em>Id., </em>p 1382. Thus, tort law is transformed from a compensatory system to a payout scheme on the basis of a statistical chance that the defendant caused the plaintiff\u2019s death. It is no answer that full compensation based on less than a certainty that a patient would have survived is overcompensation. Professor King criticizes the probability standard of causation because, in his Anew, it treats the better-than-even chance as a certainty, \"as though it had materialized or were certain to do so.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 1387. Clearly, causation can never be proven to a certainty; the law settles for less in determining that a defendant should be held liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>for damages to a plaintiff.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, Professor McCormick describes the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof in terms of \"probability\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">The most acceptable meaning to be given to the expression, proof by a preponderance, seems to be proof which leads the jury to find that the existence of the contested fact is more probable than its nonexistence. Thus the preponderance of evidence becomes the trier\u2019s belief in the preponderance of probability. [McCormick, Evidence (3d ed), \u00a7 339, p 957.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">McCormick notes that some courts are \"shocked at the suggestion that a verdict, a truth-finding, should be based on nothing stronger than an estimate of probabilities.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 958. This statement reveals the very foundation of the tort system. Imperfect as it may be, our legal system attempts to ascertain facts to arrive at the truth. To protect the integrity of that goal, there must be some degree of certainty regarding causation before a jury may determine as fact that a medical defendant did cause the plaintiff\u2019s injury and should therefore compensate the plaintiff in damages. To dispense with this requirement is to abandon the truth-seeking function of the law. Professor King is willing to do so in his attempt to compensate for the precise magnitude of any lost chance. Professor King\u2019s criticism of the more likely than not standard for causation, like the lost chance theory itself, is based on the erroneous premise that it is the purpose of tort law to compensate for lost chances. But tort law should not operate by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>same principles that govern lotteries and insurance policies. If the acts of the defendants did not actually cause plaintiff\u2019s injury, then there is no rational justification for requiring defendants to bear the cost of plaintiff\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Even where there is causation in fact, a weighing of social interests requires a limit on how far the consequences of negligence will extend.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">As a practical matter, legal responsibility must be limited to those causes which are so closely connected with the result and of such significance that the law is justified in imposing liability. Some boundary must be set to liability for the consequences of any act, upon the basis of some social idea of justice or policy. [Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts, 5th ed, \u00a7 41, p 264.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Thus, \"[b]y adjusting the causation requirement, the court is able to strike a balance between deterring harmful behavior and encouraging useful activity.\u201d <em>Abel </em>v <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co, </em>418 Mich 311, 324, n 8; 343 NW2d 164 (1984), cert den 469 US 833 (1984). If liability is to be imposed in proportion to any chance at survival, then the medical profession will be subjected to a burden which is not imposed on any other group of defendants. <em>Cooper, supra. </em>I submit that nothing is to be gained by extracting payment from a defendant who cannot be shown to have caused the adverse result. Such a rule will not serve the deterrence function of tort law. It more likely will encourage the practice of costly defensive medicine in an attempt to avoid practically certain liability in the event of an unfavorable outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The utility of the physician\u2019s conduct militates against a relaxation of the causation requirement in medical malpractice cases. \"The physician serves a vital function in our society, a function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>which requires the assumption of a duty to the patient. Yet, his profession affords him only an inexact and often experimental science by which to discharge his duty.\u201d <em>Herskovits, supra, </em>p 638 (Brachtenbach, J., dissenting). See also Malone, <em>Ruminations on cause-in-fact, </em>9 Stan L R 60, 86-87 (1956). This is not similar to the case in which two shooters are held liable because it cannot be determined whose bullet caused the victim\u2019s death, <em>Summers v Tice, </em>33 Cal 2d 80; 199 P2d 1 (1948). Under those circumstances, the utility of the actors\u2019 conduct is so low that it is not troubling to permit recovery against both on the theory of concert of action, even where causation can be attributed to neither by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts, \u00a7 41, p 271. In <em>Abel v Eli Lilly, supra, </em>p 327, this Court discussed <em>Summers v Tice </em>and the rationale for its rule, which is embodied in 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 433B(3), comment f, p 446:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">[T]he reason for the exception to traditional rules is to prevent the injustice of allowing proved \u25a0wrongdoers to escape liability for an injury inflicted upon an innocent plaintiff \"merely because the nature of their conduct and the resulting harm has made it difficult or impossible to prove which of them has caused the harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The Court in <em>Abel </em>relied on this rationale to fashion a \"DES-unique\u201d theory of alternative liability, where it could be shown that all of the defendants acted tortiously, and that the plaintiff was harmed by the conduct of one of the defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>Id., </em>p 331. Assuming as we must that defendants Kelso and Memorial Hospital acted tortiously, there remains a crucial distinction between <em>Abel </em>and this case. In <em>Abel, </em>it was known that one of the defendants caused each plaintiff\u2019s injury. In this case, the question is not who caused Nena Falcon\u2019s death; the question, for which we have no answer, is whether any human act or omission caused her death. I do not mean to minimize the tragedy of such events, but only to question the assumption that a human cause may be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In this case, there is deposition testimony from which it could be inferred that the decedent was deprived of a 37.5 percent chance of survival by the failure of Dr. Kelso to insert an intravenous line before or immediately after the administration of a saddle block anaesthetic. Plaintiff does not assert that evidence showing any greater likelihood of survival will be produced at trial; it is plaintiff\u2019s theory that the lost chance of survival should itself be compensated. Where the plaintiff can show no more than a possibility that the defendants\u2019 conduct was a cause of the harm, I would conclude that the plaintiff has not produced adequate evidence to create a factual issue regarding causation. <em>Rogers, Harvey, supra. </em>Inherent in the concept of causation is a degree of certitude which is absolutely lacking in this case. Our case law wisely requires evidence from which it may be inferred that the defendant <em>probably </em>caused the ultimate harm before the jury may be allowed to infer that the defendant did cause such harm and should compensate the plaintiff in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Also inherent in the concept of causation is the notion of foreseeability. The scope of liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>should ordinarily extend to, but not beyond, the scope of the \"foreseeable risks\u201d\u2014that is, the risks by reason of which the actor\u2019s conduct is held negligent. Prosser &amp; Keeton, \u00a742, p 273. In this case, there is absolutely no evidence that the purpose of an intravenous line would have been to prevent an amniotic fluid embolism. Similarly, there is a total absence of evidence that the purpose of an intravenous line was to manage or treat this unpredictable complication of labor. Instead, all of plaintiff\u2019s evidence points to the conclusion that the reason for inserting an intravenous line would have been to manage the potential complications of the saddle block anaesthetic. Under these circumstances, even assuming that compensation should be granted where defendant has caused the loss of a mere chance, plaintiff lacks evidence on which a showing of causation may be predicated. In other words, plaintiff cannot even prove that defendant caused the loss of a 37.5 percent chance of survival.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">I disagree with the adoption of the lost chance of survival theory. The recovery of damages for the loss of a mere chance eviscerates the principles that underlie our tort law. By identifying the ultimate harm underlying a wrongful death action as the loss of a chance at survival, the lead opinion abandons the most fundamental negligence element of cause in fact. By definition, the recovery sanctioned today is based on the mere possibility that the acts of the defendants caused the death of Nena Falcon. I believe it is unwise to impose liability on members of the medical profession in such difficult circumstances as those now before this Court. Rather than deterring undesira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ble conduct, the rule imposed only penalizes the medical professional for inevitable unfavorable results. The lost chance of survival theory presumes to know the unknowable. There is little satisfaction or comfort in the conclusion that we simply cannot know why Nena Falcon died. The desire to compensate for the chance that the decedent might have survived, while understandable, is not justifiable.</p>\n<judges id=\"b597-5\">Brickley and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">MCL 600.2922; MSA 27A.2922.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\"> The procedural posture of this case requires us to presume that defendants breached the applicable standard of care.
