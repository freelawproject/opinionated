However, the realities of trial practice lead us to the determination that the harsh rule of automatic reversal goes beyond the limits necessary to safeguard the right of a defendant to a fair trial. Therefore, today we modify the rule of automatic reversal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The linchpin of the new rule centers on a showing of prejudice. For purposes of this rule, we broadly define prejudice as \"any reasonable possibility of prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">We find that communication with a deliberating jury can be classified into one of three categories: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>substantive, administrative, or housekeeping. Upon appeal, it is incumbent upon a reviewing court to first categorize the communication that is the basis of the appeal. This will necessarily lead to the determination of whether a party has demonstrated that the communication was prejudicial, or that the communication lacked any reasonable prejudicial effect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Substantive communication encompasses supplemental instructions on the law given by the trial court to a deliberating jury. A substantive communication carries a <em>presumption </em>of prejudice in favor of the aggrieved party regardless of whether an objection is raised. The presumption may only be rebutted by a firm and definite showing of an <em>absence </em>of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Administrative communications include instructions regarding the availability of certain pieces of evidence and instructions that encourage a jury to continue its deliberations. An administrative communication carries no presumption. The failure to object when made aware of the communication will be taken as evidence that the administrative instruction was not prejudicial. Upon an objection, the burden of persuasion lies with the nonobjecting party to demonstrate that the communication lacked any prejudicial effect. Alternatively, a reviewing court, upon its own volition, may find that an instruction which encourages a jury to continue its deliberations was prejudicial to the defendant because it violated the ABA Standard Jury In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>struction 5.4(b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as adopted by this Court in <em>People v Sullivan, </em>392 Mich 324; 220 NW2d 441 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Housekeeping communications are those which occur between a jury and a court officer regarding meal orders, rest room facilities, or matters consistent with general \"housekeeping\u201d needs that are unrelated in any way to the case being decided. A housekeeping communication carries the presumption of no prejudice. First, there must be an objection to the communication, and then the aggrieved party must make a firm and definite showing which effectively rebuts the presumption of no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We conclude that the instructions in each of the cases at bar fall into the category of administrative communication, except the typewritten definition of second-degree criminal sexual conduct which was a substantive communication. With regard to the administrative communications in each case, the defense counsel waived objection when made aware of the instructions. With regard to the substantive communication in <em>Pannell, </em>the prosecution effectively overcame the presumption of prejudice to the defendant. Furthermore, the note written by the trial court was in conformance with the <em>Sullivan </em>rule and included in the record. We find that the record evidence indicates that neither defendant has suffered \"any reasonable possibility of prejudice\u201d as a result of the communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>France </em>and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Pannell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-S\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"AbZ\">\n<em>A. PEOPLE v FRANCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">At the conclusion of a September, 1985, jury trial, LaNathan France was convicted of armed robbery<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and of breaking and entering an occupied dwelling with intent to commit larceny.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury acquitted him of second-degree criminal sexual conduct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He was sentenced to serve a term of from twenty to forty years in prison for armed robbery, and a concurrent term of from ten to fifteen years in prison for breaking and entering.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Moments after the jury left the courtroom to begin its deliberations, the trial court asked defense counsel, \"[a]ny objection, if [the jurors] ask for the exhibits, just to send them into them by way of the bailiff . . . ?\u201d Defense counsel said he did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">While the jury was deliberating, the trial court several times indicated that there had been contact between the bailiff and the jury. On each occasion, defense counsel stated that he had no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The first of these conversations began when the trial court explained that the jury had sent out a note asking for a diagram of the victim\u2019s house, as well as the exhibits that had been produced by the prosecution. The trial court stated, \"I instructed [the bailiff] to tell [the jurors] that the diagram on the board wasn\u2019t made an exhibit, thus it\u2019s not one of the exhibits that can be brought to them. Their response was okay.\u201d The trial court then stated that the other exhibits had been given to them. Defense counsel responded: \u201d[n]o objection to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>handling [of] the diagram in the manner in which you did, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Later in the day, the trial court stated that it had received a note from the jury asking for a further definition of criminal sexual conduct. The trial court reported that it had given the jury a written instruction in a form that was approved by the defense counsel. Defense counsel stated on the record that the recitation of the trial court was correct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Finally, the trial court said that the jury had requested a police report. He told counsel that \"the response to [the jurors] was that [the police report] was marked but was not received in evidence; and, therefore, we were not able to give them that.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s response was the same: \"[n]o objection to that, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In the Court of Appeals, France presented many claims of error. Believing one had merit, the Court of Appeals declined to discuss the others.</p>\n<p id=\"Apr\">The Court of Appeals followed the strict rule prohibiting communication with a deliberating jury outside the courtroom and the presence of counsel, <em>People v Cain, </em>409 Mich 858; 294 NW2d 692 (1980), and reversed the conviction of the defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court based its decision solely on the doctrine of stare decisis.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Judge Beasley signed the unanimous opinion and added a separate concurrence in which he urged this Court to \"revisit and reverse\u201d the automatic reversal rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>stated in <em>Zaitzeff v Raschke, </em>387 Mich 577; 198 NW2d 309 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The prosecution sought leave to appeal, which we granted on June 30, 1989.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\n<em>B. PEOPLE v PANNELL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Earl L. Pannell went to trial in November, 1985, on eight counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At the conclusion, a jury found him not guilty of three of the eight counts. With regard to the remaining five counts, Pannell was convicted of the lesser offense of third-degree criminal sexual conduct.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He was sentenced to five concurrent terms of from ten to fifteen years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The jury was instructed near the end of the day on November 12, 1985. The next morning, the jury began deliberating, and, at 10:30 a.m., it asked the court for \"[pictures, police report, [and the victim\u2019s] statement.\u201d In the absence of defense counsel, the judge directed the bailiff to give the jury the photographs that were admitted into evidence. However, the court waited to respond to the request for the police report and the victim\u2019s statement until defense counsel appeared at 12:20 p.m. At this time, the matters were placed on the record. Both parties agreed that neither the police report nor the victim\u2019s statement should be sent to the jury because the items were not admitted into evidence. Furthermore, defense counsel had no objections to the jury receiving the photographs. The jury was excused that afternoon at 4:30 p.m. without reaching a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">The following morning, November 14, 1985, at 10:38 a.m., the jury sent a note to the judge which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>read, \"we can not reach an agreement.\u201d Without consulting counsel, the judge immediately replied with a note which read, \"[c]ontinue your deliberations . . . .\u201d At 12:12 p.m. that afternoon, the jury sent out a second note which stated, \"[m]ay we see the hammers?\u201d Again, without consulting counsel, the judge directed the bailiff to give the jury the hammers that were entered into evidence as exhibits.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> When the attorneys returned to the courtroom at 12:20 p.m. the same afternoon, the judge summarized the above occurrences for the record.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Here again, there was no objection to the judge sending the jury the exhibits that were entered into evidence, in this instance the hammers.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">However, defense counsel wanted to place on the record an objection to the jury request of the previous day. The objection was that the testimony of a police officer regarding the victim\u2019s statement should have been reread to the jury.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> During the objection, the jury returned with its verdict at 12:25 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions of the defendant. <em>People v Pannell, </em>170 Mich App 768; 429 NW2d 233 (1988). In doing so, the Court found no error requiring reversal since the note sent to the jury was consistent with the ABA Standard Jury Instruction 5.4(b),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> adopted by this Court in <em>People v Sullivan, supra. </em>Additionally, the <em>Pannell </em>Court took the opportunity to express its concern about the automatic reversal rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">We also state that we, like a growing number of our fellow appellate judges, disagree with the strict rule requiring reversal set forth in <em>People v Cain </em>[94 Mich App 644, 648; 288 NW2d 465 (1980)]. Like Judge Sawyer in his concurrence in <em>People v Lyons </em>[164 Mich App 307, 311; 416 NW2d 422 (1987)], we do not believe that contact with a deliberating jury can never be harmless error. We join Judge Sawyer in urging the Supreme Court to review this issue. <em>[Id. </em>at 771.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The defendant sought leave to appeal, which we granted on June 30, 1989.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AqB5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">It has been clear for well over a hundred years that contact with a deliberating jury must be carefully limited. <em>People v Knapp, </em>42 Mich 267, 269-272; 3 NW 927 (1879); <em>Churchill v Alpena Circuit Judge, </em>56 Mich 536; 23 NW 211 (1885).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>In recent years, this Court has been asked to address the issue on numerous occasions. In <em>Wilson v Hartley, </em>365 Mich 188, 190; 112 NW2d 567 (1961), a bailiff and a clerk entered the jury room on the second day of deliberations and delivered an oral message from the judge. The Court said that it did not \"condone such improper method of handling a jury trial,\u201d but affirmed the conviction on the ground that there was no prejudice to the plaintiff (against whom the jury returned its verdict). In <em>Wilson, </em>pp 189-190, we emphasized the importance of conforming to the correct procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">Trial judges have a responsibility to communicate to the jury directly in open court and in the presence of, or after notice to, the parties or their counsel. The secrecy of the deliberations of the jury is a responsibility of the trial judge. The question of communications, either oral or written, from third parties to the jurors in the jury room has been the subject of several appeals to this Court in the last year. This indicates the importance of calling to the attention of the entire trial bench their duty to preserve the secrecy of the jury deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">A few months later, the Court ordered a new trial in a case in which the trial judge had directed the sheriff to give oral instructions to a deliberating jury. <em>People v Kangas, </em>366 Mich 201; 113 NW2d 865 (1962). Citing <em>Knapp </em>and <em>Churchill, </em>the Court ordered the new trial without separately discussing the question whether there was any prejudice in that particular case. The Court also cautioned trial judges to be sure that they and others avoid improper contact with deliberating juries:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>We call to the attention of the trial judges of this State their duty to safeguard trial by jury from any suspicion the jury may be tampered with while deliberating. Frequently of late this Court has had similar incidents called to its attention by appeal in which there is reason to believe the opportunity for jury tampering was present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">[W]e . . . caution trial judges that bailiffs, sheriffs, and other court personnel should be warned about practices involving associations with jurors both in and out of the courtroom which might create the opportunity to influence their decisions. <em>[Kangas, supra </em>at 208.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In <em>Salvatore v Harper Woods, </em>372 Mich 14, 19-21; 124 NW2d 780 (1963), the trial judge returned a deliberating jury to the courtroom and spoke to the jury in the absence of counsel. The Court said that the trial court should not proceed in this fashion \"unless <em>undue </em>delay of the jury\u2019s deliberations would result or unless counsel have agreed by stipulation on the record to permit such further instruction in their absence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. The Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, however, observing that the proceedings in <em>Salvatore </em>had occurred in open court and had been recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">After wrestling with three more cases involving contact between a deliberating jury and outsiders,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the Court decided <em>Zaitzeff v Raschke, supra. </em>In that case, a deliberating jury passed out a note asking that certain testimony be reread. The judge brought the jurors back to the courtroom, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>he discussed their request.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A short time later, the judge and the court reporter entered the jury room, where the court reporter read to the jury the requested testimony. This Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment in <em>Zaitzeff, </em>adopting Justice Black\u2019s view that it is virtually impossible for a defeated party to demonstrate prejudice as a result of an improper visit to a deliberating jury. This Court strongly emphasized its intention to stop the practice of making improper contact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">With what was written so plainly in 1961 for <em>Wilson v Hartley, </em>365 Mich 188, concerning the indefensible practice of entering the jury room while the jurors are there, no matter by whom done, one would think that this Court had said enough to prevent what took place here. Yet the practice seems to go on, and on, and on, encouraged occasionally by \"no prejudice shown\u201d conclusions of a group of Justices who cannot hope to know what was said, or done, or gestured, or hinted, in the sanctity of the jury room. <em>[Id. </em>at 579.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Later in 1972, this Court reversed a first-degree murder conviction where the trial judge, without obtaining the permission of the attorneys, had entered the jury room to deliver twenty-one exhibits. <em>People v Heard, </em>388 Mich 182, 183-184; 200 NW2d 73 (1972). Neither the attorneys nor the jury had asked the judge to do this, and defense counsel objected when the judge returned to the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">In <em>People v Cain, supra, </em>this Court reinstated an order granting a defendant a new trial. A deliberating jury had passed out a . note asking whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>its verdict had to be unanimous. The judge read the note and told the bailiff to tell the jurors that their verdict had to be unanimous. Because of this error, the trial court granted the defendant a new trial, which the Court of Appeals set aside. This Court reinstated the trial court\u2019s order for a new trial, since the bailiff\u2019s oral statement to the jury \"was in the nature of an instruction, off the record and without counsel, in (at the perimeter of) the jury room, and while the jury was deliberating.\u201d 94 Mich App 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The Court\u2019s most recent opinion in this area is <em>People v Anderson, </em>418 Mich 31; 340 NW2d 634 (1983). In <em>Anderson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">The judge concluded his instructions with the statement that he would, before the jury commenced deliberations, discuss with the lawyers the instructions he had just given. If there were no additional instructions, he would then \"personally come to your jury room and advise you that there will be no more instructions,\u201d whereupon \"any verbal communication between us shall cease.\u201d After determining that there would be no further instructions, the judge announced that he would, with the consent of both counsel, advise the jury to commence deliberations, and apparently did so. <em>[Id. </em>at 45.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The Court of Appeals reversed Anderson\u2019s conviction on a different ground, and this Court reinstated the conviction, finding that the ex parte communication with the jury was not error which required reversal because the trial judge had expressed his intention to communicate with the jury in that fashion and neither party had objected, even though each had been put on notice of the judge\u2019s intention to proceed. Nevertheless, the Court once again cautioned that such contact was improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>There is simply no showing of prejudice in this case .... This view should not be taken in any way as approval of the practice employed in this case. It was an unwise and potentially prejudicial procedure. The better, simpler, and wiser practice would require the trial judge to communicate with the jury only from the bench in the courtroom and on the record. While experience suggests that that may sometimes be a cumbersome and time-consuming procedure, it is a price worth paying to preserve the integrity of the factfinding process, the appearance of jury independence, and the avoidance of the expense, delay, and consumption of judicial resources involved in appellate evaluation of jury room contact between the court and the jurors, [id. at 40-41.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">This issue has also been presented on numerous occasions to the Court of Appeals. Two recent decisions are noteworthy. In <em>People v Kent, </em>157 Mich App 780, 789-792; 404 NW2d 668 (1987), the Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions because of errors in evidentiary rulings, and went on to address the defendant\u2019s contention that error which required reversal took place when a court clerk took meal orders from the jury during its deliberations. Defense counsel and defendant were informed after the fact and neither objected. The Court identified the meal order as a \"purely housekeeping matter,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 791, and concluded that the communication was not improper. Before leaving the issue, the <em>Kent </em>Court strongly criticized the automatic reversal rule and urged a greater flexibility in the manner with which this Court treats the issue.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>In <em>People v Lyons, </em>164 Mich App 307, 309; 416 NW2d 422 (1987), lv den 430 Mich 861 (1988), a deliberating jury sent out a note that read, \" '[t]he jury cannot reach a decision. What does the judge suggest?\u2019 \u201d Without consulting either party, the judge told the bailiff to tell the jury to \" 'keep on working.\u2019 \u201d The bailiff delivered the oral message. The Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, saying that \"[i]n Michigan there is a strict rule prohibiting communication with a deliberating jury outside of the courtroom and the presence of counsel.\u201d The Court of Appeals relied principally upon <em>Cain.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Again, a member of the panel, Judge Sawyer, issued a separate concurrence in which he urged this Court to reexamine the automatic reversal rule. <em>Lyons, supra </em>at 311-313. While noting that an \"invasion into the jury room must be looked upon with great concern,\u201d Judge Sawyer continued on, stating, \"I cannot agree with the proposition that such an invasion can never be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311. Additionally, Judge Sawyer raised the policy concern of requiring the victim of the crime to \"be put through another trial in futile reverence to a rule which serves no useful purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">It is readily apparent that an increasing number of Court of Appeals jurists, while remaining loyal to the doctrine of stare decisis, have found considerable disfavor with the rule of automatic reversal in the event of ex parte communication with a deliberating jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">A review of federal cases that address the issue of ex parte communications with a deliberating jury indicate that the nature of the communication can be classified as either substantive or administrative. Substantive ex parte communication occurs when the trial court provides the jury with supplemental instructions on matters of law. Administrative ex parte communication includes instructions regarding the availability of certain pieces of evidence, and an instruction which encourages the jury to continue its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">One of the earliest cases involving the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>substantive ex parte communication is <em>Fillippon v Albion Vein Slate Co, </em>250 US 76; 39 S Ct 435; 63 L Ed 853 (1919), where an employee brought a personal injury action against his employer for work-related injuries. In <em>Fillippon, </em>the jury was instructed on applicable Pennsylvania law and had retired for deliberations when it sent a written inquiry to the court asking whether the plaintiff should be found to have been contributorily negligent. The court responded with a written supplemental explanation of the law of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The United States Supreme Court found that the supplemental instruction given to the jury was not in accord with Pennsylvania law, and that it was \"calculated to mislead the jury in that it excluded a material element that needed to be considered in determining whether plaintiff should be held guilty of contributory negligence . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82. The Court said that \"the trial court erred in giving a supplementary instruction to the jury in the absence of the parties and without affording them an opportunity either to be present or to make timely objection to the instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81. Although the Court provided no remedy for the error of ex parte communication, it held that erroneous instructions in jury trials are presumptively injurious and furnish grounds for reversal unless it affirmatively appears that they were harmless. The <em>Fillippon </em>rule was then extended to criminal cases in <em>Shields v United States, </em>273 US 583; 47 S Ct 478; 71 L Ed 787 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">One of the leading cases regarding unauthorized communications with a jury is <em>Remmer v United States, </em>347 US 227; 74 S Ct 450; 98 L Ed 654 (1954).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>In a criminal case, any private communication, contact, or tampering, directly or indirectly, with a juror during a trial about the matter pending before the jury is, for obvious reasons, deemed presumptively prejudicial, if not made in pursuance of known rules of the court and the instructions and directions of the court made during the trial, with full knowledge of the parties. <em>The presumption is not conclusive, but the burden rests heavily upon the Government to establish, after notice to and hearing of the defendant, that such contact with the juror was harmless to the defendant. [Id. </em>at 229. Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">One manner in which the prosecution can meet its burden of establishing that the instruction was harmless to the defendant is illustrated in <em>United States v York, </em>830 F2d 885, 894 (CA 8, 1987). The jury posed the question, \" '[c]an we find York guilty on Count n even though he may not have carried a gun?\u2019 \u201d The court responded with, \" '[i]n answer to your question I refer you to pages 31-33 of my instructions.\u2019 \u201d The court held that the presumption of prejudice was overcome because, \"[t]he court\u2019s ex parte communication did nothing more than direct the jury to the neutral correct explanation of the law . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 895. See also <em>Black v Stephens, </em>662 F2d 181 (CA 3, 1981) (In response to a jury\u2019s note requesting a definition of excessive force, the trial court merely recited the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>original instruction to which there was no objection. The court held that the recitation of the original charge was not improper.).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Ex parte administrative instructions are not generally held to be error requiring reversal unless it can be shown that there was a prejudicial effect upon a jury. Occasionally, a jury will request certain documents or information that may or may not have been admitted into evidence. When these requests occur, the trial court will ordinarily advise the jury regarding the availability of the information requested, or, if the subject matter of the request has been admitted into evidence, the court will comply with the request and send in the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">As amply illustrated above, case law has determined that it is error for the court to instruct or communicate with the jury in the absence of counsel and without notice to the defendant and counsel. In <em>United States v Reynolds, </em>489 F2d 4, 8 (CA 6, 1973), the court held that the test for determining if a forbidden communication constituted error requiring reversal was whether \" 'there is any reasonable possibility of prejudice.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">In <em>United States v Mesteth, </em>528 F2d 333 (CA 8, 1976), the jury sent two written requests to the judge. The first asked for the testimony of a witness to be read, and the second was an inquiry regarding whether the defendant was right- or left-handed. The judge responded by writing \"no\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>and his signature on the bottom of each note. The court applied the <em>Reynolds </em>test to find that the communications were not \"of an affirmative or substantive nature,\u201d and held that \"there was no reasonable possibility of prejudice, and the error, if any, was harmless.\u201d <em>Mesteth </em>at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Included within the category of administrative communication is an instruction which encourages a jury to continue its deliberations. In <em>General Motors Corp v Walden, </em>406 F2d 606 (CA 10, 1969), after the jury had deliberated for some time, it sent a note to the court which read, \" 'Your honor, we are sitting five to one, and apparently cannot get closer. We do not know what to do. Will you please instruct us?\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609. Without consulting counsel the court responded, \" '[t]he Court has received your note and advises that you are to continue to deliberate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Within an hour the court informed counsel of the note and its response. However, the court did not divulge how the jury was divided. Neither counsel objected, moved for a mistrial, or requested further instructions. The court found that the statement by the trial court was \"an administrative direction to the jury\u201d and went on to hold, \"the communication was both harmless to the parties and collateral to the issues submitted for determination by the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Again, in <em>Reazin v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc, </em>663 F Supp 1360 (D Kan, 1987),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> citing <em>Acree v Minolta Corp, </em>748 F2d 1382, 1385 (CA 10, 1984), the court said that the response of a trial court to a jury request for evidence or to a <em>question whether a jury should proceed </em>is an administrative direction. In <em>Aeree, </em>the court held, \"[notwithstanding this general [Fillippon] rule, it is not error if the instructions given to the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>are merely administrative directions rather than supplementary instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1385.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">We are persuaded by our analysis of the preceding cases that the Michigan rule of automatic reversal does not serve the best interests of justice and, in many instances, it may very well serve to defeat justice. The Michigan rule was borne of the frustration of this Court with the failure of our state trial courts to cease the practice of entering the jury room while the jury is deliberating. Notwithstanding our decision today, the message bears repeating: ex parte communication with a deliberating jury is error under MCR 6.414(A); it has been, and continues to be discouraged by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">However, as observed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Rushen v Spain, </em>464 US 114, 118-119; 104 S Ct 453; 78 L Ed 2d 267 (1983), reh den 465 US 1055 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">[T]he Constitution \u201ddoes not require a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>every time a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising situation . . . [because] it is virtually impossible to shield jurors from every contact or influence that might theoretically affect their vote.\u201d <em>Smith v Phillips, </em>455 US 209, 217 [102 S Ct 940; 71 L Ed 2d 78] (1982). There is scarcely a lengthy trial in which one or more jurors do not have occasion to speak to the trial judge about something, whether it relates to a matter of personal comfort or to some aspect of the trial. The lower federal courts\u2019 conclusion that an unrecorded <em>ex parte </em>communication between trial judge and juror can never be harmless error ignores these day-to-day realities of courtroom life and undermines society\u2019s interest in the administration of criminal justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">We are persuaded that this Court can no longer \"ignore the day-to-day reality of courtroom life\u201d in Michigan. While we are mindful of the right to a fair trial, we cannot ignore the interest of society in the administration of justice, and the interest of the state in the effective use of its judicial and law enforcement resources. Furthermore, we find merit in the concern for the victims of crime expressed by Judge Sawyer in his <em>Lyons </em>concurrence. We, too, believe that it is unconscionable that a victim must be put through another trial in futile reverence to a rule which fails to serve the interests of justice.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Therefore, we draw from the reasoning of the Court of Appeals jurists who have urged us to review this issue, as well as from the reasoning of the federal courts, to modify the rule of automatic reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The linchpin of the new rule centers on a showing of prejudice. For the purposes of this rule, we broadly define prejudice as \" 'any reasonable possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>bility of prejudice.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> A reviewing court must reverse the conviction if it determines that a defendant has been prejudiced by an ex parte communication with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">We hold that before a reviewing court can make a determination regarding the prejudicial effect of an ex parte communication, it must first categorize the communication into one of three categories: substantive, administrative, or housekeeping. This wilJ necessarily lead to a decision regarding whether a party has demonstrated that the communication was prejudicial or that the communication lacked any reasonable prejudicial effect.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Substantive communication encompasses supplemental instruction on the law given by the trial court to a deliberating jury. A substantive communication carries a presumption of prejudice in favor of the aggrieved party regardless of whether an objection is raised. The presumption may only be rebutted by a firm and definite showing of an absence of prejudice.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> See <em>Remmer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Administrative communications include instructions regarding the availability of certain pieces of evidence and instructions that encourage a jury to continue its deliberations. An administrative communication has no presumption of prejudice. The failure to object when made aware of the communication will be taken as evidence that the instruction was not prejudicial. Upon an objection, the burden lies with the nonobjecting party to demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>strate that the communication lacked any prejudicial effect.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Alternatively, a reviewing court, upon its own volition, may find that an instruction which encouraged a jury to continue its deliberations was prejudicial to the defendant because it violated the ABA Standard Jury Instruction 5.4(b), as adopted by this Court in <em>Sullivan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Housekeeping communications are those which occur between a jury and a court officer regarding meal orders, rest room facilities, or matters consistent with general \"housekeeping\u201d needs that are unrelated in any way to the case being decided. A housekeeping communication carries the presumption of no prejudice. First, there must be an objection to the communication, and then the aggrieved party must make a firm and definite showing which effectively rebuts the presumption of no prejudice.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">In <em>France, </em>the Court of Appeals found no error with regard to the typewritten definition of second-degree criminal sexual conduct which was sent to the jury because the note had received the prior approval of counsel. The Court followed the analysis in <em>People v Anderson, </em>418 Mich 31; 340 NW2d 634 (1983), and held that no prejudice was shown with regard to the typewritten note. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>We find that the typewritten note was a substantive communication because it was a supplemental instruction on the law. However, we hold that the presumption of prejudice was overcome by the consent of the defense counsel prior to the instruction being sent to the jury. As in <em>Anderson, </em>the judge expressed his intention to engage in an ex parte communication with the jury, and both parties consented to the communication after having been put on notice by the court. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the note merely recited the original instruction on second-degree criminal sexual conduct to which there was no objection when given to the jury at the close of trial. <em>Black, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, we are unable to find any reasonable possibility of prejudice to the defendant as a result of the typewritten note.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The comments made by the bailiff in <em>France </em>were a result of requests made by the jury to review certain pieces of information, some that were taken into evidence and some that were not. In each instance, the judge either provided the jury with the evidence, or he instructed the jury that the information was unavailable because it was not entered into evidence. In <em>Pannell, </em>the communications were similar. We find that the ex parte instructions given in both cases come within the category of administrative communication. In each case, the defense counsel waived objection when he was made aware of the instructions, and we are unable to find any reasonable possibility of prejudice to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">With regard to the note written by the trial court in <em>Pannell, </em>we find that the judge merely required the jury to continue its deliberations. The court did not require or threaten to require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>jury to deliberate for an unreasonable time or for unreasonable intervals. Therefore, we find no violation of the rule adopted in <em>Sullivan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">A defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect one.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Today, we have set forth rules which we believe acknowledge the realities of the courtroom while safeguarding the right of an individual to receive a fair trial. Reviewing courts must first categorize the nature of the communication\u2014substantive, administrative, or housekeeping\u2014and then analyze whether the communication carried any reasonable possibility of prejudice to the defendant. In doing so, we find that the communications which serve as the basis for each of the instant appeals did not result in any possible prejudicial effect to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Thus, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>France </em>and remand the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the remaining issues which the defendant has raised on appeal. Conversely, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Pannell.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b268-7\">Brickley, Boyle, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\"><em> </em>See <em>Zaitzeff v Raschke, </em>387 Mich 577; 198 NW2d 309 (1972), and <em>People v Cain, </em>409 Mich 858; 294 NW2d 692 (1980) (peremptory order adopting the dissent of Justice Cavanagh in <em>People v Cain, </em>94 Mich App 644, 647-648; 288 NW2d 465 [1980]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\"> MCR 6.414(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">Court\u2019s Responsibility.

This Court said: \"There was no unauthorized presence in the jury room. Further, the trial court correctly communicated to the jury that there was no transcript in evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Earlier, in <em>People v Anderson, </em>418 Mich 31, 40-41; 340 NW2d 634 (1983), this Court had found there was not error requiring reversal where the judge, before jury deliberation had begun and after he had consulted with counsel and determined that there would be no additional instructions, told the jurors at the door of the jury room to begin their deliberations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This Court said that its decision \"should not be taken in any way as approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>of the practice employed in this case.

A housekeeping communication would carry a presumption of no prejudice. An administrative communication would carry no presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">A failure of defense counsel to object to a substantive communication would not preclude appellate counsel from assigning error on appeal. A failure to object to an administrative communication, however, \"will be taken as evidence that the administrative instruction was not prejudicial.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">Where there has been a substantive communication, the prosecution would have the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>rebutting \"by a firm and definite showing\u201d the <em>\"absence </em>of prejudice\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> without regard to whether defendant\u2019s trial lawyer objected. Where there has been an administrative communication, \"the burden of persuasion lies with the nonobjecting party to demonstrate that the communication lacked any prejudicial effect\u201d <em>if </em>the defendant\u2019s lawyer objected at the trial level.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> A defendant must object to a housekeeping communication to preserve the issue and \"must make a firm and definite showing which effectively rebuts the presumption of no prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The majority would classify the communications at issue in the instant cases as administrative communications.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The majority concludes that \"the record evidence indicates that neither defendant has suffered 'any reasonable possibility of prejudice\u2019 as a result of the communications.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The majority reverses the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>France, </em>where the defendant\u2019s conviction was reversed and a new trial was ordered, and affirms the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Pannell, </em>170 Mich App 768; 429 NW2d 233 (1988), where the defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">We would affirm the decisions of the Court of Appeals in both <em>France </em>and <em>Pannell, </em>and, thus, would, with the Court of Appeals, affirm Pannell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>conviction and reverse France\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In <em>France, </em>after the jury was instructed and left the courtroom, the judge obtained the agreement of counsel for the parties that in the event the jury asks for exhibits, the judge could send them to the jury through a court officer. An hour later, the jury sent a note asking to see a diagram of complainant Brenda Villanueva\u2019s house and the exhibits that were produced by the prosecution. The judge subsequently reported on the record that he had instructed a court officer \"to tell them that the diagram on the board wasn\u2019t made an exhibit, thus it\u2019s not one of the exhibits that can be brought to them. They\u2019re [sic] response was okay.\u201d And the exhibits were given to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The judge said that he had received another note asking to hear France\u2019s testimony, as well as Brenda Villanueva\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor said he had no comment on the requests. France\u2019s lawyer said that he had no objection to the handling of the diagram in the manner in which the judge had responded, but that he would like the jury to hear the entire testimony of both witnesses. After the testimony was played back to the jury, the jury resumed its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The judge reported at 4:30 p.m. that in response to a jury request for a legal definition of criminal sexual conduct, he had sent to the jury a typewritten version of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree that had been earlier approved by France\u2019s lawyer. The judge also reported that he had received a note from the jury at 3:45 p.m. inquiring: \"May we see the police report on Brenda that was entered into an exhibit? Exhibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>#4?\u201d The judge said: \"And the response to them was that Exhibit 4 was marked but was not received in evidence; and, therefore, we were not able to give them that.\u201d And that at 3:50 p.m., he had received a note stating: \"We have reached a verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The complainant, Brenda Villanueva, had been impeached with her original statement to the police set forth in exhibit 4. She originally told the police that she could not identify the perpetrator, but identified France at the trial. It was alleged that there were other inconsistencies between the trial testimony and the statements reported in exhibit 4.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">France argues on appeal that the court officer may have told the jury \"something\u201d that would have led the jury to believe that exhibit 4 should be ignored because it did not constitute evidence. He argues that \"[a]ny slight misstatement by the clerk in this area could have led the jury to disregard substantial impeachment evidence. Such a misstatement is guarded against when counsel is present to help formulate the language.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>To be sure, France\u2019s trial lawyer responded that he had no objection when the judge reported what had occurred. Had France\u2019s lawyer objected, the court officer, and, after the verdict had been read, each member of the jury, and possibly the judge, could have been sworn and questioned by the prosecutor and France\u2019s lawyer. But it was already too late to have attempted to rectify any miscommunication with the jury by corrective instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>The \"Moving Finger\u201d had written and moved on over half an hour before France\u2019s lawyer was given an opportunity to object. To require a lawyer to insist on an inquiry, in order to preserve his client\u2019s position, puts him in an awkward position. The lawyer would not be challenging some act of the prosecutor, but rather the judge\u2019s conduct. The lawyer is put in the position of questioning the accuracy of the judge\u2019s report of what occurred, and of seeking by \"cross-examination\u201d of the court officer, jurors and possibly the judge, to prove that it was inaccurate or incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The judge would be both the hearing officer and a witness. The principal witness would be his court officer, who has just heard the judge state on the record what the court officer was supposed to have said. If the lawyer succeeds in establishing that the court officer said more than the officer was supposed to have said, the court officer and the judge would be embarrassed, to say the very least. The lawyer may have to practice in that court day after day. Is it not expecting too much of the lawyer to require that he seek to embarrass the court officer and the judge? I think so.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>This Court\u2019s conclusion expressed in <em>Zaitzeff </em>that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct what actually occurred where there are oral communications with the jury is the product of experience. What occurred in <em>France </em>was a lapse, that infrequently, almost never is seen to occur. The reason such departures do not occur is because judges know that oral communication with a deliberating jury is an absolute no-no, and we should keep it that way by not retreating to \"encouraging\u201d compliance with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">We would affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction in <em>Pannell. </em>While the trial judge violated this Court\u2019s decisions and the court rules in responding to the jury without first consulting with Pannell\u2019s lawyer and the prosecutor, we can readily determine whether there was any prejudice to Pannell\u2019s rights in the judge\u2019s failure to have done so because he responded with a note and not orally.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The jury in <em>Pannell </em>had expressed its inability to reach a verdict on the morning of the second day of deliberations. We cannot imagine any argument that Pannell\u2019s lawyer could have made that would have persuaded the judge, so early in the jury\u2019s deliberations, to respond other than that the jury should continue to deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">We do not wish to be understood as saying that prejudice must be shown when the judge violates the rule and responds to the jury without consulting with the lawyers. Rather we are saying that where it is <em>manifest </em>there was no prejudice, reversal is not required because of a failure to consult the lawyers before responding.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The argument that the interest of society in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>administration of justice requires the adoption of a new rule is not borne out by the record of reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">There are eight decisions of the Court of Appeals reported (or unreported of which we are aware) in the eighteen years since <em>Zaitzeff </em>was decided, reversing and ordering a new trial because of improper communication between the judge and a deliberating jury. In each of these cases the communication was delivered orally, and thus there was no record of what actually was said other than the judges\u2019 after-the-event report of what he believes occurred or expected to occur:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\"><em>\u2014Marchlewicz v Stanton, </em>50 Mich App 344; 213 NW2d 317 (1973), where, after the jury had retired to deliberate, the judge entered the jury room and conversed with the jury foreman;</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\"><em>\u2014People v Zeegers, </em>61 Mich App 546, 547; 233 NW2d 76 (1975), where the court officer responded, without the approval or knowledge of the court or counsel, to a jury inquiry, \"[s]hould we just consider the tapes, or all of the evidence?\u201d that the jury should consider \"all of the evidence\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\"><em>\u2014People v Olson, </em>66 Mich App 197, 198; 238 NW2d 579 (1975), where the judge entered the jury room to talk to the jury, and, after the verdict, in response to a motion for a new trial, said that \"nothing was discussed in the jury room except the time when the jury would recess and resume, which, of course, are subjects within the Court\u2019s sole discretion\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\"><em>\u2014People v Washington, </em>119 Mich App 373, 375; 326 NW2d 514 (1982), where, as in the instant case of <em>France,</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the jury asked to see pictures used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>questioning a witness, and the judge instructed the bailiff to tell the jury that \"they were not exhibits, were not part of the record, <em>and were not evidence, </em>and they could not have them\u201d (emphasis added);</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><em>\u2014People v Lyons, </em>164 Mich App 307, 309; 416 NW2d 422 (1987), where the jury advised by note that it could not reach a decision, and the judge instructed the bailiff to orally inform the jury, \"keep on working\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><em>\u2014People v Foreman, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, decided October 14, 1987 (Docket No. 91819), p 2, where the judge, like the judge in <em>Washington </em>and the judge in the instant case of <em>France, </em>responded to a note from the jury asking to see police reports by instructing a court officer to tell the jurors that \"the police reports <em>were not evidence </em>in this case\u201d (emphasis added);</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u2014The instant cases of <em>People v France.</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aqrv\">The Court of Appeals, in affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction in the instant case of <em>Pannell, </em>captured the essence of this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Zaitzeff, Heard, Kangas, </em>and <em>Cain, </em>and the line that distinguishes cases where reversal is required without a showing of prejudice from cases where a showing of prejudice is required, when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">In <em>Cain, </em>as in <em>Lyons, </em>the trial judge sent the bailiff <em>to orally answer the jury\u2019s question. </em>In both cases, it was impossible to know what was said to the jury by the bailiff and, consequently, to determine whether there was any prejudice to the defendants\u2019 rights. <em>[People v Pannell, supra, </em>p 770. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Similarly, when a judge enters the jury room and responds personally to an inquiry from the jury, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>is generally \"impossible to know what was said to the jury by the [judge] and, consequently, to determine whether there was any prejudice to the defendants\u2019 rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Eight reversals by the Court of Appeals in eighteen years suggests that the rule stated by this Court in <em>Zaitzeff, </em>and applied by this Court in subsequent decisions, requiring reversal without a showing of prejudice where, after jury deliberations have begun, either the judge enters the jury room or responds to an inquiry from the jury orally through a court officer, is not interfering with, but rather that it may be promoting the interests of society in the administration of justice, and also the interests of the state in the effective use of judicial and law enforcement resources, and that it may also be consistent with concern for the victims of crime by avoiding unnecessary retrials.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">A number of Court of Appeals judges have asked this Court to reconsider the \"automatic reversal rule.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Since there have been only eight reversals in eighteen years, it appears that the \"automatic reversal rule\u201d is not so automatic. The predicate for their request may, however, be instances of questionable reversal in unreported decisions of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The task of reviewing the unreported decisions of the Court of Appeals in criminal cases in order to locate decisions concerning communication with a deliberating jury would certainly be a tedious one. One would think, however, that if there have been instances of questionable reversal in unre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>ported decisions, the judges who have called upon this Court to change the rule could locate them without too much difficulty and thus provide evidence in support of their exhortation that we replace with an exhortation<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> a rule that has worked to reduce and largely eliminate ex parte communication with a deliberating jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The lesson of experience is that exhortation will not guard against ex parte communication by a judge with a deliberating jury. See <em>Wilson v Hartley, </em>365 Mich 188; 112 NW2d 567 (1961), and <em>Salvatore v Harper Woods, </em>372 Mich 14; 124 NW2d 780 (1963), discussed in n 12. This Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>ZaitzelT </em>was the result of the failure of exhortation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The present rule is working. Judges no longer enter the jury room after the jury begins to deliberate. Most judges obey the rule barring ex parte communication with a deliberating jury, and consult with the lawyers before responding to a note from the jury, unless it would cause \"undue delay\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> to do so, or arrangements have been made in advance how the judge should respond to specific inquiries.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">We rarely see a case where a judge responds to an inquiry from the jury except on a stenographically transcribed record or by a note or other writing that becomes part of the court file. If trial judges perceive that they may respond orally off the record, the progress that has been achieved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>obtaining compliance with the rule barring ex parte communication with a deliberating jury may be lost. Some \"busy\u201d judges may become less compliant with the rule barring ex parte communication when responding to jury requests, with the result that there will be more grist for the appellate mill. Court of Appeals judges who are troubled by the present rule may find more troubling the added workload that may result were circuit and Recorder\u2019s Court judges to backslide and thereby provide more work for the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In this connection, it is noteworthy that in the five cases being held in abeyance for this Court\u2019s decisions in the instant cases, the Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions in every case:<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AiD\"><em>\u2014People v Bethea,</em><footnotemark><em>44</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where the judge responded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>without consulting counsel by penning a note that was thereafter placed in the court file;</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><em>\u2014People v Wilson,</em><footnotemark><em>45</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where the judge conferred with the attorneys and responded by note to the jury, who gave it to the jury forewoman and told her to read the note to the jury and hand it back to him, and the note was placed in the court\u2019s file;<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\"><em>\u2014People v Ross</em><footnotemark><em>47</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where the jury sent a note requesting a fifteen-minute break, defense counsel was unavailable, and the judge instructed the court officer to respond orally that the jurors could take a break and return in fifteen minutes, and this was related on the record after the noon recess;<footnotemark>48</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>\u2014People v Montgomery, </em>176 Mich App 501; 440 NW2d 21 (1989), where the foreperson asked the court officer if the jury could go to lunch, the judge approved, and the court officer so informed the jury and that the jurors were to return at 2:15 p.m.; the judge informed counsel of this communication and there was no objection;<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\"><em>\u2014People v Wytcherly (On Rehearing), </em>176 Mich App 714, 716; 440 NW2d 107 (1989), where the judge responded in writing to a note from the jury verdict stating that it was down to two people from reaching a total agreement, \"keep working.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">While the Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions in <em>Ross </em>and <em>Montgomery, </em>although the judge responded orally through a court officer, there was little risk of miscommunication or improper influence on the jury\u2019s deliberations in a statement that the jury could take a fifteen-minute recess or in a statement that the jurors could go to lunch and were to return at 2:15 p.m. There was no suggestion in <em>Ross </em>or <em>Montgomery </em>that there was any communication respecting the subject matter of their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The majority has proposed a tripartite classification for appellate review of ex parte communications by the court or a court officer with a deliberating jury: substantive, administrative, and housekeeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Where the communication is oral and is not stenographically transcribed or by a note or other writing that is preserved as part of the record, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>appellate court will generally not have an adequate record on which to base such a classification. The majority nevertheless states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">Upon appeal, <em>it is incumbent upon a reviewing court to \u00f1rst categorize the communication </em>that is the basis of the appeal. This will <em>necessarily </em>lead to the determination of whether a party has demonstrated that the communication was prejudicial, or that the communication lacked any reasonable prejudicial effect. [Emphasis added[<footnotemark>51</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The proposed tripartite classification begs what, in most cases, is the central question, namely whether the communication was respecting the subject matter of the jury\u2019s deliberations, and, more particularly, whether it was of a sort that could pose any reasonable possibility of prejudice. Clearly, once it is established that a communication, oral or written, concerned only \"meal orders, rest room facilities, or matters consistent with general 'housekeeping\u2019 needs that are unrelated in any way to the case being decided,\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> it would be extraordinary for there to be any reasonable possibility of prejudice as a result of the communication. Similarly, I would agree, a statement that \"certain pieces of evidence\u201d are unavailable, will not ordinarily pose any reasonable possibility of prejudice.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The troublesome issue, where there is not a written record of what occurred, is a factual one: Whether the jury in <em>France </em>was told only that a police report<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> is not an exhibit or whether what was said by the court officer was reasonably susceptible of being understood as an instruction that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the jurors were not to consider the contents of the police report as evidence. Indeed, when a jury asks for a police report that was not received in evidence as an exhibit, it may be appropriate for the judge to explain to the jury that while the police report is not an exhibit, the contents, as related on the stenographic record, may be considered to impeach and in assessing the credibility of the witness whose statement is reported in the police report, and that the jurors should attempt to recall, through their collective memories, the testimony regarding the police report.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The judge\u2019s response to a request for an exhibit that was marked and not introduced into evidence may thus encompass, in effect, \"supplemental instructions on the law,\u201d and thus constitute a substantive, rather than an administrative, communication.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> One can be sure that lawyers will so contend, and rightfully so. The tripartite classification will not assist in resolving the question whether there is any reasonable possibility of prejudice in an oral response that a police report that was marked as an exhibit was not evidence.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">An instruction \"encourag[ing] a jury to continue its deliberations\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> may also be a substantive communication, if the communication includes, and possibly if it fails to include, a supplemental instruction on the law, along the lines of the instruction adopted by this Court in <em>People v Sullivan, </em>392 Mich 324; 220 NW2d 441 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The majority would place on the prosecution the burden of rebutting a claim of prejudice by a \"firm and definite showing\u201d of \"an <em>absence </em>of prejudice\u201d where the communication is substantive and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>\"burden of persuasion\u201d to \"demonstrate that [an administrative] communication [to which the defendant objected] lacked any prejudicial effect.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> If the \"substantive\u201d or \"administrative\u201d communication is stenographically recorded, or there is other written record of the communication, there will be nothing further to \"show.\u201d And then it will be for the appellate court to determine whether there was any reasonable possibility of prejudice. If there is not a stenographic or written record, the prosecution will be in no better position than the defendant to \"show\u201d whether there was or was not prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In sum, where there is not a stenographic or other contemporaneous written record of the communication, the prosecutor will not be able to show, and an appellate court will generally be unable to determine, whether the communication is \"administrative\u201d or \"substantive,\u201d and may, in a rare case, even have difficulty determining whether an oral communication is \"housekeeping.\u201d Where there is a contemporaneous written record of the communication, the appellate court will generally be able to make an assessment, without regard to whether the plaintiff in a civil case or a prosecutor in a criminal case or the defendant, in a civil or criminal case, has the burden of persuasion, of whether there was any reasonable possibility of prejudice, even though the rule against ex parte communication with a deliberating jury was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Reference has been made by the majority to decisions of the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">In <em>United States v Mesteth, </em>528 F2d 333, 334 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>(CA 8, 1976), the judge responded to a deliberating jury\u2019s requests to have certain testimony reread and to be told whether the defendant was left- or right-handed.

The secrecy of the deliberations of the jury is a responsibility of the trial judge.

Although we do not condone such improper method of handling a jury trial, under the circumstances we are of the opinion that no prejudice resulted to plaintiff and that the situation does not constitute a just reason for reversal of the verdict and judgment. <em>[Id., </em>pp 189-190.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-10\"><em>Wilson </em>was followed by <em>Salvatore v Harper Woods, </em>372 Mich 14, 20; 124 NW2d 780 (1963), where the jury returned to the courtroom and inquired about figures placed by a witness on a blackboard. The judge responded on the record in the absence of the parties and counsel, that the blackboard figures were not an exhibit, and made other observations on the record. This Court concluded that it did not appear that the defendant was prejudiced by the colloquy read in light of the verdict. The Court distinguished <em>Wilson v Hartley </em>on the basis that there the bailiff and clerk entered the jury room to convey the judge\u2019s oral instructions, while in <em>Salvatore </em>\"the proceedings occurred <em>in open court and were recorded.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">The Court in <em>Salvatore </em>said that although \"counsel\u2019s absence from the courtroom when a jury returns for further instructions does not bar the trial judge from proceeding, he should not do so unless <em>undue </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>delay of the jury\u2019s deliberations would result or unless counsel have agreed by stipulation on the record to permit such further instruction in their absence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 21.

This error was particularly important because the clerk instructed the jury on evidence and its use. Of course, she could as easily have told them something that would have led the jury to believe that these items were to be disregarded because they did not constitute evidence. This is a particular problem here because the court instructed that only evidence could be considered, pursuant to cji . . . . Any slight misstatement by the clerk in this area could have led the jury to disregard substantial impeachment evidence. Such a misstatement is guarded against when counsel is present to help formulate the language. The clerk\u2019s instructions here may well have affected the verdict and so constituted sufficient potential prejudice to require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The impeachment evidence itself was crucial, particularly the pcr, because it damaged the general credibility of the Complainant and Amy and specifically impeached the evidence on whether Defendant was armed. The pcr indicated that Amy originally told the police that she had seen nothing .... This directly contradicted her testimony that she had seen a knife-like object. The pcr indicated that the Complainant herself did not get a good look at the perpetrator and so could not identify anyone. This conflicted with her alleged ability to identify Defendant at trial. Also the pcr indicated that she was unsure of whether the perpetrator had a gun or a knife. Such ambiguity would lead a jury to question whether any weapon was involved at all\u2014a hotly contested issue here where Defendant denied having any weapon, as his primary defense. There was much testimony and discussion regarding the pcr at trial. Defense counsel referred to it extensively in closing .... There was certainly the potential of prejudice and a reasonable possibility of prejudice here.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Also the answer to the question on the pcr generated a verdict. Within five minutes after answering the question, the jury reached a verdict .... They were no doubt undecided because of this impeachment evidence. Any answer to a jury question that causes a verdict so quickly cannot be said to have had no affect on the verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\"> The adoption of the tripartite classification set forth by the majority would, however, require a lawyer to seek such an inquiry, and not to obligingly say \"no objection\u201d when a judge reports that he has, ex parte, authorized an oral communication with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">A judge who, after he has responded ex parte to a jury inquiry, reports, on the record, to counsel concerning the communication with the jury, should be required, possibly by an amendment of the rule, to explain why he engaged in an ex parte communication with the jury, i.e., he attempted to reach counsel but was unable to do so, and to have waited longer in responding would have resulted in <em>\"undue </em>delay.\u201d See <em>Salvatore, </em>n 12 <em>supra, </em>p 21.

A new trial was ordered in <em>Szopko v Kinsman Marine Transit, </em>96 Mich App 64; 292 NW2d 486 (1980), where the judge had an off-the-record conversation, without the presence of counsel, with a particular juror concerning an incident that had occurred during the course of the trial.
