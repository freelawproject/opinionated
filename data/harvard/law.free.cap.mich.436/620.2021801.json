The central issue is whether a group of vacant improved subdivision lots owned by petitioner can be valued utilizing a wholesale discount, resulting in a lower assessed valuation than if each lot had been individually owned. Under the circumstances presented in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>case, we conclude that the tribunal adopted wrong principles in measuring the true cash value of petitioner\u2019s property on a discount basis. We therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">This appeal involves tax assessment valuations for the tax years 1981 through 1984. Petitioner-appellant Edward Rose Building Company, a housing developer, owned one hundred vacant lots in a platted single-family residential subdivision known as Lake Oakland Woods in Independence Township, Oakland County. Roads, utilities, sewer, and water had been installed in the subdivision. Petitioner handled both (1) the development of raw land to the point of platting and improving the lots for building, and (2) the actual construction of houses on the lots for sale to the ultimate consumers. Petitioner\u2019s marketing plan was limited exclusively to the sale of individual lots on which it had constructed homes. Petitioner did not sell, nor did it offer to sell, lots as groups to other developers or builders, and it did not sell individual platted lots without houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In the late 1970\u2019s, a housing slump occurred as part of the general economic recession, and sales of the lots in question came to a standstill. No lots were sold from 1980 to 1982. In 1983, eight lots were sold; thirteen others were improved with basements. Assessing the property at fifty percent of its true cash value, the township assessment for each lot was $6,400 for the years 1981 and 1982, and $6,900 for the years 1983 and 1984. Petitioner appealed the assessments to the Michigan Tax Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">On March 26, 1985, a hearing was held before a tribunal hearing officer. Each side called an ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>praiser as a witness. The true cash value of the properties per lot as claimed by the parties is set forth in the following table:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">YEAR PETITIONER TOWNSHIP</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">1981 $10,000 $14,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">1982 9,000 13,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">1983 8,100 11,700</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\">1984 7,800 13,000<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-21\">The difference in the claimed true cash values for each lot resulted from the fact that each of the appraisers used a different valuation method. Although both appraisers valued the lots as though all of the lots were of equal value (or used an average value per lot), the petitioner\u2019s appraiser concluded that no market existed for individual lot sales and therefore based the property\u2019s value on comparable multilot sales to builders. Given the depressed market, it was petitioner\u2019s position before the hearing officer that the buyer of the lots would most likely be another developer or a builder who would buy the lots \"en masse,\u201d to resell them to individuals at a profit. Petitioner contended that a quantity or wholesale discount\u2014 reflecting holding costs for marketing, financing, and risk\u2014necessarily had to be recognized as an integral part of a group sales transaction. Under the approach advocated by the petitioner\u2019s appraiser in valuing the lots for the years 1981 to 1983, the discounted value of the lots as a group was determined, and then the true cash value of each lot was to be fixed for tax purposes by dividing the discounted value by one hundred.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-22\">On the other hand, the township\u2019s appraiser valued the lots by comparing sales of individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>lots. The township contended that the true cash value of each lot was equal to the price that an individual buyer would pay for the lot, i.e., its single lot value. The township argued that its position is strengthened because the petitioner\u2019s marketing plan did not contemplate sales on a group basis; rather, the petitioner sold, and planned to sell, the lots one at a time, and then only after it had constructed houses on the lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">The hearing officer concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">on the facts herein, where petitioner declines to sell lots either individually or in groups, but only sells a lot in conjunction with the sale of a house, it seems to be a self-imposed limitation or restriction on the alienability of its property such that valuing the lots as a group might be inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The hearing officer set the true cash value of the lots at $14,000 per lot in 1981, $13,000 in 1982 and 1984 ($15,000 in 1984 for the thirteen lots with basements), and $12,000 in 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Petitioner then appealed to the entire Tax Tribunal. On March 21, 1986, the Tax Tribunal vacated the conclusions of law as stated by the hearing officer. The tribunal held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">The Respondent [township] has convinced this Tribunal through the market approach, substantiated by a market analysis, that land is 20% of the total improved sale price, and that the subject lots, if sold <em>individually, </em>should be valued as follows: 1981, $14,500; 1982, $13,000; 1983, $11,700; and 1984, $13,000. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">However, while adopting the township\u2019s approach to determining the individual valuation per lot, the tribunal discounted the value per lot by a factor of eighteen percent, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The appraiser must distinguish between the aggregate of individual retail lot prices, and the discounted or wholesale value, which is market value. In comparing Petitioner\u2019s sales of <em>multiple </em>lots with Respondent\u2019s sales of <em>individual </em>lots; there is a distinct indication that 18% is the \"mark up\u201d difference between the purchase of multiple lots and single lots. In a sense, the typical land developer is a merchant who depends on a cost mark-up sufficient to cover expenses and produce a reasonable profit as a reward for risk and effort. This provision for profit may be expressed in a variety of ways, but should be sufficient to attract the necessary capital to the project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">This Tribunal has discounted these \"retail\u201d individual values to allow an 18% mark up for the influence of development costs during the holding period of liquidation. Realistically, if the developer sold all the subject lots at the time periods under consideration, he obviously would have sold them as an entire package and the sale price would have been at \"wholesale\u201d to allow the buyer a profit when reselling individually. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The Tax Tribunal concluded that the true cash value of the lots was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">1981 $12,300 . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">1982 11,000 . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">1983 9,900 . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">1984 11,000 [79 lots] . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">13,000 [13 lots with basements]. . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">Upon further appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals agreed that the Tax Tribunal had properly selected the market approach as the most accurate method of valuation. <em>Edward Rose Bldg Co v Independence Twp, </em>164 Mich App 324, 328; 416 NW2d 433 (1987). However, the Court disagreed with the tribunal\u2019s use of a discount:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Although we do not agree that petitioner\u2019s marketing decision constitutes a limit on \"alienation,\u201d we do find that his marketing decision had a significant effect on what can properly be considered fair market value. Petitioner marketed only individual lots and only with a house petitioner built. On its own terms, the lots are unavailable for group-lot sales. The term \"fair market value\u201d presumes a market. Petitioner may not fairly argue that its property\u2019s value is comparable to other group-lot sales when petitioner specifically refuses to sell on that basis. The Tax Tribunal is bound to review the actual facts in a case and not possible or hypothetical sales in evaluating tcv [true cash value]. Cf. <em>Uniroyal v Allen Park, </em>138 Mich App 156; 360 NW2d 156 (1984) (where it was held that, in determining the tcv by a capitalization of income method, the Tax Tribunal should rely on the actual rent established by lease and not a hypothetical market rent).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">While petitioner does not sell individual lots without houses it builds, individual lot sales are a significantly more accurate way of measuring the tcv of petitioner\u2019s property. The Tax Tribunal is charged with the duty of accepting the approach which provides the most accurate valuation under the circumstances of each case. <em>Antisdale </em>[v <em>City of Galesburg, </em>420 Mich 265, 277; 362 NW2d 632 (1984)]. We therefore find that the Tax Tribunal erred in interpreting the statutory phrase \"true cash value\u201d when it measured the fair market value of petitioner\u2019s property on a \"wholesale\u201d basis where petitioner did not, in fact, market the property in that fashion. <em>[Id., </em>pp 329-330.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The Court of Appeals further noted that \"were we to uphold the Tax Tribunal\u2019s ruling, it would have the unhappy effect of distinguishing assessments merely on the basis of the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s holdings. . . . [T]his strikes us as fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 330. The Court lastly found \"no relation in the record between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>assessed [true cash value] of petitioner\u2019s property and his business costs\u201d and therefore reversed the tribunal\u2019s eighteen percent discount as error. <em>Id., </em>p 331. The case was remanded to the tribunal for a recomputation of the ad valorem assessment consistent with the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">This Court granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 431 Mich 908 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">The Michigan Constitution, art 9, \u00a7 3, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-9\">The legislature shall provide for the uniform general ad valorem taxation of real and tangible personal property not exempt by law. The legislature shall provide for the determination of true cash value of such property; the proportion of true cash value at which such property shall be uniformly assessed, which shall not, after January 1, 1966, exceed 50 percent; and for a system of equalization of assessments. The legislature may provide for alternative means of taxation of designated real and tangible personal property in lieu of general ad valorem taxation. Every tax other than the general ad valorem property tax shall be uniform upon the class or classes on which it operates._</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>The Legislature accordingly provided a definition of \"cash value\u201d which, during the tax years in question,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\">As used in this act, \"cash value\u201d means the usual selling price at the place where the property to which the term is applied is at the time of assessment, being the price which could be obtained for the property at private sale, and not at forced or auction sale. ... In determining the value the assessor shall also consider the advantages and disadvantages of location; quality of soil; zoning; existing use; present economic income of structures, including farm structures; present economic income of land if the land is being farmed or otherwise put to income producing use; quantity and value of standing timber; water power and privileges; and mines, minerals, quarries, or other valuable deposits known to be available in the land and their value. [MCL 211.27(1); MSA 7.27(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">MCL 211.27a(l); MSA 7.27(1X1) further requires that \"property shall be assessed at <em>50% </em>of its true cash value pursuant to section 3 of article 9 of the state constitution of 1963.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">As this Court has frequently recognized in the past, our review of property tax assessment appeals is tempered by a constitutionally mandated standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">In the absence of fraud, error of law or the adoption of wrong principles, no appeal may be taken to any court from any final agency provided for the administration of property tax laws from any decision relating to valuation or allocation. [Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">It is the province of the Tax Tribunal to apply its expertise to the facts of each case to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>the appropriate method of arriving at the cash value, or fair market value, of the subject property. The factual findings of the tribunal are final, provided they are supported by competent and substantial evidence. <em>Antisdale v City of Galesburg, supra, </em>p 277. See also <em>Continental Cablevision v Roseville, </em>430 Mich 727, 735; 425 NW2d 53 (1988); <em>Fisher-New Center Co v State Tax Comm (On Rehearing), </em>381 Mich 713; 167 NW2d 263 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Despite this deferential standard of review, we conclude under the present circumstance that the Tax Tribunal adopted a wrong principle in discounting the individual lot values by a factor of eighteen percent. The tribunal\u2019s valuation of petitioner\u2019s property utilizing a wholesale discount was an improper method of valuation which distorted the fair market value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">As a general rule, different parcels of land in the sam\u00e9 ownership are to be regarded as separate units for tax purposes and, as such, must be separately valued and assessed. 72 Am Jur 2d, State and Local Taxation, \u00a7743, p 72. See generally, anno: <em>Different parts or parcels of land in the same unit or separate units for tax assessment purposes, </em>133 ALR 524.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">On the basis of testimony taken before the hearing officer, the Tax Tribunal rejected the petitioner\u2019s proffered evidence of valuation based upon group lot sales comparables. Instead, the tribunal expressly accepted the valuations of the township <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>per lot (see section i). The values assigned to the individual lots as determined by the Tax Tribunal are not challenged on appeal, and we do not quarrel with this factual determination or the Tax Tribunal\u2019s selection of the market approach data produced by the township as the most accurate means of determining the true cash value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">However, the Tax Tribunal inappropriately proceeded one step further. The tribunal discounted the valuations per lot \"to allow an 18% mark up for the influence of development costs during the holding period of liquidation.\u201d Thus, the Tax Tribunal essentially took the \"wholesale\u201d approach, adopting the township\u2019s assessment, less eighteen percent. This application of a wholesale discount disregards several factors essential to an accurate computation of true cash value.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">\"Highest and best use\u201d is a concept fundamental to the determination of true cash value. It recognizes that the use to which a prospective buyer would put the property will influence the price which the buyer would be willing to pay. Land is appropriately valued \"as if available for development to its highest and best use, that most likely legal use which will yield the highest present worth.\u201d 1 Michigan State Tax Commission, Assessor\u2019s Manual, ch VI, p 5 (1972). See also <em>Teledyne Continental Motors v Muskegon Twp, </em>163 Mich App 188; 413 NW2d 700 (1987), lv den 429 Mich 889 (1987), <em>The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal </em>(Chicago: American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, 1984), p 152, and Boyce, <em>Real Estate Appraisal Terminology </em>(Cambridge, Mass: Ballinger Publishing Co, 1975), p 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In this case, the parties\u2019 experts agree that the highest and best physical use of the property is as single family residential lots for development into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>home sites. Indeed, all of the appraisals submitted by the experts presume the use of the property as a single-family residential subdivision. The application of a wholesale discount may be appropriate when measuring the investment value of raw land or unimproved subdivision lots, but not when measuring the value of improved property if put to its highest and best use. This point was recognized in <em>First Interstate Bank of Oregon v Dep\u2019t of Reve</em>nue, 306 Or 450; 760 P2d 880 (1988). In <em>First Interstate, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court considered the assessment of lots in a fully developed subdivision containing roads and utilities. The assessor valued and assessed each lot separately. The developer/owner argued for assessment of the lots as a single property, which would have resulted in a lower assessed value. Like the petitioner in this case, the developer asserted that a discount should be figured into, the assessed value. Holding that the lots were to be individually assessed, the court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">Taxpayer\u2019s position is based on an appraisal of the properties that relies on a \"developer\u2019s discount\u201d to arrive at the assessed value of the properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">Reduction by this method results in a determination of the properties\u2019 value to the current owner or their value as an investment. This is not the market value, which is the price that each property would receive on the open market. OAR 150-308.205(A)(l)(a). While in certain circumstances the value to the owner might equal the market value, the value to the owner cannot be equated with the market value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">There is no dispute that the highest and best use of each lot is for the construction of a single-family residence. Only by valuing the property at its highest and best use can the true cash value of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>property be determined. [Citation omitted.] <em>The developer's discount does not assess the value of the properties if put to their highest and best use, but reduces their value to arrive at the value of the properties considered as an investment. Investment is not the highest and best use of the properties.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\">Although we reject a developer\u2019s discount in the situation in which the original holding has been subdivided into several lots and the subdivision has been fully developed, it is appropriate to take into account the present legal and physical status of the property. Even if the best use of a property would be for subdivision, the property\u2019s present value would take into account the fact that the property would not be presently usable for the sale of individual lots. <em>However, when the property has been subdivided and roads and utilities provided to each lot, there are no longer development costs which would affect the present market value of each lot. Each lot is fully developed and ready to be put to its highest and best use. [First Interstate, supra, </em>pp 453-455. Emphasis added. Cf. <em>Appeal of Sawmill Brook Development Co, </em>129 NH 410; 529 A2d 902 (1987); <em>Cigolini Associates v Borough of Fairview, </em>208 NJ Super 654; 506 A2d 811 (1986).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In the present analogous circumstances, it similarly cannot be said that the investment value to the petitioner bears a relationship to the fair market value of the improved property when put to its highest and best use. A discount may be appropriate where an undeveloped tract of land exists without improvements. The recognized \"developmental approach\u201d to valuation allows for such a discount. However, this approach is appropriate only in instances involving unimproved property. The Michigan State Tax Commission, Assessor\u2019s Manual, ch VI, p 7, characterizes the \"developmental approach\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Land with a potential use for subdivision is often valued by the development method. ... To indicate present value, the development method requires estimates of the selling price of developed lots; of the cost required for development, financing, carrying, and sales; of the period necessary to sell the developed lots; and of the amount by which the net sale price must be discounted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Significantly, the Tax Tribunal rejected use of the developmental approach in the instant case, finding that it \"is <em>not applicable to the subject property since the costs of converting the raw land into platted lots has been </em>completed(Emphasis added.) The tribunal nevertheless applied a developer\u2019s discount to the market values substantiated by the township. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">When the assessment of separate \"improved\u201d lots<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is based upon sales of comparable lots using the market approach to valuation, as is the case here, market conditions are already taken into account. If the developer then obtains a further \"discount\u201d due to the same market conditions, the true cash value of each lot would be distorted. In effect, the weakness of the market would be counted twice in computing value. As explained by this Court in <em>Antisdale, supra, </em>quoting from the Michigan State Tax Commission, Assessor\u2019s Manual:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">\"The market value of a given property is esti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>mated by comparison with similar properties which have recently been sold or offered for sale in the open market. The principle of substitution is applied, i.e., when property is replaceable, typical buyers will not purchase it at a higher price than those paid for similar properties with comparable locations, characteristics, and future earning capabilities. Of all appraisal methods the market data approach is the most direct, the best understood, and <em>the only one directly re\u00f1ecting the balance of supply and demand for a whole property in actual market place trading.\u201d [.Antisdale, supra, </em>p 276, n 1, quoting 1 Michigan State Tax Comm, Assessor\u2019s Manual, ch VI, pp 1-2. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">In <em>St Leonard Shores Joint Venture v Sup\u2019r of Assessments of Calvert Co, </em>307 Md 441, 445; 514 A2d 1215 (1986), the court considered a challenge by a land developer to the property tax assessment of a subdivided tract of land owned by him. The developer argued that the assessment should have taken into account a discount for the length of time necessary to sell all of the lots. The supervisor\u2019s assessment valued each of the lots using comparable individual lot sales in the taxpayer\u2019s and in neighboring subdivisions. The court affirmed that assessment, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">Regardless of whether a buyer for each lot actually exists, the assessor is required to assess each lot as if a willing buyer exists. This is not to say that a glut on the market should not be considered. We think, however, that the condition of the real estate market is adequately reflected in the price that the hypothetical buyer would be willing to pay. Therefore, we reject appellant\u2019s contention relating to the \"sell-out period\u201d of the lots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">We think that these sales, as well as the sales in similar subdivisions, provided an ample basis from which the Tax Court could reasonably conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>that the Supervisor had correctly assessed the subdivision lots. . . . \"[Appellant\u2019s] approach to fair market value is a staged sell-out over a period of years, with [appropriate] conveying charges etc., and finally reducing the end result to a net profit figure. This is good, sound business practice. Unfortunately, it is not the way the assessment process works.\u201d <em>[Id.., </em>pp 446-448.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">In the instant case, there may not have been one hundred buyers for the one hundred subdivision lots. However, this fact is not determinative of value; current market conditions are an intrinsic element of the market data approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">It has also been recognized that the calculation of a discount for absorption time would be unduly speculative: \" 'If all the lots sold in one year, we have a value certain; if all the lots sell over a period of years, we have a value dependent upon the future whims of the market place.\u2019 \u201d <em>St Leonard Shores Joint Venture v Sup\u2019r of Assessments of Calvert Co, </em>61 Md App 204, 207; 486 A2d 206 (1985), aff\u2019d 307 Md 441; 514 A2d 1215 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Finally, the statutory definition of true cash value\u2014\"the usual selling price\u201d\u2014requires that actual facts be a significant consideration in the valuation of property. We have previously recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adc\">[t]here are many factors external to property that influence and determine its real value; they include neighborhood conditions, location, property tax, general economic conditions, and the cost of borrowing. <em>[Washtenaw Co v State Tax Comm, </em>422 Mich 346, 366; 373 NW2d 697 (1985). See also <em>Antisdale, supra, </em>p 285 (\"To the extent that tax benefits to a typical owner affect the 'usual selling price\u2019 of property, they are properly included within the true cash value of the property\u201d); MCL 211.27; MSA 7.27.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Even the dissent in the instant case realizes that \" 'Assessment decisions must recognize limitations or restrictions which have a bearing on the selling price of property.\u2019 \u201d (Opinion of Levin, J., <em>post, </em>p 668.) In the instant case, the petitioner\u2019s marketing scheme affected the fair market value of the property. As the Court of Appeals aptly noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\">Petitioner marketed only individual lots and only with a house petitioner built. On its own terms, the lots are unavailable for group-lot sales. The term \"fair market value\u201d presumes a market. Petitioner may not fairly argue that its property\u2019s value is comparable to other group-lot sales when petitioner specifically refuses to sell on that basis. [164 Mich App 329.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">It is the duty of the Tax Tribunal to accept the approach which provides the most accurate valuation under the circumstances of each case. <em>Antis-dale, supra, </em>p 277. While the tribunal properly selected the market approach, based on individual lot sales, as the most accurate way of measuring the true cash value of petitioner\u2019s property, the application of a discount to the valuations per lot contradicted this market approach and was inconsistent with the recognized highest and best use of the property. We therefore conclude that the Tax Tribunal adopted wrong principles in measuring \"true cash value\u201d under the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">One final aspect of this case warrants our attention. The township contends that assessments that would be derived from using two different markets \u2014a multilot market for the unsold lots and a single lot market for the sold lots\u2014for property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>identical in all respects except for ownership violates the principle of uniformity of taxation. This is a legitimate concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The Michigan Constitution mandates not only that property must be assessed at a uniform fifty percent of true cash value, but also that the ad valorem taxation itself be uniform. Const 1963, art 9, \u00a73. It is well established that the concept of uniformity requires uniformity not only in the rate of taxation, but also in the mode of assessment. <em>East Grand Rapids School Dist v Kent Co Tax Allocation Bd, </em>415 Mich 381, 395-396; 330 NW2d 7 (1982), reh den 417 Mich 1104 (1983); <em>Washtenaw Co, supra; Titus v State Tax Comm, </em>374 Mich 476; 132 NW2d 647 (1965); <em>Huron-Clinton Metropolitan Authority v Bds of Supervisors of Five Counties, </em>304 Mich 328, 335-336; 8 NW2d 84 (1943). The \"controlling principle is one of equal treatment of similarly situated taxpayers.\u201d <em>Armco Steel Corp v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>419 Mich 582, 592; 358 NW2d 839 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The uniformity requirement of the Michigan Constitution compels the assignment of values to property upon the basis of the true cash value of the property and not upon the basis of the manner in which it is held. Noticeably absent from the statutory definition of \"cash value\u201d and those enumerated factors which an assessor must consider is any reference to the identity of the person owning an interest in the property or whether there are other parcels which are owned by the same taxpayer. MCL 211.27; MSA 7.27. In other words, the fact of ownership is not a germane consideration in determining value:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">\"The Constitution requires assessments to be made on property at its cash value. This means not only what may be put to valuable uses, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>what has a <em>recognizable pecuniary value inherent in itself, and not enhanced or diminished according to the person who owns or uses it.\u201d [Washtenaw Co, supra, </em>p 370, n 4, quoting <em>Perry v Big Rapids, </em>67 Mich 146, 147; 34 NW 530 (1887). Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">It matters not, accordingly, whether similar tax parcels are owned by the same person. The tribunal\u2019s mode of assessment violates the sum and substance of the uniformity mandate. As the Court of Appeals in this case recognized,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">[W]ere we to uphold the Tax Tribunal\u2019s ruling, it would have the unhappy effect of distinguishing assessments merely on the basis of the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s holdings. A large property owner, even though he is marketing individual lots and not proposing multi-lot sales, would be able to claim a significantly reduced assessment, compared to a single lot holder, merely on the basis of extensive holdings. In this context, this strikes us as fundamentally unfair. Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 3. [164 Mich App 330.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Affording a discount to the multilot owner provides advantageous treatment upon the basis of a factor unrelated to the land itself. It \"would produce an inherent preference in favor of developers, as opposed to taxpayers who own single or scattered lots.\u201d <em>St Leonard Shores Joint Venture, supra, </em>61 Md App 215. Two identical lots, available for the same ultimate use, would not be equally taxed. And, practically speaking, the taxing authority would be faced with the problem of where to draw the line\u2014should a discount be allowed for a twenty-lot owner, a fifty-lot owner, or only the one hundred-lot developer?</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">We conclude that the disparity in treatment which results from the tribunal\u2019s method of val\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>tion is not permissible under the uniformity provisions of the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The Tax Tribunal adopted wrong principles in this case when it utilized a wholesale discount in determining the true cash value of petitioner\u2019s improved subdivision lots. There was ample market data produced by the township regarding individual lot sales which provided an accurate means of ascertaining the true cash value of individual lots. In fact, the tribunal expressly accepted the valuations per lot proposed by the township. The tribunal nevertheless proceeded to apply a wholesale discount to these values. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">We do not preclude the possibility that a wholesale discount may be an appropriate element of valuation where the subject property is raw or unimproved land and the land is suitable for valuation using the developmental approach. However, where, as here, the land has been subdivided and improved, the petitioner has chosen to market the property on an individual lot basis only, and the market approach constitutes the chosen means of measuring values per lot, a developer\u2019s discount distorts the true cash value of the lots. In effect, it doubly counts the weakness of the market and allows for costs to the developer which are no longer relevant given the \"improved\u201d status of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">In light of our holding, we affirm, as did the Court of Appeals, the tribunal\u2019s findings as to the individual lot valuations without the application of a discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">We remand this case to the Tax Tribunal for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>computation of the tax for the years in question consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b745-4\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Boyle, and Archer, JJ., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b745-5\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7A\"><em>(to reverse the Court of Appeals and affirm the Tax </em>Tribunal). Edward Rose Building Company owned one hundred single family residence lots that it had platted and improved with utilities and roads. The Tax Tribunal, on Rose\u2019s petition for review of real property tax assessments,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found that, for the tax years 1981 through 1984, the wholesale values of the lots were approximately $2,000 a lot less than the retail values of the lots,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and directed that the assessments be revised on the basis of the wholesale values.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stating that the Tax Tribunal had erred as a matter of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">The constitution provides that a determination of the Tax Tribunal \"relating to valuation\u201d is not subject to appeal \"to any court\u201d in the \"absence of fraud, error of law or the adoption of wrong princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>pies.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court has held, however, that a valuation not \"supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> constitutes an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The question presented is, thus, (1) whether there is competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record to support the \"wholesale\u201d values set forth in the decision of the Tax Tribunal, and (2) whether the Tax Tribunal, in directing that the assessments be based on the \"wholesale\u201d values, committed fraud or error of law or adopted a wrong principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The majority agrees with the Court of Appeals that the Tax Tribunal erred as a matter of law in measuring the \"true cash value\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>/\"usual selling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>price\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of Rose\u2019s property on a wholesale basis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The majority concludes that the Tax Tribunal was required, as a matter of law, to ignore the wholesale market and to adopt values established in the retail market as the true cash value.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">The majority does not advert to the evidence of sales of residential lots in quantities to builders at wholesale prices less than retail prices. Nor does the majority conclude that the wholesale values found by the Tax Tribunal were not supported by competent, material and substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">I would hold that there was sufficient evidence to support the wholesale values, and that, in basing the assessments on wholesale values, the Tax Tribunal neither committed fraud or error of law, nor did it adopt a wrong principle. There is, indeed, overwhelming evidence that there was a wholesale market, and that the differential between the wholesale and retail markets was greater than the \"discount\u201d allowed by the Tax Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The majority relies on two of the four reasons<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> stated by the Court of Appeals, and advances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>additional reasons, for concluding that the Tax Tribunal erred as a matter of law in basing the assessments on wholesale values.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The Court of Appeals and the majority both rule that sales on the wholesale market are to be ignored, as a matter of law, in establishing the usual selling price/true cash value because:</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">\u2014The lots were <em>not actually offered </em>for sale on the wholesale market to builders.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Although Rose did not offer the lots for sale in the wholesale market, the Tax Tribunal did not err in finding that if <em>all the subject lots </em>were sold, they would \"realistically\u201d and \"obviously\u201d have been <em>sold as an entire package </em>at wholesale to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>allow the buyer a profit when reselling individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">\u2014Were the ruling of the Tax Tribunal to be affirmed, \"it would have the unhappy effect of distinguishing assessments merely on the basis of the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s holdings,\u201d so that a \"large property owner\u201d would be assessed less than the owner of a single lot, and, in context, this seemed, as the Court of Appeals put it, to be \"fundamentally unfair\u201d in light of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the uniformity clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The argument confuses <em>true cash value </em>and <em>uniformity. </em>Uniformity concerns the proportion of true cash value at which property is assessed, constitutionally fixed at fifty percent, and not the method of valuation employed to determine true cash value.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">If all property were assessed at true cash value, there would automatically be uniformity because all property would then be assessed at the same proportion, one hundred percent, of true cash value\u2014all property would then be uniformly assessed. Lack of uniformity cannot arise from valuing property at its usual selling price/true cash value.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The statutory/constitutional standards of usual selling price/true cash value and uniformity are not contradictory, and are not in need of harmonization or reconciliation by judicial reformulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The additional reasons advanced by the majority are:</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">\u2014The assessor was not required to assess the lots as a single parcel, and was justified in <em>separately valuing and assessing </em>them.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>This confuses <em>assessment </em>and valuation\u2014usual selling price concerns valuation, not assessment;</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">\u2014In allowing a wholesale discount for improved subdivision lots, the Tax Tribunal failed to measure the value of the \"property if put to its <em>highest and best use.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">This confuses <em>use </em>and value\u2014usual selling price concerns valuation, not use;</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">\u2014Recognizing a merchant\u2019s discount, in addition to a reduction in value to take market conditions into account, would be to <em>count the weakness in the market twice.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Recognizing that a merchant would only buy at a price that enables the merchant to cover expenses and hopefully realize a profit, would not count a weakness in the market twice because merchants buy low at wholesale and sell high at retail in <em>both good times and bad times.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">I agree with the majority that Rose is not \"entitled\u201d to a land <em>developer\u2019s </em>discount for the length of time it would take to market the one hundred lots that Rose had subdivided and improved with utilities and roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">The Tax Tribunal did not err, however, in ignoring that Rose had not offered the lots for sale to other builders or to consumers. Nor did it err in finding that a land developer who had one hundred lots for sale would ordinarily and \"realistically\u201d sell them to buyer(s) at a wholesale discount from what the buyer(s) would sell them to home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>buyers, and in concluding that in the tax years there was a wholesale market with a \"usual selling price\u201d\u2014the statutory definition of the constitutional standard of \"true cash value\u201d\u2014approximately $2,000 a lot less than the consumer\u2019s retail market for the very same lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The Tax Tribunal saw Rose as a \"merchant\u201d who performs the service of marketing a lot to a consumer that <em>adds </em>value\u2014$2,000 said the Tax Tribunal\u2014to the lot when, and not before, the lot is actually so marketed to a particular consumer. That is a value land developers, and hence the market, recognize by their willingness to sell lots, for less than consumers will pay, in quantities to builders who perform that service. And that is a value consumers recognize by their willingness to pay more for a lot than a builder pays.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In the Oregon<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and Maryland<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> cases relied on by the majority, the taxpayers were land developers who claimed that their inventories of unsold lots should be valued\u2014on the basis of appraisals, not comparable sales\u2014to <em>yield a return </em>on their investment or to take into consideration the <em>length of time </em>necessary to sell all the lots. There was not, as here, evidence of actual sales of quantities of lots to builders, or of a differential between the usual selling price of a quantity of lots on the wholesale builder\u2019s market and the usual selling price of a single lot on the retail consumer\u2019s market.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">In the Oregon case, the Oregon Department of Revenue had, on appeal from the county assessor, reduced the assessment of the thirty-two lots and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>other parcels and determined that their value should be established by ascertaining the difference between the sales prices of comparable lots \"sold <em>as a group\u201d </em>and the total amount the lots would have sold for if sold individually, and by applying the percentage of difference as a discount in determining the value of the <em>property\u2014that is the method adopted by the Tax Tribunal in this case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The Oregon Supreme Court held that the developer was not entitled to a <em>further </em>discount determined on the basis of the time required to sell all the lots individually. The developer\u2019s assessment was finalized on the basis of the wholesale price of comparable lots sold as a group, a discount of over $3,000 a lot.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The record <em>in this case </em>establishes that there were two usual selling prices<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> of lots\u2014the wholesale usual selling price to builders, and the retail usual selling price to consumers. The concepts of usual selling price/true cash value do not require or permit the Tax Tribunal to ignore, <em>as a matter of law, </em>relevant and material evidence of a fact bearing on the determination of usual selling price/true cash value: the usual selling price of a quantity of lots to builders.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The majority states: \"[T]he statutory definition of true cash value\u2014'the usual selling price\u2019\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number><em>requires that actual facts </em>be a significant consideration in the valuation of property.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Yet the majority concludes as a matter of law that the \"actual facts,\u201d found by the Tax Tribunal, must be ignored, and that the usual selling price/true cash value may not, as a matter of law, be based on evidence of the usual selling price of a quantity of lots to builders. Rather, the usual selling price, must, again as a matter of law, be based on sales in what is generally, when market conditions are normal, a secondary market<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> where lots are sold at retail to potential home buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The majority asserts that \"the petitioner\u2019s marketing scheme affected the fair market value of the property,\u201d and argues that Rose may not \" 'fairly argue that its property\u2019s value is comparable to other group-lot sales when petitioner specifically refuses to sell on that basis.\u2019 \u2019&gt;<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Rose\u2019s \"marketing scheme\u201d had no affect on the market value of the one hundred lots.

Property not on the market must nevertheless be valued for ad valorem taxation at its usual selling price.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The question is the sum(s) of money Rose\u2019s lots would have sold for if Rose had offered them for sale. Unless Rose then had, or geared up, or engaged the services of a selling organization to market one hundred lots to one hundred consumers, who had the financial means and desire to pay cash for a lot in a production home subdivision, and to carry the lot and finance construction until completion of a home by a custom home builder, Rose could only have sold the lots to other builders at a wholesale market price. That is the only <em>market </em>in which one hundred lots can \"realistically\u201d be sold, as the Tax Tribunal properly found.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">I would agree that \"[i]f the developer\u201d were to obtain \"a further 'discount\u2019 due to the same market conditions, the true cash value of each lot would be distorted,\u201d and then \"the weakness of the market would be counted twice in computing value.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> But there is a big \"if \u201d in that argument, one for which there is no support in the record and which is contradicted by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">To be sure, \"sales of comparable lots,\u201d the mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>ket approach to valuation, takes into account \"market conditions.\u201d If, again, one views the discount allowed by the Tax Tribunal as a \"developer\u2019s discount\u201d for the time it would take to sell the lots due to adverse market conditions\u2014the kind of discount sought by the developer in the Oregon case\u2014then to allow a discount to the developer, for the time it takes to sell the lots due to adverse market conditions, could be duplicative of the reduction in the retail value, based on comparable retail sales, of the lots due to adverse market conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The Tax Tribunal, did not, however, allow a \"developer\u2019s\u201d discount to take into account adverse market conditions. It rejected the developmental approach to valuation, but nevertheless allowed a merchant\u2019s discount in valuing Rose\u2019s lots based on record evidence that there \"is a distinct indication that 18% is the 'mark up\u2019 difference between the purchase of multiple lots and single lots,\u201d and that this differential enables \"the merchant\u201d to \"cover expenses and produce a reasonable profit as a reward for risk and effort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">While the Tax Tribunal spoke of a \"holding period of liquidation,\u201d it is apparent that it did not allow the \"mark-up\u201d because of market conditions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It recognized, rather, that a <em>merchant </em>requires a markup to cover expenses incurred and for services rendered in marketing a product, whether market conditions are poor, indifferent, or tremendous._</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>There is no evidence that weakness in the market would be counted twice were a builder/ merchant wholesale market discount, applicable in normal as well as abnormal marketing times, recognized as a fact, and not brushed aside on the bases of hypotheses unsupported in the record and controverted by experience, and of legal reformulations that substitute \"highest and best use,\u201d separate \"assessment,\u201d and \"uniformity\u201d for usual selling price/true cash value, the statutory and constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The majority, on the basis of scattered sales in a secondary market in an abnormal marketing time, has announced a rule of law for valuing inventories of lots held by land developers or builders that, henceforth, may be thought to be applicable when normal marketing conditions prevail and there is abundant evidence of a thriving primary builder\u2019s market and that land developers generally sell lots at wholesale price in that market.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">The township\u2019s appraiser, James M.

Each lot or group of lots would then have been assessed at the same proportion of its accurately determined usual selling price.

The ultimate goal is uniform true cash values. They are not necessarily achieved by a single uniform approach. . . . [T]he use of a single uniform mode ... is not forbidden but such use should not foreclose other methods and approaches, depending upon the nature of the particular property, to achieve uniform assessment. With all approaches available for use and comparison of results, valuations of property for assessment purposes are more likely to reflect true cash values than will be the case if only a single mode is used. <em>[Fisher-New Center Co v State Tax Comm, </em>380 Mich 340, 369-370; 157 NW2d 271 (1968).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Tangible personal property is subject to ad valorem personal property taxation.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Inventories were, until exempted as of the 1976 tax year,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> required to be valued essentially at cost, and tangible personal property has been generally taxed at historical cost less depreciation. Those modes of valuing tangible personal property have been the means by which the true cash values of inventories of manufactured products and tangible personal property were and are reported for ad valorem personal property taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The constitution and the General Property Tax Law places \"ail <em>taxable property, both real and </em>personal\u201d in \"one <em>category </em>to be uniformly assessed and taxed\u201d (emphasis added) and required \"uniform assessment and taxation of all tangible property, <em>both real and personal </em>other than intan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>gibles, at the standard of true cash value . . . <em>In re Appeal of General Motors Corp (Livonia v State Tax Comm), </em>376 Mich 373, 377-378; 137 NW2d 161 (1965). (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Nevertheless, establishing the true cash value of inventories essentially at cost and of tangible personal property at historical cost less depreciation, has been thought to be appropriate although other modes of valuation, e.g., comparable sales, were and are employed for valuing real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Establishing the usual selling prices of tangible personal property at historical cost less depreciation meant that a truck had one value for personal property taxation in the hands of the manufacturer, a higher value in the hands of a dealer, and still a higher value in the hands of a consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Two \"identical\u201d trucks, side by side at a traffic light, one owned by a manufacturer/dealer, and the other by a consumer, were valued for ad valorem personal property taxation at different values, and thus \"would not be equally taxed.\u201d It has not been suggested, however, that General Motors, Ford, or Chrysler should have been required to value inventories of unsold trucks at the highest price that a consumer had paid for a truck, or that their dealers were required to value their unsold trucks at the highest price they had sold a truck to a consumer, even though the highest and best use of the truck was exemplified by the truck driven by or for a consumer. It was recognized that until the truck is sold to a consumer, until the value added by marketing it to a consumer had, in fact, been added, a truck is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>worth less in the hands of the manufacturer or in the hands of the dealer than the consumer paid.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">There is clearly a difference between a lot that is owned by a consumer and a lot that is still merchandise. Merchandise must be marketed. Business persons who buy merchandise cannot, as Fuller, the township\u2019s appraiser acknowledged, afford to pay what the consumer pays. There is no \"unfairness\u201d to the consumer in assessing him on the basis of the usual selling price he pays, and the merchandiser on the basis of the lower usual selling price he pays.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Recognizing the difference between a wholesale and a retail market price simply recognizes the usual selling price to the owner, whether builder or consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">This Court observed in <em>In re Appeal of General Motors Corp, supra, </em>p 378, that <em>\"[i]f the requirement of cash value were met, the requirement of uniformity would also be met . . . </em>(Emphasis added.) The majority puts the cart before the horse when it employs the principle of uniformity as justification for ignoring a market value\u2014the usual selling price in the wholesale market\u2014and, hence, true cash value.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">In <em>CAF Investment Co v Saginaw Twp, </em>410 Mich 428, 463; 302 NW2d 164 (1981), it was argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the rent actually payable under an \"economically unfavorable lease\u201d should be ignored because otherwise two properties, side by side, would be assessed differently in violation of the constitutional requirement of uniformity of assessment. This Court rejected that argument stating that the argument \"begs the question. <em>The touchstone of uniform assessment is the true cash value or usual selling price of the property. </em>Assessment decisions must recognize limitations or restrictions which have a bearing on the selling price of property.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Decisions respecting the value of vacant lots should similarly recognize the difference between lots that are still in the chain of production from vacant land to house occupancy, and lots that have already been marketed to a consumer. Just as the owner of unencumbered property located near property encumbered with an economically unfavorable lease may, without violation of the uniformity clause, find that his property has been valued and assessed for a greater amount than the property subject to the unfavorable lease, so, too, a consumer who owns a lot may, without violation of the uniformity clause, be assessed a greater amount than the merchant-owner of a lot that has not been marketed to a consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The Tax Tribunal did not fail to consider the statutory provisions alluded to by the majority,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> directing, in effect, that separate parcels or lots be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>separately <em>assessed. </em>The Rose lots were separately assessed by the Tax Tribunal.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The General Property Tax Law does not require that true cash value be determined on a retail basis. Lots can be as readily <em>assessed </em>on an \"individual\u201d or \"separate\u201d basis employing a wholesale value as a retail value.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The requirement of separate <em>assessment, </em>lot by lot, does not preclude consideration of <em>evidence </em>of sales of comparable lots in quantities or <em>valuation </em>of lots on a bulk basis. The requirement of separate assessment does not change the meaning or definition of usual selling price/true cash value, and does not justify ignoring evidence of usual selling prices and market values established in a wholesale market.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Valuation precedes assessment. Once property has been valued, its usual selling price/true cash value established, assessment is essentially a mechanical matter. A valuation based on comparable bulk sales can readily be divided by the number of parcels or lots to arrive at an individual or separate assessment for each parcel or lot so that the statutory command of separate assessment can be met. The mandate of separate assessment of each parcel or lot does not mandate any particular method of valuation or preclude the consideration of all relevant evidence bearing on valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">There are two main parts to the majority\u2019s highest and best use argument:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>\u2014The highest and best use of Rose\u2019s lots is single family residence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-4\">\u2014The Tax Tribunal is required to hypothesize the existence of one hundred buyers at the highest price that a single lot could be sold at retail without regard to whether there were actually one hundred buyers at that price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The highest and best use conception concerns the <em>use </em>to which property can be put and not the <em>market </em>in which it is sold. The one hundred lots would be put to the same use whether Rose itself built and sold houses on the lots, or Rose had theretofore or then established, or were to have employed, a selling organization to sell the lots at retail prices to consumers, or the lots were sold by Rose to builders at a wholesale price.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Because it is unlikely that the zoning of the lots in Rose\u2019s platted subdivision in Independence Township <em>could </em>have been changed in the tax years from single family residence to manufacturing, mobile home park, low-rise, medium-rise or high-rise residential, commercial, or office, the higest and best use of the lots in the subdivision was, indeed, single family residence. This means only that Rose\u2019s and the township\u2019s appraisers were obliged, as they both recognized, to value the lots for single family residence use, and not for manufacturing, mobile home park, low-, medium-, or high-rise residential, commercial or office, or some other use.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">That single family residence is the highest and best use of the lots says nothing about whether the lots should be valued at the wholesale market price or at the retail market price for that highest and best use or at a combination of both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>wholesale market and retail market prices for that highest and best use.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In the absence of comparable sales, , the appraisers would, indeed, have been obliged to hypothesize a market price for the highest and best use, single family residence. A particular parcel of real property cannot be permitted to escape its share of the burden of taxation because the parcel cannot be readily marketed or sold.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Until a house is actually constructed, a certificate of occupancy issued, a consumer buys the house and moves in, a residential lot is, again, but work in progress toward realization of the highest and best use, single family occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Although a lot is zoned single family residence, and single family occupancy is the highest and best use, a lot cannot properly be valued <em>as if </em>the value, that would be added to the lot by <em>marketing the lot to consumers, </em>another step toward realization of the highest and best use, has actually been added.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Valuing lots on the basis of the actual selling price of lots in the wholesale market to builders would not \u201ccontradict\u201d a \"market approach,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>would not be \"inconsistent with the recognized highest and best use of the property.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Al3\">Valuing lots on the basis of comparable sales in the wholesale market would contradict only the assertion that \"the market approach, based on individual lot sales\u201d is the most accurate measure of the true cash value of the lots.

While tax benefits might affect the size of the differential between the wholesale price and the retail price, the determinant of true cash value is the wholesale or retail price that a willing buyer and a willing seller would agree upon as it may be affected, or not affected, by the tax benefits to the buyer or seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">The price actually paid\u2014the market\u2014cannot appropriately be ignored because buyers or sellers might have derived a tax benefit before, as a result of, or after entering into, a real estate transaction.

The price is at $17,500.\u201d In response to a question from the township\u2019s lawyer whether these \"were wholesale prices\u201d he said, \u201cI would say yes.

At the same time, phase two of Woodglen came on the market with an additional thirty-one lots, so that there were forty-nine lots to be marketed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Fuller\u2019s written appraisal indicates that in February, 1983, two lots were sold to a builder or builders for $15,000 each, and that two lots were sold in January-February for $18,000 each, and two lots were sold in March-April for $20,000 each.

The increase from $il,700 a lot to $13,000 a lot from December 31, 1982 to December 31,1983 reflects a turnaround in 1983 as interest rates for home mortgages moved lower.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b760-7\"> Fuller at first testified that it was possible that a prudent purchaser would have paid $1,300,000, or $13,000 a lot as of December 31, 1983.

Fuller, the township\u2019s appraiser, said it would take approximately three years to market these lots to consumers. As a result of the real estate recession, Rose took out one building permit for this subdivision in 1980, none in 1981 or 1982, and seven in 1983. Rose had sold 135 lots with houses constructed thereon between August 1977 and November 1979, three in 1980, two in 1981, one in 1982, four in 1983 and four in 1984. This history suggests it would have taken longer than three years to market the one hundred lots to consumers in 1980-1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">In some of the tax years in suit, the United States Government was borrowing money at fourteen percent per year, and the prime rate approached twenty percent per year. Twelve percent per year on a $10,000 lot, the lowest wholesale value set by the Tax Tribunal for any of the tax years, would be $1,200 for one year. The \"discount\u201d allowed by the Tax Tribunal was $2,000. Thus, if all the lots could have been sold within one year\u2014and both appraisers agreed that they could not all have been sold in one year\u2014and all the other costs, real estate taxes, advertising, brokerage, insurance, etc., did not exceed $800, and the interest did not exceed $1,200, Rose would have merely recaptured, by reason of the $2,000 discount, his expenditures therefor. And if it took three years to market the lots, then the $2,000 discount was grossly inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">If Rose had bought one of the lots for $14,500 at the end of 1981\u2014 the retail value which the majority states was the true cash value as a matter of law\u2014and the interest cost was twelve percent, or $1,740, a year, the interest would have mounted to $5,220 by December 31, 1984, when the retail value of the lot, according to the majority, was $13,000, so that Rose would have lost the difference between $13,000 and the sum of the $14,500 retail price and the $5,220 in interest, $19,220, or a loss of $6,220, to say nothing of real estate taxes, advertising expenses, and brokerage fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\"> Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2), property shall be assessed at 50% of its true cash value pursuant to section 3 of article 9 of the state constitution of 1963.
