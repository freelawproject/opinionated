Our reading of the provisions granting and describing the jurisdiction of the probate court persuades us that probate court power extends beyond \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">The jurisdiction of the probate court, a court of limited jurisdiction, is defined by the Legislature. MCL 600.847; MSA 27A.847 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\">In the exercise of jurisdiction vested in the probate court by law, the probate court shall have the same powers as the circuit court to hear and determine any matter and make any proper orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>to fully eifectuate the probate court\u2019s jurisdiction and decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">To determine the breadth of the power granted to the probate court by chapter XIIA of the Probate Code, the \"jurisdiction vested in the probate court by law\u201d must be delineated.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Fairly characterized, the paramount purpose of the juvenile section of the Probate Code is to provide for the well-being of children. To this end, MCL 712A. 1(2); MSA 27.3178(598.1X2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">This chapter shall be <em>liberally construed </em>to the end that each child coming within the jurisdiction of the court shall receive the care, guidance, and control, <em>preferably in his or her own home, </em>as will be conducive to the child\u2019s welfare .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In 1944, in a further move to provide for the well-being of children coming within the jurisdiction of the court, the Legislature enacted \u00a76 of chapter XIIA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">The juvenile division of the probate court shall have jurisdiction over adults as hereinafter provided and <em>may make such orders affecting adults as in the opinion of the court are necessary for the physical, mental, or moral well-being of a particular child </em>or children under its jurisdiction: Provided, That such orders shall be incidental to the jurisdiction of the court over such child or children. [MCL 712A.6; MSA 27.3178(598.6). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">A plainer, more straightforward statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the authority conferred on the probate court to fashion necessary orders to protect children who come within its jurisdiction would be difficult to imagine.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We are persuaded that this section provides clear authority for the court to make orders which are necessary for the well-being of a child. The dissent interprets the phrase that the court has \" 'jurisdiction over adults as hereinafter provided\u2019 \u201d to limit jurisdiction over adults to the orders in \u00a7 18. <em>Post, </em>p 412. However, in reaching this conclusion, the dissent ignores the word \"and\u201d after \"hereinafter provided.\u201d Thus, contrary to the view expressed by the dissent, we conclude that the probate court has \" 'jurisdiction over adults as hereinafter provided <em>and </em>may make such orders affecting adults as . . . are necessary for the physical, mental, or moral well-being of a particular child.\u2019 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Section 18 of chapter XIIA was enacted at the same time as \u00a7 6. Thus, it is fair to say that the Legislature intended the two sections to be interpreted consistently with each other. The appellee\u2019s arguments that \u00a7 18 was later amended to exclusively limit the court\u2019s power to \u00a7 18, and that the specific nature of the orders in \u00a7 18 negates the broad grant of power in \u00a7 6 are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">We find nothing in the 1972, 1982, or 1988 amendments to support these arguments. The amendments did not alter the meaning of the section to exclusively limit the court\u2019s power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u00a7 18.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the amendments of \u00a7 18 did not alter the meaning of the section to specifically provide for exclusivity, \u00a7 6 and \u00a7 18 are still to be considered consistent as the Legislature intended in 1944. Another indication that \u00a7 18 is to be read in light of \u00a7 6 are the words \"as hereinafter provided\u201d in the latter section. By acknowledging other relevant provisions in \u00a7 6, we conclude that the Legislature has clearly indicated its intent that the related sections be interpreted consistently with each other rather than intending that one section override the other.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In the instant case, while \u00a76 provides strong support for the orders given in the probate court, \u00a7 18 can also be read to justify the probate court\u2019s orders. Section 18(l)(b) authorizes an order placing a child under supervision in the child\u2019s own home:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">Place the child on probation, or under supervision in the child\u2019s own home or in the home of an adult who is related to the child. . . . The probation or supervision shall be upon such terms and conditions, <em>including reasonable rules for the conduct of the parents, guardian, or custodian, if any, designed for the physical, mental, or moral well-being and behavior of the child, as the court determines. </em>[Emphasis added.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>In addition, \u00a7 18(l)(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">Order the parents ... to refrain from continuing conduct which . . . has caused or tended to cause the child to come within or to remain under this chapter ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In analyzing the foregoing sections, it is significant to note that these dispositional orders are stated in broad, general terms. The court may provide \"reasonable rules for the conduct of the parents [designed for the well-being of the child].\u201d Also, the court may order parents to discontinue conduct which, \"in the opinion of the court,\u201d causes a child to come within the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Thus, we hold that the Legislature has conferred very broad authority to the probate court. There are no limits to the \"conduct\u201d which the court might find harmful to a child. The Legislature intended that the court be free to define \"conduct\u201d as it chooses. Moreover, in light of the directive that these provisions are to be \"liberally construed\u201d in favor of allowing a child to remain in the home, we find these sections supportive of the court\u2019s order prohibiting the father from living with his daughter. The court could have found that the conduct which \"tended to cause\u201d the daughter\u2019s sexual victimization was the proximity of the father to the daughter. Thus, the court could order the father to refrain from conducting himself, at all, in the presence of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Certainly, the immediate conduct which \"caused\u201d the child to come within the jurisdiction of the court was the sexual behavior of the father. However, the court could well have found that such an order prohibiting the father from touching his daughter may not have been effective in assuring the safety of the child. However, it is not only conduct which immediately \"causes\u201d the abuse which can be prohibited, but also conduct which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>tends to cause </em>the abuse. The court could properly find that the living arrangements, father and daughter under the same roof, tended to cause, or led to the misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Although the dissent would find that the probate court did not have the authority to order the appellee to support his family, it states that \"[section 18 spells out the <em>kinds of orders </em>that the probate court is authorized to enter . . . .\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 412 (emphasis added). This statement seems to contemplate that the authority extends beyond the four corners of \u00a7 18. Yet, despite the dissent\u2019s acknowledgment that \u00a7 18 represents the \"kinds of orders\u201d allowable, it does not find the support order proper. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Sections 18(2) and 18(3) provide that the court may order reimbursement by a parent to the court for the costs of services and care to a child. While \u00a7 18(2) concerns costs for placement outside of the home, \u00a7 18(3) concerns reimbursement for costs incurred by a child in the child\u2019s own home. Certainly, these were the \"kinds of orders\u201d which were issued in this case. Under \u00a7\u00a7 18(2) and 18(3), a court can take jurisdiction of a child, incur costs in caring for the child, and order a parent to reimburse for those costs. The order in this case is similar in that it ordered a parent to provide financial support for the family. Both orders direct a parent to pay for the care of a child within the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">There is evidence in other sections of chapter XIIA that the Legislature intended to give the probate court broad powers and flexibility in providing for the well-being of children. Section 18f(2) directs agencies to write case service plans for the use of the court and the parties. Section 18f(3)(b) states that case service plans shall include \"[e]f-forts to be made by the child\u2019s parent[s] to enable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the child to return to his or her home.\u201d Under \u00a7 18f(4), \"[t]he court may order compliance with all or any part of the case service plan as the court considers <em>necessary.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Thus, under \u00a7 18 the court may order parents to refrain from conduct, or to act affirmatively, in the interest of the child. Under \u00a7 18f(3)(b), case service plans are to include efforts by the parents to enable a child to return home. An effective \"effort\u201d in this regard might consist of outside counseling or therapy aimed at reforming an abusive parent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 18f(4), a probate court may order compliance with the plan if considered necessary, and lawfully regulate a parent\u2019s activity outside of the home.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Under MCL 712A.19b; MSA 27.3178(598.19b), the probate court has power to terminate parental rights:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>(3) The court may terminate the parental rights of a parent to a child if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, 1 or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">(b) The child or a sibling of the child has suffered physical injury or physical or sexual abuse under either of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">(i) A parent\u2019s act caused the physical injury or physical or sexual abuse and the court finds that there is a reasonable likelihood that the child will suffer from injury or abuse in the foreseeable future if placed in the parent\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Section 19 authorizes the drastic measure of terminating parental rights. Nevertheless, the dissent is reluctant to acknowledge authority in the probate court to implement harsh measures affecting adults. In light of \u00a7 19, it is inconsistent for the dissent today to urge an interpretation of this legislation which denies the court the authority to tailor remedies which fall short of terminating parental rights and which are necessary for the well-being of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Further evidence of past interpretation by this Court of chapter XIIA can be found in the Michigan Court Rules. MCR 5.965(B)(10) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">If the court authorizes the filing of the petition as provided in subrule (B)(9), the court may release the child to a parent or the court may place the child with someone other than a parent as provided in subrule (C). Release of the child to a parent following the authorization of a petition may be accompanied by <em>reasonable terms and conditions believed necessary to protect the physical health or mental well being of the child. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Again, we note that \"reasonable terms and condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>tions believed necessary\u201d is broad and expansive language. Moreover, MCR 5.965(C)(2) discusses the three prerequisites to releasing a child to someone other than a parent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">(a) custody of the child with the parent presents a substantial risk of harm to the life, physical health, or mental well being of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">(b) no provision of service or other arrangement except removal of the child is reasonably available to adequately safeguard the child from the risk as described in subrule (C)(2)(a); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">(c) conditions of child custody away from the parent are adequate to safeguard the health and welfare of the child.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The complicated problem posed by this case is underscored by this section. While all these criteria apply with regard to the father, none exist as to the mother. When issuing its order, the probate court gave due regard to both the supportive mother/daughter relationship, and the abusive father/daughter relationship. It certainly would have been unfair to the victim, and irresponsible given the historic purpose of this legislation, to have removed her from her mother, brother, and home environment because of her father\u2019s abusive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Finally, MCR 5.973(A)(5)(b) discusses dispositional orders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">The court shall not enter an order of disposition until it has examined the case service plan as provided in MCL 712A.18f; MSA 27.3178(598.18f). <em>The court may order compliance with all or part of the case service plan and may enter such orders as </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>it considers necessary in the interest of the child. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Again, the broad language of this court rule does not expressly limit permissible orders to \u00a7 18, but construes the code to allow orders which are \"necessary\u201d for the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We are persuaded that to interpret the Juvenile Code only to authorize the dispositional remedies expressly provided in \u00a7 18 would severely limit the probate court\u2019s effectiveness in providing for the well-being of children. To be sure, situations will arise which call for creative solutions, not contemplated by the Legislature in \u00a7 18. To its credit, the Legislature recognized this need. The probate court should have the flexibility to tailor orders to remedy the complicated and myriad problems posed by abusive family relationships. It is reasonable to contemplate scenarios, much like this one, where a court reasonably believes a parent\u2019s daily proximity to a child \"tends to cause\u201d the abuse. It is also reasonable to contemplate scenarios where the home is rendered unfit by the actions of one parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The Legislature granted the probate court the needed flexibility in \u00a7 6. Sections 6 and 18 were enacted at the same time, the presumption being that they are to be read in light of each other. Section 6 states clearly that orders may be implemented which are \"necessary\u201d for the well-being of a child. There is further support in \u00a7\u00a7 18f, 19b, and the court rules that the probate court is so empowered.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">With all due respect, we believe that the dissent\u2019s concern about the breadth of this grant of power is exaggerated. While the language is broad, it provides sufficient guidance and needed flexibility to the court. The court is limited in that it can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>only act after it has jurisdiction over a child, and it may only act to ensure a child\u2019s well-being. Any orders aimed at adults must also be incidental to the court\u2019s jurisdiction over children. In addition, under \u00a7 6, the court may only make orders affecting adults if \"necessary\u201d for the child\u2019s interest. The word \"necessary\u201d is sufficient to convey to probate courts that they should be conservative in the exercise of their power over adults. Furthermore, upon review of an order affecting adults, if an appellate court finds the factual record insufficient to justify the \"necessity\u201d of the order, it may overturn the order as clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In this case, the record was sufficient to support the court\u2019s orders. A jury determined that the father had sexually abused the daughter in the past, and his behavior indicated a likelihood of similar conduct in the future. In contrast, the child\u2019s relationship with the mother was healthy. Given the objective of the act that provisions should be liberally construed in favor of keeping children at home, it was reasonable for the court to determine it was necessary to remove the father from the home and order him to pay support.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">While we disagree with the dissent regarding the probate court\u2019s post-trial authority, we find that the pretrial order prohibiting the father from living at home was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Under \u00a7 6, the court cannot act to issue \"orders affecting adults\u201d until it has acquired jurisdiction of a child. With regard to jurisdiction, MCR 5.973(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">General. A dispositional hearing is conducted to determine measures to be taken by the court with respect to the child properly within its jurisdiction and, when applicable, against any adult, <em>once the court has determined following trial, </em>plea of ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>mission, or plea of no contest <em>that the child comes within its jurisdiction. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Along the same line, the staff comment on the court rules states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">It is unclear whether the Legislature intended to authorize the court to order parents to comply with the \u201cinitial service plan\u201d at the pretrial stage. Traditionally, a court would not order the parent to comply with a case service plan before it has assumed jurisdiction over the child. [Mich Ct R, p R 5-88.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">There is no general statutory authorization for referees or judges to make dispositional orders prior to trial. Furthermore, ordering a father out of his home absent a trial raises potential due process implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed to the extent it found that the probate judge exceeded his authority in the issuance of post-trial orders.</p>\n<judges id=\"b502-10\">Brickley, Boyle, Archer, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, C.J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b502-11\">Cavanagh, J., concurred in the result only.</judges>\n<author id=\"b502-12\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A78\"><em>(to affirm). </em>The questions presented are whether the probate court has authority to order a parent out of the family home and to pay support for the family.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held that it did not. I agree and would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">A teenage girl, then sixteen, came to the atten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>tion of the probate court in January, 1987. A caseworker for the Department of Social Services reported that she said that when she was approximately nine years old, her father, Harold Macomber, had repeatedly, for approximately one year, forced her to disrobe, fondled her body as they lay in bed together nude, and that he had penetrated her vagina digitally. She further reported that six years later, beginning in the fall, 1986, her father had begun making sexual advances to her by rubbing her breasts, buttocks, vagina, and thighs while she was fully clothed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">A preliminary hearing was scheduled before a judge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A referee conducted the hearing on January 23, 1987. After hearing testimony from the caseworker, Harold Macomber, his wife Lucille, the daughter, and an older brother, the referee reported that he found probable cause to believe that the allegations of abuse were true as well as the daughter\u2019s fear that her father would \"go further.\u201d The referee added that the daughter had talked to her brother and then her mother the previous Friday, January 16, 1987. The brother, twenty years old, said that he also had been sexually molested by Harold Macomber. Lucille Ma-comber said that she believed the allegations. Harold Macomber denied any and all wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The referee authorized the filing of a petition, and ordered that the daughter be placed under the supervision of the dss in the care of her mother. He also ordered that, pending such hearing, Harold Macomber shall not reside in the family home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>and shall have no direct contact with the daughter without written permission of the dss.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Harold Macomber moved out of the family home pursuant to the order. He apparently provided for the support of his family without a court order; no support order was entered until after the adjudication that the daughter was within the jurisdiction of the court. An attorney entered an appearance for Harold Macomber on February 3, 1987. The attorney filed a number of motions including one to set aside the \"Order of Disposition.\u201d At the hearing on that motion, a question was raised concerning the referee\u2019s authority to enter a preadjudication order requiring a father to vacate his home and refrain from having communication with his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The judge did not address the referee\u2019s authority, but focused, rather, on his authority under \u00a7 6 of chapter XIIA,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> captioned Juveniles and Juvenile Division, of the Probate Code:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">The juvenile division of the probate court shall have jurisdiction over adults as hereinafter provided and may make such orders affecting adults as in the opinion of the court are necessary for the physical, mental, or moral well-being of a particular child or children under its jurisdiction: Provided, That such orders shall be incidental to the jurisdiction of the court over such child or children. [MCL 712A.6; MSA 27.3178(598.6).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The judge concluded that the court\u2019s authority concerning adults, set forth in \u00a7 6, \"applies both before and after adjudication for instances such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>this where there needs to be some temporary, even preadjudicative order over adults if the court finds such is necessary for the physical, mental or moral well-being of a child.\u201d The judge announced that he would \"reenter\u201d the order previously entered by the referee, and did so on March 19, 1987. The judge did not address the scope of the court\u2019s authority concerning adults..</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In April, 1987, on evidence tending to support the allegations in the original complaint and subsequently filed petition, the jury \"adjudicated\u201d that the probate court had jurisdiction of the daughter. An interim order was entered making the daughter a temporary ward of the court, allowing her to continue to live with her mother, and continuing the order that Harold Macomber remain out of the home. Harold Macomber was directed to pay $180 per week for the support of his family and to attend counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Following a June 30, 1987, dispositional hearing, the judge entered an order continuing the daughter as a temporary ward of the court and continuing the reference to the dss for supervision in the home of her mother, and, finding that it is \"necessary for the physical, mental or moral well-being of [the daughter],\u201d ordered that Harold Macomber should:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">(1) . . . not have any direct, indirect, in person, verbal, written, by phone, by mail, or any other means of contact with said child or Phillip and Lucille Macomber without written authorization from the [dss] or the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">(2) . . . attend counseling and the \"Parents Who Care\u201d support group meetings as required by Wanda Carter-Smith or any replacement caseworker at the YWCA-Child Sexual Abuse Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">(3) . . . pay directly to Lucille Macomber, mother, $180.00 per week for the support of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>family; Provided, that this support shall be reduced by $36.00 for each day that said father does not work and is not paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Pursuant to the order, the matter was reviewed and reevaluated by the judge semiannually beginning in December, 1987.

The Court added that \"[t]he probate court has no inherent powers. Its right to take jurisdiction of children and to govern their lives is based entirely on constitution and statute.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The Court considered \u00a7 6, conferring \"jurisdiction over adults\u201d in the juvenile division of the probate court and empowering the court to make \"orders affecting adults,\u201d and nevertheless concluded that the probate court exceeded its power when it entered the order requiring Harold Ma-comber to leave the family home and to pay $180 per week to support his family.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The dss, recognizing that the probate court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>no inherent powers, and can act only as authorized by statute, relies in part on \u00a7 1(2) of chapter XIIA, providing that the \"chapter shall be liberally construed to the end that each child coming within the jurisdiction of the court shall receive the care, guidance, and control, preferably in his or her own home, as will be conducive to the child\u2019s welfare and the best interest of the state.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVC\">The dss argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">The Probate Court has the power to, under appropriate standards, terminate parental rights in children. The Court has the power to make a child a ward of the Court and put the child in foster care. Surely the Court must have the power to take steps to insure that a child receives care, guidance and control <em>in her own home, </em>by removing from the home the source for the Court to have exercised jurisdiction in the first place. The Court of Appeals opinion in this case will severely restrict a legitimate power of the Probate Court. Under the Court of Appeals analysis, a Probate Court confronted with a sexually abusive father would lack the power to remove the father from the home, but would either have to take the terrible chance that the sexual abuse would occur again, or take the severe step of removing the innocent child from the home. We submit that the Legislature could not have intended to leave the Probate Court with this Hobson\u2019s choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The probate court, all agree, is a court of limited, statutorily prescribed authority. Section 18 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>chapter XIIA<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> provides for the \"disposition\u201d of a child who has been adjudicated to be within the jurisdiction and authority of the court. The probate court has a number of, but not unlimited, options under \u00a7 18. While there may be good and sufficient policy reasons that would support legislation empowering a probate judge to require an abusive parent to leave the family home,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Legislature has not authorized the probate court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Under \u00a7 18, after an adjudication, upon the conclusion of a trial, that a child is within the jurisdiction and authority of the probate court, the court may enter an order of \"disposition\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u2014warning \"the child or the child\u2019s parents,\u201d and dismissing the petition;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u2014placing the child \"on probation, or under supervision in the child\u2019s own home or in the home of an adult who is related to the child,\u201d and in so ordering include \"reasonable rules for the conduct of the parents\u201d that are designed for the \"physical, mental, or moral well-being and behavior of the child, as the court determines\u201d;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u2014placing \"the child in a suitable foster care home subject to the court\u2019s supervision\u201d;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u2014placing \"the child in or committing] the child to a private institution or agency approved or licensed\u201d by the dss;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u2014committing \"the child to a public institution, county facility, institution operated as an agency of the court or county, or agency authorized by law to receive children of similar age, sex, and characteristics.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">If the child is placed outside the home, the court may require the parent to pay the cost of placement outside the home.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court might thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>confront a parent with the alternatives of paying the cost of maintaining the child in a foster care home or of himself leaving the home so that the child can continue to live in the home. Some probate court judges have, in that manner, brought about the removal of an allegedly offending parent from the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">There is, however, no provision expressly authorizing the probate court to require a parent to leave the home. \"[Reasonable rules for the conduct of the parents\u201d means parental conduct in the home in respect to the child while the child is in his own home pursuant to a court order placing the child in his own home under court supervision, not parental conduct generally. The provision authorizing the probate court to include reasonable rules for the conduct of parents if the child is placed on probation or under supervision in the child\u2019s own home,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> does not contemplate that among the \"reasonable\u201d rules is a rule requiring a parent to leave the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The probate court was not authorized to require Harold Macomber to act affirmatively,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>vide. financial support, except to the extent set forth in \u00a7 18,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or elsewhere in chapter XIIA. Section 18 spells out precisely when, and the extent to which, a parent can be ordered by the probate court to provide financial support,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and does not authorize the probate court to require a parent to provide generally for the financial support of his <em>family.</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To the extent that is a deficiency in the legislation, the Legislature can remedy the asserted deficiency by conferring on the probate court the same power that the circuit court may have in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">To be sure, the probate court may order a parent \"to refrain from continuing conduct which, in the opinion of the court, has caused or tended to cause the child to come within or to remain under this chapter, or which obstructs placement or commitment of the child pursuant to an order under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>this section.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> That aspect of the probate court\u2019s \u00bfpower with respect to parental conduct is expressed in the negative\u2014to \"refrain from continued conduct.\u201d It stretches those words to the breaking point to construe them as including, when a child is placed in his own home on probation or under supervision, as including within \"obstruction of a] placement\u201d a parent\u2019s presence in his own home or, even viewing his presence as an affirmative act, a parent\u2019s decision to remain in his own home.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Section 18 does not distinguish between a delinquent and an abused child. The theme of \u00a7 18 is that a delinquent or abused child should be removed from the corrupting environment. The probate court may, indeed, permit the child to remain in his own home, but the language employed to state that option, \"[p]lace the child on probation, or under <em>supervision </em>in the child\u2019s own home or in the home of an adult who is related to the child,\u201d MCL 712A.18(l)(b); MSA 27.3178(598.18)(l)(b) (emphasis added), conveys the premise that it is the child, not the parent, who is on probation and in need of court supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The Legislature has not conferred on the probate court plenary authority to govern the lives of parents insofar as may be necessary, in the probate court\u2019s judgment, to advance the well-being or best interests of even a child who has been adjudicated to be within the jurisdiction of the probate court because delinquent or abused.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Section 18 spells out the kinds of orders that the probate court is authorized to enter respecting the parents of a child who has been adjudicated to be within the jurisdiction of the probate court, thereby giving meaning to the limitations set forth in \u00a7 6 conferring on the probate court \"jurisdiction over adults <em>as hereinafter provided </em>\u201d and stating \"[t]hat such orders <em>shall be incidental </em>to the jurisdiction of the court over such child or children.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Since we conclude that the probate court does not, after trial and adjudication, have the authority under \u00a7 18 to enter an order of disposition requiring the father to leave the home, it is clear that, before trial and adjudication,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> neither a referee<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> nor a judge is empowered to enter such an order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-9\"> For the words to take on the meaning which the dissent attributes to them, the section should have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">[T]he probate court shall have jurisdiction over adults as hereinafter provided [to] make such orders affecting adults [as necessary for the well-being of a child].</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\"> In relevant part, \u00a7 18 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">Except as otherwise provided in subsection (15), if the court finds that a child is within this chapter, the court <em>may enter </em>any of the following orders of disposition which is appropriate for the welfare of the child and society in view of the facts proven and ascertained ....

The alternatives are placement in the home of the child\u2019s parent, in a suitable foster care home, in a child care institution or child placement agency licensed by the dss, or in \"a suitable place of detention.\u201d MCL 712A.14(3)(d); MSA 27.3178(598.14)(3)(d). Here, in contrast with \u00a7 18 (see n 20 and accompanying text), there is no provision authorizing the promulgation of rules respecting parental conduct or otherwise respecting adults.</p>\n<p id=\"AOo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Clearly, there is no language in \u00a7\u00a7 10 or 14 that can be read as authorizing entry of an order requiring a parent to remove himself from his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">MCR 5.965(BX10) and \u00a7 13a (since the enactment of 1988 PA 224, adding \u00a7 13a) provide that if a child is released to a parent, the release may be on \"reasonable terms and conditions\u201d necessary for the physical health or mental well-being of the child. MCL 712A.13a(3); MSA 27.3178(598.13a)(3). Clearly, this language should be read as authorizing the court to condition a decision to release the child to the parents\u2014rather than to detain the child\u2014on the parents abiding by reasonable terms and conditions. The referee did not offer Harold Macomber the <em>choice </em>of either leaving the home, or of remaining in the home with the consequence that the daughter would be placed in foster care or otherwise institutionalized at his expense.
