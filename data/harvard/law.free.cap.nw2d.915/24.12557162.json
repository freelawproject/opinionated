Stat. \u00a7 504B.385 (2016) before asserting a habitability defense to landlord's eviction action. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In February 2016, appellant landlord Andrew Ellis (landlord) and respondent tenant John Doe (tenant) entered into a written month-to-month agreement for the lease of a residential property located in Minneapolis (the property) by tenant in exchange for a monthly rental amount of $755.00 due on the first day of each month. Tenant experienced habitability problems when he took possession of the property, and contacted landlord on several occasions about the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After landlord failed to complete the requested repairs, tenant contacted a city inspector about the habitability issues. On October 13, 2016, landlord received a notice from the City of Minneapolis informing him that a city inspector had inspected the property and found numerous violations of city ordinances. The notice required him to correct the violations within 30 days. Landlord failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Tenant withheld rent in March 2017 after landlord failed to both correct the ordinance violations and rid the property of a raccoon that tenant alleged was living in the ceiling. Landlord filed an eviction action against tenant alleging nonpayment of $3,581.00 in rent and late fees, and sought return of the premises. Tenant filed an answer stating that he did not owe landlord the amount alleged and asserted a habitability defense pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Fritz v. Warthen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314203\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/298/54/\">\n    298 Minn. 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314203\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/298/54/\">\n    213 N.W.2d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973), arguing that landlord had violated the statutory covenants of habitability under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 504B.161 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The housing court held a hearing and issued an order scheduling a trial to determine the amount of rent, if any, that tenant owed landlord, and to address the habitability issues raised by tenant in his answer, including landlord's failure to complete the repairs required by the city-ordinance-violation notice. The housing court ordered tenant to pay the withheld rent into the court pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   and Minn. R. Gen. Pract. 608, which provide that the tenant shall deposit accruing rent with the district court as security when the tenant claims to be withholding rent in reliance on a defense. Tenant paid the withheld rent into the court the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After receiving exhibits and hearing testimony from both parties, the housing court issued an order discrediting landlord's testimony and determining that tenant owed landlord $67.64 in past-due rent. But it concluded that tenant had demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that landlord had violated the statutory covenants of habitability and noted that tenant had suffered considerable loss of his use and enjoyment of the property. It determined that tenant owed landlord only part of the full rental amount for each month from October 2016 to April 2017, to continue until landlord completed the repairs specified in the city's notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 5, 2017, landlord requested that the district court review the housing court's decision. Landlord argued that tenant had not provided landlord with written notice of the violations of the statutory covenants of habitability pursuant to Minn. Stat. \u00a7 504B.385. The district court affirmed the housing court's order because tenant had asserted a successful defense for the breach of the statutory covenants of habitability. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Was tenant required to follow the procedures set forth in Minn. Stat. \u00a7 504B.385,\n   before he asserted a habitability defense to an eviction action?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Landlord argues that the district court erred when it awarded retrospective and prospective rent abatement because tenant failed to provide notice of habitability violations to landlord pursuant to Minn. Stat. \u00a7 504B.385 before asserting a habitability defense. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The resolution of this issue requires us to interpret section 504B.385 governing a rent-escrow action brought by a tenant in relation to a tenant's assertion of a habitability defense to a landlord's eviction action. \"The interpretation of a statute is a question of law we review de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Cocchiarella v.

Additionally, \"[w]hen the material facts are not in dispute, we review the lower court's application of the law de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Collier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8348749\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/726/799/#p803\">\n    726 N.W.2d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 803 (Minn. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   An eviction action is a summary proceeding to determine the present possessory rights to property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amresco Residential Mortg. Corp. v. Stange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11080979\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/631/444/#p445\">\n    631 N.W.2d 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 445-46 (Minn. App. 2001). A landlord may bring an eviction action against a tenant for nonpayment of rent. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 504B.291 (2016). Minnesota caselaw and statutes have recognized a limited number of defenses to an eviction action that a tenant may assert, one of which is breach of the statutory covenants of habitability that the supreme court first recognized in\n   <em>\n    Fritz v. Warthen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314203\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/298/54/\">\n    298 Minn. 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314203\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/298/54/\">\n    213 N.W.2d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973).\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   held that a covenant in a lease for payment of rent and the statutory covenants of habitability are mutually dependent, and a breach of the statutory covenants may be asserted as a defense in an eviction action for nonpayment of rent.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314203\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/298/54/\">\n    298 Minn. at 58-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314203\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/298/54/\">\n    213 N.W.2d at 341-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Because the statutory covenants of habitability are made a part of every residential lease and are mutual with the covenant to pay rent, the rent, or at least part of it, is not due under the terms of the lease when the landlord has breached the statutory covenants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314203\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/298/54/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314203\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/298/54/\">\n    at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314203\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/298/54/\">\n    213 N.W.2d at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, although the housing-court referee and district court used language not employed in\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   , in effect they concluded that \"the rent, or at least part of it, is not due under the terms of the lease\" because landlord breached the covenants of habitability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Separate from a\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   defense, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 504B.385 establishes a separate rent-escrow action brought by a tenant for a breach of the statutory covenants of habitability. Section 504B.385, subd. 1, details procedures that a tenant must follow before withholding rent and depositing it in escrow with the district court. The statute in relevant part states, \"[T]he residential tenant must give written notice to the landlord specifying the violation\" prior to depositing the withheld rent into escrow with the court. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 504B.385, subd. 1(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, landlord argues that tenant did not provide written notice of habitability violations prior to asserting a Fritz defense. But this argument would require the application of section 504B.385 rent-escrow action's requirements to tenant's assertion of a\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   habitability defense to eviction.\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   does not contain a written-notice requirement. Nor does section 504B.385 indicate that it applies to a\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   habitability defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 504B.385 refers to a distinct definition of the \"action brought under this section.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 504B.385, subd. 3. An \"action\" is a \"judicial proceeding whose purpose is to obtain relief at the hands of the court.\"\n   <em>\n    American Heritage Dictionary\n   </em>\n   17 (4th ed. 2000). A \"proceeding\" is \"the instituting or conducting of legal action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1398. But a defense is not an action. Instead, a defense is \"[t]he action of the defendant in opposition to complaints against him or her.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 475-76. It is clear from the plain language of the statute that an action instituted by a tenant is different from a defense asserted by a tenant in response to an eviction action brought by a landlord. Therefore, tenant was not required to follow the procedures set forth in section 504B.385 before asserting a\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   habitability defense because the statutory cause of action is independent of a\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   habitability defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Landlord relies heavily on our unpublished opinion in\n   <em>\n    Ellis v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   , No. A14-1991,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203823190\">\n    2015 WL 3823190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Minn. App. 2015), to argue that we should reach the opposite conclusion. But we are not bound by unpublished opinions because they are not precedential. Minn.

And\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   is different in several key aspects.
