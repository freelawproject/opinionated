He also does not contest that the revocation of his Wisconsin law license is appropriate discipline for his misconduct, along with a requirement that he comply with a monetary judgment obtained against him by a client regarding unearned advance fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 After fully reviewing the matter, we approve the stipulation and revoke Attorney Goldmann's Wisconsin law license. His transgressions leave us no choice: Attorney Goldmann has shown himself to be unwilling or unable to conform his conduct to the standards that are required to practice law in this state. We also adopt the stipulated requirement that he comply with his client's monetary judgment against him. Finally, because this matter is being resolved without the appointment of a referee, and because the OLR has not sought costs, we impose no costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 Attorney Goldmann was admitted to the State Bar of Wisconsin in 2013. His most recent address on file with the State Bar of Wisconsin is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. According to the parties' stipulation, Attorney Goldmann currently lives in Canada, but made use of a general delivery address in Milwaukee and an email account to receive the case documents in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 Attorney Goldmann's license to practice law in Wisconsin is currently suspended. On June 15, 2017, this court temporarily suspended his law license for his willful failure to cooperate with the OLR investigation of this matter. In October 2017, his law license was administratively suspended for failure to pay bar dues and assessments and failure to file the\n   required trust account certification. The parties report that Attorney Goldmann abandoned the practice of law in mid-2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 Attorney Goldmann's work in ten client matters gave rise to all but one of the misconduct claims in this case. It is not necessary to describe the particular factual allegations of Attorney Goldmann's misconduct in each client matter; a synopsis will suffice. Beginning in 2015 and continuing into 2017, Attorney Goldmann effectively abandoned the ten clients identified in the OLR's complaint: M.G. (Counts 1-4); S.M.C. (Counts 5-7); A.L.R. (Counts 8-11); E.G.H. (Counts 12-16); C.H. (Counts 17-21); R.C.M. (Counts 22-23); R.D.S. (Counts 24-26); A.P. (Counts 27-30); S.D.Y. (Counts 31-33); and M.D.C. (Counts 34-37). Attorney Goldmann undertook to represent these clients in a variety of matters-criminal cases, civil cases, parental rights cases, etc.-but he failed to take necessary actions on their behalf. Among other things, he failed to attend court hearings; failed to file crucial documents; failed to comply with court orders; failed to forward his clients' case files to the clients or successor counsel; failed to refund unearned advance fees; failed to be forthright about his actions; and failed to respond to his clients' requests for information or otherwise keep them updated on their cases. Once the aggrieved clients contacted the OLR, he failed to cooperate with the OLR's investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b66 The remaining misconduct claim in this case (Count 38) concerns certain false and misleading information that Attorney Goldmann gave his employing law firm about his level of professional experience and success. The firm included this information on its website, with Attorney Goldmann's knowledge and understanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b67 Based on the foregoing, the OLR complaint alleged, and the parties later stipulated, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Contrary to SCR 20:1.3,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attorney Goldmann failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client in the following client matters: M.G.

(Count 4), S.M.C. (Count 7), A.L.R. (Count 11), E.G.H. (Count 16), C.H. (Count 21), R.C.M. (Count 23), R.D.S. (Count 26), A.P. (Count 30), S.D.Y. (Count 33), and M.D.C. (Count 37).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b68 In the stipulation, Attorney Goldmann states that the stipulation did not result from plea bargaining, and that he does not contest the facts and misconduct alleged by the OLR or the discipline sought by the OLR. Attorney Goldmann further states that he fully understands the misconduct allegations; fully understands the ramifications should this court impose the stipulated level of discipline; fully understands his right to contest this matter; and fully understands his right to consult with counsel. Attorney Goldmann represents that his entry into the stipulation is made knowingly and voluntarily, and that his entry into the stipulation represents his decision not to contest the misconduct alleged in the complaint or the level and type of discipline sought by the OLR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b69 Having considered this matter, we approve the stipulation and adopt the stipulated facts and legal\n   conclusions of professional misconduct. We agree that the revocation of Attorney Goldmann's Wisconsin law license is in order. Attorney Goldmann has engaged in a widespread pattern of serious professional misconduct that has harmed his clients and tarnished the profession. A sanction of revocation is clearly supported by our precedent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Gegner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279104\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/373/192/\">\n    2017 WI 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279104\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/373/192/\">\n    373 Wis. 2d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279104\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/373/192/\">\n    890 N.W.2d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (consensual license revocation based on 47 counts of misconduct and other pending OLR investigative matters);\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Cannaday\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256162\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/360/647/\">\n    2015 WI 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256162\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/360/647/\">\n    360 Wis. 2d 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256162\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/360/647/\">\n    859 N.W.2d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (revocation for 76 counts of misconduct after attorney abandoned a significant portion of law practice);\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4025407\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/341/104/\">\n    2012 WI 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4025407\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/341/104/\">\n    341 Wis. 2d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4025407\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/341/104/\">\n    814 N.W.2d 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (revocation for 51 counts of misconduct);\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Fisher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5749874\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/324/745/\">\n    2010 WI 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5749874\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/324/745/\">\n    324 Wis. 2d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5749874\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/324/745/\">\n    785 N.W.2d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (revocation for 55 counts of misconduct after attorney abandoned law practice);\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Abbott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430812\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/286/616/\">\n    2005 WI 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430812\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/286/616/\">\n    286 Wis. 2d 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430812\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/286/616/\">\n    707 N.W.2d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (consensual license revocation for 20 allegations of misconduct).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b610 We turn next to the issue of restitution. According to the parties' stipulation, one of Attorney Goldmann's clients, A.P., sued Attorney Goldmann in small claims court regarding unearned advance fees that he had failed to return to her. A.P. obtained a judgment in the amount of $1,653 against Attorney Goldmann. The parties stipulated, and we agree, that Attorney Goldmann should be ordered to pay restitution to A.P. in the amount of this judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b611 The parties' stipulation says nothing further on the topic of restitution. We note that, prior to any reinstatement of Attorney\n   Goldmann's Wisconsin\n   law license, we will revisit the issue of restitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SCR 22.29(4m) (any attorney petitioning for reinstatement from a disciplinary suspension of six months or more is required to allege and demonstrate that the attorney \"has made restitution to or settled all claims of persons injured or harmed by [the attorney's] misconduct ... or, if not, the [attorney's] explanation of the failure or inability to do so\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b612 Finally, because Attorney Goldmann entered into a comprehensive stipulation under SCR 22.12, thereby obviating the need for the appointment of a referee and a full disciplinary proceeding, we do not impose costs in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b613 IT IS ORDERED that the license of James Eric Goldmann to practice law in Wisconsin is revoked, effective the date of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b614 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the June 15, 2017 temporary suspension of James Eric Goldmann's license to practice law in Wisconsin, due to his willful failure to cooperate with the Office of Lawyer Regulation's investigation in this matter, is lifted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b615 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the administrative suspension of James Eric Goldmann's license to practice law in Wisconsin, due to his failure to pay bar dues and assessments and his failure to comply with trust account certification requirements, will remain in effect until each reason for the administrative suspension has been rectified pursuant to SCR 22.28(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b616 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that James Eric Goldmann shall pay restitution consistent with the $1,653 judgment issued against him and in A.P.'s favor in connection with the misconduct described herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b617 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that James Eric Goldmann shall comply with the provisions of SCR 22.26 concerning the duties of a person whose license to practice law in Wisconsin has been revoked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b618 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that compliance with all conditions of this order is required for reinstatement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SCR 22.28(3).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    SCR 22.12 provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    (1) The director may file with the complaint a stipulation of the director and the respondent to the facts, conclusions of law regarding misconduct, and discipline to be imposed.
