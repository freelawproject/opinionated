Butler was previously reprimanded by the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board and failed to timely notify Michigan authorities of the reprimand. The examiner and the subcommittee concluded that Butler violated the Public Health Code, MCL 333.1101 et seq., under MCL 333.16221(b)(\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   ) (\"[f]inal adverse administrative action by a licensure, registration, disciplinary, or certification board involving the holder of ... a license ... regulated by another state ...\") and MCL 333.16221(f) (failure to notify department\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   of disciplinary action taken by another state against licensee within 30 days of action).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The subcommittee fined Butler $500 for the violations. We affirm the determination that Butler violated MCL 333.16221(b)(\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   ) and (f) but vacate the fine and remand for further proceedings under Mich. Admin. Code, R 338.7005 (Rule 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Butler is a doctor licensed to practice medicine in nine states, including Michigan and Wisconsin. In 2012, Butler was employed as the Regional Medical Director for Advanced Correctional Healthcare and was responsible for providing medical services for\n   persons jailed in Wisconsin. Pursuant to a stipulation agreed to by Butler in February 2015, the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board formally reprimanded her for a 2012 incident wherein an inmate was prescribed medicine for hypothyroidism when his lab results were consistent with hyperthyroidism. The error was initially the result of a miscommunication regarding the lab results by a nurse during a phone call to Butler, but the error continued even after Butler was later provided with the actual lab results. As reflected in the stipulated final decision and order, Butler \"acknowledged that the written lab report support[ed] a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and that she erred.\" More than 30 days later, by letter dated April 22, 2015, the Director of Human Resources for Advanced Correctional Healthcare informed the Michigan Board of Medicine of Butler's Wisconsin reprimand, apologizing for the delay, which was blamed on a miscommunication between the corporate office and Butler's Wisconsin\n   counsel and not on any fault or failure on Butler's part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May 2015, LARA, through the acting director of the Bureau of Health Care Services, filed an administrative complaint against Butler based on a final adverse administrative action taken against Butler in Wisconsin, MCL 333.16221(b)(\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   ), and the fact that the action had not reported to LARA within 30 days, MCL 333.16221(f) and MCL 333.16222(4). The crux of Butler's defense was that the Wisconsin reprimand was not based on any willful misconduct, that the prisoner-patient suffered no adverse reaction to the prescribed medicine, that Butler implemented changes in jail protocols regarding the reporting of lab tests to help prevent future errors, and that, as to the 30-day notice failure, there was no willful wrongdoing on her part, given that she was led to reasonably believe that\n   her employer or its counsel would provide the requisite notice in timely fashion. Following the evidentiary hearing, the examiner concluded that the violations had been established by LARA by a preponderance of the evidence, concluding that there was no willful-intent element to the provisions in MCL 333.16221(b)(\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   ) and (f). The examiner issued a proposal for decision, recommending adoption of his findings of fact and conclusions of law. The recommendation was subsequently accepted by the subcommittee after Butler had filed exceptions to the proposal for decision. In the subcommittee's final order, it fined Butler $500 for the violations of MCL 333.16221(b)(\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   ) and (f). She now appeals as of right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rulings by disciplinary subcommittees of regulated professionals are reviewed on appeal solely under Const. 1963, art. 6, \u00a7 28.\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Community Health v.

And for a violation of MCL 333.16221(b)(\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   ), the available sanctions include \"[p]robation, limitation, denial, suspension, revocation, permanent revocation, restitution, or fine.\" MCL 333.16226(1).

Indeed, there can be no real dispute that the Wisconsin reprimand constituted a final adverse administrative action taken by another state against Butler's license, MCL 333.16221(b)(\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   ), and that Butler failed to notify LARA of the reprimand within 30 days, MCL 333.16221(f) and MCL 333.16222(4). Instead, Butler, on the strength of Rule 5, challenges the fine imposed by the subcommittee. Rule 5 provides in full:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   When a fine is designated as an available sanction for a violation of section 16221 to 16226 of the code, MCL 333.16221 to 333.16226, in the course of assessing a fine, the disciplinary subcommittee\n   <em>\n    shall take into consideration\n   </em>\n   the following factors without limitation:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (a) The extent to which the licensee obtained financial benefit from any conduct comprising part of the violation found by the disciplinary subcommittee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (b) The willfulness of the conduct found to be part of the violation determined by the disciplinary subcommittee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (c) The public harm, actual or potential, caused by the violation found by the disciplinary subcommittee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (d) The cost incurred in investigating and proceeding against the licensee. [ Rule 338.7005 (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Butler argues that the subcommittee failed to apply Rule 5 in assessing the $500 fine, thereby acting unlawfully, beyond the scope of its powers, without any supporting evidence, and in violation of Butler's due-process rights. Butler posits that if the Rule 5 factors are weighed, there is no basis for any fine. LARA argues that it must be presumed that the subcommittee weighed the factors in Rule 5 in the course\n   of assessing the fine and that, in light of the factors, the\n   $500 fine was justified under the facts of the case. LARA accurately points out that the subcommittee was generally authorized to impose a fine of up to $250,000 for the violation of MCL 333.16221(b)(\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   ). See MCL 333.16226(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, as indicated, MCL 333.16226(1) and MCL 333.16237(4) mandate a sanction for a violation of MCL 333.16221, so the subcommittee had no choice but to impose a sanction on Butler, and it chose to fine her, which was an available sanction under MCL 333.16226(1) for the two particular violations at issue. Accordingly, given the subcommittee's election to impose a fine and no other sanction, Rule 5, an administrative rule, did not allow the subcommittee to entirely forgo a fine, as Butler suggests, because this would offend the mandatory-sanction language in the statutes. Therefore, the factors in Rule 5 must be weighed for purposes of determining the amount of the fine and not whether the fine should have been imposed in the first place. Even outside the circumstances of this case in which the $500 fine was the only sanction that was imposed, the plain language of Rule 5 reveals that it is meant to be analyzed merely in regard to setting the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of a fine and that the fine must be more than $0. Specifically, Rule 5 directs a subcommittee to consider the Rule 5 factors \"in the course of assessing a fine\" when \"a fine is designated as an available sanction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The language, \"in the course of assessing a fine,\" indicates or reflects that an underlying decision to impose a fine in some amount has already been made\n   by the relevant subcommittee, leaving only a determination regarding the amount of the fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the instant case, the final order issued by the subcommittee contained no indication that the subcommittee examined and weighed the factors in Rule 5 in settling on the fine of $500, and we are in no position to presume that the subcommittee engaged in the required analysis. Moreover, we, as an appellate court, cannot act in place of the subcommittee and do our own independent examination and analysis in the first instance. Because the subcommittee apparently did not take into consideration the factors in Rule 5 in the course of assessing the fine, as the rule requires, the imposition of the $500 fine prejudiced Butler's substantial rights because the ruling was made on unlawful procedure and contrary to law. Const. 1963, art. 6, \u00a7 28 ; MCL 333.16226(2). Accordingly, while we affirm the subcommittee's ruling that Butler violated MCL 333.16221(b)(\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   ) and (f) as alleged, we vacate the $500 fine imposed by the subcommittee and remand for proceedings under Rule 5 consistent with our interpretation of the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
