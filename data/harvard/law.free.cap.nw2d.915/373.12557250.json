We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants David Miller and Donald Miller are brothers who resided together at Donald's home located in Milan, Michigan, in York Township. Both were qualified medical marijuana patients. Defendant Katherine Null, formerly in a long-term relationship with David, also was a qualified medical marijuana patient, and she served as David's registered medical marijuana primary caregiver. Null rented a bedroom from Donald, but she did not reside with the Millers. During 2014, Null directed David to construct a medical marijuana structure in Donald's backyard for containing the medical marijuana she cultivated for patients connected to her through registration under the MMMA. Starting in July 2015, Null rented space on Donald's property for that purpose. Defendants failed to obtain a construction permit for the medical marijuana outdoor-growing facility, never got permits before installing electrical and watering systems, and never obtained a certificate of occupancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Under the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, MCL 125.3101\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . (MZEA), plaintiff adopted its zoning ordinance regulations for land development and use for the public health, safety, and welfare of the local community. Use of property by a medical marijuana caregiver is permitted only under Charter Township of York Zoning Ordinance (Zoning Ordinance) \u00a7 40.204 as a \"Home Occupation,\" which is defined as an occupation or profession customarily conducted entirely within a dwelling by the persons residing within the dwelling and not more than one person who does not reside within the dwelling, and where such use is clearly incidental to the principal use of the dwelling as a residence. [Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 2.03(112).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Medical marijuana caregivers were required to comply with Zoning Ordinance\n   \u00a7 40.204(A)(13)(e) and (f) for marijuana use and cultivation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (e) All medical marihuana shall be contained within the main building in an enclosed, locked facility inaccessible on all sides and equipped with locks or other security devices that permit access only by the registered primary caregiver or qualifying patient, as reviewed and approved by the Building Official;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (f) All necessary building, electrical, plumbing, and mechanical permits shall be obtained for any portion of the residential structure in which electrical wiring, lighting and/or watering devices that support the cultivation, growing, or harvesting of marihuana are located[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff learned that the medical marijuana facility that defendants had built outdoors failed to comply with zoning and construction regulations. Instead of enforcing its zoning ordinance regulations, plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment from the trial court regarding the validity of its zoning and construction regulations and its right to enforce them as they applied to the cultivation and use of medical marijuana in zoned residential locations and subdivisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before filing their respective motions for summary disposition, the parties stipulated to the essential facts. They agreed that defendants' medical marijuana outdoor growing facility failed to comply with plaintiff's home-occupation zoning ordinance because Null did not reside at Donald's property, and defendants grew medical marijuana outside and not entirely within Donald's house. The parties agreed that, except for defendants' zoning and construction code violations, defendants' medical marijuana use and their outdoor growing facility complied with the MMMA. The parties stipulated that defendants' violations of plaintiff's zoning ordinance and construction code regulations constituted nuisances per se subject to penalties including injunctive relief and abatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff argued in its motion for summary disposition that under the MZEA, it had broad authority to prohibit growing medical marijuana outdoors. Defendants countered that the MMMA preempted plaintiff's home-occupation zoning ordinance because it directly conflicted with the MMMA. The trial court ruled that direct conflicts existed between the MMMA and plaintiff's ordinance. The trial court noted that the Legislature amended the MMMA during 2012 specifically to permit outdoor cultivation. Consequently, the trial court held that plaintiff's ordinance conflicted by allowing medical marijuana growing only as an indoor home occupation. Further, the trial court held that plaintiff's ordinance also conflicted with the MMMA because the MMMA did not require Null to live on the premises where the marijuana was grown. The trial court ruled that plaintiff could not exclude outdoor cultivation because the MMMA permitted it. In addition, the trial court ruled that defendants' structure was subject to construction regulations and zoning so long as the zoning did not forbid outdoor cultivation of medical marijuana. The trial court ordered defendants to seek the required permits and ordered plaintiff to review and grant the permits if defendants' structure complied with the building code. Plaintiff now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff first argues that its authority under the MZEA to adopt ordinances permitted it to regulate medical marijuana and to restrict registered caregivers to growing marijuana indoors in areas zoned residential. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Whether a state statute preempts a local ordinance is a question of statutory interpretation and, therefore, a question of law that we review de novo.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Ter Beek v.

[Quotation marks and citations omitted.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In this case, Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 40.204 regulates home occupations and home-based businesses. Within the context of a home occupation, plaintiff specifically regulates registered primary medical marijuana caregivers. Section 40.204(13) permits such caregivers to operate as a \"home occupation\" if they comply with the MMMA and certain specified restrictions, some of which are not relevant to the issues on appeal. Pertinent to this case, \u00a7 40.204(13)(e) requires that all medical marijuana be was contained inside the house in areas zoned residential caregivers are prohibited from having or growing any medical marijuana outside the house on properties zoned residential. Section 40.204(13)(f) requires permits to modify any portion of a house for cultivation, growing, or harvesting of marijuana. Read together, Subparts (e) and (f) of \u00a7 40.204(13) only permit medical marijuana to be grown indoors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 3.13 permits plaintiff to penalize property owners for nonconforming uses. Plaintiff can declare a\n   nonconforming use a nuisance and require any structure to be vacated, torn down, removed from the property, modified, or abated with the cost of abatement attaching as a lien on the property. Defendants' violation of plaintiff's home-occupation zoning ordinance, therefore, was subject to serious penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The MMMA governs medical marijuana use.

Read together, MCL 333.26424(b)(2) and MCL 333.26423(d) permit growing medical marijuana outdoors by registered caregivers as long as the growing occurs within an enclosed, locked facility as specified. The MMMA also provides that other state law inconsistent with the MMMA may not interfere with the rights established under the MMMA.

MCL 333.26423(d). Because nothing in the plain language of MCL 333.26423(d) is ambiguous, judicial construction is not necessary. Moreover, when MCL 333.26423(d), is read together with MCL 333.26424(b)(2), no irreconcilable conflict results that makes either statutory provision susceptible to more than one meaning. Accordingly, we conclude that the MMMA permits growing medical marijuana outdoors by registered caregivers as long as the growing occurs within the specified enclosed, locked facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The record in this case reflects that the trial court essentially read the plain language of the MMMA and held that the MMMA permitted growing medical marijuana outdoors. The trial court recognized that the Legislature amended MCL 333.26423(d) to redefine the meaning of \"enclosed, locked facility\" to include specific requirements for structures enclosing medical marijuana being grown outdoors. The trial court did not clearly err by finding that the Legislature amended the MMMA to permit outdoor cultivation. The trial court reasonably inferred that the Legislature changed the MMMA to permit and regulate outdoor-growing facilities. Therefore, the MMMA authorizes growing medical marijuana outdoors under specific requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The trial court read the plain language of MCL 333.26423(d) and simply concluded that the MMMA permitted what plaintiff's home-occupation zoning ordinance expressly prohibited. The trial court did not find ambiguity and did not judicially construe MCL 333.26423(d) in search of its meaning. We also do not find any inherent ambiguity necessitating judicial construction. Therefore, the trial court did not err by applying the plain language of the MMMA to resolve the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The trial court also correctly held that defendants' enclosed, locked facility must comply with MCL 333.26423(d), plaintiff's construction regulations, and plaintiff's construction-permit requirements. Contrary to plaintiff's contention, the trial court's ruling did not grant defendants immunity and exemption from all zoning and construction regulations. We believe that the trial court narrowly tailored its ruling to resolve the issues presented in this case and yet upheld plaintiff's power to regulate the public health and safety respecting new construction. Accordingly, the trial court did not err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that the silence in the MMMA's \"medical use\" and \"enclosed, locked facility\" definitions regarding the specific manner and location of cultivating medical marijuana permitted plaintiff to prohibit cultivation through zoning ordinance regulations.

(quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In this case, we read and interpret the MMMA as a whole. We conclude, as the trial court did, that the MMMA permits and thereby authorizes registered caregivers to grow medical marijuana for their patients both indoors and outdoors without fear of penalty by a local government. Contrary to plaintiff's argument, the Legislature's failure to articulate a caregiver's right and privilege to cultivate medical marijuana in a specific location may not be relied on to conclude that plaintiff may prohibit caregivers from outdoor cultivation. See\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   MCL 333.26423(d) provides that caregivers may elect to grow medical marijuana outdoors so long as they comply with the enclosed, locked facility requirements. MCL 333.26424(b)(2) and MCL 333.26423(d), when read together, grant registered caregivers the right and privilege to grow medical marijuana outdoors without fear of a local government's imposition of penalties. As explained in\n   <em>\n    Ter Beek II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4293603\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/495/1/\">\n    495 Mich. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=846%20N.W.2d%20531\">\n    846 N.W.2d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , an ordinance \"directly conflicts with the MMMA by permitting what the MMMA expressly prohibits-the imposition of a 'penalty in any manner' on a registered\" caregiver whose medical marijuana use, i.e., cultivation, falls within the scope of the immunity in MCL 333.26424(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Notably, the MMMA does not grant municipalities authority to adopt ordinances that restrict registered caregivers' rights and privileges under the\n   MMMA. By comparison, the Legislature recently enacted the Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act, MCL 333.27101\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., and specifically granted municipalities authority to adopt local ordinances including zoning regulations that restrict the location, number, and type of facilities within their boundaries. MCL 333.27205. Obviously, had the Legislature intended to authorize municipalities to adopt zoning ordinances restricting the activities of registered medical marijuana caregivers, it could have done so in the MMMA. Despite amending the MMMA twice, the Legislature refrained from incorporating such provisions into the MMMA. Plaintiff's insistence on reading into the MMMA what the statutory scheme plainly fails to provide lacks merit. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by reading the MMMA as a whole and concluding that plaintiff could not infringe upon registered medical marijuana caregivers' rights and privileges under the MMMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Lastly, plaintiff argues a number of angles for reversing the trial court's decision that the MMMA preempted its home-occupation zoning ordinance. All of them lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As explained above, the trial court read the MMMA as a whole, analyzed its plain language, and interpreted MCL 333.26424(b)(2) and MCL 333.26423(d) and other MMMA provisions in a reasonable and harmonious manner to conclude that plaintiff's home-occupation ordinance prohibited what the MMMA permitted. Therefore, the trial court correctly ruled that a direct conflict existed resulting in the MMMA's preemption of plaintiff's ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that the trial court erred because the MMMA does not preempt its ordinance by occupying the field of zoning and construction-code regulations. The trial court, however, never held that the MMMA preempted zoning and construction-code regulations. In fact, the trial court specifically held that construction code regulations and plaintiff's building-permit regulations applied to defendants' outdoor structure. Consequently, it ordered defendants to obtain all requisite permits for their enclosed, locked facility for growing medical marijuana outdoors. Accordingly, plaintiff's argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that its home-occupation ordinance did not directly conflict with the MMMA. As explained above, plaintiff's ordinance directly conflicts with the MMMA because it prohibits what the MMMA clearly permits, and therefore, the ordinance is void and preempted. We also believe that the trial court could have held that the MMMA preempted plaintiff's ordinance because plaintiff's enforcement of its home-occupation zoning ordinance would have resulted in the imposition of penalties upon qualified patients and registered caregivers in direct conflict with the immunity that MCL 333.26424(a) and (b) grants them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff argues further that its ordinance was not preempted by the MMMA because plaintiff merely adopted additional requirements for medical marijuana cultivation that were not unreasonable and only served to prevent possible nuisances in residential neighborhoods. Plaintiff again relies on the MZEA for its authority to regulate medical marijuana cultivation and prohibit outdoor growing in areas zoned residential. As we explained above, the MZEA does not save plaintiff's ordinance from preemption.

Proper statutory construction, however, requires reading\n   MCL 333.26423(d) within the overall statutory scheme to prevent reducing a registered caregiver's right and privilege to grow medical marijuana outdoors into conduct subject to local government prohibition with potentially severe penalties for violations. Plaintiff's reading improperly turns a blind eye to the rights, privileges, and immunity afforded registered medical marijuana caregivers by MCL 333.26424(b) and qualifying medical marijuana patients under MCL 333.26424(a). Accordingly, plaintiff's argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Murphy, P.J., and Sawyer and Beckering, JJ., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Effective December 20, 2016, the Legislature amended the definition of the term \"medical use\" in MCL 333.26423(f).
