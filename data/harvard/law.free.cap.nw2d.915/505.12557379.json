Minneapolis granted both of these requirements, and appellant Neighbors for East Bank Livability challenged the decisions. Now on appeal, Neighbors for East Bank Livability contends that the city's granting of both the conditional-use permit and variance was improper because the proposed project was inconsistent with the city's comprehensive plan and because there were no unique circumstances regarding the property to justify a variance. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Local governments within Minnesota's metropolitan area are required to adopt comprehensive plans, which are documents to help guide land use and development.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And many of these comprehensive plans adopt, and look to, planning documents created by neighborhoods and smaller areas within their borders for guidance. It is the interaction between these city-wide comprehensive plans and the incorporated small area plans that is central to the legal dispute before us today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2009, Minneapolis adopted its current comprehensive plan, the Minneapolis Plan for Sustainable Growth, to help guide its balancing act between twin desires: the desire to grow rapidly and the desire to maintain its identity. A key component of its plan was setting forth residential density classifications-low, medium, and high-and where each best belonged in the city. Residential high-density buildings were to go primarily in mixed-use areas. The comprehensive plan also mentioned a fourth category, very high density, which would belong in activity centers and growth centers throughout Minneapolis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   One of the stated goals of the comprehensive plan was to \"[d]evelop small area plans for designated land use features ... in consultation with neighborhood associations, residents, and other stakeholders.\" One such neighborhood is Marcy-Holmes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Marcy-Holmes is the oldest neighborhood in Minneapolis and includes a mixture of structures that are historical and progressive, residential and commercial, old and new. It is eclectic. Like much of Minneapolis, the neighborhood has recently experienced dramatic growth. This brings the challenge of being open to expansion, but staying true to its identity. To address these concerns, Marcy-Holmes created the Marcy-Holmes Neighborhood Master Plan which, in city-planning vernacular, is referred to as a small area plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This small area plan provided direction on how Marcy-Holmes should evolve. Its most current form was adopted\n   in 2014, after which it was incorporated into Minneapolis's comprehensive plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This small area plan listed the same density levels as the comprehensive plan with the same ranges: small, medium, and high. The small area plan did not mention the fourth category, very high density, but noted that its high category was for \"the areas of most intense use and density.\" But the density limitations in Minneapolis's comprehensive plan did not remain static for long. In 2016, the city adopted a density-limitation amendment to its comprehensive plan which drastically raised the upper limit of densities allowed, especially in areas within activity and growth centers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This new density increase quickly became relevant, as respondent Alatus desired to construct a project far exceeding the un-amended density limits. Alatus proposed constructing a building at 200 Central Avenue Southeast and 113 Second Street Southeast in Minneapolis, situated in Marcy-Holmes. This location is also within the East Hennepin Activity Center, which is near the Downtown Growth Center. The area is a C2 zoning district, which is defined as a neighborhood corridor commercial district. Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances \u00a7 521.10(3) (2017). This exact area contains several high-rises, including the LaRive Condominiums, which are approximately 310 feet in height. The proposed Alatus project is a mixed-use 42-story building, standing at approximately 483 feet tall. The first four levels of the project would make up a podium, the fifth floor would be an amenity level, and the next 37 levels would encompass a tower. While the footprint of the podium would encompass much of the building site, the footprint of the tower is less than half of the podium. Topping the tower would be a mechanical penthouse level. The building would include 214 residential dwelling units, and 6,500 square feet of ground-floor commercial space. The residential density of the proposed projected would be approximately 268 residential dwelling units per acre (du/acre).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The project would include nearly 400 parking spaces, located in the first four levels of the building and in three levels below grade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Due to the large scale and breadth of the project, it did not fully comply with Minneapolis's zoning ordinances. Alatus needed to obtain both a conditional-use permit and a variance to construct the building.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alatus needed the conditional-use permit because of the height of the proposed project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The maximum height for buildings in the C2 zoning district is 56 feet, but the proposed height of this project exceeded 483 feet. Alatus also needed a variance for the floor-area ratio of the proposed project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Floor-area ratio refers\n   to the total amount of floor area in a building, divided by the area of the lot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The maximum floor-area ratio in the C2 zoning district is 1.7, while the project has a proposed floor-area ratio of 14.42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The process for obtaining a conditional-use permit and variance starts with seeking approval from the Minneapolis city planning commission. Before the commission makes a decision, the department of community planning and economic development (CPED) generally reviews the application and makes a recommendation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   From there, review is available by appealing the decision to the zoning and planning committee, which recommends its decision to the ultimate decision maker-the Minneapolis City Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Alatus completed its application for a conditional-use permit and variance in July 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   CPED prepared an assessment report of the application in August 2016. This report made detailed findings suggesting that the proposed project was appropriate to be built in Marcy-Holmes because, among other reasons, it was compatible with the surrounding area and it was consistent with the policy and goals of Minneapolis's comprehensive plan and Marcy-Holmes's small area plan. CPED recommended that the city grant the conditional-use permit and variance. At the end of August 2016, the city planning commission voted to approve both the conditional-use permit and variance applications. The commission also adopted CPED's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Appellant Neighbors for East Bank Livability appealed this decision to the zoning and planning committee. This committee conducted a hearing regarding the appeal in September 2016 and subsequently issued recommended findings of fact. These findings incorporated the CPED findings and made several additional findings favorable to granting the conditional-use permit and variance. The committee also noted that Marcy-Holmes's official neighborhood organization supported the project. The zoning and planning committee then recommended that the Minneapolis City Council deny the appeal and approve the applications for the conditional-use permit and variance. In October 2016, the Minneapolis City Council unanimously adopted the zoning and planning committee report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In November 2016, Neighbors for East Bank Livability filed a complaint against the City of Minneapolis and Alatus, both of whom are respondents on appeal. Among other counts, the complaint sought declaratory judgment against Minneapolis, seeking a determination that granting the conditional-use permit and variance was improper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted summary judgment against Neighbors for East Bank Livability and determined that\n   the city did not err in granting the conditional-use permit or variance. The district court explained that the project was consistent with both the comprehensive plan and small area plan, and furthered the goals of both plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Neighbors for East Bank Livability appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I.

This court's review of the city's decision to grant or deny a conditional-use permit or variance is limited to whether the decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.\n   <em>\n    Roselawn Cemetery v.

On appeal, the parties direct our attention primarily to this factor as Neighbors for East Bank Livability contends that the issuance of both the conditional-use permit and variance is improper because granting either is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan. Neighbors for East Bank Livability also argues a separate factor-the necessity of the variance is due to circumstances unique to the property-is similarly not satisfied. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The city's granting of the conditional-use permit and variance is consistent with the comprehensive plan.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Neighbors for East Bank Livability's primary contention on appeal is that granting either the conditional-use permit or variance is improper because it is inconsistent\n   with the comprehensive plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances \u00a7 525.340(5) (2017) (stating that conditional-use permits must be consistent with the applicable policies of the comprehensive plan);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20462.357\">\n    Minn.

It reasons that the project is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan because the project's 268 du/acre exceeds the applicable density limitation set forth in the small area plan. The small area plan, adopted before the density amendment, has a density limitation of 120 du/acre, while the amendment to the comprehensive plan raised the density limitation to 800 du/acre.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issue is which limitation controls: the comprehensive plan's 800 du/acre, or the small area plan's 120 du/acre.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We determine that the comprehensive plan's 800 du/acre limitation applies, and Alatus's proposed project falls within that limit, because (1) comprehensive plans control over small area plans in general; (2) Marcy-Holmes's small area plan was adopted into Minneapolis's comprehensive plan, and both plans refer to the comprehensive plan as controlling; and (3) an examination of the density-limitation amendment shows the city intended the heightened density level to apply to Marcy-Holmes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Comprehensive plans control over small area plans.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We determine that comprehensive plans control over small area plans because of the statutory framework of city planning, the history of cities and neighborhoods in city planning, and caselaw guidance detailing a city's role in comprehensive plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Minnesota legislature provides cities the power to plan the use of land within their boundaries.\n   <em>\n    Mendota Golf, LLP v.

The municipal planning act grants cities the authority to create and execute comprehensive plans: \"[a] municipality may carry on comprehensive municipal planning activities for guiding the future development and improvement of the municipality and may prepare, adopt and amend a comprehensive municipal plan and implement such plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20462.353\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 462.353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1 (2016). And the Minnesota legislature found that it is\n   <em>\n    municipalities\n   </em>\n   that are faced with \"mounting problems in providing means of guiding future development of land,\" and that comprehensive plans are an effective way to combat these difficulties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20462.351\">\n    Minn.

While cities have been delegated a wide latitude of power in regulating land use within their borders, in addition to the ability to create and amend comprehensive plans, neighborhoods and small areas lack such statutory authority. This statutory framework of city planning guides our determination that a city's comprehensive plan, not a small area plan, controls when in conflict with one another. And we note the controlling nature of\n   <em>\n    comprehensive\n   </em>\n   plans is inherent in the title of the plan.\n   <em>\n    See Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   632 (2d ed. 2004) (defining comprehensive as \"inclusive of\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The current statutory focus on cities, not neighborhoods, in land use planning evolved over the past century. During early statehood, there was little authority empowering Minnesota cities to regulate land use. Karen E. Marty,\n   <em>\n    Minnesota Land Use Law\n   </em>\n   , 55-62 (2d ed. 2017). In the early part of the twentieth century, the neighborhoods themselves, and their citizens, had a statutory voice in a municipality's land-use decisions. The first zoning laws required a petition from a majority of the affected property owners in order to start the zoning process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20462.357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20462.357\">\n    at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the first zoning statutes required a referendum of affected citizens to authorize the city to zone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co. v. Nadasdy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747266\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/247/159/#p164\">\n    247 Minn. 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747266\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/247/159/#p164\">\n    76 N.W.2d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 675 (1956). But with the advent of metropolitan planning, this power shifted. Marty,\n   <em>\n    Minnesota Land Use Law\n   </em>\n   , at 78-85. Neighborhoods no longer possess this decisive role in city planning and instead play an advisory part.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nw. Coll. v. City of Arden Hills\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10686313\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/281/865/#p869\">\n    281 N.W.2d 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 869 (Minn. 1979) (\"Although neighborhood sentiment may be taken into consideration in any zoning decision, it may not constitute the sole basis for granting or denying a given permit.\");\n   <em>\n    Yang v.

App. 2003) (\"A city may consider neighborhood opposition only if based on concrete information.\"). This advisory role neighborhoods play in city planning is consistent with the current statutory framework delegating power to cities, not neighborhoods. The evolution of Minnesota's land-use planning laws further supports our determination that comprehensive plans, not small area plans, control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Caselaw examining the role of comprehensive plans is also instructive. In\n   <em>\n    Nordmarken v. City of Richfield\n   </em>\n   , the City of Richfield amended its comprehensive plan to accommodate a large proposed development.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446286\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/641/343/#p346\">\n    641 N.W.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346 (Minn.

This interpretation is also consistent with other jurisdictions that have a similar statutory framework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoffman Family, L.L.C. v.

Neighborhoods cannot effectively carve themselves out of a city through a small area plan. Rather, a small area plan has the important purpose of providing detailed guidance within its borders, not erecting insurmountable barricades to city planning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In light of a city's broad power in city planning, comprehensive plans control over small area plans unless stated otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Minneapolis's comprehensive plan and Marcy Holmes's small area plan both state that the comprehensive plan controls.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Our interpretation that comprehensive plans generally control over small area plans is bolstered by the specific plans before us. Further, Marcy-Holmes's small area plan was incorporated into the comprehensive plan and was amended simultaneously with the comprehensive plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The statutory power delegated to cities is evident in Minneapolis's comprehensive plan, as it states, \"\n   <em>\n    Minneapolis\n   </em>\n   will develop and maintain a land use pattern that strengthens the vitality, quality and urban character of its downtown core, commercial corridors, industrial areas, and neighborhoods while protecting natural systems and developing a sustainable pattern for future growth.\" (Emphasis added.) The comprehensive plan also states it \"incorporates by reference land use recommendations from a number of small area plans that cover various sub-sectors of the city [and these] plans should be consulted for applicable areas when making development decisions, as they provide more detailed guidance.\" This language reflects that small area plans are\n   <em>\n    consulted\n   </em>\n   to provide \"more detailed guidance,\" not deferred to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The language in Marcy-Holmes's small area plan similarly recognizes this hierarchy. It states the comprehensive plan \"is a policy document that guides the physical development of the entire city.

The parties argue over the last quotation, specifically the second sentence, and disagree on which plan \"it\" refers to.

At the time the small area plan was adopted, its three classifications of density levels-low, medium, and high-mirrored those of the comprehensive plan. The density levels of the small area plan were consistent with the comprehensive plan. While the small area plan did not contain the very-high level, it described its high classification as \"the areas of most intense use and density.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   And when the subsequent density-limitation amendment to the comprehensive plan was adopted, allowing densities up to 800 du/acre in activity centers near growth centers where consistent with the applicable small area plan, it applied to the entirety of the comprehensive plan-including the small area plan. The proposed Alatus project is located in the East Hennepin Activity Center, which is near a growth center, resulting in the amendment applying to the proposed site, unless it would be inconsistent with the small area plan. And as the city found, the proposed project with a high residential density is consistent with the small area plan's policy and guidance. Therefore, the maximum residential density limit for the location of the proposed project is 800 du/acre, and the proposed project is within its limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     An examination of the density-limitation amendment shows the city intended the heightened density level to apply to Marcy-Holmes.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Neighbors for East Bank Livability contends that even if the comprehensive plan generally controls over the small area plan, that is not the case here as the density-limitation amendment states otherwise. To resolve this issue, we must look to the amendment's language. The amendment to the comprehensive plan states \"[d]ensities up to 800 du/acre may be allowed in or near all designated Growth Centers and within Activity Centers adjacent to Growth Centers,\n   <em>\n    as consistent with adopted small area plans\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)

Looking at only the plain language of the amendment, we conclude that both are reasonable interpretations, and the amendment is therefore ambiguous. Because the amendment is ambiguous, we look beyond the plain language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goodman v.

Small area plans are incorporated into a city's comprehensive plan and are intended to provide additional guidance, not roadblocks. With this understanding of comprehensive and small area plans, the amendment's language, stating that it only applied where \"consistent with adopted small area plans,\" means that the small area plans provide additional guidance to the comprehensive plan as to where raised density levels should occur, but does not trump the comprehensive plan. It would be unreasonable to construe the broad language of the amendment, \"consistent with adopted small area plans,\" to mean the narrow result of not exceeding the limits already in place in small area plans. This would transform the role small area plans have in city planning from what was meant to be an aid to the city into that of an unyielding obstacle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A review of the history of the amendment further supports our interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Binkley v.

In May 2015, the amendment was proposed that would add the following language to the density range for activity centers and growth centers: \"[d]ensities up to 800 du/acre may be allowed in or near all designated Growth Centers, and the following designated Activity Centers in or near the Growth Centers: Cedar Riverside, Dinkytown, East Hennepin, Mill District, Stadium Village, and Warehouse District.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In January 2016, CPED recommended the adoption of this amendment and noted that small area plans \"provide more detail\n   <em>\n    as to where the highest densities\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    are appropriate.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) And later that month, when the city's principal planner addressed this amendment before the city planning commission, she explained it would increase the density limit for the downtown core, growth areas, and explicitly mentioned activity centers. This included the East Hennepin Activity Center, where the proposed projected is located. After this hearing, the city planning commission adopted the CPED findings and recommended that the city council approve the amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This history of the amendment shows the amendment was meant to apply to small area plans, that small area plans were meant to provide general guidance to where increased densities would be appropriate, and it specifically mentioned the East Hennepin Activity Center. Nowhere in any of the documented history of the amendment-staff reports, meeting minutes, or public comments-was there any indication that \"as consistent with adopted small area plans\" meant anything other than that small area plans would help direct where increased density would be appropriate. This amendment therefore resulted in the increased 800 du/acre applying to Marcy-Holmes, where appropriate, in light of the small area plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In sum, because comprehensive plans control over small area plans, and because Marcy-Holmes's small area plan was adopted and became a part of the comprehensive plan prior to the density amendment, we determine that the 800 du/acre density limitation from the comprehensive plan's amendment applies. Both the language and history of the amendment support this interpretation. Therefore, the city did not act in an unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious manner when it determined that the conditional-use permit and variance is consistent with the comprehensive plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The term \"practical difficulties\" is broken down into three requirements by statute: (1) the applicant proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner; (2) the difficulties facing the applicant are due to circumstances unique to the property, not created by the applicant; and (3) the variance will not\n   alter the essential character of the locality.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20462.357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the city explicitly considered each of these three requirements, but Neighbors for East Bank Livability contends that the city erred when it determined that Alatus satisfied the requirement that the practical difficulties were due to circumstances unique to the property. We first discuss the findings on this requirement and then determine whether the city's conclusion that this requirement was met was unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The city found that practical difficulties in complying with city ordinances existed because of circumstances unique to the property. It found that the property was located in an activity center adjacent to a growth center, which is an area encouraged to be high density. Furthermore, there were additional findings that the property was contextually unique because the block contained two other permanent structures: the Pillsbury Library and an adjacent parking ramp. And these two structures limit the ability of the proposed project to be built horizontally. As the district court explained in its thorough and careful order, these structures restricted the proposed project by limiting the lot size and this unique situation was not created by Alatus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Neighbors for East Bank Livability argues that these findings are not sufficient, as the only reason a variance was necessary was because of the way the proposed project was designed, not because of anything unique to the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree. Here the city found multiple factors that were unique about this property, including the fact that other buildings were located on the block, that constricted its ability to build. These findings are supported by the record, and Neighbors for East Bank Livability does not point to any legal authority that suggests other buildings on the block cannot satisfy this factor. Nor do we discern any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Minnesota caselaw further supports this determination. The Minnesota Supreme Court has recognized that unique circumstances are not limited to the purely physical condition of the land and that such a limitation would make granting of a variance \"practically impossible except where the topographic conditions of a specific parcel of land would render the tract of land in question otherwise valueless.\"\n   <em>\n    Merriam Park Cmty.

This did not change when the residential density limits were amended for the comprehensive plan. The small area plan still serves as guidance on where the increased residential density can occur within Marcy-Holmes. What the small area plan does not do, however, is prevent the amendment from applying within its borders merely because it already has a residential density limitation. To hold otherwise would render a city's chief planning tool a confederation of neighborhood plans, rather than the title the legislature bestowed upon it: a comprehensive plan. As a result, the city's determination that the proposed project is consistent with the comprehensive plan is not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Additionally, because there are unique circumstances-not attributable to the property owner-justifying the variance, the city's decision to grant it is not improper.

However, the ordinance states that \"[t]he unique circumstances were not created by persons presently having an interest in the property and\n    <em>\n     are not based on economic considerations alone\n    </em>\n    .\" Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances \u00a7 525.500(1) (2017) (emphasis added). This means that economic motivations can be present; they just cannot serve as the sole motivation for the variance. And here there were several reasons independent of economic motivation, including other permanent structures on the block, that support the finding that there were unique circumstances warranting a variance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <strong>\n     Affirmed.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
