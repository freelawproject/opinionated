We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March 2014, appellant Gary Stephen Gundy left a note on a car that belonged to M.K., a 17-year-old girl who worked at a gas station. M.K. found the note when she walked to her car after completing her shift at work. The note stated, \"if youre female like to have fun, maybe get Buzzed ... Im a middle aged man looking for someone to hang out with. I'm not ugly LOL. Tx me 2182606164.\" M.K. originally thought that someone left the note as a\n   joke. She did not contact the number, but she showed the note to her manager. Her manager later informed M.K.'s father that someone left the note on M.K.'s car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   M.K.'s father is a deputy sheriff for the St. Louis County Sheriff's Office. M.K.'s father called the number listed on the note, which belonged to Gundy, but no one answered. When Gundy returned M.K.'s father's call, her father did not answer. Gundy then texted M.K.'s father's phone and asked who called him. Her father decided to pose in his text message as a 16-year-old girl because his daughter and her co-worker were around that age. He began a texting conversation with Gundy, informing him that he received Gundy's note and was \"interested.\" Gundy replied, and, after exchanging a few text messages, Gundy asked when the fictitious 16-year-old girl wanted to meet. They agreed to meet on the following Tuesday. Gundy also agreed to purchase whatever the 16-year-old girl wanted to \"get buzzed.\" The following day, Gundy sent the 16-year-old girl sexually explicit text messages describing what he wanted to do to her when they met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During their texting exchange, the 16-year-old girl eventually asked if she could bring her 15-year-old friend to the meeting. Gundy agreed to it, saying it would \"B to fun.\" He also agreed to help the 16-year-old girl pay for gas to drive the girls to their meeting. After knowing that both fictitious girls would attend their meeting, Gundy used sexually explicit language to describe what he intended to do with both girls at his home. Gundy also agreed that he would provide them with marijuana, wine coolers, pornography, and \"go fast,\" which referred to methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following this conversation, M.K.'s father informed the Duluth Police Department about the note and his text-message exchanges with Gundy. The department began investigating, and a female employee from the Lakeview Drug and Task Force called Gundy on March 25 to set up a meeting for the next day. On March 26, the female employee called Gundy to confirm the meeting. That same day, two female Duluth police officers, acting as a fictitious 15-year-old girl and 16-year-old girl, waited at the school parking lot inside of a car at the scheduled meeting time. Gundy drove to their location, saw the plainclothes officers sitting in the car, and continued driving. After Gundy drove by the female officers, other officers stopped Gundy, arrested him, and seized a cell phone. Pursuant to a search warrant, officers searched Gundy's home and found the following: a light bulb that Gundy used as a smoking device, a tin container that contained methamphetamine, a sex toy, condoms, a pornographic DVD, and wine coolers. The officers also retrieved the text messages between M.K.'s father and Gundy from both of their phones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the police arrested Gundy and searched his house, Stephen Borchers, a St. Louis County sheriff's department investigator, interviewed Gundy. Investigator Borchers read Gundy his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. Gundy stated that he understood his rights and agreed to speak with Investigator Borchers. Gundy admitted that he wrote the note placed on M.K.'s car, knew that one of the girls was 15, and bought wine coolers for the girls. Gundy told Investigator Borchers that he continued texting the girl because he wanted to see if he was being set up. Investigator Borchers asked Gundy if he thought that the encounter with the teenage girls would be \"interesting,\" and Gundy replied, \"I was going to see how it prevailed. You know? I was thinking, are you f-cking out of your mind or what? I mean, who wouldn't?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The state charged Gundy with one count of electronic solicitation of a child in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.352\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 2a(1),\n   and one count of possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.025\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 2(a)(1) (2012). Gundy moved the district court to dismiss both charges, arguing there was insufficient probable cause to support the district court's issuance of the search warrant and that the district court should therefore suppress the evidence obtained through its execution. Gundy contended specifically that there was no probable cause because he communicated with a 16-year-old, not a ficticious 15-year-old. The district court denied Gundy's motion, reasoning that the statute did not require that he directly communicate with a 15-year-old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before trial, the state moved the district court to sentence Gundy as a career offender under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.1095\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 4 (2012), on the possession-of-a-controlled-substance charge. The district court held a bifurcated jury trial. In the first phase, the jury returned a guilty verdict on both charges. Following that verdict, the district court allowed the state to present evidence to the jury regarding whether Gundy is a career offender. The state introduced evidence of Gundy's prior felony convictions through conviction records and the testimony of a probation officer. The jury found that Gundy is a career offender. The district court sentenced Gundy to 36 months for his conviction of electronic solicitation of a child and 60 months as a career offender for his conviction of fifth-degree possession of a controlled substance, to be served concurrently. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I.

Is Gundy entitled to a resentencing hearing because there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict that Gundy is a career offender and because the district court failed to properly instruct the jury?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Gundy challenges his electronic-solicitation-of-a-child conviction, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to prove his guilt under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.352\">\n    Minn.

Thus, the statute broadly prohibits a person from attempting to persuade a child to engage in sexual conduct.

When the 16-year-old asked, via text, whether Gundy would \"do [the 15-year-old girl] like me,\" he replied, \"For sure we ll have us a porn party.\" He agreed to help with gas money so that the 16-year-old could pick up the 15-year-old. He also directed his sexually explicit text messages to both the 15-year-old girl and the 16-year-old girl, stating \"U girls gonna do each othere with the toy and put my c-ck in each othere,\" \"Cant wait [to] make u both squirt hard,\" \"We gonna do it all till we cum and cum and cum I love t talk why we doing it all be a blast,\" \"U girls sweet an sexy,\" and \"B the time a ur life.\" During his interview with the police, Gundy stated that he was curious about the situation, admitted that his reference to \"go fast\" referred to methamphetamine, and admitted buying alcohol for the girls. When the officer asked him what would have happened if he had actually met the 15- and 16-year-old girls at the school, Gundy stated that they would have probably drunk a few beers and that he was not sure where it would have gone from there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   By specifically describing his intended sexual activity with the 15-year-old, traveling to the school where he believed he would meet the 15-year-old and guide her to his home, purchasing items, and preparing his home to host the sexual activities with the 15-year-old, Gundy attempted to bring about a meeting to engage in unlawful sexual activity with the 15-year-old. This evidence, \"when viewed in the light most favorable to the conviction, was sufficient to permit the jurors\" to have concluded that Gundy attempted to persuade someone he reasonably believed to be 15 years old to engage in sexual conduct.\n   <em>\n    Ortega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7068556\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/813/86/#p100\">\n    813 N.W.2d at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In addition to proving that Gundy solicited a child, the state also had to prove that Gundy communicated with a child \"with the intent to arouse the sexual desire of any person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.352\">\n    Minn.

The district court authorized the search warrant, allowing the officer to search for evidence of child pornography in computer and electronic systems, telephone records, cellular telephones, and for evidence of controlled substances, including methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Gundy argues that this evidence does not establish probable cause that he solicited the fictitious 15-year-old girl because the search-warrant affidavit did not state that the text messages were communicated to the fictitious 15-year-old girl. As we have already concluded, Gundy was not required to directly contact the 15-year-old girl in order to solicit her. And if the police found the alcohol, marijuana, and methamphetamine at Gundy's home, the evidence would demonstrate that Gundy intended to fulfill his plan of engaging in sexual conduct with the fictitious girls, as he discussed in his text messages. Therefore, a district court could reasonably conclude that Gundy's home included evidence of electronic solicitation of a child or possession of methamphetamine.
