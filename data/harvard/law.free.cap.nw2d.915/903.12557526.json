Following a bench trial, the district court determined that appellants violated the Minnesota Consumer Fraud Act (MCFA) and the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (UDTPA), and ordered a restitution process for those students who were misled. On appeal, the appellants argue that the district court erred because the state failed to prove the necessary elements of an MCFA violation, the restitution order violated Minnesota law, and the determination that the appellants are jointly liable was improper. Because the state proved the necessary elements of an MCFA violation in respect to testifying students, we affirm in part. Because the restitution order's presumption of injury and causal nexus was not authorized by law with respect to non-testifying students, we reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellants Globe University and Minnesota School of Business (\"the schools\") are for-profit, post-secondary educational institutions. The schools have many separate campuses from one another, are separately accredited, and keep separate financial records. While the schools are separate legal entities, they have many overlapping qualities. Both schools are owned by the Myhre family; have the same corporate management team, which oversaw uniform operations of both campuses; and are Minnesota corporations that share a principal place of business in Woodbury. Credits at one school can be applied to a program at the other school, and both schools\n   use joint course catalogs. The likenesses go further, as the schools share training materials, student-activity-record systems, instructors, and enrollment agreements. Both schools offer certificates, diplomas, associate's degrees, bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and doctoral degrees. This appeal is centered on the schools' associate's and bachelor's degrees in criminal justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July 2014, the state sued the schools, alleging that the schools violated both the MCFA and the UDTPA by making false, deceptive, and misleading statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The misleading statements that are at issue on appeal involve promising prospective students career opportunities unattainable with the criminal-justice degree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint requested injunctive and declaratory relief, civil penalties, restitution under the parens patriae doctrine for all persons injured, litigation costs, and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A bench trial was held in April 2016 on the MCFA and UDTPA claims. The trial lasted 17 days, and over 60 witnesses testified. The state argued that the schools misled prospective students to believe that the bachelor's and associate's degrees in criminal justice provided the means to become a police officer, even though the degrees did not satisfy any aspect of the education required to become a police officer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, the state argued that the schools misled prospective students that the associate's degree in criminal justice provided the means to become a probation officer, even though the degree did not satisfy any aspect of the education required to become a probation officer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, the state introduced numerous marketing and advertising exhibits to support its arguments that the schools misled prospective students to believe that their programs were means to become police officers or probation officers. Many of the materials used images of police officers, and the Minnesota School of Business's blog website depicted stories of past students becoming police officers. The school had presentations by police officers and meet-and-greets with police officers. Numerous materials led students to believe the program was a means to become a police officer. For example, Globe University's website stated, \"[I]f you're interested in working in law enforcement ... the\n   multidisciplinary field of criminal justice can lead down many different career paths. A degree in criminal justice is useful in a wide variety of positions including: Police officer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Both schools' program applications included an acknowledgment by applicants that stated, \"I acknowledge I have discussed and fully understand the Criminal Justice program offered through Globe University/Minnesota School of Business is not POST certified. I realize this prevents me from being eligible to participate in skills training required to be a sworn police officer in the State of Minnesota.\" Other materials admitted into evidence instructed employees of the schools to provide applicants accurate disclosures and to avoid any misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Twenty-four students in the schools' programs between 2008 and 2015 testified on behalf of the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Many students testified that the schools misled them regarding the criminal-justice programs. The testimony of these students shared a common narrative: the prospective student would inform one of the schools of their intent to become a police officer, he would be encouraged by the school to enroll in a criminal-justice program, and he then enrolled in the program in reliance on the schools representations. Numerous school employees also testified, including a former admissions representative from the Minnesota School of Business, who testified that if an individual wanted to become a police officer, she was instructed to sell the program regardless of whether it realistically matched the applicant's career goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The schools' expert, Dr. Chiagouris, testified that the state relied on flawed evidence: testimony of select students was not a legitimate method to represent the actual student body. And another expert, Dr. Guryan, testified that the schools' criminal-justice degrees provided substantial net-value earnings to their graduates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court found the that students who testified on behalf of the state were credible, and also found that the testimony of the schools' employee-witnesses, who stated they informed prospective students that they could not become police officers, credible as well. The court found the state's anecdotal evidence regarding the criminal-justice programs persuasive, and it determined that the schools advertised their criminal-justice programs as a means to become a police officer, without disclosing the true requirements of becoming a police officer. It found that the schools' online marketing was directed at prospective students interested in becoming police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court found that the schools engaged in false and misleading practices in violation of the MCFA and the UDTPA in relation to their criminal-justice programs. It found that a causal connection existed between the schools' advertising and promotion of the criminal-justice programs and harm to citizens of Minnesota based on the schools targeting prospective students interested in becoming police officers; advertising and suggesting that their programs could lead to becoming a police officer; having recruiters recommend the programs to students interested in becoming police officers; misleading prospective students into believing the two-year degree\n   was sufficient to become a probation officer; and failing to disclose material facts. The district court determined the harm from these actions was both foreseeable and inevitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Next, the district court addressed relief. It determined that the schools were jointly liable as they never tried to legally separate themselves, were jointly operated, and were factually indistinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although the state represented from the beginning of the case that it would not pursue relief on an individual level, it nonetheless sought restitution for the victims. The district court found that these positions were not incompatible and ordered restitution for not only the 15 students who testified, but also provided a system through which other potentially harmed students could seek relief. The restitution order set up a notice-and-claims process for the schools to provide relief to students who attended the criminal-justice programs and were misled into thinking that they could become police or probation officers. The restitution order required that the schools must notify potentially harmed students, and that eligible claimants have 45 days to complete a claim form. Then, any claimant who demonstrated that he or she enrolled in a criminal-justice program with the understanding he or she would be qualified to become a police officer or probation officer would receive a rebuttable presumption of harm and causation. The schools had the opportunity to request documentation and to dispute any claims. And if the parties cannot come to a resolution, then the schools have the opportunity to had a third party make a binding decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The schools appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I. Did the district court err in determining that the state established a causal nexus between the schools' conduct and the alleged harm to the 15 students who testified?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II. Did the district court err in determining that the state established a causal nexus between the schools' conduct and the alleged harm to the students who did not testify?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   III. Did the district court err by determining that both schools were jointly liable?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On appeal, the schools set forth numerous arguments challenging the district court's determination that the schools are jointly liable under the MCFA to any student. The schools also challenge the restitution order and its rebuttable presumption of injury and a causal nexus. To address these arguments, we examine whether the district court erred in (1) its liability and restitution determinations as to the 15 students who testified; (2) its a restitution process that included a rebuttable presumption of injury and causal nexus as to non-testifying students; and (3) its determination that the schools are jointly liable for all damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We start our analysis by determining whether the district court erred in holding the schools liable for damages under the MCFA regarding the 15 students who testified. The MCFA states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [t]he act, use, or employment by any person of any fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, misleading statement or deceptive practice, with the intent that others rely thereon in connection with the sale of any merchandise, whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived, or damaged thereby, is enjoinable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Minn.

The district court found that the schools engaged in a variety of wrongful conduct, including targeting prospective students who wished to become police officers, advertising the programs as making graduates eligible to become police officers, and explicitly misleading prospective students. Similarly, the students who testified explained how they were harmed: they paid tuition for a degree that did not serve its purpose-to enable them to become police or probation officers. In light of the testimony of the students explaining how the school's wrongful conduct led to their harm, a causal nexus between the wrongful conduct\n   and harm was present, including the reliance component.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The schools contend that the district court erred by applying the wrong standard to determine if the causal-nexus element was met. The schools point to language in the district court's order indicating that the causal-nexus element was satisfied because the conduct here was \"inevitable and foreseeable.\" They contend that this ignores the necessary-reliance component of the causal-nexus element, as stated in\n   <em>\n    Group Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11075591\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/621/2/\">\n    621 N.W.2d at 13-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this oversimplifies what the district court actually stated. The district court found that the students provided anecdotal testimony about the direct harm caused by the schools' wrongful acts. It then stated that the consequences of this wrongful conduct was so inevitable and foreseeable, that it must satisfy the causal-nexus requirement set out in\n   <em>\n    Group Health\n   </em>\n   . While the district court did not explicitly use the word reliance, it did not apply or adopt a new standard, but instead phrased the element of reliance in terms of the natural consequences of the schools' actions and the evidence presented at trial. These conclusions are consistent with\n   <em>\n    Group Health\n   </em>\n   , where the Minnesota Supreme Court held \"the causal nexus and its reliance component may be established by other direct or circumstantial evidence that the district court determines is relevant and probative as to the relationship between the claimed damages and the alleged prohibited conduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11075591\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/621/2/\">\n    621 N.W.2d at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, students testified that they relied on the schools' wrongful conduct and that wrongful conduct caused them harm. Because the district court properly analyzed the causal-nexus element, and its analysis was supported by the record, the court did not apply the wrong standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because the state proved all of the required elements to support a violation of the MCFA in regards to the 15 students who testified, the district did not err in holding the schools liable and ordering restitution for these 15 students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We now turn to the potential claimants, former students who did not testify, but for whom the district court fashioned restitution relief. For these potentially harmed students, the state was still required to establish harm, wrongful conduct, and a causal nexus-including reliance-between the two.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11092878\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/627/342/#p351\">\n    627 N.W.2d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Unlike the 15 students who testified about the harm caused by their reliance on the schools' wrongful conduct, the record is mostly silent regarding the other criminal-justice-student population. Undoubtedly, the schools engaged in a wide range of wrongful conduct. But the state did not prove\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the schools' wrongful conduct impacted the student population outside of the 15 students who testified. Nonetheless, the district court ordered a restitution process for these non-testifying students whereby they can submit a claim stating that they were misled by the schools' wrongful conduct, with the causal nexus rebuttably presumed. This is problematic-no legal authority supports the use of a rebuttable presumption of a causal nexus between the schools' wrongful conduct and students' harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The state was required to prove a causal nexus between the wrongful conduct and harm to any student for whom it sought relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Group Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11075591\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/621/2/\">\n    621 N.W.2d at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating causation is a \"necessary element\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   27 Michael K.

But nothing in\n   <em>\n    Group Health\n   </em>\n   suggests that this requirement can be presumed for purposes of restitution when it was not proved at trial. Here, although the state proved the existence of wrongful conduct by the schools, it offered only limited anecdotal testimony by the 15 testifying students. This only demonstrates the experiences of those specific students. In this case, where student experiences may vary significantly, this lack of evidence is troubling. Although\n   <em>\n    Group Health\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that district courts have a wide range of discretion in accepting relevant evidence to satisfy the causal-nexus element, it does not stand for the application of a rebuttable presumption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We conclude that the restitution order does not satisfy the state's burden to prove a causal nexus between the schools' wrongful conduct and harm to the non-testifying students.

The schools engaged in a mutual undertaking for a common purpose, as reflected in the district court's findings that the schools' operations were uniform; and that they shared\n   enrollment agreements, instructors, and course catalogs. Furthermore, the schools shared the same corporate management and are owned by the same family, which had the right to control both schools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The schools argue that neither the existence of a joint venture or a joint enterprise is supported by the record because the state primarily relies on the fact that the schools shared employees and resources, which is insufficient to support either theory under\n   <em>\n    Hansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11534552\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/609/625/#p628\">\n    609 N.W.2d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Minn.

In\n   <em>\n    Hansen\n   </em>\n   , this court stated the fact that \"the entities at issue here may have shared common employees or that one entity may have used the services of the other entity does not lead to the conclusion that there was the requisite contribution or control such that they engaged in a joint venture as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11534552\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/609/625/#p628\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, here, shared employees and resources are only two factors among several other factors that lead to the conclusion that the schools engaged in a joint enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The schools also contend that the state waived its right to pursue joint liability because it did not plead it. However, they do not cite to any binding legal authority, but rather direct our attention to an unpublished decision, where this court held that because the pleadings failed to allege a joint enterprise or joint venture, it was not an error for the district court to decline to consider joint liability on a summary judgment motion. Not only does this case not stand for the proposition that it is improper for a district court to hold defendants jointly liable when it was not pleaded in the complaint, as was the case here, but it holds little persuasive value as an unpublished decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dynamic Air, Inc. v.

The state nevertheless must satisfy its burden of proof as to all of the elements under the MCFA, including a causal nexus, when seeking damages.
