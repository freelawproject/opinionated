We affirm, concluding the order is appealable and the district court did not err in dismissing Ramirez's retaliatory discharge claim on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 2] Ramirez was employed by Walmart in Jamestown. On April 18, 2017 Walmart terminated Ramirez's employment. On October 13, 2017 Ramirez sued Walmart under N.D.C.C \u00a7 34-01-20, which prohibits retaliatory discharges by employers. Ramirez claimed he was discharged from employment in retaliation for complaining to supervisors about other employees' \"unfair\" terminations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Walmart moved to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under N.D.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), arguing Ramirez failed to plead any facts establishing that his complaints about \"serial dismissals\" constituted protected activity as defined in the statute. The district court granted the motion on December 1, 2017, and dismissed the action without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Although an order dismissing a complaint without prejudice is generally not appealable, when a statute of limitations has run, a dismissal without prejudice is appealable because it forecloses litigation in the plaintiff's chosen forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James Vault &amp; Precast Co. v.
