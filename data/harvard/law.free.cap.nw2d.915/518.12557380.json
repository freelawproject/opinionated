The district court concluded that the officer is not entitled to official immunity because he was not performing his official duties while driving to work and did not perform his official duties during the relevant period of time. We agree and, therefore, affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This wrongful-death case arises from a series of two automobile accidents on interstate highway 35 (I-35) in Chisago County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At approximately 5:20 a.m. on November 6, 2013, Joseph Allen Kelley was driving to work in his Ford Ranger pickup truck. It was still dark at the time, and the pavement was wet or icy due to light snowfall overnight. Kelley entered the southbound lanes of I-35 at county highway 10 near the city of Harris. He initially drove in the right lane, behind a Dodge Ram pickup truck. He moved to the left lane to pass it. Soon thereafter, Kelley swerved to avoid a deer carcass that was lying on the pavement in the left lane, near the center line. Kelley lost control of his pickup, which slid on the gravel shoulder and then rolled in the grassy median. Kelley's pickup came to rest in an upright position on the far edge of the median, near the shoulder of the northbound lanes of I-35. Kelley's pickup was facing southeast with its headlights shining across the northbound lanes. During the rollover, Kelley was ejected from his pickup. His body came to rest on the pavement in the left northbound lane of I-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Meanwhile, Richard A. Giese was driving to work in the northbound lanes of I-35. Giese, a licensed police officer, was employed by Pine County as an investigator in the sheriff's office. Giese was driving an unmarked squad car, a 2007 Chevy Impala, which was owned by the county. The county maintained a policy that permitted Giese to drive the county-owned vehicle to and from his home in certain circumstances for work-related reasons. The parties do not dispute that Giese was complying with the county's policy concerning the squad car on that morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Giese entered the northbound lanes of I-35 at state highway 95 near the city of North Branch. He initially drove in the right lane behind a four-door sedan. Giese moved to the left lane to pass the sedan because its driver was driving erratically (by, for example, flashing the headlights between high beams and low beams and by tapping on the brakes). Soon thereafter, Giese saw a stalled vehicle in the median, near his lane of traffic, with its headlights pointed in a southeast direction across the northbound lanes. Giese believed that the stalled vehicle in the median likely had slipped off the pavement and had spun around before stopping there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As Giese approached the stalled vehicle, he scanned the area to see if anyone was walking near the vehicle. Giese did not see anyone near the stalled vehicle and continued driving. After he drove past the stalled vehicle's headlights, Giese's own headlights illuminated an object on the pavement in his lane of traffic. He was unable to move to the right lane because the sedan was traveling alongside him. He applied his brakes but did not stop before striking the object. Giese's squad car dragged the object along the pavement for approximately\n   92 feet. After coming to a stop, Giese activated his emergency lights, backed up, and parked his squad car to protect the scene. Giese then realized that he had struck a person's body. Giese exited the squad car, approached the body, and checked a wrist for a pulse. Giese then checked in and around the stalled vehicle for other passengers, advised onlookers to return to their vehicles, notified dispatch of the situation, and waited for a state trooper and emergency personnel to arrive. Kelley was pronounced dead at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October 2016, Kelley's mother, Carol S. Raymond, commenced this wrongful-death action against Giese and the county on behalf of Kelley's next of kin. Raymond alleges that Giese was negligent and that his negligence caused Kelley's death. Raymond alleges that the county is vicariously liable for Giese's negligence because the county owned the squad car that Giese was driving.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In his deposition, Giese testified that, as he approached the stalled vehicle, he slowed down to approximately 40 to 50 miles per hour. In contrast, two passengers of the Dodge Ram pickup (which Kelley had attempted to pass and which stopped on a southbound shoulder after Kelley's pickup rolled) testified in depositions that, immediately before and after colliding with Kelley, Giese appeared to be moving at a normal highway speed without having slowed down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2017, Giese and the county moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Giese is entitled to official immunity and the county is entitled to vicarious official immunity. In October 2017, the district court issued an order denying the motion. With respect to the issue of official immunity, the district court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">\n   Giese did not assume any duties typical of a police officer responding to a motor vehicle accident. For example, Giese did not activate emergency lights to warn other motorists; or stop and check the scene of the accident; or check on the welfare of any occupants of the vehicle in the center median; or radio for emergency medical service or additional law enforcement; or secure the scene so that other motorists would not get injured. At most, Giese's only action was to slow his squad car and take a quick look to see if he saw anyone near the pickup.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   Giese's conduct did not implicate any legal duties as a licensed police officer. Giese was driving to work and did not intend to stop at the accident area. He took no actions typical for a police officer acting in their official capacity in response to an accident. Giese's decision to keep driving and not assume the responsibilities or actions of a police officer in response to a motor vehicle accident was made in his individual decision making capacity. It was not until after he drove his vehicle over Kelley that he assumed his legal duties as a police officer by stopping, turning his emergency lights on, and backing up to secure the scene. Giese's relevant conduct was that of an average citizen, not the conduct of a police officer engaged in official duties. Therefore, the doctrine of official immunity does not apply to bar Plaintiff's\n   claim for negligent wrongful death against him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, the district court determined that Giese is not entitled to official immunity. The district court also reasoned, \"Because Giese is not entitled to official immunity, the Pine County Sheriff's Department is not entitled to vicarious official immunity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Giese and the county appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-23\">\n   I. Is Giese entitled to official immunity for his alleged negligence while driving from home to work?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   II. Is the county entitled to vicarious official immunity?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Appellants argue that the district court erred by denying their motion for summary judgment. A district court must grant a motion for summary judgment \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that either party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Minn.

The first step of the official-immunity analysis is broad enough to encompass a threshold question: whether the conduct at issue is governmental conduct. To answer that question, a court must ask whether a public official was performing the duties of his or her office when he or she engaged in the conduct that is alleged to be tortious. As stated above, the purpose of the official-immunity doctrine is to \"protect public officials from the fear of personal liability that might deter independent action and impair effective performance of their duties,\"\n   <em>\n    Elwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10664836,10664909\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/423/671/\">\n    423 N.W.2d at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and thereby to ensure that \"individual government actors [are] able to perform their duties effectively, without fear of personal liability that might inhibit the exercise of their independent judgment,\"\n   <em>\n    Kariniemi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794448,6794486\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/882/593/\">\n    882 N.W.2d at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Public officials are entitled to official immunity \"for their actions in the course of their official duties,\" but they are not so entitled if they \"acted ... outside the parameters of their charged duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Janklow v.

Accordingly, a public official may be entitled to official immunity only with respect to his or her performance of official duties. If a public official was not performing official duties when he or she engaged in the conduct that is alleged to be tortious, it is unnecessary to consider the second and third parts of the three-part official-immunity analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A court performs the first step of the official-immunity analysis \"by looking at the nature of\" a plaintiff's claim.\n   <em>\n    Pletan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10604707\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/494/38/\">\n    494 N.W.2d at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Appellants contend that, notwithstanding Raymond's insistence that this is an ordinary traffic-accident case, she actually intends to prove that Giese was negligent because he did not act as a public official should have acted. There is some basis in the record for appellants' contention. For example, in Raymond's complaint, she alleged that, \"As a Pine County Investigator, Giese has additional training and experience to help make important decisions when approaching an unusual scene.\" In another portion of the complaint, Raymond alleged that \"Giese has substantial training and experience, as a police officer, that would raise the standard of his conduct in situations such as this.\" In addition, Raymond retained an accident-reconstruction expert, who issued a written report that is based substantially on Giese's responsibilities as a law-enforcement officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After Giese and the county moved for summary judgment, however, Raymond took a different approach. She argued in her memorandum of law in opposition to\n   the summary-judgment motion that this is \"a straightforward auto case\" in which the driver \"happened to be an off-duty sheriff deputy\" but that \"standard liability applies to the driver and owner of the vehicle, like any other auto accident.\" Raymond also argued to the district court that this case \"has nothing to do with questioning an officer's professional judgment in the line of duty\" and that there should be no \" 'immunity bubble' insulating public officials in their personal lives from liability for their own negligent actions.\"\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Raymond's complaint cites the following statute as the basis of the county's liability: \"Whenever any motor vehicle shall be operated within this state, by any person other than the owner, with the consent of the owner, express or implied, the operator thereof shall in case of accident, be deemed the agent of the owner of such motor vehicle in the operation thereof.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20169.09\">\n     Minn.

In one portion of her brief, she states, \"This case is about bad driving [but] not about policing.\" She also states that Giese \"was off duty and not performing any duties within the scope of his employment as an investigator\" and, thus, \"this case has nothing to do with questioning an official's professional judgment in the line of duty.\" But in another portion of her brief, she argues that \"Giese of all people should have realized\" that he was approaching \"an obvious accident scene\" because of \"his experience seeing accidents.\" In addition, she argues that Kelley \"would be alive if Giese had pulled over to activate his emergency lights or had secured the scene\" before the collision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    After reviewing the record, we acknowledge that the nature of Raymond's claim has not been perfectly clear and consistent throughout the history of the case. We believe that it is appropriate to focus on the memorandum of law that Raymond filed in the district court in opposition to the summary-judgment motion. We are, of course, reviewing the district court's ruling on that motion, and the district court's ruling naturally is based on Raymond's description of her claim in that memorandum. There Raymond argued that \"standard liability applies to the driver and the owner of the vehicle, like any other auto accident.\" Given that argument, we assume that Raymond intends to prove that Giese was negligent only because he breached the standard of care that applies to all motorists-\" 'the standard of care to be expected from a reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances.' \"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gruenhagen v.

During the relevant period of time, Giese was driving from his home in Chisago County to Pine County with the intention of going to work. When Giese saw a stalled vehicle in the median, he perceived that the vehicle had slipped off the road into the median in a \"spin-out\" and had come to rest at the edge of the left northbound lane of traffic. Based on that perception, Giese did not take any particular action as a public official, such as stopping near the stalled vehicle to check on the welfare of its driver or occupants. He testified in his deposition that he took no action as a public official because spin-outs are fairly common on Minnesota roads in wintertime, because it did not appear that anyone was injured or in need of emergency assistance, and because the vehicle was located in Chisago County, which is not the county where he was a public official. Moments later, Giese saw an object on the roadway in his lane of traffic and collided with it. These undisputed facts demonstrate that Giese was not performing the duties of his public office when he engaged in the conduct that Raymond alleges was negligent. Because Giese was not performing any official duties, the\n    doctrine of official immunity is not necessary to \"protect [him] from the fear of personal liability that might deter independent action and impair effective performance of [his] duties,\"\n    <em>\n     Elwood\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10664836,10664909\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/423/671/\">\n     423 N.W.2d at 678\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , or to ensure that he is \"able to perform [his] duties effectively, without fear of personal liability that might inhibit the exercise of [his] independent judgment,\"\n    <em>\n     Kariniemi\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794448,6794486\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/882/593/\">\n     882 N.W.2d at 600\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Accordingly, Giese may not invoke the doctrine of official immunity in response to Raymond's claim that he breached the standard of care of a reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances. Thus, we need not consider the second and third parts of the three-part official-immunity analysis.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    In sum, given Raymond's theory of the case during district court proceedings, the district court did not err by denying the summary-judgment motion with respect to Giese because the district court correctly concluded that Giese is not entitled to official immunity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <strong>\n     II.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Appellants argue that the district court erred by concluding that the county is not entitled to vicarious official immunity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The doctrine of vicarious official immunity protects the state or a political subdivision from liability based on the conduct of an employee who is protected by the doctrine of official immunity.\n    <em>\n     Wiederholt v.

The district court concluded that the county is not entitled to vicarious official immunity because Giese is not entitled to official immunity.

For example, if Raymond were to seek to prove that Giese was negligent because he did not perform his official duties before colliding with Kelley or did not utilize his law-enforcement training and experience (as hinted in Raymond's appellate brief), Giese then may invoke the doctrine of official immunity. A theory of liability that is based on a public official's discretionary decision about\n     <em>\n      whether\n     </em>\n     to perform official duties is just as deserving of protection as a public official's decision about\n     <em>\n      how\n     </em>\n     to perform official duties.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Vassallo\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7254225\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/842/456/#p462\">\n      842 N.W.2d at 462\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (\"Official immunity can apply to any act that involves an exercise of independent judgment....\"). In\n     <em>\n      Pletan\n     </em>\n     , the supreme court concluded that a police officer was entitled to official immunity for both his \"decision to engage in a car chase\" and his decision \"to continue vehicular pursuit.\"\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10604707\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/494/38/\">\n      494 N.W.2d at 41\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .

Accordingly, a public official may be entitled to official immunity when he or she is making a decision about whether to perform his or her official duties.
