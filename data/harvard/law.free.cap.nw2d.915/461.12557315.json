Appointed counsel may file an application for leave to appeal the defendant's October 6, 2016 plea-based conviction to the Court of Appeals, and/or any appropriate postconviction motions in the trial court, within six months of the date of the circuit court's order appointing counsel. The defendant, through no fault of his own, was deprived of the opportunity to have appointed appellate counsel file a timely motion to withdraw the plea and application for leave to appeal due to the trial court's failure to\n   timely respond to the defendant's January 3, 2017 request for counsel pursuant to MCR 6.425(G)(1)(a) and the trial court's corresponding delay in ordering transcripts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
