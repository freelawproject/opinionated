Because the district court failed to apply the probable-cause standard when determining whether the law and proffered evidence would support an aggravated sentence, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The state charged respondent Donyale Damon Gayles with three counts of aggravated first-degree sale of a controlled substance; four counts of first-degree sale of a controlled substance; one count of first-degree possession of a controlled substance; and three counts of child endangerment (possession of a controlled substance), after officers orchestrated three controlled purchases of cocaine from respondent. The controlled purchases occurred at respondent's home. During two of the controlled purchases, children were present in respondent's home. Officers executed a search warrant of the home and discovered over 180 grams of cocaine and an unattended child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The state provided notice of its intent to seek an aggravated sentence and an upward departure, citing two aggravating factors: the drug offenses were committed in the presence of a child, and respondent has two or more prior violent-crime convictions and is a danger to public safety. The state thereafter moved for a court determination under Minn. R. Crim. P. 11.04, subd. 2(a), of whether the law and proffered evidence supported an aggravated sentence. Respondent argued that the state could not prove that a child witnessed the drug sales, and that the evidence did not support a finding that he is a danger to public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court denied the state's motion to present aggravating factors to the jury. The district court indicated that \"motions for aggravated sentences are not governed by a particular standard,\" but then stated that it considered the state's evidence concerning whether the offenses were committed in the presence of children \"in the light most favorable to the [s]tate.\" The district court found that there was no evidence that the children saw, heard, or otherwise witnessed the drug sales during the controlled purchases, and that the fact that children \"could\" have reached the controlled substances was not sufficient to support an aggravated sentence. The district court also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to present to a jury the issue of whether respondent is a danger to public safety, as his criminal history did not indicate a high frequency of dangerous crimes, and he had demonstrated lengthy periods of noncriminal behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The state appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   What standard applies when determining whether to allow the state to present aggravating sentencing factors to a jury under Minnesota Rule of Criminal Procedure 11.04, subdivision 2(a) ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Minn.

The state argues that the district court erred by failing to apply the probable-cause standard. Respondent argues that the district court applied a legally correct standard, but even if the district court should have applied the probable-cause standard, the evidence was insufficient to present the factors to the jury for consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Minn. R. Crim. P. 7.03 requires the state to provide written notice of its intent to seek an aggravated sentence at least seven days before an omnibus hearing. \"[T]he state is not limited to factors specified in the Sentencing Guidelines provided the state provides reasonable notice to the defendant and the district court ... of the factors on which the state intends to rely.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20244.10\">\n    Minn.

If the state gives notice of its intent to seek an aggravated sentence, the district court \"must determine whether the law and proffered evidence support an aggravated sentence.\" Minn. R. Crim. P. 11.04, subd. 2(a). The comment to the rule provides that the district court must determine two issues: \"whether the proposed grounds legally support an aggravated sentence\" and whether \"the proffered evidence is sufficient to proceed to trial.\" Minn. R. Crim. P. 11 cmt. The comment to rule 11 recognizes that rule 11.04, subdivision 2, \"does not provide a standard for determining insufficiency of the evidence claims and that is left to case law development.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20244.10\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Minnesota appellate courts have not previously addressed the standard a district court must employ in making a pretrial determination of whether aggravating factors may be presented to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v.

Robideau\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court reversed a departure based on the presence-of-a-child factor because the child did not witness the commission of the crime, although the child was in the home during the commission of the offense.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7077185\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/796/147/#p152\">\n    796 N.W.2d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 152 (Minn. 2011). In so doing, the supreme court indicated that a child must actually witness \"some portion\" of the crime's commission through seeing, hearing, smelling, feeling, or some other sensory perception.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7077185\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/796/147/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The state argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the presence-of-a-child factor in broader terms than those discussed in\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Robideau\n   </em>\n   , noting that the guidelines do not contain an exhaustive list of aggravating factors. The state argues that the presence-of-a-child factor may be satisfied by a child's \"mere presence in proximity to drug trafficking.\" We decline to adopt the state's broader interpretation of the presence-of-a-child factor, and adhere to the requirements articulated in\n   <em>\n    Robideau\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   However, applying the probable-cause standard to the facts before the district court, we reverse the district court's conclusion that the law and proffered evidence does not support presenting this aggravating factor to the jury. Examining the facts presented to the district court and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the state, the state presented sufficient direct and circumstantial evidence to present a fact question to the jury on whether one or more of the crimes were committed in the presence of a child. The evidence indicates that respondent stored drugs in his home and conducted drug sales from his home. On multiple occasions, respondent sold drugs while his children were present in the home. The children interacted with the drug purchaser immediately before and after drug transactions. On one occasion, a minor teenager was present in the home when a buyer transferred money to respondent\n   and discussed purchasing additional drugs. On another occasion, a child was left unattended with over 180 grams of cocaine in the home. The direct evidence, and the inferences drawn therefrom, are sufficient to present a fact question to the jury on whether a child witnessed the crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We likewise hold that the district court erred in concluding that the state failed to present sufficient evidence to present the dangerous-offender factor to the jury. The dangerous-offender factor requires the district court to determine whether the offender has two or more prior convictions for violent crimes, and the fact-finder to determine whether the offender is a danger to public safety.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.1095\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 2(2). The latter determination may be based on \"the offender's past criminal behavior, such as [a] high frequency rate of criminal activity ... or long involvement in criminal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.1095\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , subd 2(2)(i). It may also be based on \"the fact that the present offense of conviction involved an aggravating factor that would justify a durational departure.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.1095\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , subd. 2(2)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The state presented evidence of respondent's 20-year history of criminal activity, including a history of violent crimes. The district court concluded that respondent did not pose a danger to public safety after comparing respondent's criminal history with the facts of two pre-\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   cases,\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 1993),\n   <em>\n    review denied\n   </em>\n   (Minn. Aug. 16, 1993). The district court found that respondent did not pose a danger to public safety because he did not commit any serious crimes during lengthy periods of time, and he was not incarcerated for long periods of time between his crimes. But in\n   <em>\n    Kimmons\n   </em>\n   , we rejected the argument that the \"long involvement in criminal activity\" factor required \"a continuous pattern of offenses throughout one's life.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10642694\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/502/391/\">\n    502 N.W.2d at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded that the legislature did not intend to limit the statute's application to cases demonstrating a continuous pattern of offenses or violent criminal acts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10642694\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/502/391/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10642694\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/502/391/\">\n    at 395-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, the state was not required to provide evidence of a continuous pattern of unlawful behavior over respondent's 20-year history of criminal activity. Moreover, by weighing the evidence of appellant's prior criminal acts against his periods of lawful behavior, the district court infringed upon the province of the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Stat. \u00a7 609.1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 4 (2004) ). We conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence of respondent's long history of criminal involvement to present a fact question to the jury on whether respondent presents a danger to public safety. The district court erred in concluding that the state had not proffered sufficient evidence to satisfy this factor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because aggravating factors are elements of a crime that operate to enhance a sentence, the probable-cause standard applies when determining whether the law and proffered evidence support submission\n   of an aggravating sentencing factor to the jury under Minn.
