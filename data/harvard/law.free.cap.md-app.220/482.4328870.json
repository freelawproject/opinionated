In an effort to stem the surge in foreclosures in Maryland, the General Assembly enacted laws obligating lenders to give borrowers information regarding opportunities to avoid foreclosure. This case interprets the legislatively prescribed notice requirements that lenders must send to borrowers before initiating a foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In 2009, Appellant, Ramos Granados, defaulted on a loan secured by his principal residence. Mr. Granados endeavored to participate in loan modification, but after he made a few late payments, the lender filed a notice of intent to foreclose (\u201cNotice\u201d or \u201cNOI\u201d). Shortly after filing a foreclosure action, the lender dismissed the case without prejudice. Almost one year after the NOI was issued, Jeffrey Nadel and Scott Nadel, as substitute trustees for the current noteholder (\u201cAppellees,\u201d \u201cTrustees,\u201d or \u201clender\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a second foreclosure action. The Trustees did not send Mr. Granados a new NOI, relying instead on the NOI issued prior to the first foreclosure action, and prior to intervening changes in the statute governing notice requirements for residential foreclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">During the second foreclosure action Mr. Granados filed several motions to dismiss, followed by exceptions to the foreclosure sale, in which he asserted that the Trustees failed to comply with the notice requirements of Maryland Code (1974, 2010 Repl.Vol., 2010 Supp.), Real Property Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>(\u201cRP\u201d), \u00a7 7-105.1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Maryland Rule 14-205. The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County denied the motions and ratified the sale. In his timely appeal, Mr. Granados raises two issues for our review, which we have rephrased for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">1. Did the circuit court err in denying Mr. Granados\u2019 motions to dismiss the foreclosure action where the Trustees docketed the action relying on a Notice of Intent to Foreclose issued prior to applicable changes to the statute governing notice requirements in a prior foreclosure action that was dismissed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">2. Did the circuit court err in denying Mr. Granados\u2019 request for a hearing relative to his motion excepting to ratification of foreclosure sale pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-311?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We hold that once the Trustees dismissed the first foreclosure action, they were obligated to send Mr. Granados a new Notice containing the particularized information and documents prescribed by law before filing a second foreclosure action. Therefore, we reverse the circuit court on the first issue and do not reach the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Ramon Granados obtained a construction loan on November 20, 2006, in an amount of $688,950 from FNMC, a division of National City Bank. The loan was evidenced by a note and secured by a deed of trust recorded against real property in the city of Bowie in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland (the \u201cProperty\u201d or the \u201cBowie Property\u201d). Under the deed of trust, Mr. Granados was to use the Property as his principal residence within 60 days of obtaining the loan and for at least one year thereafter unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\n<em>First Modification Trial Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">On December 31, 2008, PNC Bank, National Association (\u201cPNC\u201d) acquired National City Bank and the Granados loan. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (\u201cSPS\u201d) was a loan servicer for PNC. A loan servicer performs services for the mortgage note holder or lender, including collecting payments, modifying terms of the mortgage, releasing liens, paying property insurance and taxes, and initiating foreclosure proceedings. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1980, 2011 Repl.Vol., 2014 Supp.), Fin. Inst. Art. \u00a7 11-601(j); <em>Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co. v. Brock, </em>430 Md. 714, 727-31, 63 A.3d 40 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Mr. Granados defaulted on the loan on May 2, 2009.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On September 25, 2009, SPS sent Mr. Granados an application for his first Trial Period Plan under the Home Affordable Modification Program (\u201cHAMP\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Plan set up three payments each in an amount of $1,730.64 due on November 1, 2009, December 1, 2009, and January 1, 2010. If Mr. Granados complied with the terms of the Plan, under which \u201cTIME WAS OF THE ESSENCE,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the lender would send him a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>HAMP Agreement to modify the loan documents. Although at the time Mr. Granados had not yet received a notice of intent to foreclose, and no foreclosure action had been filed, the SPS application form also contained a provision stating that the lender would suspend any scheduled foreclosure sale if borrower met the obligations of the Plan. Significantly, the form also advised, \u201cbut any foreclosure action <em>will not be dismissed </em>and may be immediately resumed from the point at which it was suspended if this Plan terminates.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Thus conditioned on the premise that any pending foreclosure action would not be dismissed, the form advised that no new \u201cnotice of default, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, or similar notice will be necessary to continue the foreclosure action, all rights to such notices being hereby waived to <em>the extent permitted, by applicable laiv.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Mr. Granados made payments in the correct amounts on November 24, 2009 (23 days late), December 28, 2009 (27 days late), and January 23, 2010 (22 days late). Mr. Granados made a fourth payment on February 26, 2010. On March 5, 2010, Mr. Granados received a letter from SPS, Inc. stating that SPS did not apply a check it received in an amount of $1,730.64, because \u201c[the funds] were less than the amount that we previously advised you was necessary to stop your foreclosure.\u201d The letter did not explain why SPS considered the payment to be an incorrect amount or why it accepted three late payments but not this one. The letter advised Mr. Granados that, \u201cif you send us <em>$60,42242 </em>by <em>03/19/2010 </em>we will credit the payment to your account, stop your foreclosure and set you up on a forbearance plan to accept future payments.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\n<em>The Notice of Intent to Foreclose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">On March 10, 2010, a Notice of Intent to Foreclose was sent to Mr. Granados pursuant to Maryland Code (1973, 2003 RepLVol., 2008 Supp.), RP \u00a7 7 \u2014 105.1 (b)(1), and Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 09.03.12.02. The NOI announced that Mr. Granados was in default of his Loan as of May 2, 2009, and that the most recent loan payment, received on January 11, 2010,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was applied to the April 4, 2009 period. The NOI specified the new amount required to cure the default was <em>$66,159.75. </em>It also warned that, \u201c[if] you do not bring your loan current and cure your default or negotiate a resolution with us, we may file a foreclosure action 45 days after this Notice is sent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\n<em>First Foreclosure Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">On April 8, 2010, SPS sent Mr. Granados a second trial period plan. The second plan required trial period payments of $2,133.64 by May 1, June 1, and July 1, 2010. Mr. Granados made a single payment of $2,133.64 on April 30, 2010, but that same day \u2014 one day <em>before </em>the first payment was due under the second plan \u2014 Bierman Geesing &amp; Ward LLC, on behalf of the substitute trustees on the deed of trust at the time, filed the first foreclosure action. Bierman Geesing &amp; Ward LLC later voluntarily dismissed this action without prejudice through an order entered by the circuit court on July 19, 2010. <em>Geesing v. Granados, </em>No. CAE10-13975, Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Meanwhile, on May 10, 2010, Mr. Granados received yet another letter from SPS stating that SPS did not apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>check it received from him in an amount of $2,133.64. True to form, the letter provided the same reason for not crediting Mr. Granados\u2019 check as in the previous letter: \u201c[the funds] were less than the amount that we previously advised you was necessary to stop your foreclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The Granados Loan was transferred in August 2010 to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Trustee to RMAC Pass-Through Trust, Series 2010-7T (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d). Quantum Servicing Corporation (\u201cQuantum\u201d) assumed responsibility for servicing the Loan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> SPS sent Mr. Granados a letter dated September 13, 2010, notifying him that servicing of the Loan was being transferred to Quantum and that the last date to contact or make payments to SPS was September 29, 2010. The letter explained that after September 29, 2010, all future questions about the loan should be directed to Quantum.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\n<em>The General Assembly Acts to Aid Distressed Homeowners</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The General Assembly first addressed the foreclosure crisis in 2008 with the passage of Senate Bill 216 and House Bill 365, both signed by Governor O\u2019Malley and enacted as Chapters 1 and 2, Laws of Maryland 2008. This emergency legislation was prompted by the Maryland Homeownership Preservation Task Force, convened by Governor O\u2019Malley in 2007, in response to rising loan default and foreclosure rates in Maryland. The legislation created RP \u00a7 7-105.1, which provides that a foreclosure action generally may not be filed against a residential property until at least 90 days after the borrower defaults on the loan and 45 days after the lender sends the borrower a notice of intent to foreclose. Maryland Code (1973, 2003 Repl.Vol., 2008 Supp.), RP \u00a7 7-105.1(b)(1). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>purpose of the legislation was to aid borrowers in communicating with lenders to avoid foreclosure. In that vein, the notice was required to state the names and telephone numbers of the secured party, the loan servicer, and an agent of the secured party authorized to modify the terms of the mortgage loan. Maryland Code (1973, 2003 Repl.Vol., 2008 Supp.), RP \u00a7 7-105.1(c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In 2010, during the time Mr. Granados was attempting to enter into a HAMP agreement to modify his loan, the General Assembly once again addressed the persistent rise in foreclosure actions in Maryland. After passage of the 2008 legislation, foreclosures continued to escalate, with total foreclosure activity increasing 67% over one year \u2014 from 29,790 foreclosures in 2008 to 44,463 in 2009 \u2014 and rising 13% in the last quarter of 2009. <em>See </em>Department of Legislative Services, <em>Fiscal and Policy Note for House Bill 1*72, Revised, </em>at 7-8,15 (2010). House Bill 472, passed on April 7, 2010, substantially modified the content of the notice of intent to foreclose that lenders are required to provide borrowers prior to filing an order to docket foreclosure. <em>See </em>House Bill 472, ch. 485 (2010).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The legislation required, among other things, that lenders provide borrowers notice of loan modification programs well before initiating a foreclosure action. Specifically, amended RP \u00a7 7-105.1(c) requires lenders to send the borrower and record owner of an owner-occupied residential property an application for a loan modification or loss mitigation program along with any NOI, at least 45 days before filing a foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>action. This provision addresses a problem noted in the preamble to the bill as originally filed, which acknowledged that \u201c[m]any homeowners have their home go to foreclosure while loan modification reviews are still pending or have not even begun.\u201d House Bill 472, ch. 485, 2:15-16 (first reading, 2010). Thus, the new law requires that loss mitigation applications have to include: options for loan modification or alternative loan payment plans; ways to simplify relinquishment of the property, such as through short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure; and ways to lessen the harmful impact of foreclosure on the borrower. The new law also expands mediation opportunities for borrowers and requires lenders to perform a loss mitigation analysis. <em>See </em>RP \u00a7 7 \u2014 105.1(c)(5), (g) (2010 Repl.Vol., 2010 Supp.). A loss mitigation analysis is an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of a loan secured by owner-occupied residential property to determine whether a mortgagor or grantor qualifies for a loan modification, and, if there will be no loan modification, whether any other loss mitigation program may be made available to the mortgagor or grantor. RP \u00a7 7-105.1(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The new law also amended the content of the NOI that lenders were required to send borrowers to include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">4. A statement recommending that the mortgagor or grantor seek housing counseling services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">5. The telephone number and the Internet address of nonprofit and government resources available to assist mortgagors and grantors facing foreclosure, as identified by the Commissioner of Financial Regulation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">6. An explanation of the Maryland foreclosure process and time line, as prescribed by the Commissioner of Financial Regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">RP \u00a7 7 \u2014 105.1 (c)(4)(ii)(1) \u2014 (3) (2010 RepLVol, 2010 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"Akdu\">\n<em>Second Foreclosure Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">On February 24, 2011, the Trustees filed an Order to Docket Suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>initiating the second foreclosure proceeding under the deed of trust against the property at 13920 Lake Meadows Dr. The Order to Docket included: 1) an Affidavit of Ownership identifying the secured party as Wells Fargo; 2) an Affidavit of Debt made by Quantum on behalf of Wells Fargo indicating that the amount due on the loan by Mr. Granados was $791,594.55; 3) an Affidavit of Default specifying that the Loan was due for the May 1, 2009 payment, and that as of January 25, 2011, the loan was more than 634 days past due; 4) copies of the Note, Deed of Trust, Deed of Removal, Appointment of Successor Trustee, and other documents required by the Commissioner of Financial Regulation; 5) information concerning loss mitigation programs and eligibility requirements; 6) a \u201cHardship Packet\u201d to be completed by Mr. Granados in advance of any mediation; and 7) a copy of the March 10, 2010 Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On March 23, 2011, Mr. Granados moved to dismiss the foreclosure proceeding pursuant to Maryland Rule 14-211<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> on several grounds. First, he asserted that the lender did not comply with the loan modification trial plans and never returned the February 26, 2010 payment he made under the second plan, although he did not provide documentation to support this claim. Second, Mr. Granados contended that the Order to Docket filed February 24, 2011 did not comply with the new Maryland Rule 14-205(b), which, by its terms, required that a notice of intent to foreclose comply with the revised notice requirements under RP \u00a7 7-105.1(c) (2010 Repl. Vol., 2010 Supp.). Specifically, Mr. Granados alleged that the NOI, issued almost a year prior to the second foreclosure action, did not contain the correct information and documents the law required be sent with the NOI. He stated that the Trustees were \u201ctrying to circumvent the new regulations by attaching to their order to docket an inaccurate and outdated [NOI] that does not include the correct amount required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>cure the default and that names PNC Bank as the secured party, when in fact, it is now Wells Fargo the alleged secured party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The Trustees responded that the foreclosure was docketed using a notice of intent that complied with the law at the time the NOI was issued. They maintained that the circuit court should read the new statutory provisions prospectively to permit NOIs issued before the new law went into effect to serve as sufficient notice prior to filing an order to docket foreclosure. The Trustees cited an advisory notice issued by the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation purporting to grandfather NOIs that were compliant with the provisions of RP \u00a7 7-105.1 in effect prior to July 1, 2010. They asserted that because Mr. Granados did not cure his default, the NOI was still valid, and the dismissal of the previous foreclosure action was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The circuit court denied Mr. Granados\u2019 motion in an order entered on April 11, 2011 without a memorandum opinion. Soon after, on April 18, 2011, Mr. Granados requested mediation, which the parties held on May 23, 2011.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On May 27, 2011, the mediator filed a mediation report with the circuit court, stating that no agreement was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">On June 7, 2011, Mr. Granados filed a second motion to dismiss, relying on substantially the same arguments as in his first motion, and adding a paragraph challenging the Trustees\u2019 power of attorney to initiate the foreclosure on behalf of Wells Fargo. In opposition, the Trustees produced a document showing power of attorney. The circuit court again rejected Mr. Granados\u2019 arguments and ruled that, \u201csimply because a prior foreclosure case was voluntarily dismissed, a previously issued Notice of Intent is not therefore invalid.\u201d The court noted that Mr. Granados had raised this very same issue in his previous motion and had \u201cnot offered any new legal basis for the granting of the requested relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>On August 15, 2011, Mr. Granados filed a motion for reconsideration, \u201crespectfully disagreeing] with [the circuit court\u2019s] interpretation\u201d of the law in the July 15, 2011 opinion denying his second motion to dismiss. In this motion, Mr. Granados further developed his argument that the Trustees could not rely on the NOI issued before the previous foreclosure action because it was out-of-date and did not comply with current law. Mr. Granados asserted that the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation intended his Advisory Notice to allow secured parties to use NOIs from before the law\u2019s effective date for a reasonable amount of time, but not NOIs issued by different secured parties for different foreclosure proceedings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\n<em>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and Denial of Motion to Reconsider</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\"><em>\u25a0 </em>Before the circuit court could rule on Mr. Granados\u2019 motion for reconsideration, Mr. Granados filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland on August 16, 2011. The bankruptcy court stayed the Maryland circuit court proceeding on August 22, 2011, and then lifted the stay on October 18, 2011. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d). On December 2, 2011, the bankruptcy judge discharged Mr. Granados from his debts, including the amount owed to Appellees for the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The foreclosure proceeding resumed, and the Trustees filed an opposition to Mr. Granados\u2019 motion to reconsider on February 22, 2012. Mr. Granados filed a reply on March 6, 2012, this time asserting that he had met his obligations under the Second Trial Plan, but that the lender did not uphold the terms of the plan, which entitled him to a modification. He provided documentation of the trial plans that SPS offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>and his payments thereunder. The circuit court denied Mr. Granados\u2019 motion for reconsideration in an order entered on March 26, 2012, again stating that he failed to offer any new legal basis for relief. On April 11, 2012, Mr. Granados filed an appeal of the order to this Court, which he withdrew on June 21, 2012 and which was dismissed on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag3\">\n<em>Foreclosure Sale</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The Trustees proceeded with the foreclosure sale on November 16, 2012, and sold the Property to Wells Fargo, the note holder, for $315,783.29. On January 18, 2013, in one last attempt to avert the loss of his property, Mr. Granados filed a Motion Excepting to Ratification of Foreclosure. The circuit court issued an order entered on March 1, 2013, denying the motion and ratifying the foreclosure sale. On March 28, 2013, Mr. Granados noticed the instant appeal from the order ratifying the sale pursuant to Maryland Code (1973, 2013 RepLVol., 2013 Supp.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d), \u00a7 12-303, which allows appeals from an order for the sale or conveyance of real property. The circuit court proceeded to grant judgment in favor of the Trustees in an order dated May 1, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">On appeal and in his motions to dismiss filed below, Mr. Granados contends that when the second foreclosure suit was brought almost a year after the NOI was sent, the information contained in the NOI was stale and inaccurate, and did not comply with additional notice requirements established by subsequent amendments to RP \u00a7 7-105.1 and CO-MAR 09.03.12.02. He maintains that because the Trustees failed to send him a new Notice, the foreclosure action should have been dismissed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Trustees, on the other hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>claim that the NOI was complaint with RP \u00a7 7-105.1 when it was sent, and amendments to the statute effective July 1, 2010 were intended to apply prospectively to NOIs issued after July 1, 2010. Therefore, the NOI that was sent to Mr. Granados in March of 2010 prior to the first foreclosure proceeding was valid for the subsequent foreclosure proceeding filed in February of 2011. For support, the Trustees cite to the May 2010 Advisory Notice issued by the Commissioner of Financial Regulation stating that NOIs sent before July 1, 2010 may be used for foreclosure actions in the transitional period after the law took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The Trustees, in one footnote and one sentence in the body of their brief, contest Mr. Granados\u2019 standing to bring this appeal because of his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. They assert that, due to Mr. Granados\u2019 discharge, any claim or cause of action belongs to the bankruptcy estate unless the estate administered it or abandoned it. At oral argument, the Trustees narrowed their standing argument to challenge only Appellant\u2019s ability to pursue a loan modification claim, not to dispute the procedural issues with the notice of intent to foreclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Before the circuit court, the Trustees\u2019 prose was much less explicit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> They noted that Mr. Granados had received a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>discharge under Chapter 7, and that he was relieved of any obligation to pay the lender. The Trustees relied on Mr. Granados\u2019 discharge to characterize his motions as dilatory tactics to forestall the foreclosure, but they did not contest his standing to file the motion or exceptions to sale. Given the Trustees\u2019 cursory treatment of this issue, before the circuit court, in their brief here, and at oral argument, we are hesitant to say they preserved this issue for appeal. Therefore, we decline to decide standing for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.... \u201d Md. Rule 8-131. This is true for issues of standing; when a party raises the issue of standing on appeal, this Court need not decide the issue if it was not raised and decided by the circuit court. <em>Cnty.

Maryland Rule 14-305 allows a party to the foreclosure proceeding to file exceptions to the sale. <em>See Four Star Enters. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Council of Unit Owners of Carousel Ctr.

Here, the Trustees do not contest that Mr. Granados was a party to the foreclosure proceeding and did not try to remove or disqualify him. In the Report of Sale for the foreclosure, dated November 16, 2012, the Trustees rested their authority to proceed with the foreclosure on the \u201cDeed of Trust from Ramon Granados.\u201d The Trustees continued to acknowledge Mr. Granados\u2019 role as a party in the foreclosure case during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding, and thus even though Mr. Granados received a discharge from the bankruptcy court, he was still a party to the Maryland foreclosure suit, and filed exceptions under Rule 14-305.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Although we review the circuit court\u2019s denial of a foreclosure injunction for an abuse of discretion, <em>Anderson v.

In other words, the purpose of RP \u00a7 7-105.1 is to provide some advance warning of the foreclosure proceedings to the defaulting borrower, the identification of the secured party, and other specified information to allow the borrower to pursue a modification of the loan or other action to forestall foreclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 557, 50 A.3d 567. Before a lender may foreclose on a defaulting borrower, the lender must give a borrower notice of its intent to foreclose upon the secured property.

For example, a Notice issued after July 1, 2010 must include the telephone numbers and internet addresses for government and nonprofit resources and a statement recommending housing counseling services.

The legislation does not specify whether it was intended to apply prospectively to NOIs. The Commissioner of Financial Regulation addressed the issue in an advisory notice on May 5, 2010:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">A NOI sent by a secured party to a mortgagor or grantor and record owner of a residential property prior to the Effective Date [July 1, 2010], which is compliant with current law, may be filed with an order to docket on or after the Effective Date.

On October 25, 2011, however, the Commissioner revised the May 2010 No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>tice, citing critiques \u201cthat complaints and orders to docket have been filed with NOIs that were delivered more than a year ago, in some instances, two years ago.\u201d Commissioner of Financial Regulation, <em>\u201cResidential Mortgage Foreclosure Regulations </em>\u2014 Notice <em>of Intent to Foreclose, Loss Mitigation Affidavit and Related </em>Documents,\u201d Advisory Notice, Oct. 25, 2011. The 2011 Notice instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">The 2010 Advisory <em>was intended to address transition issues </em>in connection with legislative changes and maintain the orderly processing of residential foreclosures in Maryland. The 2010 Advisory was not intended to provide that an NOI delivered on or before July 1, 2010 is perpetually valid. The Commissioner cannot determine the time at which an NOI should be reissued and <em>defers to the Maryland Judiciary to make such determinations on a case-by-case basis.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">(Emphasis supplied). Based on our reading of the amendments to RP \u00a7 7-105.1(c) and the intent of the law as interpreted by the Commissioner of Financial Regulation, we hold that, under the circumstances of this case, the Trustees were required to issue a new and updated NOI between the dismissal of the first foreclosure proceeding and the institution of the second that contained all of the information required by Section 7-105.1. We reject the Trustees\u2019 position that the NOI sent to Appellant in March of 2010 and used in the first foreclosure proceeding, which was dismissed, could be used as valid notice for any subsequent foreclosure proceeding. As demonstrated by the legislative history of RP \u00a7 7-105.1, the amendments apply to \u201cany order to docket or complaint to foreclose on residential property filed\u201d after July 1, 2010. The Trustees filed their Order to Docket on February 24, 2011, almost a year after the NOI was sent. As discussed by the Commissioner in the 2011 Advisory Notice, the intent of 2010 amendments was to grandfather existing Notices during the transitional period surrounding the July 1, 2010 effective date of the new law. The 2010 Advisory Notice was not meant to confer perpetual validity to Notices issued before the new law went into effect. The Commissioner\u2019s directive on the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>pretation of the statute is \u201centitled to some deference, given the specific legislative delegation to that official to adopt regulations with respect to the notice requirement.\u201d <em>Burson, </em>427 Md. at 553, 50 A.3d 567 (citing <em>Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. Demby, </em>390 Md. 580, 604-05, 890 A.2d 310 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">We decline to set an expiration date for a notice of intent to foreclose. However, when a lender institutes a foreclosure action, and then dismisses that action, the lender should issue a new NOI. Especially here, where the dismissal of the first foreclosure action coincided with legislative changes providing new protections to borrowers, the NOI issued in 2010 was clearly no longer sufficient. The NOI is not a blank check that will allow a lender to initiate a foreclosure proceeding against a borrower at any point in the future. It has a specific function \u2014 to give borrowers notice of a potential foreclosure and allow them to pursue remediation of their default. It is contrary to the spirit of the law that the NOI should operate as a document providing notice to a borrower of an impending foreclosure by an uncertain lender at some unpredictable time in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Appellees assert that, even if they should have issued a new NOI, the order to docket was a valid substitute because it allowed Appellant to receive all the information he would have received from an updated NOI. We disagree. Following Appellees\u2019 argument would obviate the requirement for the NOI. Its purpose is to give borrowers an opportunity for loan modification and communication with the current lender before the initiation of the foreclosure action, that is, before a trustee files an order to docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Trustees\u2019 Failure to Provide Notice Was Not Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Having found that the circuit court erred by not requiring Appellees to issue a new NOI before filing an order to docket, we turn to whether that error warrants reversal in this appeal. Appellees assert that this case does not require reversal because Appellant was aware of his loan modification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>options, citing <em>Shepherd v. Burson, supra, </em>a Court of Appeals case interpreting RP \u00a7 7-105.1 as codified in 2008.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In that case, Ms. Shepard contested a foreclosure action, contending \u201cthat the failure to identify Freddie Mac as the secured party in the notice [of intent to foreclose] violated RP \u00a7 7-105.1(c)(4)(ii)(1)(A),\u201d and that this violation warranted dismissal of the foreclosure action pursuant to Maryland Rule 14-207.1. <em>Shepherd, </em>427 Md. at 549, 50 A.3d 567. The circuit court disagreed, allowed the sale to proceed, and ratified the foreclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 549-550, 50 A.3d 567. The Court of Appeals granted Ms. Shepard\u2019s petition for certiorari on direct appeal to consider whether the Notice of Intent to Foreclose that she received met the requisites of RP \u00a7 7 \u2014 105(c) that the \u201csecured party\u201d be identified. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 50 A.3d 567. The Court held that the NOI was incomplete because it failed to identify one of the secured lenders. <em>Id. </em>at 556, 50 A.3d 567. However, the Court did not reverse the circuit court. The Court found that the NOI effectuated the purpose of RP \u00a7 7-105.1 because the notice contained \u201cdetails to allow her to seek a loan modification, including the name and phone number of a specific individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557, 50 A.3d 567. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">[A] failure to disclose every secured party is not a basis for dismissing a foreclosure action when the notice identifies a secured party, the notice contains the other information required by the statute that allows the borrower to pursue a loan modification, the identity of the other secured party is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>elsewhere disclosed to the borrower well in advance of the foreclosure sale, and the borrower does not move to dismiss the foreclosure action on the grounds of defective notice for more than a year after such disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 544, 50 A.3d 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The case before us presents a different factual situation from the one in <em>Shepherd. </em>Here, the NOI fulfilled its purpose for the <em>original </em>foreclosure action because it gave notice to Mr. Granados that foreclosure proceedings were imminent and gave contact information for the loan servicer. However, the NOI did not fulfill its purpose for the <em>second </em>foreclosure proceeding, which is the proceeding at issue here. By the time the Trustees filed their order to docket in the second foreclosure action, the NOI was not just incomplete, it was also inaccurate. It did not name the current secured party or the loan servicer, nor did it contain contact information for someone authorized to perform loan modification as of the time the order to docket was filed. Because the Notice here was incorrect, not just incomplete as was the case in <em>Shepherd, </em>the error warrants vacating the sale and remanding to the circuit court for dismissal without prejudice. The Trustees, of course, can send a new notice of intent to foreclose, file their order to docket 45 days later, and complete the foreclosure sale in the new proceeding.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In his second question presented, Mr. Granados asks us to consider the circuit court\u2019s denial of a hearing on his exceptions to the sale. Because we reverse the circuit court on the first question, we need not consider this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The requirements of RP \u00a7 7-105.1 must be effectuated to give borrowers an opportunity to avoid foreclosure. A lender who relies on an old, incorrect notice of intent to foreclose flouts this requirement. Appellees would have saved themselves time and expense had they initially sent another notice of intent, with correct information and in compliance with the new law. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>although the NOI that was sent to Mr. Granados on March 10, 2010 complied with RP \u00a7 7-105.1 as valid notice of the foreclosure proceeding filed on April 30, 2010, that action was dismissed. When more than one year later Appellees filed their Order to Docket in the circuit court initiating a new foreclosure proceeding, they should have issued a new NOI.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court must be reversed. On remand, the circuit court will set aside the foreclosure sale and dismiss the foreclosure action without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\">.

In that order, the court allowed the foreclosure, allowed the recordation of a Trustees Deed from the foreclosure, and allowed the successful purchaser to proceed to evict the debtor and \"to take whatever legal action is necessary to obtain possession of the above mentioned property pursuant to Maryland law.\u201d It further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>provided that \u201cany surplus that may arise from the foreclosure sale shall be paid to the Chapter 7 Trustee for distribution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">. The parties refer to Maryland Rule 14-205 in their discussions of the requirements for foreclosure filings. Maryland Rule 14-205(b) refers to and reproduces parts of RP \u00a7 7-105.1 relevant to this appeal, specifically, the requirement that a lender issue an NOI at least 45 days before filing an order to docket the foreclosure. We therefore reference the Maryland Code, RP \u00a7 7-105.1 throughout this discussion rather than the Maryland Rules. We nevertheless note that the Maryland Rules are consistent with our discussion of the history and purpose of the recent foreclosure legislation. Since the beginning of the recent foreclosure problems, and especially after the passage of these recent statutes, the Court of Appeals has amended the rules to ensure that they are compatible with the newly enacted foreclosure statutes. <em>Maddox v. Cohn, </em>424 Md. 379, 387, 36 A.3d 426 (2012). Both the legislative acts and the amendments to the Rules were designed primarily to protect the interests of residential homeowners in the foreclosure process. <em>Id. </em>at 388, 36 A.3d 426. In consideration of the General Assembly\u2019s public policy statements, as exemplified by its recent enactments, strict adherence to the rules of procedure in mortgage foreclosure sales of residential property and their consequent protections for borrowers is required. <em>Id. </em>at 393, 36 A.3d 426.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b524-5\">. Maryland Rule 14-205(b) duplicates the notice requirement, stating, with an exception not relevant here, that \"an action to foreclose a lien on residential property may not be filed until the later of (1) 90 days after a default for which the lien instrument lawfully allows a sale, or (2) 45 days after the notice of intent to foreclose required by Code, Real Property Article, \u00a7 7-105.1(c), together with all items required by that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>section to accompany the notice, has been sent in the manner required by that section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b525-15\">.
