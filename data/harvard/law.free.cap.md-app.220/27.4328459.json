He was sentenced to serve two concurrent terms of life in prison without the possibility of parole. In this timely filed appeal, appellant presents two questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">1. Did the trial court err in sentencing Appellant to two life without parole sentences pursuant to \u00a7 14-101 of the [Maryland Code (2002, 2012 Repl.Vol.), Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d) ]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">2. Did the trial court err in allowing improper and prejudicial other crimes evidence at trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Discerning no error in appellant\u2019s convictions, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court. But, because we conclude that the circuit court imposed an illegal sentence, we shall vacate appellant\u2019s sentence for the second count of robbery and remand for re-sentencing on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">On the morning of January 10, 2012, an African-American man, about five foot, four inches tall, wearing a skull cap, a beige or khaki colored jacket, and a distinctive silver ring, entered the M <em>&amp; </em>T Bank in Woodlawn, Maryland. He pushed his way to the front of the line and demanded money from the two tellers who were servicing customers. Taking approximately $516.00 from the two tellers, the man ran out of the bank. The robbery was recorded on the bank\u2019s video surveillance system.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">Later that day, appellant was arrested while he was walking toward his residence at 5406 Gwyndale Avenue. When approached by the police officers, he ran towards the back of the residence, discarding his jacket, cell phone, and wallet as he ran. Some of the discarded money matched the serial num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>bers of the money that had been taken from the bank. Appellant\u2019s former girlfriend confirmed that appellant sometimes wore a beige parka and a silver ring. The State also produced surveillance images from a police camera near appellant\u2019s residence that show appellant leaving his house about fifteen minutes prior to the robbery, wearing a hat, pants, and beige parka that were similar to those worn by the bank robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\n<em>The Application of C.L. \u00a7 l4-101</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Appellant was previously convicted for armed robbery in 1991 and 1995, and for robbery in 2001. He served three separate terms of incarceration for these convictions. Months prior to appellant\u2019s trial in the instant case, the State filed notice of its intent to proceed against appellant as a repeat violent offender under Md. Rule 4-245.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Appellant does not challenge the adequacy of the notice provided by the State or the sufficiency of the evidence produced by the State to prove his prior convictions. He asserts that the circuit court erred by imposing enhanced sentences for both of his robbery convictions in this case. This is because his previous robbery and armed robbery convictions are not enumerated crimes of violence under C.L. \u00a7 14-101 (a), and therefore, the circuit court erred as a matter of law by sentencing him as a fourth-time offender. Appellant further contends that, even if the circuit court was correct in concluding that the enhanced penalty statute was applicable, the court erred by imposing two enhanced sentences for his convictions, which arose from the same robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The State rejects appellant\u2019s interpretation of C.L. \u00a7 14-101(a)(9), asserting that it ignores the clear legislative purpose of the statute and would lead to an absurd result. As to appellant\u2019s second argument, the State contends that, because appellant failed to raise any objection to his sentences at the time they were imposed by the court, he has waived the argument for the purposes of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Whether the circuit court correctly interpreted and applied the relevant sentencing statute is a question of law, which we shall review <em>de novo. See e.g. Pitts v. State, </em>205 Md.App. 477, 486, 45 A.3d 872 (2012) (\u201cWhere a trial court\u2019s determination requires the interpretation and application of Maryland\u2019s constitutional, statutory or case law, we must determine whether the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions are correct utilizing a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The offense of robbery, for which appellant was convicted, is proscribed by C.L. \u00a7 3-402.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant was sentenced as a repeat violent offender pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 14-101, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">(b) Fourth conviction of crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, on conviction for a fourth time of a crime of violence, a person who has served three separate terms of confinement in a correctional facility as a result of three separate convictions of any crime of violence shall be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">(2) Notwithstanding any other law, the provisions of this subsection are mandatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">C.L. \u00a7 14-101(b). Among the enumerated crimes of violence that form the basis for an enhanced penalty, the statute includes \u201crobbery under \u00a7 3-402 or \u00a7 3-403 of this article^]\u201d C.L. \u00a7 14-101(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Prior to 2000, robbery was a common law offense with a statutory penalty. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7\u00a7 486, 488 of Article 27 (setting the maximum penalties for the crimes of robbery and robbery with a deadly weapon, but not defining those offenses). The General Assembly codified the crimes of robbery and armed robbery as Art. 27 \u00a7 486 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Art. 27 \u00a7 487, respectively, effective October 1, 2000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the Criminal Law Article was subsequently adopted on October 1, 2002, the statutes proscribing robbery and armed robbery were recodified as C.L. \u00a7 3-402 and C.L. \u00a7 3-403, \u201cwithout any substantive change\u201d from Art. 27 \u00a7 486 and Art. 27 \u00a7 487. Revisor\u2019s Notes, C.L. \u00a7\u00a7 3-402, 3-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">The current version of the enhanced penalty statute, C.L. \u00a7 14-101, was derived without substantive change from Art. 27 \u00a7 643B, which was originally enacted in 1975. Revisor\u2019s Notes, C.L. \u00a7 14-101; Art. 27 \u00a7 643B. For as long as there has been an enhanced penalty statute in Maryland, robbery and armed robbery have been included in the enumerated list of violent crimes that form the basis for the imposition of a more severe sanction against repeat violent offenders. C.L. \u00a7 14-101; Art. 27 \u00a7 643B.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Prior to October 1, 2000, Art. 27 \u00a7 643B(a) included robbery and armed robbery in the list of offenses constituting crimes of violence, without any modifications, limitations, restrictions, or accompanying references.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Committee Notes, Art. 27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u00a7 643B. In 2000, when robbery and armed robbery were codified, the legislature also amended Art. 27 \u00a7 643B to reference the new statutes, replacing the reference to \u201crobbery\u201d and \u201crobbery with a weapon\u201d with \u201crobbery under \u00a7 486 or \u00a7 487 of this article[.]\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the Criminal Law Article was adopted in 2002, the recodified enhanced penalty statute, C.L. \u00a7 14-101, adopted the statutory references to the sections of the Article that defined robbery and armed robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> C.L. \u00a7 14-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Appellant contends that his previous convictions for robbery and armed robbery occurred before the adoption of the Criminal Law Article on October 1, 2002, and therefore, they were not convictions under C.L. \u00a7 3-402 (robbery) or \u00a7 3-403 (armed robbery). His 2001 robbery conviction arose under Art. 27 \u00a7 486, which was in effect from October 1, 2000 to September 30, 2002, and his 1991 and 1995 convictions for armed robbery arose under the common law. <em>See </em>Art. 27 \u00a7 486 <em>Coles v. State, </em>374 Md. 114, 123-25, 821 A.2d 389 (2003) (discussing development of robbery from common law to codi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>fication). Therefore, he argues that his previous convictions for robbery and armed robbery did not arise under C.L. \u00a7 3-402 and \u00a7 3-403, as required by the plain language of C.L. \u00a7 14-101(a)(9), and those previous convictions cannot be the basis for imposing an enhanced penalty under C.L. \u00a7 14-101(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">When a case requires this Court to interpret the language of a statute, we employ a well-established set of principles, which we recently reiterated, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">[T]he primary goal of statutory construction is \u201c \u2018to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172 [935 A.2d 699] (2007) (quoting <em>Dep't of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. 399, 419-20 [918 A.2d 470] (2007)). The necessary first step is to look to the \u201cnormal, plain meaning of the language of the statute,\u201d which we read in its entirety to ensure that \u201c \u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe v. Montgomery Cnty. Bd. of Elections, </em>406 Md. 697, 712 [962 A.2d 342] (2008) (quoting <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 172 [935 A.2d 699]). If we conclude that the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we stop there. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173 [935 A.2d 699]. But we stay within the bounds of common sense: \u201cIf persuasive evidence exists outside the plain text of the statute, we do not turn a blind eye to it.... This enables us to put the statute in controversy in its proper context and thereby avoid unreasonable or illogical results that defy common sense.\u201d <em>Adamson v. Corr. Med. Servs., </em>359 Md. 238, 251-52 [753 A.2d 501] (2000) (citations omitted). If there is ambiguity or the language is susceptible to more than one meaning, then we look further: to \u201clegislative history, case law, purpose, structure, and overarching statutory scheme in aid of searching for the intention of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Whitley v. Md. State Bd. of Elections, </em>429 Md. 132, 149 [55 A.3d 37] (2012). We don\u2019t go out of our way to find ambiguity, and \u201c[i]f a specific term is not defined in the statute, the Court \u2018will give that term its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>ordinary and natural meaning and will not resort to subtle or forced interpretations for the purpose of extending or limiting the operation of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>F.D.R. Srour P\u2019ship v. Montgomery County, </em>179 Md.App. 109, 123 [944 A.2d 1149] (2008) (quoting <em>Md.-Nat'l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>110 Md.App. 677, 689 [678 A.2d 602] (1996), <em>aff'd, </em>348 Md. 2 [702 A.2d 690] (1997)), <em>aff'd, </em>407 Md. 233 [964 A.2d 650] (2009).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><em>Butler v. State, </em>214 Md.App. 635, 669-70, 78 A.3d 887 (2013) (parallel citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Resolution of the question now before us requires a determination of whether the General Assembly intended that only robberies and armed robberies committed after the adoption of C.L. \u00a7 3-402 and \u00a7 3-403 may result in an enhanced sentence under C.L. \u00a7 14-101(a)(9).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We shall assume for the purposes of this analysis that the plain language of C.L. \u00a7 14-101(a)(9) may be susceptible to more than one meaning. We begin with the observation that appellant does not assert that there is a substantive difference between a robbery committed before October 1, 2002, and a robbery after that date, and we perceive no substantive difference.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, because the interpretation of the statute advanced by appellant is, in our view, illogical and contrary to both common sense and code revision principles, we will look beyond the language and consult other sources to discern the intent of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Nevertheless, we will consider appellant\u2019s interpretation of C.L. \u00a7 14 \u2014 101(a)(9) in light of the other provisions of the enhanced sentencing statute. Of all the offenses that have consistently been included in the list of crimes of violence, the only other crime that is identified by reference to the section of the Maryland Code proscribing it is maiming.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> C.L. \u00a7 14-101(a). Under appellant\u2019s interpretation of C.L. \u00a7 14-101(a)(9), courts would be obligated to analyze prior convictions for robbery or armed robbery differently than they analyze prior convictions for other common law crimes identified in C.L. \u00a7 14-101(a). For example, prior convictions for murder, kidnapping, rape, and assault would be the basis for an enhanced sentence no matter when those convictions occurred. C.L. \u00a7 14-101(a). But, only prior robbery convictions would be time limited to the period after the adoption of the Criminal Law Article. We see, and appellant identifies, nothing about the crimes of robbery or armed robbery, which maintain their common law definition, that make them different from other common law offenses enumerated in C.L. \u00a7 14-101(a), such that prior convictions for robbery or armed robbery would be eliminated from enhanced sentence consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Looking at the enhanced sentencing statute as a whole, we find additional indications that it was not the legislature\u2019s intent to do so. The offenses of mayhem, maiming, assault with intent to murder, assault with intent to rape, assault with intent to rob, assault with intent to commit a sexual offense in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the first degree, and assault with intent to commit a sexual offense in the second degree, no longer exist as statutory offenses in Maryland. C.L. \u00a7 14 \u2014 101(a); Art. 27 \u00a7 12, \u00a7 384, \u00a7 385, \u00a7 386 (repealed in 1996). Including these offenses in the list of crimes of violence reflects the legislative intent to impose enhanced sentences on the basis of convictions that occurred before the adoption of the Criminal Law Article. C.L. \u00a7 14 \u2014 101(a)(5)\u2014(6), (20)-(26). Indeed, as the Committee Note accompanying the 1996 revision of the statute expressly states, \u201creference to these repealed sections ... must be retained under this section of law to ensure that they may be used as predicate offenses for the subsequent offender provisions of this statute.\u201d Committee Note (Committee to Revise Article 27), Art. 27 \u00a7 643B. The express language of C.L. \u00a7 14-101(d), imposing a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years for a second conviction of a crime of violence, allows the imposition of an enhanced sentence for crimes committed before October 1, 1994, long before the Criminal Article was adopted. C.L. \u00a7 14-101(d). Thus, to interpret C.L. \u00a7 14-101(a)(9) in the manner appellant suggests, would be contrary to the express legislative intent embedded in other provisions of the enhanced penalty statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Examining the Maryland Code more broadly, we see that the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as set forth in C.L. \u00a7 14-101(a) is incorporated and referenced in many other statutes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For example, the commission or intent to commit a crime of violence is an element of several other offenses proscribed by the Maryland Code, potentially exposing individuals who commit any of the enumerated offenses to additional charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>based on the circumstances of the crime.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The fact that an individual has been charged with a crime of violence, empowers the State to collect the individual\u2019s DNA for inclusion in a State-wide database,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> may affect the individual\u2019s eligibility for pre-trial release,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> reduces the options available to the individual as part of a plea bargain,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and potentially impacts the evidence that may be admitted against him or her at trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> After conviction, an individual who committed a crime of violence is less likely to be released on parole. C.S. \u00a7 7-301(a)(3)(i). The good conduct credits of incarcerated violent offenders accrue at half the rate of non-violent offenders. C.S. \u00a7 3 \u2014 704(b)(2). Individuals serving sentences for violent offenses or those previously convicted for a violent offense are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>also prohibited from participating in most home detention or work release programs. C.S. \u00a7 3 \u2014 404(2); C.S. \u00a7 11-723(1)(4)(i). Even after a violent offender has served his or her sentence, an individual\u2019s status as a violent offender may impact his or her rights in family law cases,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> may affect his or her ability to obtain a job,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> a professional license, or a certification,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and prevents the individual from legally owning certain items of property under penalty of law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Limiting the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d by adopting appellant\u2019s preferred interpretation of C.L. \u00a7 14-101(a)(9) could potentially impact the application of many other statutes implemented to protect the citizens of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">When the General Assembly codified the offenses of robbery and armed robbery and passed the pertinent amendment to Art. 27 \u00a7 643B, it also amended the language of several other statutes that referenced robbery and/or armed robbery in the same way by adding language that referred to the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>sections of the Code.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Acts 2000, Ch. 288 (effective October 1, 2000); <em>see also </em>Art. 27 \u00a7 372 (Uniform Machine Gun Act); Art. 27 \u00a7 410 (First Degree Murder); Art. 27 \u00a7 413 (Sentencing in Capital Murder Cases); Art. 27 \u00a7 441 (Regulated Firearms); Art. 88B \u00a7 12A (Statewide DNA Database System); C.J.P. \u00a7 3-804 (Jurisdiction of Juvenile Court); C.J.P. \u00a7 10-402 (Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance); C.J.P. \u00a7 10-406 (Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance). Neither the legislative history of the act that effectuated the amendments, nor the committee notes for the individual statutes directly address why the legislature felt it necessary to amend these statutes to include the statutory references, but neither is there any indication of a legislative intent to effect a substantive change. It appears that the language was added to call attention to the codification of robbery and armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Based on a cursory review of published appellate opinions after October 1, 2000, when Art. 27 \u00a7 643B was originally amended, it is clear that courts have continued to impose enhanced penalties based on prior convictions for robbery and armed robbery that arose under the common law, not under Art. 27 \u00a7 486 and \u00a7 487 or under C.L. \u00a7 3-402 and \u00a7 3-403, as appellant now suggests would be required by the plain language of the enhanced penalty statute. <em>See e.g. Stevenson v. State, </em>180 Md.App. 440, 443-44, 951 A.2d 875 (2008) (predicate conviction for robbery in 1992 formed basis for enhanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>sentence in 2004, pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 14-101(e), sentence vacated because defendant had not served the requisite period of incarceration as a result of previous conviction); <em>Coles v. State, </em>374 Md. 114, 132 n. 4, 821 A.2d 389 (2003) (predicate conviction for armed robbery in 1991 formed basis for enhanced sentence in 2001, pursuant to Art. 27 \u00a7 643B(d), convictions affirmed); <em>Facon v.

On the other hand, in no published Maryland opinion of which we are aware has this Court or the Court of Appeals ever questioned that a previous conviction for robbery or armed robbery arising under common law or under an earlier version of the Code, would qualify as a previous conviction for enhanced sentencing purposes upon the defendant\u2019s conviction for a subsequent violent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Moreover, the interpretation of C.L. \u00a7 14-101(e)(9) advanced by appellant is contrary to the clear purpose of the enhanced penalty statute. As the Court of Appeals opined in <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 264, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">\u201cthe penological objectives of statutes such as \u00a7 643B(e) which mandate the extended incarceration of recidivist criminals [are] to provide warning to those persons who have previously been convicted of criminal offenses that the commission of future offenses will be more harshly punished, and to impose the extended period of incarceration upon those who fail to heed that warning so as to protect society from violent recidivist offenders.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>See, e.g., Gargliano v.

When the detective responded, \u201cfrom target of investigation,\u201d defense counsel objected and requested a bench conference. The court stated, \u201c[t]here is nothing wrong with him saying [appellant] was developed as a possible suspect and that is why I responded to that location[,]\u201d but the court agreed that it could be problematic if the detective started discussing appellant\u2019s \u201cprior criminal behavior[.]\u201d Ultimately, the court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection to the detective\u2019s assertion that he knew where appellant lived \u201c[f]rom target of investigation[,]\u201d and suggested that the prosecutor rephrase the question. The following colloquy then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">Q. Detective [ ], shortly after the bank robbery came out, did you develop a suspect in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">Q. Who would that be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">A. The Defendant, Mr. Williams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">Q.

Weeks just prior to this robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the State to elicit irrelevant and prejudicial other crimes evidence from the investigating detective, over the objection of defense counsel. He contends that the detective\u2019s testimony constituted prior bad acts evidence by suggesting that appellant had been the target of police surveillance for several weeks prior to the robbery at the M &amp; T Bank, presumably as part of the police department\u2019s investigation of other crimes. \u201c[LJacking any relevancy or probative value,\u201d appellant suggests that \u201cthe testimony here could only serve to show that [he] had a criminal disposition.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, the trial court\u2019s admission of the prejudicial testimony could not constitute harmless error, and he is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In response, the State contends that the detective\u2019s testimony was relevant to prove that appellant was the individual who committed the charged robberies, and that appellant mischaracterizes the detective\u2019s testimony. In the State\u2019s view, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling appellant\u2019s objection to relevant and non-prejudicial evidence and allowing the detective\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Maryland Rule 5-401 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">\u201cRelevant evidence\u201d means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Generally, relevant evidence is admissible, but irrelevant evidence is inadmissible. Md. Rule 5-402. The determination of what evidence is relevant rests in the trial court\u2019s discretion and its determination will not be overturned absent a clear abuse of discretion. Md. Rule 5-104(a) (stating that \u201c[preliminary questions concerning ... the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Evidence that a criminal defendant has committed another crime or other bad acts is generally not admissible in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>absence of special relevance. According to Maryland Rule 5-404(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The Court of Appeals has opined that propensity evidence \u201ctend[s] to confuse the jurors, predispose them to a belief in the defendant\u2019s guilt, or prejudice their minds against the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 633, 552 A.2d 896 (1989) (internal citations omitted); <em>see also Streater v. State, </em>352 Md. 800, 810, 724 A.2d 111 (1999) (\u201c[T]he exclusion of other crimes evidence is ordinarily compelled because it is often too prejudicial and may interfere with a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial\u201d) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Preliminarily, we note that the only question to which defense counsel objected, and therefore, the only question that was properly preserved for appellate review was the State\u2019s query regarding whether the detective had previously seen appellant in the area around Gwyndale Avenue, to which the detective responded in the affirmative. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-323(a) (\u201cAn objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent. Otherwise, the objection is waived.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Upon review, we are persuaded that the evidence elicited from the detective by the State was relevant under Maryland Rule 5-401. At appellant\u2019s trial the State introduced surveillance footage taken by a video camera on Gwyndale Avenue, on January 10, 2012, about fifteen minutes before the M &amp; T Bank was robbed. The video depicted an individual who the State claimed was appellant, leaving the house identified as appellant\u2019s residence, wearing clothing similar to the clothing worn by the bank robber. The fact that the detective had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>personally observed appellant in the Gwyndale Avenue area, in the weeks immediately prior to the crime, living in the residence pictured in the surveillance video, was relevant in that it had some tendency to prove that appellant was the individual in the surveillance video. Further, if appellant was the individual in the surveillance video, as the State contended, that in turn, made it more likely that he was the individual, of a similar height and build and wearing similar clothing, who robbed the M <em>&amp; </em>T bank only fifteen minutes later. Moreover, the presence of an investigator in the neighborhood helped to explain how the police happened to have this video footage of appellant from the day of the robbery, which otherwise may have been confusing to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">We further conclude that the testimony of the detective that defense counsel found objectionable did not implicate the Rule proscribing the admission of \u201cother bad acts\u201d evidence. Not only did appellant not object to how many times he had seen appellant in the area or to the time frame of the observations, the detective gave no details regarding why he was in the area of Gwyndale Avenue in the weeks prior to the robbery. Nor did he indicate the nature of any offenses that were being investigated or state that appellant was the target of the ongoing surveillance in the neighborhood. Nothing in the detective\u2019s testimony indicates, as appellant contends, that appellant was the person who had been \u201cunder investigation for weeks prior to the incident in question[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We discern no error or abuse of discretion in the evidentiary rulings made by the trial court, but, even if we had, in light of the evidence before the jury, we would find it harmless. We shall, therefore, affirm the judgments of the court and appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">CONVICTIONS AFFIRMED; SENTENCE FOR SECOND ROBBERY CONVICTION VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING ON THAT COUNT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN APPELLANT AND BALTIMORE COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-11\">.

Of the eight statutes that were amended to add the statutory references in 2000, five continue to retain the additional language today, as amended to refer to the recodified robbery statutes in the Criminal Law Article. <em>See </em>C.L. \u00a7 4-401(b)(vi) (Uniform Machine Gun Act); C.L. \u00a7 2-201(a)(4)(ix) (First Degree Murder); C.J.P. \u00a7 3-8A-03(d)(4)(vi) (Jurisdiction of Juvenile Court); C.J.P. \u00a7 10-402(c)(2)(ii)(l)(H) (Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance); C.J.P. \u00a7 10-406(a)(8) (Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance). Of the three statutes that no longer include the amended language, C.L. \u00a7 2-303(g)(l)(x)(4) (Sentencing in Capital Murder Cases), retained the language until it was repealed in 2013, P.S. \u00a7 2 \u2014 501(e)(1) (Statewide DNA Database System) adopted a reference to C.L. \u00a7 14-101 by amendment in 2003, and P.S. \u00a7 5-101(c) (Regulated Firearms), was amended for clarity in 2003 to replace \"robbery under \u00a7 3-402 and \u00a7 3-403 of this Article\u201d with (13) robbery; and (14) robbery with a deadly weapon.
