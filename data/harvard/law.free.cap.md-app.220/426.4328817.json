(\u201cMother\u201d), were married on August 30, 2000. Although the couple parted ways soon thereafter, neither party sought a divorce prior to the current controversy. In the years since they were married, Mother has given birth to five children; four of those during the time the couple was estranged. Nonetheless, based on the \u201cmarital presumption\u201d in Maryland Code (1974, 2001 Repl. Vol.), Estates and Trusts Article (\u201cET\u201d) \u00a7 1-206, Mr. B. remains the legal father of the children born during his marriage. Mr. B. has had no contact or relationship with the children; however, when Appellee, the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cthe Department\u201d), began Child in Need of Assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d) proceedings involving the four youngest children, Mr. B. was notified as a party. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County, sitting as the juvenile court, issued an order denying the Department\u2019s request for genetic testing to disestablish paternity in regards to minor children Katerine L. and Alex F. following a best interests hearing conducted on October 4, 2013. At a review hearing held on February 21, 2014, Mr. B. requested that the court revisit its earlier decision denying genetic testing in order to divest himself of legal paternity of Katerine L. and Alex F. The court denied Mr. B.\u2019s request. He presents three issues for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">I. Did the circuit court err in determining that the availability of another \u201cputative father\u201d for testing was required to find that genetic testing was in the best interests of the child, and thus, abuse its discretion in determining that the lack of an available putative father precluded testing in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">II. Was Appellant improperly denied the right to counsel at the October 4, 2013, best interests and good cause hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">III. Did the circuit court err by <em>sua sponte </em>rescinding its earlier order to conduct genetic testing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>For the reasons set forth below, we do not reach Appellant\u2019s questions because the circuit court\u2019s order was not final and appealable, and the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Mother has five children: Edgar B., Alex F., Adrianna L., Katerine L., and Eric B. All five of the children were born during the marriage of Mother and Mr. B. The eldest, Edgar B., born August 31, 2000, is the only child not conceived during the marriage. Since birth, the children have resided with Mother and have had little to no contact with Mr. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On June 18, 2013, the Department received a report that Mother was neglecting her five children. A second report, made June 21, 2013, alleged that one of the children had been sexually abused by an older sibling. During the subsequent Department assessment on June 24, 2013, Mother notified a social worker that she was being evicted and was in need of housing for herself and the children. At that time, Edgar B. was staying with a relative and Adrianna L. was living with a family friend. On June 26, 2013, after Mother was admitted to a hospital emergency department for stating that she was suicidal, the Department removed the remaining children from Mother\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Katerine L., Alex F., and Eric B. were placed in shelter care, and on the following day, June 27, 2013, the Department initiated CINA proceedings. Adrianna L. was placed in shelter care on July 10, 2013 and was added to the CINA proceedings. Edgar B. is not part of the CINA case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The Circuit Court for Montgomery County, sitting as the juvenile court, held an adjudication and disposition hearing on July 26, 2013. Based on an agreed statement of facts, the court found the four children to be CINA. The court inquired as to the whereabouts and availability of Mr. B. Mother testified that Mr. B. is not the biological father of any of her children and that she had not seen him over the last ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Mr. B. did not participate in the adjudication and disposition hearing. However, two other putative fathers did respond. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Putative father, Mr. F., was present through counsel for Adrianna L. Mr. Abdul K., putative father of Eric B., did not appear at the hearing, but called the Office of the Public Defender to request counsel and spoke with a social worker regarding the proceedings. No one appeared on behalf of Katerine L. and Alex F. other than Mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The court acknowledged that there was a dispute about the biological parentage of all four children, but explained that before ordering any genetic testing, the court would have to hold a hearing to determine whether it is in the best interests of the children to set aside parentage. The court made the following statement about the best interests hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">The outcome will be that unless there is testimony that satisfies the requirement that it be in each child\u2019s best interest ... it\u2019ll stand as it is by the legal presumption, which is that [Mr. B.] is the father. And I\u2019ll say this, if there\u2019s no other potential father, [Mr. B.] will remain the father because .. . there\u2019s nobody to undo the presumption with, I guess is the way to say it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Best Interests Hearing: October 4, 2013</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">On October 4, 2013, the circuit court held a hearing to determine if genetic testing was in the best interest of each of the children. Having been notified of the proceedings, Mr. B. attended the hearing without the assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following Mr. B.\u2019s arrival, the court took a brief recess to allow an interpreter to arrive and assist Mr. B. Although the transcript indicates a break in recording during that time, Mr. B. engaged in a discussion with the court about proceeding without counsel, as the circuit court recounted in the subsequent hearing on February 21, 2014:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Mr. B[.] understood what we were doing because we had a long discussion about what was happening. And he was offered the opportunity to have counsel, which he declined, and wanted to proceed. He appeared for the parentage testing part of this process, and he\u2019s not entitled to counsel. But I offered him the opportunity to go and get it, and he refused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Turning to the best interests of the children, the court correctly determined that when paternity is in question for a child born during a marriage, the Estates and Trusts Article applies \u201cbecause it presents the \u2018more satisfactory\u2019 and \u2018less traumatic\u2019 means of establishing paternity,\u201d <em>Ashley v. Mattingly, </em>176 Md.App. 38, 58, 932 A.2d 757 (2007) (quoting <em>Evans v. Wilson, </em>382 Md. 614, 628, 856 A.2d 679 (2004)), and creates a presumption of legitimacy for children born to a married mother. ET \u00a7 1-206(a). Proceeding with the presumption of legitimacy, the court sought to determine whether it was in the best interest of each child to undergo genetic testing to determine parentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The court received testimony from both Mother and Mr. B. In the matter of Katerine L., Mother testified that she and Mr. B. were no longer together on December 23, 2005, when Katerine L. was born. She further testified that Katerine L.\u2019s father is Mr. Alex L., who currently resides in El Salvador. Although Mr. L. is aware that he is Katerine L.\u2019s father and Katerine recognizes him as such, Mother was unable to locate him for the CINA hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In the matter of Alex F., Mother testified that Alex F. was born on December 27, 2001, when Mother and Mr. B. were no longer together. Although she does not know the identity of Alex F.\u2019s biological father, Mother testified that she is certain that Mr. B. is not the biological father. Regarding the remaining two children, Adrianna L. and Eric B., Mother identified the two putative biological fathers, Joseph F. and Abdul K., respectively. Both of those men agreed to submit to genetic paternity testing,, which the court then allowed as being in the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Mr. B. testified that he and Mother lived together for \u201ca year or two years.\u201d Mr. B. also testified that aside from meeting Alex F. briefly, he has had no contact with the children and has not spoken with Mother in \u201cfive or six years.\u201d Mr. B. testified that the only contact he has had with Mother since their separation was when he attempted to gather the necessary papers for divorce. Mr. B., however, failed to file the divorce action, citing a lack of financial ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The circuit court issued an oral ruling on the issue of genetic testing for each of the children on October 4, 2013. Regarding Adrianna L., the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">I find that it is in her best interest for parentage testing to be done on [Mr. F.] who has indicated through counsel that he believes he may be the parent, that mother has indicated that she believes he may be the parent and Mr. B[.], who is here, testified that he doesn\u2019t believe he is the parent, and the credible facts which mostly came from [Mother], are that she stopped having relations with Mr. B[.] a couple years before Adrianna\u2019s birth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Regarding Eric B., the circuit court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">That the credible evidence supports the finding that it is in Eric\u2019s best interest to allow parentage testing on [Mr. K.] to determine whether he is the biological father. Again, it is clear from the testimony, mostly [Mother\u2019s, but also Mr. B[.], and the letter from Mr. Goss which indicates that [Mr. K. ] believes he may be \u2014 or to put it another way, that it\u2019s a possibility that he may be the child\u2019s father, and there\u2019s no relationship between Eric and Mr. B[.] of any kind, that it\u2019s in Eric\u2019s best interest for the testing to be done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Regarding Katerine L., the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">The testimony of [Mother] is that Katerine\u2019s father is [Mr. L. ]. Katerine is the presumptive child of Mr. B[.]. I would be happy for the department to find a way to do the testing. So, again, the question here isn\u2019t who\u2019s the parent, the question is, is it in the child\u2019s best interest to rebut the presumption of parentage. The answer is yes, if we can find [Mr. L.] to test. If we never find [Mr. L.] to test, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>presumption will never be rebutted, so the child will be presumed to be Mr. B[.]\u2019s child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Regarding Alex F., the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">The testimony of the two parents is, to be charitable, murky, about their relations at the time when Alex might have been conceived. He was born in 2001. Mr. B[.], I think, was here today to make sure that he didn\u2019t end up responsible for any child, even the one who was born the day after he married Ms. B[.], and I think some of his testimony was not credible, and he did contradict himself several times. That having been said, I have no evidence other than that. The parents were probably still having sexual relations with one another when Alex was conceived because that would have been three or maybe four months after they got married. So, I find that the testimony is not credible to rebut the presumption of parentage, and I will not order testing for Alex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">On October 8, 2013, the circuit court entered two separate orders denying parentage testing for Katerine L. and Alex F. and found that the testing was not in the children\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Review Hearing: February 21, 2014</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">At the review hearing held on February 21, 2014, the court received additional evidence pertaining to the parentage issue. Blood test results for Adrianna L. established a 99.99% probability that Mr. F. is Adrianna\u2019s biological father, and blood test results for Eric B. established a 99.99% probability that Mr. K. is Eric B.\u2019s biological father. Accordingly, the court ruled that Mr. F. was Adrianna L.\u2019s father and Mr. K. was Eric B.\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The court also received the certificate of live birth of Alex F. listing Mr. M. as his father. Presented with this new information, the court stated: \u201cnow we have two presumptions instead of just one.\u201d Although the certificate of birth created a presumption that Mr. M. was the father, the presumption that Mr. B. was the actual father was supported by the fact that Alex was conceived before Mother and Mr. B. ceased cohabitating, and Mother\u2019s contention at the hearing remained that she was uncertain of the identity of Alex\u2019s father. The court then returned to the best interests analysis, stating:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>I guess the only thing really we can do is this. I think there has to be some efforts to try to locate Mr. [M.] before I can make a determination about what, if anything, I ought to be doing. I mean, I\u2019ve already heard from Mr. B[.] about his position on who he\u2019s the father of, and made some determinations. One of which is that he\u2019s the child\u2019s father because he\u2019s the child\u2019s presumptive parent. Obviously the name of another man on the birth certificate raises a question. But unless we can answer that question some better way than what I\u2019ve got now, I would be hard pressed to say that this rebuts the presumption of Mr. B[.]\u2019s parentage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">At the conclusion of the hearing, all four children remained designated as CI\u00d1A and committed to the Department for placement in foster care. Mother was granted supervised visitation and was required to continue in her treatment plan, including therapy, prescribed medications, participation in parenting education, and substance abuse treatment. Mr. B. remained the presumptive legal father of Katerine L. and Alex F. and was ordered to meet with the Department to explore necessary services. He has not, however, requested visitation with any of the children. Mr. F. and Mr. K. were also ordered to meet with the Department to discuss services and the possibility of visitation. The court also continued the default permanency plan recommendation of reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The March 7, 2014, Petition to Vacate</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">On March 7, 2014, Mr. B. filed a Petition to Vacate Paternity of [Mr. B.] and Request Determination by DNA. Mr. B.\u2019s petition argues, among other things, that it is in the best interests of the children \u201cto know their true genetic and medical history especially given the lack of any relationship with [Mr. BJ,\u201d and that the \u201cchildren will receive less harm now than in the future to learn that all of the adults whom they trusted were not truthful about their parentage.\u201d In response, the circuit court issued an Order granting DNA/Genetic Testing of Katerine L. and Alex F. on March 18, 2014. However, on April 1, 2014, the court rescinded that order as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>improvidently granted, pursuant to its revisory power under Maryland Rule 11-116, and denied Mr. B.\u2019s petition to vacate. Thereafter, Mr. B. initiated this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Generally, a party has the right to appeal from a final judgment. Maryland Code (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) \u00a7 12-301. Appellees assert, however, that no final judgment has been entered and therefore this appeal must be dismissed under Maryland Rule 8-602(a)(l). We agree. CJP \u00a7 12-301 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">[A] party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court. The right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">A ruling of the circuit court constitutes a final judgment when it either determines and concludes the rights of the parties involved or denies a party the means to \u201cprose-cut[e] or defend[ ] his or her rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding.\u201d <em>In re Samone H., </em>385 Md. 282, 297-98, 869 A.2d 370 (2005) (quoting <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767 (1989)). In determining whether a particular court order or ruling is appealable as a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>judgment, we assess whether any further order was to be issued or whether any further action was to be taken in the case. <em>In re Samone H., </em>385 Md. at 298, 869 A.2d 370 (citing <em>Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 41-42, 566 A.2d 767).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">In the matter before us, the February 21, 2014, review hearing and Appellant\u2019s subsequent petition for genetic testing were not Appellant\u2019s last opportunities to request genetic testing. Clearly, further action in the case was pending by virtue of the statutory mandate. \u201cThe purpose of CINA proceedings is to protect children and promote their best interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Priscilla B., </em>214 Md.App. 600, 622, 78 A.3d 500 (2013) (quoting <em>In re Rachel T., </em>77 Md.App. 20, 28, 549 A.2d 27 (1988)). Accordingly, the court in a CINA case \u201cmust be able to monitor the matching of children\u2019s needs with services and to step in when the proposed disposition fails to meet the needs of the child.\u201d <em>In re Danielle B., </em>78 Md.App. 41, 68, 552 A.2d 570 (1989) (citation omitted). Indeed, the court is obliged \u201cto act as a monitor in order to review, order and enforce the delivery of specific services and treatment for children who have been adjudicated CINA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68-69, 552 A.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Once the court has obtained jurisdiction over a child in a CINA case, \u201cthat jurisdiction continues in that case until the child reaches the age of 21 years, unless the court terminates the case.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-804. Further, the court is required to \u201cconduct a hearing to review the status of each child under its jurisdiction within 6 months after the filing of the first [CINA] petition and at least every 6 months thereafter\u201d to evaluate the safety of the child, the appropriateness of continued Department services, and to \u201cproject a reasonable date by which the child may be returned to and safely maintained in the home or placed for adoption or under a legal guardianship.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-816.2. Even once a permanency plan is established, the court must periodically review the case until commitment with the Department is terminated. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 3-823(h). Thus, just as the circuit court noted, \u201cto some degree [CINA proceedings] are fluid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Here, the court may revisit the issue of genetic testing for Katerine L. and Alex F. at any review hearing. In fact, as noted above, at the February 21, 2014 review hearing the court stated: \u201cto some degree these things are fluid so that if I could have some indication, at some point, about a different outcome, I\u2019d certainly be willing to listen to the testimony.\u201d A permanency plan hearing was scheduled for June 9, 2014. Further, the Review Hearing Order, entered on February 27, 2014, acknowledges that the court will, when appropriate, revisit the issue of paternity regarding at least one of the children, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">THAT the Department reports that [Mr. M.] is listed as Alex\u2019s father on Alex\u2019s birth certificate. Mr. [M.] was Mother\u2019s boyfriend when Alex was born. Mother is unsure if Mr. [M.] is Alex\u2019s biological father. The department will try to find Mr. [M.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Moreover, although the court\u2019s decision to deny genetic testing for Katerine L. and Alex F. was entered in the October 8, 2013, order, the court did, in fact, re-examine the issue on February 21, 2014. At the review hearing \u2014 after receiving and considering as a new exhibit Alex F.\u2019s birth certificate listing Mr. M. as his father \u2014 the court stated: \u201cgiven the information that I have about Mr. [M.], at this point, [the court is] not really able to make a determination different from the one I\u2019ve already made.\u201d Accordingly, although the court denied the request to change its earlier ruling on genetic testing at the February 21st hearing, the willingness of the court to receive additional information and revisit the issue of genetic testing when appropriate is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Therefore, we find that the order of the court denying genetic testing does not constitute a final judgment and is an interlocutory order \u2014 ordinarily not appealable unless it falls within one of the statutory exceptions set forth in CJP \u00a7 12-303. <em>In re Samone II., </em>385 Md. at 298, 869 A.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Conventional application of the final judgment rule does not always provide suitable relief in juvenile causes and CINA cases, which can progress over several years and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>normally involve ongoing interventions by the court. CJP \u00a7 12-303(3)(x), however, permits an appeal from an interlocutory order \u201c[djepriving a parent, grandparent, or natural guardian of the care and custody of his child, or changing the terms of such an order.\u201d In applying this exception, the Court of Appeals has recognized that parents have a fundamental right to raise their children and has instructed that \u201corders [that] adversely affect a parent\u2019s rights to care and custody [ ] entitle the parent to an immediate appeal.\u201d <em>In re Karl H., </em>394 Md. 402, 431, 906 A.2d 898 (2006). In determining whether an interlocutory order is appealable in the context of custody cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">[T]he focus should be on whether the order and the extent to which that order changes the antecedent custody order. It is immaterial that the order appealed from emanated from the permanency planning hearing or from the periodic review hearing. If the change could deprive a parent of the fundamental right to care and custody of his or her child, whether immediately or in the future, the order is an appealable interlocutory order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 430, 906 A.2d 898/</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The order denying Appellant\u2019s request for genetic testing did not change the antecedent custody order as to Katerine L. and Alex F., nor did it <em>adversely </em>affect Appellant\u2019s right to the care and custody of Katerine L. and Alex F. <em>In re Karl H., </em>394 Md. at 431, 906 A.2d 898; <em>see In re Samone H., </em>385 Md. at 315-16, 869 A.2d 370 (Trial court\u2019s denial of a mother\u2019s motion for an independent clinical assessment to determine whether a bond existed between her and her children was not an appealable order under \u00a7 12-303(3)(x) because the order did not meet the standard of depriving the mother of the care and custody of her children or changing the terms of the prior order to detrimentally impact the mother\u2019s fundamental rights). Moreover, as counsel for the Department pointed out in oral argument, the children are entitled to the presumption of legitimacy throughout the CINA process unless and until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the court determines it is in their best interests to undergo parentage testing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Furthermore, as the Department argues, in CINA cases, a decision whether to order genetic testing to establish paternity may be analyzed as a discovery request for a physical examination under Maryland Rule 2-423. <em>See Turner, </em>327 Md. at 114, 607 A.2d 935 (\u201cA motion for blood tests made under the Estates &amp; Trusts Article is best analyzed as a request for a physical examination under Maryland Rule 2-423, and the court has discretion to grant or deny the blood tests.\u201d). Pursuant to Rule 2-423, \u201c[w]hen the mental or physical condition or characteristic of a party or of a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party is in controversy, the court may order the party to submit to a mental or physical examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner.\u201d Such discovery orders are interlocutory and not ordinarily appealable prior to a final judgment. <em>In re Foley, </em>373 Md. 627, 634, 820 A.2d 587 (2003) (citing <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Stevens, </em>337 Md. 471, 477, 654 A.2d 877 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Finally, Mr. B. contends that this Court may review the order of the circuit court pursuant to the collateral order doctrine. The rule that a decision of a circuit court is not appealable until it constitutes a final judgment, does not apply to orders that are collateral to the proceeding. <em>Gillespie v. Gillespie, </em>206 Md.App. 146, 153 n. 2, 47 A.3d 1018 (2012). The \u201ccollateral order doctrine \u2018treats as final and appealable a limited class of orders which do not terminate the litigation in the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Foley, </em>373 Md. at 633, 820 A.2d 587 (quoting <em>Bunting v. State, </em>312 Md. 472, 476, 540 A.2d 805 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Based upon a judicially created fiction, the collateral order doctrine permits immediate appellate review of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>order that shares sufficient attributes of a final judgment. <em>Harris v. State, </em>420 Md. 300, 321, 22 A.3d 886, 22 A.3d 886 (2011). Nonetheless, the doctrine is a very limited exception \u201centertained only in extraordinary circumstances,\u201d and it has four requirements. <em>In re Samone H., </em>385 Md. at 316, 869 A.2d 370 (quoting <em>Pittsburgh Corning v. James, </em>353 Md. 657, 666, 728 A.2d 210 (1999)). The Court of Appeals in <em>Pittsburgh Coming </em>delineated the four prerequisites for a prejudgment order to fall within this limited exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">We have made clear, time and again, as has the United States Supreme Court, that the collateral order doctrine is a very narrow exception to the general rule that appellate review ordinarily must await the entry of a final judgment disposing of all claims against all parties. It is applicable to a \u2018small class\u2019 of cases in which the interlocutory order sought to be reviewed (1) conclusively determines the disputed question, (2) resolves an important issue, (3) resolves an issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action, <em>and </em>(4) would be effectively unreviewable if the appeal had to await the entry of a final judgment. <em>See Peat &amp; Co. v. Los Angeles Rams, </em>284 Md. 86, 92, 394 A.2d 801, 804 (1978); <em>Clark v. Elza, </em>286 Md. 208, 213, 406 A.2d 922, 925 (1979); <em>Shoemaker v. Smith, </em>353 Md. 143, 725 A.2d 549 (1999).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The four elements of the test are conjunctive in nature, and in order for a prejudgment order to be appealable, each of the four elements must be met. <em>In re Franklin P., </em>366 Md. 306, 327, 783 A.2d 673 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Here, the circuit court\u2019s denial of Mr. B.\u2019s request for genetic testing does not conclusively determine the question of parentage for Katerine L. and Alex F. As noted above, Mr. B. may raise the issue again at any of the statutorily mandated review hearings. At that time, if the court determines that genetic testing for the determination of paternity is in the best interests of the children, then it may order such testing pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-1005(a). At each CINA hearing, the court is required to inquire into the identity and address of each parent of the child and, \u201c[i]f appropriate, refer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>parents to the appropriate support enforcement agency to establish paternity and support.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-822(a). Thus, the collateral order doctrine is unavailable as a means to appeal the court\u2019s order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Because the order denying Appellant\u2019s request for genetic testing to determine paternity in the underlying CINA proceedings was not a final judgment, does not fall within one of the statutory exceptions set forth in CJP \u00a7 12-303 permitting certain interlocutory appeals, and does not meet the strict requirements of the collateral order doctrine, the order is not reviewable by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-8\">. We note that the strict waiver of counsel requirements embodied in Maryland Rule 11 \u2014 106(b) do not apply to a parent's waiver of his or her statutory right to counsel in a CINA case. <em>In re Alijah Q., </em>195 Md.App. 491, 518, 7 A.3d 106 (2010). Nevertheless, certain minimal protections must govern the waiver of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 519, 7 A.3d 106.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-8\">. Pursuant to Maryland Code (1984, 2012 Repl.

In <em>Turner v. Whisted, </em>the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">The criteria for determining the child's best interests in cases of disputed paternity include consideration of the stability of the child's current home environment, whether there is an ongoing family unit, and the child\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional needs. An important consideration is the child's past relationship with the putative father. Finally, other factors might even include the child\u2019s ability to ascertain genetic information for the purpose of medical treatment and genealogical history.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">327 Md. 106, 116-17 (1992) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Rather than focus on any single factor, the Court of Appeals has advocated a balanced approach reflective of \"the court's paramount concern of protecting [the child\u2019s] best interests\u201d when determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>whether a blood or genetic test should be ordered upon a showing of good cause sufficient to overcome the statutory presumption. <em>Kamp v.

To the extent that the circuit court's ruling implies that there must be a putative father other than the presumptive legal father available for testing in order to satisfy the best interests of the child standard, we note \u2014 without deciding the specific question before us \u2014 that the best interests standard applied to requests for parentage testing of children born in wedlock, as articulated by the Courts of Maryland, requires a broad analysis with no single dispositive factor. <em>See Turner, </em>327 Md. at 116, 607 A.2d 935 (citing <em>Matter of Marriage of Ross, </em>245 Kan. 591, 783 P.2d 331, 338 (1989)) (stating a court must consider the best interests of a child prior to ordering a blood test to determine whether the presumed parent is the biological parent); <em>see also Miles v. Stovall, </em>132 Md.App. 71, 82-83, 750 A.2d 729 (2000) (holding, in a child support case, that former husband was entitled to blood tests to rebut presumption of paternity). However, we note that here it appears the court took numerous factors into consideration other than whether the putative father was available for testing, including the fact that Alex F. was bom during the marriage and during the time Mr. and Mrs. B. were cohabitating.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\">.
