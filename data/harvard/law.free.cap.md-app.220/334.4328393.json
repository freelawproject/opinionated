Unlike the selection of a contractor in the private sector, the process for the State is governed by the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act and Maryland procurement law. The question in this case concerns whether the State properly concluded that (1) it could consider a novel specification without triggering the Maryland APA\u2019s rulemaking process and (2) the specification encourages \u201cmaximum practicable competition\u201d under Maryland procurement law.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">In late 2011, the State of Maryland issued a request for proposals (\u201cRFP\u201d) for Construction Management at Risk Services for a new detention facility to replace the rundown and unsafe buildings that house male juvenile offenders at the Cheltenham Youth Facility in Prince George\u2019s County (the \u201cProject\u201d). Prior to the submission of proposals, Balfour Beatty Construction, Coakley &amp; Williams Construction, Hensel Phelps Construction, and Manhattan Construction (\u201cProtestors\u201d) jointly filed a pre-award protest with the Maryland Department of General Services (\u201cDGS\u201d or \u201cAgency\u201d). Protestors challenged the State\u2019s inclusion of a Project Labor Agreement (\u201cPLA\u201d) as one of the factors used to evaluate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>technical proposals. DGS responded by amending the RFP to clarify that inclusion of a PLA was not mandatory and extended the date for submission of proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The procurement officer denied the protest, and Protestors appealed to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals (\u201cMSBCA\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d), where the Agency\u2019s decision was ultimately affirmed. Protestors filed a Petition for Review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The matter comes before this Court from the circuit court\u2019s June 19, 2013 order affirming the MSBCA\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Balfour Beatty Construction, Coakley <em>&amp; </em>Williams Construction, and Manhattan Construction (\u201cAppellants\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> present two questions on appeal, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">I. Did the MSBCA err in failing to find that inclusion of a PLA as a factor in ranking proposals establishes a procurement preference for organized labor and constitutes an unprecedented change in state policy mandating formal rulemaking under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">II. Did the MSBCA err in failing to set aside the challenged RFP because it discriminates in favor of offerors who commit to adopt a PLA, thereby restricting competition in violation of Maryland procurement law?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we hold that a novel specification included in a single RFP, without more, does not change existing procurement law or formulate a new policy of widespread application or future effect and, therefore, does not mandate predicate rulemaking under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cMaryland APA\u201d). We also find that the record before the MSBCA contained substantial evidence to support its decision that the PLA specification was reasonably related to the needs of the State while encouraging the maximum practicable competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Cheltenham Youth Detention Center Project</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The Cheltenham Youth Facility is operated by the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services and is located on approximately 900 acres in southern Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, near U.S. Highway 301. First opened in 1870 as a school for boys, Cheltenham has served as the primary detention facility for male delinquent youths from many parts of the State. As stated in the Agency Report filed by DGS,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the purpose of the facility today is to house and educate delinquent male youths between the ages of 12 and 18 years who are considered too dangerous to return to their homes and who are awaiting court disposition or trial in Anne Arundel, Prince George\u2019s, Calvert, Charles and St. Mary\u2019s Counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">By all accounts, the residential cottages located on the Cheltenham campus are outdated, inefficient, and unsafe. Other administrative buildings are in various stages of deterioration. The Project centers on replacing deteriorated buildings on the campus with a 72-bed state-of-the-art detention facility and a regional warehouse. When complete, the new detention center, designed to combine the functions of the existing campus buildings into one facility, will be the first of its kind in Maryland. The proposed 99,000 gross square foot facility \u2014 with space for housing, administration, admissions and release, somatic and behavioral health, food service, education, recreation, visitation, staff training, storage and maintenance \u2014 will be significantly larger and more complex than facilities ordinarily built by DGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Plans for the Project began in 2005 following a determination by the Department of Juvenile Services that the current facilities were obsolete.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Project went through several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>design changes and finally appeared in its current form in the Governor\u2019s 2011 capital improvement plan for fiscal years (\u201cFY\u201d) 2012-2016. In 2011, the Project was estimated at approximately $48 million and was expected to take longer than three years to complete. Phase I of the Project (preconstruction/design phase) was expected to run about 14 months, and Phase II (construction phase) was anticipated to take about 24 months to complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">During 2011, DGS officials explored the use of PLAs for Juvenile Justice facilities generally and on the Cheltenham Project specifically. A PLA is a negotiated pre-hire agreement between a construction manager (here, the CM at Risk), and a designated collective-bargaining representative for all employees on a particular project. 51 C.J.S. Labor Relations \u00a7 311 (2014). In order to perform work on a project covered by a PLA, a contractor must sign the PLA and agree that no labor strikes or disputes will disrupt the project. Id.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Typically, PLAs covering public works projects require that bidders are or become bound by the PLA but do not restrict bidding to union contractors or limit work to union members.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>In a letter dated October 18, 2011, the Maryland Secretary of State wrote to the Vice President of the Laborer\u2019s International Union of North America, stating that the State was \u201callowing various stakeholders an opportunity to comment on the final draft of the proposed criteria for a [PLA] relating to the Cheltenham [Project].\u201d He explained that, with respect to whether the State would institute a policy encouraging use of PLAs on projects over $25 million, \u201cwe are going to evaluate our experience with this upcoming procurement and then decide how we may want to proceed on future procurements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">RFP for Construction Management at Risk Services</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">On November 9, 2011, DGS issued an RFP for Construction Management at Risk Services for the Cheltenham Project, designated No. DC-455-090-001 (\u201cCheltenham RFP\u201d), pursuant to Maryland Code (1988, 2009 Repl.Vol.), State Finance and Procurement Article (\u201cSFP\u201d), \u00a7 13-103 and Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 21.05.03 (Competitive Sealed Proposals).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> DGS determined that the Construction Management at Risk (\u201cCM at Risk\u201d) delivery method was best suited to deal with the magnitude and complexity of the Project.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Authorized under COMAR, the CM at Risk is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>[A] project delivery method wherein a construction manager provides a range of preconstruction services and construction management services which may include, but are not limited to, cost estimation and consultation regarding the design of the project, prequalifying and evaluating trade contractors and subcontractors, awarding the trade contracts and subcontracts, scheduling, cost control, and value engineering.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">COMAR 21.05.10.0113(1). Typically, the CM assumes all risks for cost, scheduling, and performance of trade contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The Cheltenham RFP prescribes CM at Risk services during both pre-construction and construction phases of the Project and requires that, \u201cfi]n order to be considered, all firms must agree [ ] to the Guaranteed Maximum Price (\u2018GMP\u2019) of Forty-Eight Million, Three Hundred Nine Thousand Dollars ($48,309,000.00).\u201d (Cheltenham RFP, Section 00300, Article 2(C)(1)). The CM serves as a cost estimator and project coordinator during the design phase and as the general contractor during construction. The CM\u2019s responsibilities include developing schedules, preparing construction cost models and estimates, conducting value engineering and labor conditions studies, managing change order review and quality assurance inspections, and advising on the sequencing of the construction work. The \u201cProject Team\u201d comprises the State of Maryland, the CM, the Architects/Engineer(s), and other project consultants. (Cheltenham RFP, Section 00400, Article 1(A)(5)).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Section 00300, Article 2, establishes the scope of the Project and identifies the factors for DGS to consider when evaluating the proposals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">B. <em>Evaluation Factors for Award</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">1. Basis for Award</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">The Procurement Officer shall make a determination recommending award of the contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the State, considering price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">2.

Economic Benefits to the State</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-12\">3. Price</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-13\">All offers must include reasonable prices. The Procurement Officer may reject offers containing prices determined to be unreasonably high or low.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-14\">4.

Although subsequently amended, Subsection D.6 entitled \u201cProject Labor Agreement\u201d originally provided:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao9\">a. The firm shall provide at least two (2) examples of projects which they have managed where a Project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Labor Agreement (PLA) was used and briefly describe their experience in developing and working with the PLA</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\">b. The firm shall provide a statement affirming their intent to establish and use a PLA in accordance with Section 00840 of this RFP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The CM is required to negotiate any PLA in good faith with all relevant labor organizations that have jurisdiction over the trades involved in construction of the Project. Qualifying PLAs must contain a provision that the contractor and all subcontractors are able to compete for contracts without regard to their participation in any other collective bargaining agreements. PLAs must guarantee against strikes, lockouts, and similar job disruptions; and include provisions that set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for resolving labor disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">November 21, 2011 Pre-Proposal Conference<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">On November 21, 2011, procurement officer Myrna L. Harris presided over the pre-proposal conference for the Project. Representatives from a number of firms attended, including Turner Construction Company, Inc., Skanska USA Building, Inc., Hunt Construction Group, Inc., Gilbane, Inc., and The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">At the conference, Ms. Harris explained the RFP process, reiterating that any changes to the RFP would be provided by addenda and that offerors should acknowledge the receipt of such addenda in their technical proposals. She also discussed the submittal process, including that offerors are to submit a two-part proposal consisting of 1) a technical proposal, and 2) a price proposal. She noted that the RFP provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>technical and price proposals are given equal weight, and that the technical evaluation criteria is listed in order of importance. Mr. Stephen Gilliss, DGS Project Manager, briefly described the scope of the Project and clarified that, among other things, Phase I of the Project was not part of the GMP. The meeting was then opened for questions, and attendees inquired about various issues, including funding for the Project, the addenda process, and the approximate timeline for the award. No one submitted a question related to the evaluation factor regarding PLAs.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The Pre-Award Bid Protest</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">One day after the pre-proposal conference, on November 22, 2011, Protestors filed a joint pre-award bid protest pursuant to COMAR 21.10.02, challenging DGS\u2019s use of a PLA as an \u201cunprecedented\u201d evaluation factor. Specifically, Protestors argued that the inclusion of the PLA evaluation factor \u201ccompelled] offerors responding to the RFP to agree to enter into a Project Labor Agreement as a condition of receiving full consideration for award of the Project,\u201d thereby unduly restricting competition in violation of SFP \u00a7 13-205(a) and creating \u201ca radical new procurement policy\u201d in violation of the rulemaking provisions of the APA, Maryland Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol., 2010 Supp.), State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d) \u00a7 10-110. According to Protestors, the \u201crestrictive PLA preference\u201d discriminated against them and their non-union subcontractors because they did not have established relationships with Maryland\u2019s labor organizations and their \u201cemployees and likely subcontractors do not want to work on a project covered by a PLA.\u201d Moreover, Protestors contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that their nonunion contractors and subcontractors would be unable to use their own employees for the Project and would likely have to pay duplicative costs for various union benefit programs. Protestors charged that the PLA evaluation factor was a \u201cpreference\u201d that violated Maryland\u2019s public policy favoring \u201cMaximum Practicable Competition,\u201d and that the RFP did not \u201ccontain any explanation or proof of need for a restrictive PLA preference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Addenda</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Before issuing her decision on the Protest, the procurement officer issued two addenda to the RFP that affected the PLA evaluation factor. First, Addendum No. 2, issued on December 27, 2011, modified evaluation factor \u201cf\u201d so that firms were no longer required to demonstrate prior experience with PLAs. Thus, the language of Subsection B.2 (1) was changed from \u201cProject Labor Agreement (include previous experience with PLA projects)\u201d to \u201c[t]he presence of a Project Labor Agreement.\u201d Also, item a. of subsection D.6 was deleted, removing the requirement that a firm provide examples of past projects on which it used PLAs.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Second, Addendum No. 4, issued on February 7, 2012, extended the due date for technical and price proposals to February 23, 2012, and revised subsection D.6 to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">If the offeror intends to use a Project Labor Agreement (PLA), it shall provide a statement affirming its intent to establish and use a PLA in accordance with Section 00840 of this RFP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">This Addendum also added a provision requiring PLAs to include \u201cprovisions prohibiting discrimination on the basis of union membership.\u201d Finally, in subsection 5, the prior language, \u201c[fjailure to furnish such evidence of the required PLA within the above-referenced timeframe ... shall be deemed a material flaw in the Contractor\u2019s proposal,\u201d was modified to read \u201c[fjailure to furnish the PLA ... <em>may constitute a default under the CM </em>contract.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Addendum No. 5, issued on February 23, 2012, extended the due date for the receipt of proposals to March 1, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"A0C\">Final Decision on Protest</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Ms. Harris issued her Final Decision denying the protest on February 21, 2012. She decided that the PLA evaluation factor contained in the Cheltenham RFP, as amended, was not prohibited because it was not expressly proscribed by CO-MAR or Maryland procurement law, nor was the PLA an express requirement under the RFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Regarding the reasonableness of including a PLA as an evaluation criterion, Ms. Harris noted that \u201cany PLA must include certain protections for the State against problems that might arise and impede progress,\u201d including guarantees against strikes or similar job disruptions; procedures for prompt resolution of labor disputes; and mechanisms for labor-management cooperation. Therefore, Ms. Harris found that DGS had provided adequate grounds for including a PLA as an evaluation factor for the Project given its size and complexity. She observed that amendments to the RFP clarified that use of a PLA was not a contract requirement, and determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">Any offeror may submit an offer and at its choice may offer, or not offer, a PLA. Should an offeror choose not to offer a PLA it is not excluded from competition for award. To the contrary, it may submit an offer which it considers to be a superior proposal in terms of experience, approach, price ... and may, in its proposal, choose to demonstrate why its proposal is DGS\u2019s best option without a PLA. <em>This is especially so in this solicitation, since DGS must consider the technical proposal equally with price.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Ms. Harris discussed how use of a PLA as an evaluation factor did not discriminate against non-union subcontractors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMz\">Should an offeror choose to include the use of a PLA in its proposal, by the express requirements of Section 00840, any such PLA must \u201callow the [Construction Manager] and all Subcontractors to compete for contract and subcontracts without regard to whether they are otherwise parties to any other collective bargaining agreements\u201d and \u201ccontain provisions prohibiting discrimination of [sic] the basis of union membership.\u201d Thus, non-union labor firms will have the same opportunity as union firms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">She found that the solicitation was not unduly restrictive because the PLA was only one of seven evaluation factors for the technical proposal (which is only accorded 50 percent value under this RFP), and that it was ranked \u201cof low importance.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Ultimately, Ms. Harris concluded that the inclusion of a PLA was reasonable and nondiscriminatory, and did not constitute a change in procurement policy. Protestors appealed to the MSBCA on February 22, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Award to Turner Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">DGS received seven proposals on March 1, 2012, in response to the Cheltenham RFP, including one from Appellant Manhattan Construction. Each proposal contained a PLA. On May 23, 2012, the Maryland Board of Public Works unanimously approved the award of the contract to Turner Construction pursuant to COMAR 21.10.02.11A, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">A. If the authority to award a contract has not been delegated to a department pursuant to COMAR 21.02.01.04, and a timely protest or appeal has been filed, the contract may be executed only if either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">(1) The Board of Public Works finds that execution of the contract without delay is necessary to protect substantial State interests; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">(2) The Appeals Board issues a final decision concerning the appeal. If a contract is to be executed pursuant to \u00a7 A(l) of this regulation, the procurement agency shall so notify the Appeals Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Turner began providing preconstruction services shortly thereafter, and construction began in November of 2013.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>MSBCA Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Protestors timely appealed to the MSBCA, and in their memorandum in support thereof, Protestors introduced the affidavit of economist Anirban Basu, Chairman and CEO of Sage Policy Group, Inc. Mr. Basu\u2019s affidavit asserts that his research regarding the impact of PLAs on the DC-Maryland construction industry led him to conclude that PLAs are likely to (1) burden non-union contractors and business owners (adding that disadvantaged business owners are overwhelmingly nonunion); (2) have adverse impact on local economies; (3) diminish opportunities for pre-existing skilled non-union workers; (4) result in unsafe work practices and poor construction outcomes; (5) generate large inefficiencies; and (6) result in increased price without realizing any benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Mr. Basu also states that a survey conducted by the Associated Builders and Contractors of Maryland (\u201cABC\u201d) revealed that \u201cmore than 98% of ABC member contractors and subcontractors were less likely to bid on a public construction project that is covered by a PLA.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Basu states that according to his research, comparable government projects in Maryland encountered none of the problems \u2014 labor-related disruptions, delays, and inefficiencies \u2014 identified by DGS in the RFP as grounds for inclusion of the PLA evaluation factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">DGS submitted an Agency Report,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which included, among other documents, a March 2012 assessment of the Cheltenham facility issued by Grimm &amp; Parker Architects, and a study <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>prepared by Fred Kotler, J.D. supporting the use of PLAs on public projects and upon which DGS relied, in part, in preparation of the RFP specifications. <em>See </em>Fred B. Kotler, J.D., <em>Project Labor Agreements in New York State: In the Public Interest, </em>Cornell Univ. (2009). Mr. Kotler addresses general allegations that PLAs are anticompetitive and explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agq\">Because union and non-union contractors are free to bid on projects covered by PLAs, they avoid the favoritism that competitive bidding laws are designed to prevent. Awards are frequently made to both union and non-union companies. Those same contractors are not required to become union contractors, that is, signatories to the respective area craft agreement, but only to become signatories to the PLA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aav\"><em>Id. </em>at p. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">In response to the Agency Report, the Protestors moved for summary decision, claiming that the State failed to conduct market research or a study of labor conditions in Maryland such as that performed by Mr. Basu and, therefore, contending the State produced no <em>prima facie </em>evidence to justify the PLA evaluation factor. The State\u2019s reply included the Affidavit of Assistant Secretary for DGS, Mr. Bart Thomas. In his affidavit, Mr. Thomas asserts that the use of a PLA \u201cgives owners and contractors a unique opportunity to anticipate and avoid problems that might arise and possibly impede progress.\u201d Mr. Thomas maintains that he concluded, based upon research and communications with various union and nonunion contractors and the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (\u201cDLLR\u201d), among others, that PLAs in large-scale projects (1) help provide a dedicated, trained workforce; (2) boost local economies; (3) facilitate apprenticeship and job training programs; (4) promote project stability and safety; (5) promote project efficiency, (6) provide a planned approach to labor relations and more accurate prediction of labor costs; and (7) assure timely completion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Following submission of the record and competing affidavits, the MSBCA heard oral argument on September 20, 2012. After final briefing, the Board issued its decision denying the appeal on November 16, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">At the outset, the Board acknowledged that under SFP \u00a7 13 \u2014 205(a)(1) and attendant regulations,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the law is clear that a procurement specification may not unduly restrict competition. <em>Balfour Beatty, </em>MSBCA 2803 at 4, \u2014 MSBCA \u00b6 \u2014 (2012) (citing <em>Xerox Corp., </em>MSBCA 1111, 1 MSBCA \u00b6 48 (1983)).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Board also instructed that, \u201cit is for the government as procuring entity, and not the function of private vendors, to determine what restrictions may reasonably be imposed to achieve the State\u2019s procurement goals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Although the State enjoys \u201cgreat latitude\u201d in its determination, the State is prohibited from steering contracts to a particular vendor. <em>Id. </em>In order to defend its specifications, the government must simply assert reasonable cause for a restrictive bid or proposal requirement. The Board noted that \u201cthe more restrictive a specification may be, the greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the justification that the State may be fairly required to assert.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. Once the State satisfies this showing, the protestor has a \u201cconsiderable burden\u201d to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the restriction is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 5 (citing <em>Xerox Corp., supra; The Trane Co., </em>MSBCA 1264, 2 MSBCA \u00b6 118 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The Board found that the challenged specification \u2014 the PLA evaluation factor \u2014 is not highly restrictive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">The RFP at issue does not even impose the requirement of a PLA. Any qualified offeror was free to submit a proposal in response to this RFP with or without a PLA ... The contested specification in this RFP simply allows the State to consider the potential benefit to the State of selecting a proposal with a PLA in place. In addition, the option of including a PLA in a proposal was assured by the State to be afforded the weight of only the sixth most important of a total of seven evaluations factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 6. The MSBCA concluded \u201cthe alleged restriction is slight, even giving appellant the benefit of classifying the allowance of consideration of a PLA as a restriction at all.\u201d Id. That the degree of restrictiveness was small, the Board added, is evidenced by the fact that not one, but seven separate proposals were submitted to the State, each proposing use of a PLA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Turning to the State\u2019s justification for including the PLA evaluation factor, the Board first acknowledged that the parties advanced affidavits containing diametrically opposing perspectives. The Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">It is not for the Board to determine which view is correct.

Inclusion of a PLA as an evaluation criterion in the Cheltenham RFP, the Board found, had no general application or future effect and, therefore, it did not constitute a new regulation subject to the formal rulemaking procedures required by the Maryland APA. <em>Id. </em>at 11.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In its final analysis, the Board posed the rhetorical question, \u201c[c]an the same contractor claim through its experts that juvenile detention center should be built using a different construction approach in other respects, or perhaps not build at all?

Next, the proposed regulation must be published in the Maryland Register and be accompanied by a notice that: (1) states the economic impact of the proposed regulation on State and local government revenues and expenditures and on groups that may be affected by it, and (2) sets a date, time, and place for public hearing^ For the next 30 out of the 45 days during which the regulation is published in the Maryland Register, the unit must accept public comment on the proposed regulation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is undisputed that DGS, in the instant case, failed to follow these procedures.

To, that end, the Review Commission implemented an inflation adjustment sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>tem (\u201cIAS\u201d) as a rate-setting mechanism. <em>Id. </em>at 585, 741 A.2d 483. At its inception, the IAS method was an experimental program using inflation rates and hospital-specific data, among other factors, to set hospital rates. <em>Id. </em>at 590, 741 A.2d 483. The experiment proved successful, and within one year, the Review Commission had determined that the IAS method was more efficient and effective than the full rate review procedure, and adopted the method by resolution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">After 22 years of use, the IAS method was challenged on the ground that the Review Commission violated the Maryland APA by adopting it via resolution rather than promulgating it as regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 599, 741 A.2d 483. The Court of Appeals noted, however, that the change in review methodology did not, even at its inception, represent a change in policy or standards. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 741 A.2d 483. It was merely a starting point for determining case-by-case individualized needs. <em>Id. </em>The Court indicated that this type of change in methodology is comparable to the uses of agency policies in <em>Chimes </em>and <em>Consumer Publishing, </em>where formal rulemaking was not required. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric v.

The Court found that to require the promulgation of a rule every time an agency explains the standards it uses in applying a statute \u201cwould impose a tremendous and unnecessary burden upon state agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 501 A.2d 1307. In contrast, the Court of Appeals, in <em>CBS Inc. v.

In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>case, by altering the formula used to compute the taxable income of a multi-state corporation for Maryland income tax purposes, the Comptroller created a \u201csubstantially new generally applicable policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 698, 575 A.2d 324. The Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">Unlike the agency action in <em>Consumer Protection, </em>it <em>was </em>an effective \u201cchange [in] existing law\u201d and <em>did </em>\u201cformulate rules of widespread application.\u201d Unlike the agency action in <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec, </em>it <em>was </em>\u201ca case ... in which materially modified or new standards were applied retroactively to the detriment of a company that had relied upon the [agency\u2019s] past pronouncements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In the present case, there is no dispute that this is the first DGS project involving the potential use of a PLA. The only evidence presented to MSBCA that there were any plans to use PLAs on future projects was the Secretary of State\u2019s letter, along with a handful of emails discussing the potential form and legality of PLAs. Appellants contend that the Secretary of State\u2019s letter was issued as \u201ca new statement of procurement policy\u201d indicating that the Cheltenham Project \u201cwas to be the first of multiple State construction projects intended to be awarded under the State\u2019s new ... procurement policy promoting PLAs on State construction projects.\u201d The letter plainly belies this contention, however, because in it the Secretary of State relates: \u201cwe are going to evaluate our experience with this upcoming procurement [the Cheltenham Project] and then decide how we may want to proceed on future procurements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Significantly, the Maryland Secretary of State does not create procurement policy. Maryland procurement law vests overall power and authority over procurement matters with the Board of Public Works (\u201cBPW\u201d). SFP \u00a7 12-101. The endorsement by the Secretary of State of a pilot project for the use of PLAs in large-scale construction projects, no matter how forward looking, does not constitute the promulgation of new procurement policy because the BPW has not delegated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>such authority to the Secretary of State. SFP \u00a7 12 \u2014 101(b)(4) (\u201cThe Board may delegate any of its authority that it determines to be appropriate for delegation and may require prior Board approval for specified procurement actions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Accordingly, the MSBCA concluded that this was a \u201cpilot project\u201d and \u201cis neither of general application nor future effect.\u201d We agree. The inclusion of the PLA evaluation factor was neither a regulation under SG \u00a7 10-101, nor did it herald the implementation of new procurement policy. And, unlike the case in <em>CBS Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>the specification here did not \u201capply retroactively to the detriment of a company that had relied upon the [agency\u2019s] past pronouncements.\u201d 319 Md. at 699, 575 A.2d 324. Here, the RFP was issued in accordance with all applicable procurement requirements and notice procedures, ensuring that \u201ccertain basic principles of common sense, justice and fairness,\u201d underlying the Maryland APA were met. <em>Chimes, </em>343 Md. at 338, 681 A.2d 484 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, it was through this process that the procurement officer issued two separate addenda modifying and clarifying the RFP to address Protestors\u2019 concerns. A requirement that agencies must amend their regulations each time they introduce a new or novel specification would not only constitute an unnecessary and costly burden on the State at the expense of efficient government, it would no doubt have a chilling effect on the State\u2019s ability to take advantage of innovative technologies and services that could greatly benefit the citizens of the State. In the interest of effective administrative process, agencies should retain reasonable power to deal with issues on a case-to-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">We note that the Board\u2019s final ruling, however, contained an element of caution with respect to the rulemaking process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6b\">While it certainly is conceivable that a long term imposition of new procurement policy favoring PLAs could give rise to the necessity of adoption of regulations establishing such a policy through formal rulemaking process, the State\u2019s simple reservation of the right to consider certain factors in a single given set of procurement specifications is not tanta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>mount to such enormity of policy change as to necessitate promulgation of new administrative regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><em>Balfour Beatty, supra, </em>MSBCA No. 2803 at 10. Should the BPW determine to adopt a PLA policy with widespread application and future effect, or a de facto policy change is evidenced by the ubiquitous inclusion of PLAs in RFPs, then promulgation through rulemaking may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The PLA Specification Does Not Unduly Restrict Competition</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Appellants contend the PLA technical evaluation factor restricted competition and unlawfully discriminated against Maryland\u2019s non-union construction contractors. They maintain that in order for the more restrictive specification to be upheld by the Board, the State was required to produce substantial evidence that the specification was reasonably related to the needs of the agency. Appellants claim the MSBCA and the circuit court erred by excessively deferring to DGS\u2019s justification for the PLA specification, and by failing to require the State to present factual evidence to support its justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Our role in reviewing MSBCA decisions is generally narrow and \u201climited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assur. v.

Executive Order 01.01.2013.05 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">Maryland has a compelling interest in taking steps to ensure the timely, safe, and economical completion of public works projects and public-private partnerships, including steps to guarantee a reliable and secure supply of properly skilled labor personnel through the promotion of apprenticeship programs, and in some cases, project labor agreements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">Maryland also has a compelling interest in considering the impact on the development of critical job skills needed in construction, and the overall economic benefits to the State of Maryland and its economy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">Under existing law, state agencies are encouraged to maximize the benefits of state purchasing to the Maryland economy by considering, among other things, the number of jobs expected to be generated for Maryland residents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Several of Maryland\u2019s local governments have also addressed the use of PLAs in procurement contracts. Instructive here is the Prince George\u2019s County Council\u2019s adoption of CB-16-2011 and CB-39-2013 authorizing county agencies to include a clause that requires the execution and use of a PLA in invitations for bids and requests for proposals issued for construction projects that have an estimated dollar value of $1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>million or more. Prince George\u2019s County Code \u00a7\u00a7 10A-157, 10A-158. The sponsoring bill, dated October 18, 2011, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1D\">The County Council finds that Project Labor Agreements provide a reliable means for ensuring that construction projects will be adequately staffed with sufficient numbers of highly skilled and properly trained craft personnel and, therefore, such agreements promote the efficient, economical and safe completion of such contracts, and that for this reason alone, the county has sufficient compelling interest in allowing the use of Project Labor Agreements for construction projects to protect its investments and proprietary interests in such projects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">CB-16-2011 p. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The potential benefits of PLAs cited by each of these executive officials are the very same benefits articulated by DGS in support of the inclusion of the PLA specification here. Before the MSBCA, DGS presented the affidavit of Assistant Secretary for DGS Bart Thomas, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aed\">The use of a PLA was chosen as an evaluation factor because it gives owners and building contractors a unique opportunity to anticipate and avoid potential problems that might arise and possibly impede progress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">sis * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">The use of a PLA will provide a dedicated, trained, and professional work force and provide a boost to the local economy through using the local (union and non-union) work force hired through local union hiring halls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">The use of a PLA will maximize project stability, efficiency and productivity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The MSBCA also reviewed the affidavit of Protestors\u2019 expert, Anirban Basu, which provides that PLAs are ineffective and cost-inefficient. Mr. Basu\u2019s affidavit also asserts that PLAs are anti-competitive when employed in state projects in which the majority of workers in the state are not union members, and that surveys have indicated that \u201cmore than 70 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>percent of surveyed construction contractors in Maryland ... were less likely to bid on a PLA-covered public project.\u201d The Board acknowledged that while divergent sets of conclusions seem to exist regarding the utility of PLAs, in the face of evenly weighted but diametrically opposed affidavits, the Board would defer to the determination made by DGS. The Board noted that whether Mr. Thomas\u2019 opinion is correct or not, the State deliberately reached and holds that opinion. <em>See Siems Rental &amp; Sales Co., Inc., supra, </em>\u00b6 288, at 3-4 (\u201cWhere there is a difference of expert technical opinion, we will accept the technical judgment of the procuring agency unless clearly erroneous.\u201d (quoting <em>Adden Furniture, Inc., supra, </em>at 4)); <em>see also Schwartz, </em>385 Md. at 554, 870 A.2d 168 (\u201c[N]ot only is it the province of the agency to resolve conflicting evidence, but where inconsistent inferences from the same evidence can be drawn, it is for the agency to draw the inferences.\u201d (quoting <em>Gigeous v. E. Corr. Inst., </em>363 Md. 481, 504, 769 A.2d 912 (2001))).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The MSBCA considered a number of other points in assessing the restrictive effect of the PLA specification in addition to the affidavits. It found that (1) the presence of a PLA is the sixth of seven ranked evaluation factors; (2) the inclusion of a PLA was not mandatory; (3) there were seven proposals received in response to the RFP; and (4) DGS decided to use the Cheltenham Project PLA specification as a pilot project to evaluate whether such a specification was indeed advantageous to the State. There was significant evidence to support the State\u2019s determination that the Cheltenham Project would meet a critical need for the community, including the 2012 evaluation of the facility and evidence that the complexity and importance of the Project would benefit from the organization and guarantees provided by a PLA. Indeed, the record indicates that DGS spent a considerable amount of time evaluating PLAs and consulting with various businesses and agencies regarding their efficacy. Moreover, Mr. Basu\u2019s prediction that inclusion of the PLA as an evaluation factor would unduly restrict competition was not borne out by the facts here where DGS received seven proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Appellants attempt to rely on <em>Siems Rental &amp; Sales Co., Inc. </em>to assert that DGS is required to come forward with evidence in the form of \u201cverifiable facts\u201d indicating that the PLA specification is necessary to meet the State\u2019s needs and advance the government\u2019s legitimate interest. While <em>Siems </em>does provide that \u201cin the face of protest, <em>some reasonable facts </em>upon which the opinion that the specifications meet the State\u2019s minimum needs must be shown,\u201d neither the MSBCA nor the Maryland Courts have utilized the strict verifiable facts standard as proposed by the Appellants. <em>Siems Rental &amp; Sales Co., Inc., </em>at 4 (emphasis added). Rather, where the State has met its minimal <em>prima facie </em>burden, the burden shifts to the Appellants to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the restriction is unreasonable. <em>Xerox Corp., supra, </em>at 6; <em>Alco Power, </em>B207252.2, 82-2 Comp. Gen. Proc. Dec. \u00b6 433 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">In this matter, DGS, as the procuring agency, met its burden of producing reasonable facts upon which the MSBCA could conclude that the inclusion of the PLA evaluation factor was not unreasonably restrictive and did advance the legitimate interests of the State. With that initial burden met, it was then the burden of Protestors to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the restriction is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>The MSBCA determined that Protestors failed to do so, and we agree. As the MSBCA observed \u201cevery procurement spec [sic] may be fairly deemed to impose upon offerors some level of restriction.\u201d <em>Balfour Beatty Constr. et al., supra, </em>at 4. Therefore, the MSBCA must determine (1) the degree of that restriction and (2) whether such restriction is reasonable. Even if the evidence adduced left the matter in equipoise, the MSBCA was correct to defer to the judgment of the procuring agency as to the legitimate needs of the State. <em>Siems Rental &amp; Sales Co., Inc., </em>at 3 (citing <em>Alco Power, </em>\u00b6 433).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Because we find that the one-time inclusion of a PLA evaluation factor in a single RFP did not constitute a new regulation mandating predicate rulemaking under the Maryland APA, and that the MSBCA was presented with sufficient evidence upon which it based its decision, it follows that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>judgment of the MSBCA was proper.
