The Maryland State Board of Education has taken the position that, because the power to appoint and terminate nonprofessional personnel is committed to the county superintendent of schools, the arbitration provision which appellee Board of Education of Howard County agreed to include in its collective bargaining agreement was illegal and nonbinding. The Circuit Court for Howard County accepted the State Board of Education\u2019s interpretation of the law on this point, and enjoined the labor representative\u2019s efforts to compel arbitration of a school nurse\u2019s discharge. But the Maryland Public School Labor Relations Board takes a contrary view of the law, and has taken the position that the provision in the Howard County collective bargaining agreement providing for binding arbitration of disputes regarding the discharge for cause of nonprofessional employees is legally enforceable. In an amicus brief, the Maryland Attorney General agrees with the labor relations board. And so do we. Accordingly, we shall rule in favor of the appellant, Howard County Education Association-ESP, Inc., and reverse the judgments of the Circuit Court for Howard County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The incident that precipitated the dispute between two State agencies was the discharge of a school nurse who was an employee of the Board of Education of Howard County, appellee. Because this employee was covered by a collective bargaining agreement that provided \u201c[n]o employee will be discharged without cause,\u201d her labor representative \u2014 Howard County Education Association-ESP, Inc., appellant \u2014 filed a grievance asserting that there was insufficient cause to impose the ultimate disciplinary sanction of discharge. The county board of education rejected the employee\u2019s grievance, and advised the employee\u2019s labor representative that, despite the fact that the collective bargaining agreement had provided for such issues to be subject to the grievance process, the discharge of a non-certificated employee such as the school nurse \u201cis an illegal subject of bargaining and thus not grievable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AMG\">Relying upon another provision in the collective bargaining agreement, the employee\u2019s labor representative then filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association. Rather than submit to arbitration, the Board of Education of Howard County filed suit against the Howard County Education Association-ESP, Inc., in the Circuit Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Howard County to enjoin the arbitration. The county school board alleged that, notwithstanding any provision in the applicable collective bargaining agreement, \u201c[b]y statute and case law, a county Superintendent of Schools has the sole authority to dismiss a non-certificated employee,\u201d and therefore, the arbitration provision \u201cthat affects the merits of the Superintendent\u2019s discussion to terminate a non-certificated employee is contrary to law and invalid.\u201d The circuit court issued a preliminary injunction providing that the arbitration was stayed. But the preliminary injunction further provided that it would expire in ten days \u201cunless one or both of the parties file a request with the Maryland State Board of Education or the Public School Labor Relations Board for statutory interpretation. ...\u201d The Board of Education of Howard County asked the Maryland State Board of Education for a declaration of interpretation, and the Howard County Education Association-ESP, Inc., similarly asked the Maryland Public School Labor Relations Board for its statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The Maryland State Board of Education issued an opinion pursuant to its power under Maryland Code (1978, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2011 Supp.), Education Article (\u201cEduc.\u201d), \u00a7 2-205(e)(1), which authorizes the agency to \u201cexplain the true intent and meaning of the provisions of [the Education Article].\u201d The opinion recognized that the nurse had filed a grievance challenging her termination pursuant to Article 4.1 of the collective bargaining agreement, which provided in part: \u201cNo employee will be discharged without cause.\u201d The opinion also noted that the collective bargaining agreement provided that an employee who was not satisfied with the county board\u2019s ruling on a grievance could submit the dispute \u201cto arbitration under the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association,\u201d and the agreement provided that \u201c[t]he arbitrator\u2019s decision shall be final and binding on all parties.\u201d The opinion also recognized that the Maryland Public School Labor Relations Board had also been asked to issue an opinion regarding this same controversy, and it had ruled that \u201cdiscipline and discharge is a mandatory subject of bargaining and that the grievance involved here is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u2018subject to arbitration.\u2019 \u201d Notwithstanding the authority of the labor relations agency to decide whether a \u201cproposed topic for negotiation is a mandatory, a permissive, or an illegal topic of [collective] bargaining,\u201d the State Board of Education asserted: \u201c[W]e retain jurisdiction to explain the true intent and meaning of all other sections of the Education Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The State Board of Education\u2019s opinion initially interpreted the arbitration provision in the collective bargaining agreement as being voluntary rather than mandatory because the provision states that \u201cthe grievance may be submitted to arbitration.\u201d If this interpretation was correct, and the superintendent retained the option to voluntarily submit a dispute to arbitration, the opinion stated, the non-delegable duty of the superintendent would not be impinged. But, because \u201cthe true intent and meaning of [Educ.] \u00a7 6-201 is that the power to hire and fire is non-delegable,\u201d the opinion expressed the following conclusion: \u201cIf the superintendent\u2019s decision to terminate is subject to mandatory binding arbitration, it is our view that that would violate [Educ.] \u00a7 6-201.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In followup correspondence with counsel for the local board of education, after counsel for the Board of Education of Howard County pointed out that the nurse\u2019s collective bargaining agreement in fact \u201cprovides for mandatory binding arbitration of an employee grievance,\u201d the State Board of Education confirmed that it would consider \u201csuch a provision to violate \u00a7 6-201(c) of the Education Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In the meantime, the Maryland Public School Labor Relations Board considered the same dispute pursuant to its authority under Educ. \u00a7 2-205(e)(4) to \u201cdecide any controversy or dispute arising under Title 6, Subtitle ... 5 of [the Education Article],\u201d and its authority under Educ. \u00a7 6-510(c)(5)(i) to decide the \u201cfinal resolution\u201d of any dispute between a \u201cpublic school employer and an employee organization\u201d as to \u201cwhether a proposed topic for negotiation is ... an illegal topic of bargaining.\u201d It is the opinion of this agency that Educ. \u00a7 6 \u2014 510(c)(5)(i) \u201cexpressly charges the PSLRB with responsibility for resolving the type of negotiability dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>pute that is presented in this case.\u201d The labor relations board observed: \u201c[T]he State Board [of Education\u2019s] interpretation of Section 6201(c)(1) may (or may not) have some bearing on whether Section 4.1 of the [collective bargaining] Master Agreement deals with a mandatory or an illegal subject of bargaining, but under the express language of Section 6-510(c)(5)(i), the authority to resolve that question resides with the PSLRB.\u201d The answer to that question, the labor relations board concluded, was self-evident from the express language of Educ. \u00a7 6 \u2014 510(c)(1), which requires a public school employer to negotiate with the employees\u2019 labor representative \u201con all matters that relate to ... working conditions, including the discipline and discharge of an employee for just cause.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Although the labor relations board considered the language clear enough to be dispositive, it also considered the legislative history of the statutory provisions to be supportive of its interpretation. In its written opinion, it provided the following detailed explanation for its conclusion that the dispute regarding the discharge of the school nurse was properly covered by the collective bargaining agreement and properly subject to binding arbitration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">For many years prior to the 1990s, Maryland\u2019s collective bargaining statute provided only for mandatory subjects of bargaining, defined as \u201call matters related to salaries, wages, hours, and other working conditions.\u201d At that time, both the State Board and the courts permitted boards of education and exclusive representatives to negotiate a just cause standard for discipline and discharge, and to arbitrate such disputes. In 1994, however, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Livers v. Board of Educ. of Charles County, </em>101 Md.App. 160 [643 A.2d 523] (1994), deferred to the interpretation of the State Board of Education, which held that \u201cthe remedies or means by which a non-certificated employee may challenge a discipline or discharge decision are non-negotiable matters of educational policy,\u201d and therefore an illegal subject of bargaining. <em>Id. </em>at 409 [643 A.2d 523]. While many agreements, including those be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>tween HCEA-ESP and the County Board, continued to include language regarding just cause for discipline and discharge, such language was no longer enforceable, and disputes were subjected to the administrative appeal process in [Education Article] Section 4-205.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">In 2002, the General Assembly made significant changes to the collective bargaining statute [in the Education Article] by creating mandatory, permissive, and illegal subjects of bargaining. At that time, Section 6 \u2014 510(b) was amended to read as follows (added language in Section 510(b)(2) in italics):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">(b) <em>Representatives to negotiate. </em>\u2014 (1) On request, a public school employer or at least two of its designated representatives shall meet and negotiate with at least two representatives of the employee organization that is designated as the exclusive negotiating agent for the public school employees in a unit of the county on all matters that relate to salaries, wages, hours, and other working conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, a public school employer or at least two of its designated representatives may negotiate with at least two representatives of the employee organization that is designated as the exclusive negotiating agent for the public school employees in a unit of the county on other matters, <em>including due process for discipline and discharge, </em>that are mutually agreed to by the employer and the employee organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">(3) A public school employer may not negotiate the school calendar, the maximum number of students assigned to a class, or any other matter that is precluded by applicable law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">(2008 RepLVol.). Thus, \u201cdue process for discipline and discharge\u201d was made a permissive subject of bargaining, but there was no reference to any substantive standard that a public school employer was required to meet in order to discipline or discharge a non-certificated employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>It was under that statutory framework that the State Board, in 2005, decided the case of <em>Harford County Board of Education v. Harford County Educational Services Council, </em>MSBE Opinion No. 05-24, which the County Board relies on so heavily in the July 8, 2012, Memorandum that it filed with the PSLRB in this case. In the <em>Harford County Board of Education </em>case, the State Board concluded that the phrase \u201cdue process for discipline and discharge\u201d as used in Section 6 \u2014 510(b)(2) encompassed only the procedural aspects of due process. <em>Id. </em>at 7. In reaching this conclusion, the State Board opined that a superintendent had the exclusive authority to appoint non-certificated personnel pursuant to Section 6-201(c)(l), and the power to remove should be incident to the power to appoint. Based upon that interpretation, the State Board held that \u201cthe \u2018due process\u2019 reference in Section 6-510(b)(2) does not encompass substantive due process concerns. Rather, we find it specifically refers to the procedural aspects of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">In 2009, exclusive representatives of non-certificated employees approached the General Assembly in an effort to overturn the State Board\u2019s decision in the <em>Harford County Board of Education </em>case. That effort was successful. Senate Bill 569 amended Section 6-510(b) as follows (added language in Section 6-510(b)(1) in italics; deleted language in Section 6510(b)(2) in brackets):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">(b)(1) On request, a public school employer or at least two of its designated representatives shall meet and negotiate with at least two representatives of the employee organization that is designated as the exclusive negotiating agent for the public school employees in a unit of the county on all matters that relate to salaries, wages, hours, and other working conditions, including the <em>discipline and discharge of an employee for just cause.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, a public school employer or at least two of its designated representatives may negotiate with at least two representatives of the employee organization that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>designated as the exclusive negotiating agent for the public school employees in a unit of the county on other matters [including due process for discipline and discharge,] that are mutually agreed to by the employer and the employee organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">In short, the State Board\u2019s decision in the <em>Harford County Board of Education </em>case was overturned by statute: the 2009 amendments limited a superintendent\u2019s authority to discipline and discharge non-certificated employees by making both the procedural and substantive aspects of the due process mandatory subjects of bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The testimony of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education (\u201cMABE\u201d) recognized the implication of these amendments in the written testimony that it submitted to the Senate Finance Committee on March 5, 2009, in opposition to Senate Bill 569. MABE, speaking on behalf of \u201call of the state\u2019s boards of education,\u201d noted that Senate Bill 569 would:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">limit the superintendent\u2019s discretion to discipline or discharge support staff. MABE strongly opposes the mandated negotiation of the subjects of discipline and discharge of non-certificated staff. And yet again, this bill goes further. Senate Bill 569 would impose the standard of employee rights under disciplinary or termination actions to be \u201cjust cause.\u201d MABE has consistently opposed legislation proposing this standard of review for superintendent decisions regarding non-tenured, non-teaching staff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">[ ] If there was nothing more involved, our analysis could begin \u2014 and end \u2014 with Section 6-510(c)(l). But the County Board asserts that there is \u201cmore involved\u201d \u2014 citing section 6 \u2014 510(c)(3), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">A public school employer may not negotiate the school calendar, the maximum number of students assigned to a class, <em>or any matter that is precluded by applicable statutory law. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>In its July 2, 2012, submission to the PSLRB, the County Board contends that \u2014 notwithstanding the 2009 amendments \u2014 the State Board\u2019s 2005 interpretation of Section 6-201(c)(1) in the <em>Harford County Board of Education </em>case\u2014 <em>ie., </em>that the statutory authority of the county superintendent to \u201cappoint clerical and other nonprofessional personnel\u201d includes the power to remove such personnel \u2014 is \u201capplicable statutory law\u201d that precludes the negotiation of a just cause standard for discharge. Accordingly, the County Board argues, Section 4.1 of the Master Agreement is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">We need not for present purposes debate the merit of the State Board\u2019s interpretation of Section 6-201(c)(l). We acknowledge that the State Board has the authority to interpret the provisions of the Education Article other than those in Title 6, Subtitles 4 and 5. But the operative <em>provision </em>\u2014 ie., \u201cany matter that is precluded by applicable statutory law\u201d \u2014 appears in Title 6, Subtitle 5, and, as the County Board concedes, it is the PSLRB that has the authority to interpret the provisions of that Subtitle. This means that the PSLRB has jurisdiction to determine what does and does not constitute \u201capplicable statutory law.\u201d We conclude that the State Board\u2019s interpretation of Section 6-201(c)(1) does <em>not </em>constitute \u201capplicable statutory law\u201d precluding the negotiation of \u201cthe discipline and discharge of an employee for just cause.\u201d The \u201capplicable statutory law\u201d for purposes of this negotiability dispute is Section 6-510(c)(1), and the clear and unambiguous language of that Section provides that \u201cthe discipline and discharge of an employee for just cause\u201d is a mandatory subject of bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">[ ] <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The PSLRB concludes that the topic of \u201cdiscipline and discharge of an employee for just cause\u201d is a mandatory subject of bargaining. In the context of this case, that means that Article 4.1 of the Master Agreement is enforceable, and the grievance involving that provision is subject to arbitration under Section 2.2 of the Master Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>After the conflicting opinions were issued by the two State agencies, appellant and appellee each petitioned for judicial review, and each asked the circuit court to issue an order to enforce the opinion that was in its favor and grant appropriate injunctive relief. The circuit court found the board of education\u2019s arguments more persuasive, and entered orders affirming the interpretive ruling of the Maryland State Board of Education, reversing the interpretive ruling of the Maryland Public School Labor Relations Board, and permanently enjoining the arbitration requested by appellant on behalf of the discharged nurse. The employee\u2019s labor representative appealed the circuit court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The two State agencies that issued conflicting rulings in this case share the distinctive characteristic of being granted broad statutory power to interpret statutes within their sphere of administration. In <em>Bd. of Ed. for Dorchester Co. v. Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 790-91, 506 A.2d 625 (1986), the Court of Appeals commented on the power of the State Board of Education, stating: \u201cWhile administrative agencies generally may interpret statutes, as well as rule upon other legal issues, and while an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute which it administers is entitled to weight, the paramount role of the State Board of Education in interpreting the public education law sets it apart from most administrative agencies.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) The <em>Hubbard </em>Court further noted, <em>id. </em>at 788, 506 A.2d 625:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">The State Board\u2019s broad authority specifically includes the power to interpret the provisions of the Education Article. Section 2-205(e) provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">\u201c... [T]he State Board shall explain the true intent and meaning of the provisions of ... [the Education Article] ... within its jurisdiction ... [and] shall decide all controversies and disputes under these provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">But the Court of Appeals has also recognized that there is a limit to the judicial deference that will be granted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the State Board of Education\u2019s statutory interpretation. \u201cIf the State Board\u2019s interpretation or application of [the statute at issue], in a particular situation, would clearly be contrary to the statute\u2019s plain meaning, a reviewing court must reject that interpretation.\u201d <em>Montgomery Co. Ed. Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Educ., </em>311 Md. 303, 309, 534 A.2d 980 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">When the General Assembly created the Maryland Public School Labor Relations Board in 2010, it transferred a portion of the authority to interpret the Education Article from the State Board of Education to the newly created labor relations board. As part of that reassignment of authority, Educ. \u00a7 2-205(e)(4) was added. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">(i) The Public School Labor Relations Board shall decide any controversy or dispute arising under Title 6, Subtitle 4 or Subtitle 5 of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">(ii) A decision of the Public School Labor Relations Board is final.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The General Assembly also provided, in Educ. \u00a7 6-510(c)(5)(i): \u201cIf a public school employer and an employee organization dispute whether a proposed topic for negotiation is a mandatory, a permissive, or an illegal topic of bargaining, either party may submit a request for a decision in writing to the [Public School Labor Relations] Board for final resolution of the dispute.\u201d Further, Educ. \u00a7 6-807(a)(2) provides that, with respect to \u201cmatters covered under the provisions of Subtitles 4 and 5 of [Title 6],\u201d the Public School Labor Relations Board \u201c[s]hall decide controversies and disputes.\u201d The General Assembly also adopted a provision to make it clear that prior rulings of the State Board of Education were not binding on the labor relations board. Educ. \u00a7 6-807(d) states: \u201cA prior order, action, or opinion issued by the State Board before the enactment of this section may be considered as precedent in matters arising after the enactment of this section, but it is not binding on the [Public School Labor Relations] Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Although it seems plain to us that the present dispute turns on the question of whether a collective bargaining agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>could properly provide for arbitration of an employee\u2019s discharge, which is clearly a matter committed to the authority of the Public School Labor Relations Board to decide, the Board of Education for Howard County argues that the resolution of that question necessarily implicates the power of a superintendent to discharge an employee, and is therefore controlled by the State Board of Education\u2019s unwavering opinion that the superintendent\u2019s power to hire and fire nonprofessional personnel, pursuant to Educ. \u00a7 6 \u2014 201(c)(1), overrides and invalidates any collective bargaining agreement to the contrary. We are not persuaded by the State Board\u2019s opinion on this issue. The General Assembly created the Public School Labor Relations Board for the express purpose of deciding such issues relative to the permissible scope of collective bargaining agreements. In our view, the plain language of the statutes enacted in 2009 and 2010 provides that agreements regarding the discharge of employees may be included in collective bargaining agreements, and if any doubt about that remained, the Public School Labor Relations Board was empowered to make the final decision regarding that topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">In the Attorney General\u2019s amicus brief filed in this Court, the Attorney General described in detail the legislative history that led to the establishment of the Public School Labor Relations Board. Like the Attorney General, we are persuaded that the legislative history behind the statutes which created the labor relations board supports our reading of the statutes, and reflects a clear intent on the part of the General Assembly to have that agency, rather than the State Board of Education, be the final arbiter on any disagreement regarding the topics that can be covered in collective bargaining negotiations and agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The State Board of Education\u2019s position of steadfastly refusing to recognize arbitration of disputes regarding the discharge of employees dates back to at least the early 1990s, when this Court addressed such a controversy in <em>Livers v. Board of Education, </em>101 Md.App. 160, 643 A.2d 523 (1994). In May 1991, George Livers, a school custodian in Charles County, was arrested on drug charges. He was suspended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>without pay by the Charles County Board of Education pending the disposition of the charges. On June 11, 1991, the State <em>nolle prossed </em>Livers\u2019s drug charges. One week later, the Charles County Board of Education fired him for misconduct. Livers, a non-certificated employee, attempted to contest his firing by filing a grievance pursuant to the master agreement between his union and the Charles County Board of Education. The grievance proceeded through various phases, and eventually, the superintendent of the Charles County Board of Education affirmed Livers\u2019s dismissal. Livers and his union representative then sought to arbitrate the matter. The Charles County Board of Education refused to participate in arbitration, and filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and stay of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The arbitration was stayed, by consent, \u201cuntil the State Board rendered a declaratory ruling as to the arbitrability of Livers\u2019s grievance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163-64, 643 A.2d 523. The dispute was heard by an administrative law judge, who sided with Livers and recommended that the Charles County Board of Education be required to participate in arbitration. But the State Board of Education rejected the ALJ\u2019s recommendation, and ruled \u201cthat \u2018a public school employer may not bargain over the remedies or means by which a non-certificated employee may challenge a discipline or discharge decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 643 A.2d 523. Livers filed a petition for judicial review of the State Board\u2019s decision. After the Circuit Court for Charles County affirmed the State Board, Livers appealed to this Court. We began our analysis in <em>Livers </em>by noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">[Education Article] \u00a7 6-510(b) defines the scope of bargaining between public school employers and unions as to non-certificated employees:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">On request, a public school employer or at least two of its designated representatives shall meet and negotiate with at least two representatives of the employee organization that is designated as the exclusive negotiating agent for the public school employees in a unit of the county on all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>matters that relate to salaries, wages, hours, and other working conditions.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 164, 643 A.2d 523 (emphasis in Livers).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Citing <em>Montgomery Co.

Bd. of Educ., supra, </em>311 Md. at 318, 534 A.2d 980, we observed that the Court of Appeals had held that \u201cthe State Board retains authority to determine matters of educational policy and that, as a consequence, such matters are not proper for negotiation between local school boards and union representatives.\u201d <em>Livers, </em>101 Md.App. at 164, 643 A.2d 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Although Livers argued that the only way for him to get a fair hearing on a discipline or discharge decision \u201cis through the grievance process and ultimately through arbitration,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 166, 643 A.2d 523, the State Board had ruled that those topics were \u201cnon-negotiable matters of educational policy within the exclusive province of the local school system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We emphasized our deference to the State Board\u2019s decisions relative to education policy issues, and upheld the State Board\u2019s ruling pursuant to \u201cthis heightened deferential standard of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168, 643 A.2d 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">We observed that \u201cit is the State Board\u2019s task to determine a proper subject of negotiation, by balancing matters of educational policy against those of interest to school board employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 643 A.2d 523. We held that the \u201cState Board did not act arbitrarily in concluding that the procedures by which a non-certificated employee may grieve his or her dismissal is not subject to collective bargaining!/]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169, 643 A.2d 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">In 1999 and 2000, legislation was introduced in the General Assembly that \u201cwould have required the discipline and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>charge of noncertificated employees to be negotiated under collective bargaining.\u201d The 1999 bill (HB 701) did not make it out of committee in the House of Delegates, and the 2000 bill (HB 451) passed in the House, but died in the Senate.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">In the 2002 legislative session, Senate Bill 233 was introduced as an Administration Bill proposed by the Governor\u2019s office. According to its Fiscal Note,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">This Administration bill authorizes local boards of education and local school employee organizations representing certificated and noncertificated school personnel to negotiate over mutually agreeable matters other than salaries, wages, hours, and working conditions. Local boards, however, may not negotiate the school calendar, class sizes, or matters precluded by law. If either party declines to negotiate a permissive item, it cannot be subject to an impasse. The bill extends collective bargaining rights to noncertificated school employees who work for school systems on the Eastern Shore. The discipline and discharge of noncertificated employees for just cause is also added to the subjects that may be bargained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In an explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill, the Administration wrote that one of the provisions of the bill would safeguard \u201cdue process for education support personnel employees in suspension and termination cases\u201d because the bill \u201cgrants education support personnel employees the right to negotiate for due process protections when they are disciplined or discharged. This long-standing right that was struck down by the courts will be re-instituted.\u201d The memorandum further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">... Senate Bill 233 places \u201cdiscipline and discharge\u201d in the mandatory category of bargaining for education support personnel. Unlike teachers, there are no established procedures in State law governing the discipline and discharge of Education] S[upport] Personnel] employees. Such procedures traditionally were included in contract negotiations until 1992 when the State Board of Education ruled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>practice illegal [in <em>Livers v. Board of Education of Charles County, </em>6 Op. MSBE 407 (1992) ]. While State law provides basic appeal rights, there are currently no due process rights for ESP employees who may be wrongfully terminated. This legislation will require local school boards to negotiate discipline and discharge in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Testimony in opposition to SB 233 was presented to the Senate Finance Committee on behalf of the Dorchester County Board of Education, which took \u201cno position\u201d on those portions of SB 233 that would extend collective bargaining rights to non-certificated school personnel on the Eastern Shore, but opposed the balance of the bill. That local board\u2019s testimony on the proposed extension of due process rights in discipline cases to non-certificated personnel was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag7\">Contrary to what you may have been told, support personnel have fair due process rights for discipline and dismissal. These include the right to notice of discipline charges filed against them, the right to respond to such charges, the right to challenge a disciplinary action by appealing to the superintendent, local school board, the State Board of Education, and even the courts, with the right to be represented throughout the appeal. What the support personnel currently do not have, and, is a part of this bill, is the right, through the collective bargaining process, to take the appeal to an outside arbitrator. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding and final. The arbitrator would focus upon the employer/employee relationship, with no connection to or interest in the students or educational setting. The State Board, however, has historically placed great emphasis on the interest of the students when considering appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">The test case for the right of support personnel to have binding arbitration for discipline and dismissal, the Livers case, involved the dismissal of a Charles County employee. His dismissal was upheld throughout all the due process stages, including MSTA\u2019s [the Maryland State Teachers Association\u2019s] appeal, on his behalf, that his case should have been decided by an arbitrator under collective bargaining. The appellate court did not support the MSTA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>position. This bill is to legislatively overturn that decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Also testifying in opposition was the Maryland Association of Boards of Education, \u201crepresenting all the State\u2019s local boards of education[.]\u201d In pertinent part, the Maryland Association of Boards of Education testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">Another component of the proposed legislation also is troubling. It would require the negotiation of discipline and discharge of noncertificated employees for just cause. Currently, the discipline and discharge of noncertificated personnel is not a legal subject of collective bargaining. The issue was decided in the case of <em>Livers v. Charles County Board of Education </em>in the early 1990s, in which the State Board, and then the appellate courts, upheld the dismissal of Mr. Livers, a school custodian who had been arrested for drug offenses. The union demanded that the dismissal be taken to binding arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement. The State Board and courts ruled that the dismissal was not a legally negotiable topic, and thus the dismissal was not subject to arbitration. MSTA has continually tried to get this ruling reversed through legislation, but the General Assembly has never passed what is commonly referred to as the \u201cLivers\u201d bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">First, the assertion that due process rights should be provided to noncertificated personnel is not a justification for this legislative proposal. All categories of public employees are provided due process by law. In fact, in every school system in Maryland, every public school employee has due process rights that include being notified of any disciplinary charges against him or her, having the right to respond to those charges, and being able to challenge a disciplinary decision by appealing the decision to the superintendent, school board, State Board, and even the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">Second, the standard of \u201cjust cause\u201d applied to this discipline and discharge provision would essentially grant tenure to all support personnel and would impede prompt superin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tendent and board actions to remove employees from the school setting to ensure the safety and welfare of students. Thus, the General Assembly has always rejected the \u201cLivers\u201d proposal in order to preserve board and superintendent authority to ensure student safety and determine appropriate discipline of noncertificated employees in their school systems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Testimony in opposition to SB 233 was also provided by the Harford County Public Schools, which also specifically referred to the <em>Livers </em>case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">Another concern is the \u201cLivers\u201d provision in the bill that would require the discipline and discharge of non-eertificated employees to be negotiated. The contention that certain public employees have no due process is not true. In fact, every public school employee has due process rights that include being notified of any disciplinary charges against them; having the right to respond to those charges; and the right to appeal to the superintendent, the local and state school boards, as well as the court system. The \u201cLivers\u201d provision would diminish the authority of the Superintendent and Board to determine appropriate discipline of non-certificated employees in the Harford County Public School System. Present law allows employees to appeal disciplinary actions through the administrative appeals process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Ultimately, despite opposition such as the above quoted excerpts, SB 233 passed the General Assembly in 2002 and was signed into law by the Governor. It was codified as (now-former) Educ. \u00a7 6-510(b). Prior to 2002, Educ. \u00a7 6-510(b) contained no subparts; it had provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">(b) On request, a public school employer or at least two of its designated representatives shall meet and negotiate with at least two representatives of the employee organization that is designated as the exclusive negotiating agent for the public school employees in a unit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>county on all matters that relate to salaries, wages, hours, and other working conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Educ. \u00a7 6-510(b) (1978 RepLVol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Effective October 1, 2002, Educ. \u00a7 6-510(b) was revised to include three subparts. Section 6-510(b)(l) was identical to the previous version of \u00a7 6-510(b) quoted above. Added to the statute were subparts (2)-(4), which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">[ (b) ] (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, a public school employer or at least two of its designated representatives may negotiate with at least two representatives of the employee organization that is designated as the exclusive negotiating agent for the public school employees in a unit of the county on other matters, including due process for discipline and discharge, that are mutually agreed to by the employer and the employee organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">(3) A public school employer may not negotiate the school calendar, the maximum number of students assigned to a class, or any matter that is precluded by applicable statutory law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">(4) A matter that is not subject to negotiation under paragraph (2) of this subsection because it has not been mutually agreed to by the employer and the employee organization may not be raised in any action taken to resolve an impasse under subsection (d) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Consequently, as of October 1, 2002, \u201cdue process for discipline and discharge\u201d was a legally permitted topic for negotiation. Educ. \u00a7 6-510(b) (2003 Supp., 2004 Repl.Vol.). But, despite this change in the law, the State Board refused to alter its position that a superintendent\u2019s power of appointment implied a nondelegable power of termination which could not be modified by a contrary provision in a collective bargaining agreement. In <em>Harford, County Board of Education v. Harford County Educational Services Council, </em>MSBE Op. No. 05-24, an opinion issued in 2005, the State Board decided that the Harford County Board of Education did not have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>negotiate certain \u201cjust cause\u201d language proposed by the union, because, the State Board of Education concluded, \u201cnegotiation of the causes for the imposition of discipline or for discharge of noncertificated employees is precluded by applicable statutory law, \u00a7 6-201 of the Education Article.\u201d The State Board\u2019s opinion in <em>Harford County </em>cited <em>Livers, </em>and took note of the specific statutory changes made since <em>Livers </em>\u2014 particularly the amendments to \u00a7 6 \u2014 510(b) made in 2002 \u2014 but rejected the union\u2019s argument that the State Board should change its position. Instead, the State Board accepted the local board\u2019s argument that the \u201cdue process for discipline and discharge\u201d language found in Educ. \u00a7 6-510(b)(2) referred only to procedural, not substantive, due process. In the end, the State Board relied upon its authority to \u201cexplain the true intent and meaning of the provisions of [the Education Article],\u201d and simply ruled that \u00a7 6-201\u2019s general language trumped the legislative changes made to \u00a7 6 \u2014 510(b) in response to <em>Livers. </em>The State Board reasserted its opinion that \u201cgrounds for discipline or discharge are an illegal subject of bargaining precluded by \u00a7 6 \u2014 201(c) of the Education Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">But in 2009, the General Assembly again amended \u00a7 6-510. HB 792 and SB 569 were signed into law on May 7, 2009, and became effective on October 1, 2009. These bills added language to \u00a7 6 \u2014 510(b)(1) that made the discipline and discharge of an employee for just cause a mandatory subject of bargaining. <em>Cf. </em>6-510(b)(2) (listing subjects that could be negotiated if there was mutual agreement to do so). The legislature specified that the purpose of this change was to \u201cinclud[e] the discipline and discharge of an employee for just cause among the matters a public school employer must meet and negotiate with a certain employee organization on request[.]\u201d Laws of Maryland 2009, Chs. 284 &amp; 285.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>In 2010, the legislature enacted the Fairness in Negotiations Act, which established the Public School Labor Relations Board. The proposed Fairness in Negotiations Act was introduced in the House of Delegates as HB 243, and in the Senate as SB 590. The floor report of the House Ways and Means Committee described HB 243 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">The authority of the State Board of Education to decide public school labor relations disputes and the authority of the State Superintendent of Schools to declare labor impasses are repealed. The bill also repeals the authority of the local boards of education to make final determinations of matters that have been the subject of negotiation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The law creating the Public School Labor Relations Board was codified at Educ. \u00a7 6-801 <em>et seq. </em>This agency is charged, generally, with \u201cadminister[ing] and enforc[ing] the provisions of Subtitles 4 and 5 of this title.\u201d Subtitle 4 of the Education Article deals with organizations of employees who are required to hold a professional certification, and Subtitle 5 deals with organizations of non-certificated employees, such as the school nurse whose termination was the source of the present eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Even though Educ. \u00a7 6 \u2014 510(c)(5) delegates to the Public School Labor Relations Board the authority to determine the \u201cfinal resolution\u201d of whether a topic is properly subject to collective bargaining, the State Board of Education ruled in this case that the superintendent\u2019s power to terminate an employee who was hired pursuant to Educ. \u00a7 6-201 remains nondelegable and therefore trumps the parties\u2019 Master Agreement, in which the parties expressly agreed to include, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u00a7 4.1, a prohibition on discharging non-probationary employees without cause. As noted above, in its opinion rendered at the request of the Board of Education of Howard County, the State Board of Education \u201cdeclare[d] that the true intent and meaning of [Educ.] \u00a7 6-201 is that the power to hire and fire is non-delegable. If the superintendent\u2019s decision to terminate is subject to mandatory binding arbitration, it is our view that that would violate \u00a7 6-201.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">In our view, the State Board focused on the wrong question. The issue in this case is not whether, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, a superintendent\u2019s power of appointment includes the power to discharge an employee. Rather, the issue presented in this case is whether or not it was illegal, under applicable Maryland statutes, for the Board of Education of Howard County to enter into a collective bargaining agreement which expressly agreed that an employee\u2019s grievance is arbitrable. The answer to that question is found in Subtitle 5 of Title 6 of the Education Article, which is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Public School Labor Relations Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Section 6-510(a) provides that, if a public school employer and an employee organization \u201cnegotiate under this section,\u201d they shall do so in good faith, in a way as to honor and administer existing agreements, and shall \u201c[m]ake every reasonable effort to conclude negotiations with a final written agreement in a timely manner[.]\u201d They must also \u201c[r]educe to writing the matters agreed on as a result of the negotiations.\u201d Here, after a period of negotiations, the parties entered into a Master Agreement, covering a three-year period. Article 2 of the Master Agreement provided for a grievance procedure, and specified the means by which an employee could file a grievance. Section 2.2C3 of the Master Agreement provided: \u201cIn the event that the employee and the Association are not satisfied with the decision at Step II [of the three-step grievance process], the grievance may be submitted to [binding] arbitration ... [.]\u201d This is clearly allowed under Educ. \u00a7 6-510(b), which provides that negotiated agreements between a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>public school employer and an employee organization, of the sort entered into here, \u201cmay provide for binding arbitration of the grievances arising under the agreement that the parties have agreed to be subject to arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In this case, the school nurse\u2019s grievance asserted that she was \u201crecommended for termination without cause.\u201d Because \u00a7 4.1 of the Master Agreement specifies that no non-probationary employee will be discharged without cause, and because the Master Agreement provides for a grievance procedure, the employee attempted to pursue the grievance procedure. In response, she was notified by appellee that it was denying her grievance \u201cbecause it is an illegal subject of bargaining and thus not grievable.\u201d But, according to the Public School Labor Relations Board, the discipline and discharge of an employee for just cause is not an illegal subject of bargaining; it is mandatory subject of negotiation pursuant to Educ. \u00a7 6-510(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In this appeal, appellee argues, in part, that Educ. \u00a7 6-510(c)(3) exempts from collective bargaining a matter prohibited by applicable statute, and, the school board asserts, Educ. \u00a7 6-201(c)(l) is such \u201capplicable statutory law.\u201d Section 6-510(c)(3) provides: \u201cA public school employer may not negotiate the school calendar, the maximum number of students assigned to a class, or any matter that is precluded by applicable statutory law.\u201d But the discipline and discharge of an employee for just cause was <em>expressly made a mandatory subject of bargaining </em>in the subsection of \u201cstatutory law\u201d immediately above: <em>i.e., </em>in \u00a7 6-510(c)(l). We reject the appellee\u2019s argument that, when the legislature expressly included the discharge of an employee as a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, the legislature simultaneously intended to exclude that topic because of the general reference to \u201capplicable statutory law.\u201d Instead, we agree with the conclusion of the Public School Labor Relations Board that, with respect to resolution of disputes regarding the topics that may be the subject of collective bargaining, the General Assembly has designated the labor relations board \u2014 and not the State Board of Education \u2014 as the agency empowered to decide what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>is a \u201cmatter that is precluded by statutory law.\u201d This phrase appears in Title 6, Subtitle 5, and the \u201cfinal\u201d resolution of disputes arising under that subtitle is expressly committed to the Public School Labor Relations Board in Educ. \u00a7\u00a7 2-205(e)(4), 6-510(c)(5), and 6-807(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Appellee also urges us to affirm the circuit court\u2019s rulings because interpretations of education law by the State Board of Education are entitled to heightened deference. But, as we noted above, courts are not required to defer to the interpretations of the agency if, as here, \u201cthe State Board[ of Education\u2019s] interpretation or application of [a statute], in a particular situation, would clearly be contrary to the statute\u2019s plain meaning,\u201d in which case \u201ca reviewing court must reject that interpretation.\u201d <em>Montgomery County Educ. Ass\u2019n, Inc., supra, </em>311 Md. at 309, 534 A.2d 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Appellee also argues that the general, earlier-adopted Educ. \u00a7 6-201 controls over the more specific, later-adopted \u00a7 6-510, citing <em>State v. Harris, </em>327 Md. 32, 607 A.2d 552 (1992), for the \u201cfundamental principle that the law does not favor repeals by implication\u201d and that a \u201clater statute will not be held to repeal an earlier statute by implication unless there is some express reference to the earlier statute.\u201d 327 Md. at 39, 607 A.2d 552. But <em>Harris </em>also makes plain that, \u201cif two statutes contain an irreconcilable conflict, the statute whose relevant substantive provisions were enacted most recently may impliedly repeal any conflicting provision of the earlier statute.\u201d That principle appears applicable here. But, in any event, we do not need to find that Educ. \u00a7 6-201 has been repealed in order to accept the opinion of the Public School Labor Relations Board regarding the arbitrability of disputes regarding the discharge of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Finally, we note that, in deciding the issues presented in this appeal, we have given no weight to the \u201csunset\u201d provision that was included in the statutes which created the Public School Labor Relations Board. Although we recognize that, in the absence of further action by the General Assembly, the Fairness in Negotiations Act will be abrogated and of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>further force and effect after June 30, 2015, we agree with the assertion in the amicus brief of the Attorney General that the current powers of the agency \u201care by no means diminished or placed in doubt by the \u2018sunset\u2019 provision.\u201d According to the Attorney General: \u201cThis legislative practice [of requiring periodic review of State agencies] has long been institutionalized in the form of the Maryland Program Evaluation Act, Md. Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7\u00a7 8-401 to 8-413.... In the most recent supplement to the State Government Article, \u00a7 8-403(b) lists 56 agencies that are slated for sunset evaluation.\u201d Even though the Public School Labor Relations Board does not appear on the list cited by the Attorney General, we agree with the general assertion that, until the sun has finally set on an agency, the agency is fully empowered to exercise the authority granted to it by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">For the reasons set forth above, the Circuit Court for Howard County erred in reversing and vacating the Public School Labor Relations Board\u2019s decision, erred in affirming the interpretation of the State Board of Education, and erred in granting appellee a permanent injunction preventing the arbitration requested by appellant from going forward. We will reverse the order of the circuit court in case no. 13-C-12-090823, and dissolve the injunction. We will also reverse the order of the circuit court in case no. 13-C-12-91545, order that the decision of the Public School Labor Relations Board in Case No. N 2012-01 be affirmed, and order that Opinion No. 12-28 of the State Board of Education be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY IN 13-C-12-090823 REVERSED.
