In denying this motion, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County concluded that no reasonable layperson would believe that they would be afforded leniency upon confessing to \u201cconsensual\u201d anal sex with a four-year-old. At trial, Appellant\u2019s recorded confession was played for the jury, and on May 3, 2012, the jury convicted Appellant of one count of sexual abuse of a minor, two counts of first-degree sex offense, and one count of second-degree child abuse. In his timely appeal, Appellant presents only one question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">\u201cDid the lower court err in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>We affirm. We find that the law enforcement officers made no explicit promises, and that a reasonable layperson in Appellant\u2019s position would not have inferred from the officers\u2019 statements that he could gain the advantage of non-prosecution or leniency by confessing to \u201cconsensual\u201d anal intercourse with a four-year old. <em>See Hill v. State, </em>418 Md. 62, 77,12 A.3d 1193 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">A. The Interview</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Appellant was arrested on September 14, 2010, in the District of Columbia on an outstanding warrant. Detectives Michael Carin and Errol Birch of the Montgomery County Police went to the D.C. police station to interview Appellant. The DVD recording of the interview shows Appellant wearing what appears to be sleepwear. He is not handcuffed, but one of his legs is restrained to a device attached to the floor. The interview room contains one desk and three chairs. Although the detectives are in plainclothes, it is unclear from the video whether the detectives were armed. Both of the detectives, as well as Appellant, spoke in clear, calm voices throughout the interview, and there is no indication that Appellant was threatened in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The detectives introduced themselves as police officers, told Appellant that they wanted to interview him about K.N., and then read Appellant his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Appellant acknowledged that he understood his rights, agreed to speak with the detectives, and then initialed and signed the Advice of Rights Form.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Appellant told the detectives that he was a computer programming student at Strayer University. He also said he was not on any medications at that time, which was noted as 9:10 a.m. He confirmed that a \u201ccouple of years ago\u201d he lived in an apartment on Georgia Avenue with Maria N. and her children, K.N. and D.N.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Detective Carin explained the allegations: \u201cOkay. There\u2019s no way to sugarcoat this, because the information that we have seems pretty bad, okay? Basically, she disclosed to her Mom ... Okay. K.N. and D.N. were interviewed last week, and basically they were talking about ... you beat him up one day; and .. . you engaged K.N. in anal intercourse. Okay. That\u2019s basically why we are here.\u201d The detectives detailed K.N.\u2019s accusations, including that Appellant engaged in this behavior on multiple occasions. They also indicated they had an eyewitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Detective Carin told Appellant that he and Detective Birch did not execute warrants or work on robbery cases, but they had to attend school to learn how to be more like social workers. He continued, \u201c[O]ur main job isn\u2019t to put cuffs on you and throw you in jail .... [o]ur goal is to get the counseling for her so she can become whole again.\u201d In order to do that, he explained, they \u201chave to have an understanding of what happened.\u201d He then queried, \u201cyou and I know it wasn\u2019t her fault, correct?\u201d Appellant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about. I never once put my hands on a little girl.\u201d After Detective Carin stated that \u201cthe bottom line is you and I know it happened,\u201d Appellant replied, \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Next the detective told Appellant that not only did they have an eyewitness, but that a doctor examined K.N. and \u201cthere\u2019s damage to her [anus].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t care if it happened to her. It wasn\u2019t by me.\u201d The detective then challenged Appellant\u2019s story, relating that K.N. identified Appellant as the perpetrator; Maria talked about the time when Appellant beat up D.N.; there was a medical report; and a witness walked in on Appellant and K.N. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>detective stated, \u201cyou know exactly what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d Appellant replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">It was at this point, approximately 18:24 minutes into the interview, when the discussion took a direction that is the subject of this appeal. Detective Birch took over questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOc\">You know, this is the one things that you got to understand, and I\u2019m going to throw out another card to you, okay? When we do these cases, the most important thing is for you to stand up and be a man and accept your responsibility. The problem we have is, when we get these cases \u2014 we get these cases every day. And a lot of these girls, depending on the age of the boys, we polygraph them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">The part we had a problem with is she\u2019s saying you forced her, you forced her. Force is a huge thing. That\u2019s the problem that I have, when someone says they were forced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">Part of the polygraph that she passed was she did have anal intercourse with you. The part that she did not do well on is the force. This is the opportunity for you \u2014 if there was force, we have a problem; if there\u2019s not force, then it\u2019s consensual, and that\u2019s when she get\u2019s [sic] help. Then we understand that she is not telling us the truth about that part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">But sitting here, saying it didn\u2019t happen with all these things here \u2014 It basically is going to be her story jamming you, and this is your opportunity, if it was not force, then you need to tell us, because what happens is you walk out of here, we\u2019re going with the force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">At 19:45 minutes into the interview, Detective Birch then made the following statements that are the primary focus of Appellant\u2019s arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">And you get that shit all the time, \u201cI was raped and I was forced.\u201d Well, you\u2019re going to get in trouble for that. If it was consensual, that\u2019s a whole different story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-11\">That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to figure out, is it force or was it consensual? And that\u2019s what, and by sitting here and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to her,\u201d you can do that, you can throw the dice on that table, see if you\u2019re going to win this \u2014 you\u2019re not going to win. We\u2019re going to go forward on force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">Here is the opportunity to tell us it was not force, it was consensual. There\u2019s a little difference in age and that\u2019s just something that we got to deal with and she has to deal with, and she\u2019s going to have to make better choices in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">But the force part is what we\u2019re hung up on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">I\u2019m going to tell you what. If she said it was consensual and she passed that, we wouldn\u2019t come down here. It took us two hours to get down here to talk to you, to give your side of the story. It took me two hours to get down here. If she said it was consensual and passed that polygraph, we wouldn\u2019t have come down here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">The force part is the one that we were concerned about.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Following this, and only 20:50 minutes into the interview, Appellant stated, \u201cI never forced her to do anything.\u201d Immediately thereafter, the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">Detective Birch: Okay. Tell me what the consensual part of it was and we can roll out of this. If it\u2019s consensual, then tell us it\u2019s consensual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">[Appellant]: It was consensual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">Appellant then recounted details of having anal intercourse with K.N., claiming that \u201c[i]t was her idea.\u201d He stated that K.N. cried one time, and he stopped. Appellant did not remember D.N. walking in on them. Appellant stated that the incidents began when K.N. was four or five years old and that there were four or five such encounters with K.N. over a six-month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">Detective Carin revealed that K.N. told the police that Appellant put a plastic bag over her head. Appellant responded that \u201c[t]here was never a plastic bag,\u201d and explained that he put a pillowcase over her head because \u201c[s]he said she didn\u2019t want to see anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>The detective also questioned Appellant about the incident regarding D.N. Appellant claimed that he and D.N. were \u201cjust roughhousing in the house and it was an accident.\u201d Appellant admitted that he hit D.N. with an open hand, but maintained that it was accidental. When asked about a reported injury to KN.\u2019s ear, Appellant stated that he was chasing her \u201cto be disciplined for something she did, and she ran into the wall.\u201d He denied throwing her or smacking her, but he confirmed that KN.\u2019s ear bled after this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Appellant denied that he engaged in oral sex with K.N., but admitted that he placed his finger in her vagina and her anus \u201c[j]ust once or twice.\u201d He further asserted that K.N. \u201calways initiated\u201d the encounters and that K.N. \u201ccame and got [him].\u201d Appellant disclosed that after their encounters, he \u201ctold her not to tell anybody because people don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Appellant agreed he would write an apology to K.N. After 32:29 minutes, the following dialogue was recorded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">Detective Birch: Okay. Let me ask you this. Do you know what you did was wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">[Appellant]: (No audible response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">Detective Birch: Do you know it was illegal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">[Appellant]: (No audible response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-11\">Detective Birch: Do you know it was illegal no matter whether it was consensual or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-12\">[Appellant]: (No audible response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-13\">Detective Birch: So really the bottom line is no matter whether she said, \u201cLet me [f_] you,\u201d doesn\u2019t make a difference. You\u2019re still 100 percent wrong. You\u2019re aware of that, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-16\">[Appellant]: (No audible response.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Appellant was then left alone to write the apology letter. The transcript of the interview then concluded approximately 33:40 minutes after it began.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Thereafter, as shown on the DVD recording, about 43:20 minutes after the interview began, Detective Carin returned to the interview room, gave Appellant a bottle of water, and asked him to sign his apology. Detective Carin asked Appellant to read his apology letter aloud, and he did so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">Dear [K.N.]: I just wanted to say that I\u2019m sorry for what I did to you. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t just tell you no when I had the chance. If I could go back and change what I did, I would. Please know that none of this is your fault so don\u2019t blame yourself for what happen [sic] because you didn\u2019t anything wrong [sic]. Again I\u2019m sorry and I hope you can put this behind you and live your life in peace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">When Detective Carin asked Appellant if this letter was referring to the anal intercourse with K.N., Appellant responded, \u201cright.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Appellant inquired about what would happen next, and the detective explained that he would be transported to D.C. Central Booking and that he was charged with second-degree sex offense, second-degree assault, and sex abuse of a minor as to K.N., and second-degree child abuse as to D.N.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Detective Carin also told Appellant that he could not take him back to Maryland and that there would be an extradition hearing at some point in D.C. After a few more clarifying questions, wherein Appellant maintained that he never put a plastic bag over K.N.\u2019s head, Appellant was left alone, approximately 48:15 minutes after the interview began.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">B. The Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">On March 9, 2012, the circuit court (the \u201csuppression court\u201d) held a hearing on Appellant\u2019s Motion to Suppress. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>outset, the parties stipulated that Detectives Carin and Birch had no contact with Appellant other than what was documented in the transcript and by the recording.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Neither Detective Carin nor Appellant testified at the hearing, although both were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that his client\u2019s confession was involuntary because the officers made a promise of leniency and his client relied on that improper inducement. Counsel offered as an improper inducement the following statement: \u201cOkay. Tell me what the consensual part of it was and we can roll out of this.\u201d The suppression court inquired, \u201chow could it be that a reasonable person in the position of your client would have inferred from the detective\u2019s statement that he could gain ... the advantage of non-prosecution or other form of assistance by, if it [sic] was having consensual sex with a 4-year-old?\u201d The suppression court further queried, \u201cobjectively how could a layperson believe a 4-year-old could consent to anything?\u201d Appellant maintained that the inquiry was simply whether the police promised him something, and whether he relied on that promise in making a statement. Appellant\u2019s counsel asserted that \u201c[h]e doesn\u2019t have to know whether it\u2019s illegal or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The State responded that Appellant was arrested, held in custody, advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and then told what the allegations against him were before he made his confession. It was not objectively reasonable for Appellant to believe that a four-year-old could consent to anal intercourse, or that by saying so, Appellant would gain any advantage. The State contended that the detective\u2019s statement \u201c... we can roll out of this\u201d must be read in context. They had told Appellant they had traveled two hours to get his side of the story, so the detectives wanted to be done and roll out of there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>THE COURT: You\u2019re saying what the detective meant, \u201cAll right, tell me it was consensual so I and my colleagues can go back to Montgomery County?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">[THE STATE]: Not just what he meant, that\u2019s what he said. \u201cWe will roll.\u201d ... He didn\u2019t say, \u201cyou will roll out of here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The suppression court engaged in extensive discussion with counsel over application of the relevant Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions to the facts presented, and ultimately denied the motion, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">My conclusion, taking the transcript at face value, I mean, I conclude that no reasonable layperson in the position of the defendant would have inferred from the detective\u2019s statements that he could gain the advantage of non-prosecution or some other form of leniency in this context because no reasonable person would believe that one can lawfully, under any circumstances, have sex with a 4-year-old. To me, that is the linchpin of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">I could conjure other fact patterns, and I\u2019ve discussed some of them with counsel, which could come down on one side of the ledger or the other side of the ledger, but, respectfully, not this one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">On April 27, 2012, the suppression court held a hearing on Appellant\u2019s motion to reconsider. Most of the argument concerned conflicting interpretations of <em>Hill v. State, </em>418 Md. 62, 12 A.3d 1193 (2011), beginning with the following inquiry by the suppression court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">[COURT]: If it\u2019s reasonable [under <em>Hill </em>] on the one hand for someone to cough it up because they\u2019re told, \u201cIf you give the 9-year-old an apology you won\u2019t be prosecuted,\u201d how different is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">[THE STATE]: Under <em>Hill </em>they are promising him an explicit benefit of, \u201cWe are not going to go forward,\u201d Here, they never make that promise to [Appellant]. Never make that promise to [Appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The suppression court held the matter <em>sub cu\u00f1a </em>and reconvened on April 80, 2012, the same day the jury was selected for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">After permitting even further argument, the suppression court denied the motion for reconsideration. In so ruling, the court found that at the time of the interview, Appellant was indicted and under arrest, and that he was advised of and waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Paraphrasing the Court of Appeals in <em>Hill, </em>the court acknowledged that the question before it was \u201cwhether a reasonable layperson in the position of the defendant would have inferred from the detective\u2019s statement that he could gain the advantage of non-prosecution or some other form of assistance.\u201d The suppression court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">I understand what was decided in <em>Hill, </em>but I think there are important ... factual differences between the <em>Hill </em>case and this case, some of which I\u2019ve already recited, others of which are the nature of the detective\u2019s statements and the circumstances under which they were made and the crimes at issue. Here, one distinguishing feature I see is while it is certainly illegal to have consensual sex with a minor, it\u2019s a different crime if that consensual sex was accompanied by force. The force elevates it to first degree. I\u2019m not saying it makes it better or worse, but it\u2019s different. So that is one legitimate area where the police were trying to find out what they had was whether it was a first degree offense or not a first degree offense, but that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t an offense.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The court concluded by denying the motion, stating that it was \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">[T]his defendant ... to have believed that if it was consensual: A, it would go away; B, he\u2019d be released from D.C. jail; C, it wouldn\u2019t be a crime. It would be a crime. It\u2019d be a different crime. It wouldn\u2019t be a first degree crime, it wouldn\u2019t [sic] be some other crime, second degree, third degree, but it\u2019s still a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">The notion that a reasonable person would or could believe that having consensual sex with a 4-year-old is not problem, or that if I just say it\u2019s consensual not only, even if it all doesn\u2019t go away it\u2019s going to be materially better is a notion which I frankly think is absurd.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">C. <em>Trial and Disposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">At Appellant\u2019s trial, the State played the recorded statement for the jury, and on May 3, 2012, the jury ultimately convicted Appellant of one count of sexual abuse of a minor, two counts of first-degree sex offense, and one count of second-degree child abuse.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On January 31, 2013, the circuit court imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years without possibility of parole for both counts of first-degree sex offense, each to be served consecutively, a consecutive sentence of 25 years for sex abuse of a minor, and a concurrent sentence of 15 years for second-degree child abuse. Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal on February 12, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The sole issue on appeal is the voluntariness of Appellant\u2019s custodial confession. Appellant contends that Detective Birch\u2019s statements constituted an improper inducement and that Appellant relied on those statements in making the confession. The State counters that Appellant\u2019s statement was voluntary for several reasons. First, unlike the accused in <em>Hill, </em>here Appellant was arrested, and only after he waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>his <em>Miranda </em>rights and heard the allegations leveled against him did he volunteer that he had \u201cconsensual\u201d intercourse with a child. Second, the State argues that the detectives did not explicitly make a promise or convey an improper inducement to Appellant. And finally, the State contends that no reasonable layperson would believe that confessing to \u201cconsensual\u201d anal intercourse with a four-year-old would not result in prosecution or that such a confession would result in the filing of a lesser charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The issue of whether a confession is voluntary constitutes a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 310, 765 A.2d 97 (2001). The Court of Appeals has explained this amalgam as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">If the trial court determines that the statement was not made voluntarily, it will declare it inadmissible. That completely resolves the issue; it never becomes one for the jury. If, on the other hand, the court finds the statement voluntary, it will admit it and its voluntariness then becomes an issue which the jury must ultimately resolve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-7\"><em>Hof v. State, </em>337 Md. 581, 605, 655 A.2d 370 (1995) (internal citations omitted). As a result, we review the court\u2019s ultimate ruling on the issue of voluntariness <em>de novo. Winder, </em>362 Md. at 310-11, 765 A.2d 97. We are limited to the facts presented at the suppression hearing, and we must view the \u201c \u2018evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee v.

State, </em>the Court of Appeals reaffirmed Maryland\u2019s exclusionary rule governing custodial confessions improperly induced by law enforcement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">[U]nder Maryland criminal law, independent of any federal constitutional requirement, if an accused is told, or it is implied, that making an inculpatory statement will be to his advantage, in that he will be given help or some special consideration, and he makes remarks in reliance on that inducement, his declaration will be considered to have been involuntarily made and therefore inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">286 Md. 145, 153, 406 A.2d 415 (1979). Subsequently, the Court fashioned a two-part test based on <em>Hillard </em>for examining whether a confession was involuntary under Maryland common law. <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 309, 765 A.2d 97. The first prong is whether \u201ca police officer or agent of the police force promises or implies to a suspect that he or she will be given special consideration from a prosecuting authority or some other form of assistance in exchange for the suspect\u2019s confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This prong of the test is objective. <em>Id. </em>at 311, 765 A.2d 97. To resolve whether the officer\u2019s conduct satisfies the first prong, \u201cthe court must determine whether a reasonable person in the position of the accused would be moved to make an inculpatory statement upon hearing the officer\u2019s declaration.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>418 Md. at 76, 12 A.3d 1193. \u201cAn accused\u2019s subjective belief that he will receive a benefit in exchange for a confession carries no weight under this prong.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>418 Md. at 76, 12 A.3d 1193. A \u201cthreat, promise, or inducement can be considered improper regardless whether it is express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>or implied[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>(citing <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 308, 765 A.2d 97), and the \u201creasonable layperson\u201d inquiry may not be necessary in cases involving an express <em>quid pro quo.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">If the court finds that an improper inducement was made, then the court turns to the second prong, which is whether \u201cthe suspect makes a confession in apparent reliance on the police officer\u2019s explicit or implicit inducement.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>418 Md. at 161, 12 A.3d 1238 (citing <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d 415). This prong \u201ctriggers a causation analysis to determine whether there was a nexus between the promise or inducement and the accused\u2019s confession.\u201d <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 311, 765 A.2d 97. Absent the accused\u2019s reliance on the improper remark, the statement is admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 311-12, 765 A.2d 97 (discussing <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>327 Md. 494, 610 A.2d 782 (1992)). In order \u201cto determine whether a suspect relied upon an offer of help from an interrogating authority in making a confession[,] we examine the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312, 765 A.2d 97. It is the State\u2019s burden to prove, \u201cby preponderance of the evidence, that the accused did not make the inculpatory statement in reliance on the improper inducement.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>418 Md. at 77, 12 A.3d 1193 (citing <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d 415; <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 310, 765 A.2d 97). \u201cBoth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>prongs must be satisfied before a confession is deemed to be involuntary.\u201d <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 310, 765 A.2d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In the instant case, Appellant contends that the following statements made by the detectives interviewing him were improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">1) \u201c \u2018I was raped and I was forced.\u2019 Well, you\u2019re going to get in trouble for that. <em>If it was consensual, that\u2019s a whole different story.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">2) \u201cAnd our main job isn\u2019t to put cuffs on you and throw you in jail. That\u2019s not our job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">3) \u201cThis is the opportunity for <em>your </em>\u2014 if <em>there was force, we have a problem; if there\u2019s not force, then it\u2019s consensual, and that\u2019s when she get\u2019s </em>[sic] <em>help.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">4) \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you what. If she said it was consensual and she passed that, we wouldn\u2019t come down here. It took us two hours to get down here to talk to you, to give your side of the story. It took me two hours to get down here. <em>If she said it was consensual and passed that polygraph, we wouldn\u2019t have come down here.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">5) \u201cOkay. <em>Tell me what the consensual part of it was and we can roll out of this.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">(Emphasis added). Based on these statements, Appellant contends that \u201c[i]t is patently obvious that the officer implied to Appellant that it would be better for him or to his advantage to confess to consensual contact with [K.N.],\u201d and that \u201call that is required to make the statement involuntary\u201d is \u201can implication that there would not be trouble or there would be less trouble if [he] ... admitted to consensual contact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYJ\">Turning to the first prong of the <em>Hillard </em>common law test, we are unable to identify an express promise or offer of a benefit or leniency in exchange for Appellant\u2019s confession. Accordingly, the detectives\u2019 statements fall within the realm of implied promises. <em>See Winder, </em>362 Md. at 311, 765 A.2d 97 (noting that although an appellant \u201cneed not point to an express <em>quid pro quo,\u201d </em>he must demonstrate \u201ca promise or offer within the substance of the officer\u2019s eliciting statement\u201d (citing <em>Reynolds, </em>327 Md. at 507, 610 A.2d 782)). To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>extent that a promise might be implied by the substance of the detectives\u2019 statements, we must determine whether a reasonable layperson in Appellant\u2019s position would have been moved to make an inculpatory statement upon hearing the statements. <em>Hill, </em>418 Md. at 76, 12 A.3d 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><em>Hill v. State </em>guides our determination of whether an officer\u2019s statements to an accused impermissibly imply a promise or leniency under the first prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test. In that case, an ordained minister was accused of engaging in sexual conduct with the eight- or nine-year-old victim. <em>Hill, </em>418 Md. at 67, 12 A.3d 1193. A detective orchestrated a one-party consent phone call from the victim to the minister in an attempt to elicit an admission or apology. <em>Id. </em>at 67-70, 12 A.3d 1193. Four days later, the detective called the minister, notified him that \u201chis name came up in an investigation\u201d and \u201cit wasn\u2019t that big of a deal,\u201d and asked if the minister would participate in an interview. <em>Id. </em>at 70, 12 A.3d 1193. The minister agreed and, during the interview at the police station, the detective disclosed that the police had recorded the telephone call and that \u201c[the victim] and his mother did not want to see him get into trouble, but they only wanted an apology.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71, 12 A.3d 1193. The minister proceeded to admit that he \u201cmasturbated\u201d the victim six times and wrote an apology letter. <em>Id. </em>At his suppression hearing, the minister testified that he wrote the apology letter because he was \u201ca minister, and all [he] wanted to do was have this over and not be brought to shame because of a lie.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 12 A.3d 1193. In addition, he believed that supplying an apology letter \u201cwould just end the nightmare and what [he] was going through.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The circuit court denied the minister\u2019s motion to suppress, and we affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 66, 12 A.3d 1193. The Court of Appeals granted certiorari and ultimately vacated our decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The Court held that detective\u2019s remarks \u2014 that the victim and the victim\u2019s mother \u201cdid not want to see him get into trouble, but they only wanted an apology\u201d \u2014 constituted an improper inducement under prong one of the <em>Hillard </em>test because a reasonable layperson in the suspect\u2019s position would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>have taken the detective\u2019s statements to mean that \u201che could gain the advantage of non-prosecution or some other form of assistance, upon making an apology to the victim and his family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78-79,12 A.3d 1193. The Court observed that, in the context of the case, \u201can objectively reasonable interpretation of the word \u2018trouble,\u2019 is trouble with the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Moreover, the Court concluded that a reasonable layperson in the accused\u2019s position, upon hearing the officer\u2019s statement, \u201cwould not necessarily understand that the State could prosecute him or her, even against the wishes of the victim or victim\u2019s family.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We perceive meaningful factual distinctions between the instant case and <em>Hill. </em>First, the accused in <em>Hill </em>was not arrested prior to questioning as was Appellant. In the instant case, Appellant was arrested, read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and then \u2014 as he was sitting, restrained in the police station\u2014 informed of the charges against him and that those charges could not be \u201csugarcoat[ed]\u201d because they were \u201cpretty bad.\u201d These facts do not necessarily figure in the analysis of whether the detectives made an explicit promise of assistance or leniency. But when, as here, we are dealing with implied assertions by the detectives and are trying to ascertain what a reasonable layperson would take those statements to mean, these facts do impact the circumstances and the determination of whether a reasonable layperson would believe he could just \u201croll out of [tjhere\u201d by saying that anal sex with a four-year old was consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Second, in <em>Hill, </em>the accused was told during a <em>voluntary </em>interview that the victim did not want him to be in trouble so long as he apologized, and it was objectively reasonable, from the vantage point of a layperson, that if he apologized he would not be prosecuted. Here, the detectives said it was important to understand whether the sex was forced. Appellant contends that this implied some form of leniency if Appellant confessed that the sex was consensual, but the detectives also told Appellant that they needed to know if the sex was forced so that the child could seek proper treatment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>They never actually said he would be charged with a lesser offense if the sex was consensual, and they never offered Appellant assistance if he confessed. An \u201cappeal to the inner psychological pressure of conscience to tell the truth does not constitute coercion in the legal sense.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>219 Md. App. at 333, 100 A.3d 1208 (quoting <em>Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. at 179, 699 A.2d 1170) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Appellant also argues that the detectives clearly implied that he could roll out of his charges if he told them it was consensual,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but as the State pointed out at the hearing below, the detectives also told Appellant that they had driven two hours to get his side of the story, and they said <em>\u201cwe </em>can roll out of this,\u201d not <em>\u201cyou </em>can roll out of this.\u201d Clearly the detectives used all of their persuasive powers, even telling some untruths while toeing the improper inducement line, but in the end, they did not cross it. Standing between them and the other side was the impenetrable reality that any reasonable layperson would recognize as ludicrous the chance of charges being dropped or lesser charges being filed in exchange for a confession to a patently perverse proposition \u2014 a four-year-old consenting to sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">This Court has stated definitively that children lack the capacity to provide consent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">[C]onsent to sexual contact with an adult cannot be given by a child as a matter of law. To be effective, consent must be given by one who has the capacity to give it.... <em>We have no </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number><em>trouble in holding as a matter of law that seven and nine year old children are incapable of appreciating the nature, extent and probable consequences of sexual conduct with an adult, and thus, cannot provide valid consent. </em>Moreover, ... even when a person is in fact competent to give consent, a statute may prevent the consent from being effective if the statute is found to be intended to give special protection against certain kinds of harm. One example given by comment b [Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 892(A), defining \u201ceffect of consent,\u201d] is statutory rape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><em>Pettit v. Erie Ins. Exch., </em>117 Md.App. 212, 224-25, 699 A.2d 550 (1997) (emphasis added), <em>aff'd, </em>349 Md. 777, 709 A.2d 1287 (1998). Even without such a decree from the legislature or judiciary, objectively reasonable people simply would not believe that a four-year-old child is capable of consenting to sexual activity. <em>Cf. United States v. Kise, </em>369 F.3d 766, 774 (4th Cir.2004) (noting that the defendant\u2019s honest belief that a child is capable of consenting to sexual activity is \u201cundeniably perverse to objective individuals without his paraphilia\u201d). It so follows that it is manifestly unreasonable for a person to believe that a four-year-old is capable of consenting to sexual intercourse and, accordingly, that confessing to \u201cconsensual\u201d anal intercourse with a four-year-old would yield non-prosecution or leniency in prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Even if Appellant actually believed that the detectives\u2019 statements meant that by confessing to consensual sexual conduct, a lesser charge would be filed against him, we note that encouraging a suspect to adopt a version of the facts that might mitigate the punishment for the crime he committed is not in itself an improper inducement under Maryland law. <em>Williams, </em>219 Md.App. at 338, 100 A.3d 1208. Moreover, in the instant case, the detectives did not actually tell Appellant that a lesser charge may be filed against him by saying the sex was consensual. We are not called upon to evaluate what Appellant might have believed the detectives meant, but what a reasonable layperson would have understood the detectives\u2019 words to mean. <em>Lee, supra, </em>418 Md. at 156, 12 A.3d 1238. Indeed, \u201c[a]n accused\u2019s subjective belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>that he will receive a benefit in exchange for a confession carries no weight under [prong one of the <em>Hillard </em>test.]\u201d <em>Hill, </em>418 Md. at 76, 12 A.3d 1193. Because no objectively reasonable layperson would rely on Detective Birch\u2019s statements as a promise of non-prosecution or a lesser charge, Detective Birch\u2019s statements did not constitute an improper inducement, and the first prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test is not satisfied. As a result, we need not evaluate the second prong.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Finally, we add that the totality of the circumstances do not suggest involuntariness here. While Appellant was under arrest and restrained by a device attached between his leg and the floor, two detectives in plainclothes conducted the interview in an interview room at the D.C. police station. Appellant appeared calm, coherent, and awake throughout the interview, and stated that he was not on any medications at the time. Further, Appellant was studying to be a computer programmer at Strayer University, suggesting that he was of average intelligence and capable of understanding what was happening during the course of the interview. Indeed, Appellant stated that he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights, agreed to speak with the detectives, and initialed and signed the waiver of rights form. And, our review of the transcript and the DVD recording persuades us that Appellant was not threatened or coerced into making a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The suppression court properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-12\">.

Without the bag, the crime would be second-degree sex offense under CL \u00a7 3-306 (2002, Repl.Vol.2012 &amp; Supp.2013). Although determining whether a bag was involved was a legitimate inquiry, the issue before us is not simply whether the topic of questioning was appropriate; rather, as will be discussed <em>infra, </em>the issue is whether the detectives improperly promised or implied leniency in exchange for a confession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\">.

I could try to protect you.\u201d), <em>and Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d 415 (concluding that the following promise was improper: \u201cI will go to bat for you to the extent that I will tell the State's Attorney's Office and the Court, number one, that you have cooperated, number two, you have told me the truth, and number three, I believe you were not knowledgeable as far as the murder was concerned\u201d), <em>with Hill, </em>418 Md. at 78-79, 12 A.3d 1193 (concluding that the officer's statement that the victim's family \u201cdid not want to see him get into any trouble, but they only wanted an apology\u201d would cause a reasonable layperson to <em>infer </em>leniency based on that statement upon his confession).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">. In Maryland, consent may be a defense to sex offense charges involving an adult victim, and, accordingly, a reasonable layperson might confess to consensual conduct if the victim was an adult. <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 3-305(a) (defining first-degree sex offense); \u00a7 3-306(a) (defining second-degree sex offense); \u00a7 3-303(a) (defining first-degree rape); \u00a7 3-304(a) (defining second-degree rape). Even where the victim is close to majority age, we note that the \"mistake-of-age\u201d defense in the context of statutory rape is not recognized in Maryland. <em>See Owens v. State, </em>352 Md. 663, 674, 724 A.2d 43 (1999) (rejecting the \"mistake-of-age\u201d defense and affirming statutory rape\u2019s characterization as a \"strict liability crime\u201d); <em>Garnett v. State, </em>332 Md. 571, 607, 632 A.2d 797 (1993) (observing that \"a person engaging in intercourse with a female, whom he knows to be under 14[,] may not set up her consent as a defense\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">. We note that even if we were to review the second prong, our review would be limited, because Appellant did not testify at his suppression hearing, thereby leaving only the transcript and DVD of the interview for us to consider. As this Court stated in <em>Ashford v. State, </em>147 Md.App. 1, 56, 807 A.2d 732, <em>cert. denied, </em>372 Md. 430, 813 A.2d 257 (2002), \"the failure of a defendant to testify almost forecloses any chance of prevailing\" on a suppression motion based on an alleged absence of voluntariness. \"Only the defendant can truly tell us what was going on in the defendant's mind. Without such testimony, there is usually no direct evidence of involuntariness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
