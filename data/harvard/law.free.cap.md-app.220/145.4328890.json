He claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it awarded Wife indefinite alimony, and that it erred in finding that payments he characterizes as \u201cloans\u201d made to him by his employer constituted income during the marriage, and therefore marital property for purposes of calculating indefinite alimony. He also argues that the court wrongly failed to create a \u201cconstructive trust\u201d or other vehicle to vest him with a full ownership interest in property at issue in the divorce, even though it was titled in Wife\u2019s name. Finally, he appeals the trial court\u2019s finding that he was in contempt after he failed to pay child support. Wife filed a cross-appeal arguing that the court relied on an incorrect alimony figure when it calculated child support. We find no errors and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">1. The marriage and the parties\u2019 careers.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Husband and Wife were married on June 26, 1992 and had two children, both of whom are now over the age of eighteen. Although neither Husband nor Wife graduated from college, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>both have had successful careers. After serving in the Marines, Husband worked as a financial advisor for several institutions, and he accepted his current position with UBS in 2010. His salary agreement with UBS was complex, and the subject of much disagreement by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Husband entered into a Letter of Understanding with UBS on November 8, 2010, under which he received what the Letter characterized as a \u201ccash loan\u201d or \u201ctransition loan\u201d in the amount of $1,305,000 within thirty days. Husband also signed a series of \u201cTransition Agreements\u201d and promissory notes with UBS on November 17, 2010 and thereafter. Unlike more conventional loans, UBS made \u201cpayments\u201d (by forgiving one-ninth of each loan) on Husband\u2019s anniversary dates with the company as long as he continued to work there, and they would be forgiven in full after nine years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Husband took the position at trial that the \u201cloans\u201d were, in fact, loans, not signing bonuses or compensation, because after the divorce he would remain responsible to repay them, and in any event they could not be considered \u201cproperty acquired during the course of the marriage\u201d (the term of art that we discuss below) to the extent he would not have done the work entitling him to forgiveness until after the divorce. Husband asserted generally that although he received the loan proceeds and a commission-based salary, he really only netted about $65,000 in income each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Wife, on the other hand, contended that the $1.3 million payment was a \u201cretention bonus\u201d that UBS structured, for tax purposes, as a loan with payments due over a period of years. Wife testified that Husband had referred to these payments at the outset as a \u201csigning bonus,\u201d and only began calling the payments a \u201cloan\u201d once the divorce proceeding was underway. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>(For clarity, we refer to the payments that Husband received from UBS through the course of the marriage as the \u201cUBS payments.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Wife worked as a secretary after graduating from high school, and continued to work after they married and through the birth of their two children. By 2000, she was earning about $60,000 a year. In 2001, she and three friends started a company, Intuitive Business Concepts, Inc. (\u201cIBC\u201d), that was successful: each partner received an annual salary of $104,000, along with partnership distributions and other benefits that, at their peak, yielded a salary of $145,000. After she tried to sell her interest in the business in 2006, she became embroiled in a dispute with her partners and ultimately settled with IBC, exchanging her interest for a series of payments totaling $280,000 over three years. Wife testified that she and Husband put all this money toward living expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Wife took a year off from working to comply with a non-compete she signed with IBC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In September 2008, she took a job as an independent contractor for the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (\u201cACICS\u201d). At the time of trial, she worked approximately twenty-four hours a week and billed $125 an hour, but received no benefits or reimbursements. Wife testified that she has looked for a full-time job, and the maximum potential full-time salary she had found was about $110,000 a year \u2014 approximately $15,000 more than she was making. She also spent about sixteen hours a week working (unpaid) at the bar she and Husband acquired years ago which, as we discuss next, became a significant problem in the parties\u2019 relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">2. Park Place Adventures, LLC &amp; its investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">To realize his \u201clife long dream\u201d of owning his own bar, Husband formed, on January 1, 2010, a limited liability compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ny, Park Place Adventures, LLC (\u201cPark Place\u201d) that purchased a Severna Park restaurant called Snyder\u2019s. (The business later changed the name of the bar, and we refer to it generally as \u201cthe bar.\u201d) Husband intended to share ownership in Park Place with two of his UBS clients, Mark Tinordi and Jeffrey Kogok, but discovered shortly before forming it that UBS prohibited him from investing with his clients. To circumvent this problem, he placed a fifty-one percent interest in Park Place in Wife\u2019s name and he held no membership share at all. Ironically, Wife had no interest in buying the bar, and testified that she \u201cknew it would tear the family apart\u201d because, as she saw it, it would give Husband opportunities to stay out late and drink with friends. She allowed Husband to put Park Place (and by extension, the bar) in her name, though, because she was concerned that even more problems would follow if the ownership share went to one of their children. Park Place purchased Snyder\u2019s on December 31, 2010. Husband financed the purchase by obtaining a UBS equity line of credit using his UBS payments as collateral and then borrowing about $1.4 million from the line of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The haphazard organization of Park Place may have contributed to the problems that followed. As Mr. Kogok explained, \u201cthe whole partnership agreement was sort of a last-minute thrown together [deal], as far as I can tell.\u201d Mr. Kogok testified that he initially invested a quarter-of-a-million dollars in Park Place, and put in another $150,000 within the year-and-a-half before trial. He did not investigate the details of the partnership or its management of the bar. When asked about whether he had approved the provision in the partnership documents that prevented members from selling their shares without unanimous consent, he admitted to signing off on it: \u201cAgain, I did a sloppy job and I just signed off on the thing because it was kind of after the fact and, again, I had complete faith in [Husband].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Everyone agrees that Husband changed the bar\u2019s name in 2011 to \u201cHot Rodz &amp; Rydz,\u201d but they dispute many of the facts surrounding its management and finances. Wife says that she found out when the parties began the divorce pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ceeding that employees\u2019 paychecks were bouncing, and she had major concerns about how it was run. At that point, she took over the bar, cut a number of other benefits, and cleaned up the bar\u2019s finances. Mr. Tinordi, who had been a client of Husband for about ten years, testified that once Wife took over, the restaurant (whose name changed again, this time to the \u201cSeverna Park Tap House\u201d) started making money. Mr. Tinordi had a falling-out with Husband about Husband\u2019s poor management of the bar,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and at the time of trial Mr. Tinordi was working there about five days a week, without salary, in an effort to help turn it around.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Husband argued at trial that Park Place had a fair market value of $800,000 (based largely on its ownership of the Severna Park Tap House and the land on which it sat). He claimed that he was entitled to 77 percent of Wife\u2019s interest in the value of Park Place (which, he claimed, was purchased with a loan collateralized by the proceeds of the UBS payments), reasoning that he had not yet repaid 77 percent of the UBS payments as of the date of the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">3. The parties\u2019 lifestyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">As Husband\u2019s earnings increased, the couple\u2019s lifestyle changed too. The court described it as \u201clavish,\u201d and their purchases backed up that characterization. Husband also appears to have displayed great magnanimity in sharing his wealth, both before and after the marriage ended; the former time period mattered to the parties\u2019 standard of living during the marriage, and the latter period bore on the court\u2019s analysis of whether Husband had dissipated marital assets after they separated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">\n<em>Pre-separation</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">\u2022 The parties bought their house in May 2007 for $900,000, and bought the adjoining lot in order to build a swimming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>pool. As of the time of trial, neither Husband nor Wife was making mortgage payments on the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">\u2022 The parties owned thirteen vehicles valued at nearly $250,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">\u2022 The parties bought permanent seat licenses to Ravens\u2019 games worth $20,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">\u2022 The family enjoyed luxury vacations to Jamaica, the Bahamas, and ski resorts, as well as regular summer vacations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">\n<em>Post-separation</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">\u2022 In September 2011, Husband bought a house for a daughter by his first marriage, which she transferred to his first wife, who took out a mortgage on the property. Husband bought the house back from his ex-wife after it went into foreclosure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">\u2022 Husband bought a car for a friend\u2019s use and paid the insurance on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">\u2022 Husband gave a boat to his son, who then sold it for $10,000, a price Husband thought was far too low.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-12\">\u2022 Wife testified that after the divorce proceedings were underway, Husband began to cash in his retirement accounts. He withdrew nearly $50,000 each in April and May 2011, and withdrew over $180,000 in September that he gave to his daughter and son-in-law to buy a house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-13\">\u2022 The court found that Husband spent over $2,500 a month on \u201cdining out and alcohol,\u201d and noted that at trial, Husband could not account for more than $90,000 that he had spent between February 2013 and July 2013, other than to call them \u201cliving expenses.\u201d The court also found that he spent several thousand dollars on jewelry for himself and his girlfriend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">The parties carried significant debt and Husband used the UBS payments to pay it off. The court found that \u201c[i]t is clear that this money received [from UBS] was used by the parties during their marriage to support their lifestyle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>4. The marriage dissolves.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The parties disagreed about which of them brought about the deterioration of the marriage, but the trial court attributed it largely to Husband\u2019s partying, drinking, and philandering. Although Wife conceded that she had used drugs with Husband on occasion, she said that this took place only when he brought drugs into the house. (Husband argued that Wife, too, lived well, but the trial court did not appear to find his testimony in this regard significant or credible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) Wife testified that Husband had \u201canother life going on [that she] didn\u2019t know about,\u201d which included heavy drinking, drug use, and affairs. He was rarely home at night, and she testified that she suspected he was with other women.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The marriage was volatile well before the couple separated for the last time. Wife testified that in 2006, she got a phone call in the middle of the night from a woman claiming to be Husband\u2019s girlfriend. Husband was out of the house, and Wife tracked him down by calling <em>another </em>romantic interest of Husband, with whom he was out at the time. Wife threw his belongings onto the front lawn and he moved out of the house, but they reconciled several months later. Mr. Kogok recalled admonishing Husband at one point that he should not be staying out so late, and should be spending evenings at home with his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The parties separated for good on July 1, 2011.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Wife filed for divorce in June 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">5. Proceedings in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The court held a four-day hearing in July 2013, at which Husband, Wife, and numerous other witnesses testified, and issued a written opinion that was docketed on October 9, 2013. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The court granted Wife\u2019s request for divorce, and considered separately child support, alimony, marital property, dissipation of assets, and use and possession of the home, along with Wife\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees. The court\u2019s forty-one page written opinion made detailed findings of fact and decided numerous disputed issues by the parties. Among other things, the court found that Husband \u201clack[ed] credibility\u201d overall, pointing out that \u201c[h]is testimony was substantially challenged.\u201d It lay the blame for the marriage\u2019s deterioration almost solely at Husband\u2019s feet: \u201cThe Court also finds that this is a rare case in which the \u2018circumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties\u2019 weighs heavily in that, but for [Husband\u2019s] actions and mistakes, particularly his substance abuse, proclivity for other women, and late night partying, the marriage might still be intact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">We discuss the trial court\u2019s specific factual findings in greater detail as necessary for our analysis, but highlights included the following decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\u2022 The court awarded use and possession of the family home to Wife, at least until their youngest daughter graduated from high school or turned nineteen;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">\u2022 The court found that Husband had failed to disclose and had dissipated assets, spending over $2,000 per month on food and drink for the six months leading up to trial, and over $90,000 in that same time period on undefined \u201cliving expenses\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">\u2022 The court valued Wife\u2019s interest in Park Place at $76,710 (adopting Wife\u2019s expert\u2019s proposed valuation, as opposed to Husband\u2019s expert, who put the value of her interest in the business at over $400,000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">\u2022 The court awarded Wife $78,000 to account for Husband\u2019s decision to finance the purchase of a home for his daughter with proceeds from his IRA/Retirement account, and nearly $132,000 \u201cas an adjustment of the equities between the parties\u201d (which the court backed up with a chart explaining its rationale);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\u2022 The court awarded indefinite alimony to Wife of $4,500 per month;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">\u2022 The court ordered Husband to pay child support of $4,927 per month; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">\u2022 The court awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Wife in the amount of $65,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Husband filed a Motion to Reopen the Case, along with a Motion to Alter or Amend. The court denied both on November 18, 2013. Husband filed a timely Notice of Appeal on December 9, 2013, and Wife filed a cross-appeal on December 13, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Husband attacks the circuit court\u2019s first- and second-level findings of fact and conclusions of law. The standard of review differs for these varied conclusions, and we look at the decisions through different lenses depending on their character. But overall, Husband attacks the trial court\u2019s decisions\u2014 from the character of the UBS payments to its broader decision to award indefinite alimony \u2014 as punitive rather than grounded in fact, and that theme runs through his whole brief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree. As Husband contends, it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>been improper for the court to award indefinite alimony as punishment for how he behaved over the course of the marriage. But that is not what happened; instead the court made credibility findings that it then used to support its legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Specifically, the court found Husband\u2019s testimony not to be credible in a number of areas: <em>first, </em>his lifestyle (both when he was married and after the separation); <em>second, </em>his role in Park Place and the limited success of the bar; and <em>third, </em>his assertions that the UBS payments constituted loans that Husband never considered income. The court\u2019s view of Husband\u2019s credibility in all those areas necessarily, and appropriately, affected its conclusions (and therefore we recount Husband\u2019s testimony in those areas in some detail here and above). Because the court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous, and because its disposition of the case \u2014 including those issues raised in Wife\u2019s cross-appeal \u2014 fell within the bounds of the circuit court\u2019s discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">A. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion When It Awarded Wife Indefinite Alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme favors fixed-term, \u201crehabilitative\u201d alimony rather than indefinite alimony. <em>See Blaine v. Blaine, </em>336 Md. 49, 68, 646 A.2d 413 (1994). But a court may award indefinite alimony in two different circumstances, one of which is at issue here: where, \u201ceven after the party seeking alimony will have made as much progress toward becoming self-supporting as can reasonably be expected, the respective standards of living of the parties will be unconscionably disparate.\u201d FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>We review indefinite alimony awards at more than one level. <em>First, </em>we review the trial court\u2019s findings of fact as to questions such as <em>what </em>a party\u2019s income is (referred to as \u201cfirst-level\u201d facts) and reverse them only if clearly erroneous. <em>Wenger v. Wenger, </em>42 Md.App. 596, 607, 402 A.2d 94 (1979). <em>Second, </em>while the question of whether the standards of living between spouses will be unconscionably disparate is a factual one as well, <em>Whittington v. Whittington, </em>172 Md.App. 317, 337, 914 A.2d 212 (2007), it is not a \u201cfirst-level\u201d fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">It is a second-level fact ... that necessarily rests upon the court\u2019s first-level factual findings on the factors [in FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b) ] that ... are relevant to all alimony determinations, and \u201call the factors ... necessary for a fair and equitable award\u201d; and upon how much weight the court chooses to give to its various first-level factual findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 337-38, 914 A.2d 212 (quoting FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)). Whether or not economic disparity will exist in the future requires the trial court to \u201cprojec[t] forward in time to the point when the requesting spouse will have made maximum financial progress, and compar[e] the relative standards of living of the parties at that future time.\u201d <em>Francz v. Francz, </em>157 Md.App. 676, 692, 853 A.2d 839 (2004) (citing <em>Roginsky, </em>129 Md.App. at 146, 740 A.2d 125); <em>see also Blaine, </em>336 Md. at 64, 646 A.2d 413 (noting that the statutory language \u201cin effect requires] ... the court [to] make a prediction as to the success of the dependent spouse\u2019s efforts to become self-sufficient\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">A mathematical disparity, standing alone, does not mandate indefinite alimony \u2014 the FL \u00a7 11-106(b) factors drive the analysis. <em>Ware v. Ware, </em>131 Md.App. 207, 232, 748 A.2d 1031 (2000). \u201cThe interplay of those factors may frequently have a strong bearing on whether a particular disparity can fairly be found to be an unconscionable disparity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232-33, 748 A.2d 1031; <em>see also Innerbichler v. Innerbichler, </em>132 Md.App. 207, 248, 752 A.2d 291 (2000) (affirming indefinite alimony award, noting that \u201cunconscionable equitable disparity is more than a numerical calculation\u201d (citing <em>Ware, </em>131 Md. App. at 229, 748 A.2d 1031), and affirming trial court\u2019s \u201ccareful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>analysis of the various equitable considerations\u201d). The factors cover a wide range of considerations about the parties and their earning capacity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">(1) the ability of the party seeking alimony to be wholly or partly self-supporting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">(2) the time necessary for the party seeking alimony to gain sufficient education or training to enable that party to find suitable employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">(3) the standard of living that the parties established during their marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">(4) the duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">(5) the contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">(6) the circumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">(7) the age of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-12\">(8) the physical and mental condition of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-13\">(9) the ability of the party from whom alimony is sought to meet that party\u2019s needs while meeting the needs of the party seeking alimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-14\">(10) any agreement between the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-15\">(11) the financial needs and financial resources of each party, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-16\">(i) all income and assets, including property that does not produce income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-17\">(ii) any award made under \u00a7\u00a7 8-205 and 8-208 of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-18\">(iii) the nature and amount of the financial obligations of each party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-19\">(iv) the right of each party to receive retirement benefits; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-20\">(12) [other considerations not relevant here.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-21\">FL \u00a7 11-106(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-22\">Husband attacks several parts of the court\u2019s decision on indefinite alimony, and we organize his complaints slightly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>differently than he did in his brief. We look <em>first </em>at whether the trial court\u2019s finding that the UBS payments were not loans but actually incentive bonuses was clearly erroneous; <em>second, </em>whether the court erred in finding (as part of its examination of the FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b) factors) that Wife was partially self-supporting and that Husband had the ability to pay alimony, and whether it examined the correct standard of living; and <em>third, </em>whether the court abused its discretion in finding an unconscionable disparity, which supported the ultimate decision to award indefinite alimony under \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">1. The trial court\u2019s characterization of the UBS payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Husband contends that the trial court erred in finding that the UBS payments constituted marital property rather than a loan. He claims specifically that UBS characterized the payments as loans, and that portions of the loan would only be forgiven if he continued to work at UBS. He points to Schedule F, which he introduced at trial, as demonstrating that 77 percent of the UBS loan paid to him as of the date the parties separated ($1.67 million) remained outstanding ($1,286,720). That is, he had yet to pay back this money, and in his view, it does not constitute marital property because he will not actually acquire <em>ownership </em>of those funds until the entirety of the loan is forgiven, something that would not happen until November 2019, and only then if he remains employed by UBS. He complains that the court simply did not believe him, and from there the court\u2019s characterizations of the UBS payments were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Wife counters that whatever label attaches to the UBS payments, the fact is that UBS paid Husband \u201cover $2.2 million between November 2010 and February 2013,\u201d and that the payments were structured for tax purposes. She also points out that the trial court\u2019s findings regarding Husband\u2019s income were bolstered by the fact that he earned additional income above and beyond the UBS payments \u2014 for example, his paystub from July 2013 reflected that he earned over $238,000 in the first half of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>The trial court did not err when it characterized the UBS payments as income. The court became keenly aware of the unusual circumstances surrounding this unusually large payment and its complicated structure, and considered the testimony of Husband\u2019s experts, but also looked through that testimony to conclude that the payments really served as an incentive rather than a loan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">This case presents a special issue of how to treat the extra or additional income received by [Husband] with his work at UBS. After the testimony of the parties and both parties\u2019 experts, <em>it is the Court\u2019s opinion that these payments are in fact \u201cbonuses\u201d or \u201cincentive payments\u201d and should therefore be treated as an asset. </em>[Husband\u2019s] own expert, Mr. Estabrook, stated that [Husband\u2019s] so-called \u201cloan\u201d is \u201cforgiven for services rendered\u201d each year. Furthermore, after review of the relevant documents and testimony, the Court is aware that <em>the actual amount of money [Husband] owes under the terms of the \u201cPromissory Note\u201d is actually offset by the amount he receives on a concurrent date under the relevant \u201cTransition Agreement,\u201d </em>which includes the accrued interest. Under the terms of the Transition Agreement, UBS actually pays [Husband] an amount to cover both the \u201cloan\u201d payment and the applicable interest that is owed on such payments on the date it becomes due.... [Husband] is therefore paid to pay back the loan, and does not expend anything out of his own funds, except the taxes on the year the transition payment is received. <em>[Husband] himself stated that \u201cwe always lived off the loan, \u201d indicating that the parties used it as a source of income.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9g\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Husband claims that the trial judge erred in not crediting his version of the loan, and that the judge \u201cmade it clear he did not believe a thing that Husband said.\u201d But this was the trial court\u2019s prerogative. Husband presented an expert who attempted to establish that the loans were \u201cdebts,\u201d but the court was free to discount his testimony or not to credit it at all. <em>Walker v. Grow, </em>170 Md.App. 255, 275, 907 A.2d 255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>(2006) (\u201cThe weight to be given the expert\u2019s testimony is a question for the fact finder.\u201d) We agree with Husband that \u201conly assets acquired during the marriage are marital.\u201d FL \u00a7 8-201(e)(1). But we disagree with his claim that under <em>Harper v. Harper, </em>294 Md. 54, 448 A.2d 916 (1982), he \u201cobtained possession of the ... loan during the marriage, [but] did not acquire ownership in that portion of the funds until the anniversary date over the next nine years.\u201d Nor does the label UBS and Husband put on the payments compel us to override the circuit court\u2019s findings, particularly when Husband and Wife did not just \u201cpossess,\u201d but actually <em>spent </em>the proceeds during the marriage, a reality that characterizing them as loans would ignore.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Husband also cites <em>McCleary v. McCleary, </em>150 Md.App. 448, 822 A.2d 460 (2002), a case in which the husband incurred significant debt during the marriage and argued that the trial court\u2019s marital property award (of more than $2 million) failed to account for his negative net worth. We reversed, reasoning that the court had, in fact, failed to consider the husband\u2019s $4.6 million liability to his former company, and also did not account for over $1 million in tax liability. <em>Id. </em>at 459-60, 822 A.2d 460. Husband argues that <em>McCleary </em>should have compelled the trial judge here to \u201crecognize ... Husband\u2019s debt,\u201d which in turn would have led the trial court to conclude, \u201cas the [Court of Special Appeals] did in <em>McCleary, </em>that [Husband] was insolvent and had a negative net worth.\u201d But Husband oversimplifies that case and skips an essential analytical step: in <em>McCleary, </em>the husband had introduced specific evidence of indebtedness. Here, on the other hand, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>arrangement has a very different structure, and the Letter of Agreement specifically contemplates that UBS will forgive the outstanding sums as Husband continues in his job (the record does not suggest, nor does Husband argue, that he has any intention of leaving early). Unlike <em>McCleary, </em>the character of Husband\u2019s financial relationship with UBS was in dispute from the beginning, and we disagree that the court abused its discretion in resolving those disputes as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">2. FL \u00a7 11-106 factors</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Husband claims that the trial court reached incorrect conclusions about several of the factors it was required to consider in the indefinite alimony equation. <em>First, </em>we disagree that the court erred in concluding that Wife was only partially self-supporting (per \u00a7 11-106(b)(1)). Although Husband attacks a number of the specific entries on Wife\u2019s financial statement, it is not our job to second-guess the circuit court\u2019s fact-finding. And the court\u2019s reasoning was based not just on the financial statement, but also on Wife\u2019s testimony about the jobs that were reasonably available to her in her area of expertise. Husband attempts to suggest that the court \u201caccepted the fact that Wife was only working <em>part-time </em>(between 24 and 30 hours a week)\u201d (emphasis in original), but that is not, in fact, what the court said. The court explained that Wife \u201cworks approximately 32-25 hours per week (not including the 16 hours per week she works at Severna Park Tap House, with no pay). <em>Due to the nature of her business, and the travel time and so forth, she is only able to bill approximately 2h to 30 hours per week.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The court hardly failed to \u201cdo the math\u201d: it simply saw the facts differently than Husband did. Indeed, even Husband\u2019s expert agreed that \u201cnobody is capable of billing all of their hours. Everybody puts in additional hours beyond the amount that they\u2019re billing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The court also was free not to credit the claim by Husband\u2019s expert, Steve Shedlin, that Wife could make a net income of about $110,000 a year (or \u201cobtain full time employment for about $104,000.00 per year for 40 hours per week.)\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>court pointed out that Mr. Shedlin served as a vocational rehabilitative expert, and that his work \u201cusually involves assisting persons with disabilities to find full-time employment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Mr. Shedlin never interviewed Wife, and did not limit his research to Wife\u2019s specific area of expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Wife points out, too, that the trial court\u2019s conclusion was not far off Mr. Shedlin\u2019s in any event, so to the extent the trial court might have made any mathematical errors (and we do not agree that it did), they were harmless and had no effect on the bottom line. Mr. Shedlin testified that Wife could earn in the range of $180,000 to $242,000 per year if she were self-employed, but he also agreed on cross-examination that \u201cif she works for somebody else, she gets a job and she doesn\u2019t go out and open up on her own and have to incur all of her own expenses, she can make $110,000 a year.\u201d He conceded that the salaries for the jobs available to Wife fell in the range of $85,000 to $105,000. And this backed up Wife\u2019s testimony, and her exhibit from a website that she claimed was the \u201cgo-to\u201d website for finding jobs in her area, that she only had the ability to earn between $85,000 and $104,000, the maximum earning capacity in her field. The trial court also found Wife\u2019s testimony about her billing rates \u201ccompelling.\u201d We see no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision to adopt an earnings figure for Wife in the lower end of the range Husband\u2019s expert proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\"><em>Second, </em>we disagree with Husband that the court did not properly assess the parties\u2019 standard of living during the marriage pursuant to FL \u00a7 11-106(b)(3). Although the court may have muddied slightly the period of time it considered when establishing their standard of living, this really bore on whether Husband dissipated assets, a question not before us. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The court supported its findings by citing numerous facts demonstrating that the parties enjoyed a high standard of living during the marriage, not just by Husband after they separated. The court specifically noted the purchase of the bar and a million-dollar home, jewelry and other luxuries, and family vacations and entertainment expenses, and Wife\u2019s testimony was consistent with his in this regard. (She explained that when she and Husband were married, \u201c[w]e weren\u2019t really wanting for anything. We got to go to [restaurants] and basically wherever we wanted.\u201d) We will not disturb these first-level factual findings on appeal absent clear error, and we perceive none.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><em>Finally, </em>the court did not err when it disagreed with Husband\u2019s (purely factual) claim that he lacked the ability to pay alimony under FL \u00a7 11-106(b)(9). Again, Husband\u2019s expenditure of $90,000 for undefined \u201cliving expenses\u201d over the six months preceding trial was relevant primarily to the question of whether he dissipated marital assets. But those payments also bore on whether he had an ability to pay alimony, and the fact that he could not account for that much money over a six-month period gave the court more than adequate reason to believe that he could have paid, but chose not to.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Husband also is incorrect that the trial court inappropriately awarded alimony as a punitive measure. <em>See Strawhorn v. Strawhorn, </em>49 Md.App. 649, 657, 435 A.2d 466 (1981) (\u201cEven though culpability can be considered in the granting or denying of alimony, alimony cannot be awarded strictly as a punitive measure.\u201d), <em>vacated, on other grounds, </em>294 Md. 322, 450 A.2d 490 (1982). Even in <em>Strawhom, </em>we reiterated that \u201c[t]he fault that destroyed the marital relationship can be considered [as an element of an award] when it affects the economic needs of the party seeking alimony,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citing <em>Kingsley v. Kingsley, </em>45 Md.App. 199, 209, 412 A.2d 1263 (1980)), and that is all the court did here. Wife testified, for example, that she had no interest in purchasing the bar that ultimately became not just a source of marital discord, but a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>significant drain on their finances. The court acted well within its discretion in finding that Husband was the driving force behind that decision and more responsible for its impact, and that he was at fault in many other ways for the relationship\u2019s breakdown. These decisions might have had a detrimental <em>effect </em>(in Husband\u2019s view) on the overall outcome, but the court\u2019s reasons were appropriate under the law (not least because Husband\u2019s inability to pay was caused by his own failure to set aside any part of the UBS payments for even the short-term future).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">3. The court did not err in finding an unconscionable disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Husband claims that \u201c[t]he evidence is glaring that should [Husband] stop working for UBS, he would be obligated to repay all of the sums received from the date his employment ceased through the end of the term of the loan.\u201d We review the finding of unconscionable disparity as a question of fact and under a clearly erroneous standard. Maryland Rule 8-131(c). Then, we review the decision to award indefinite alimony under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Roginsky v. Blake-Roginsky, </em>129 Md.App. 132, 143, 740 A.2d 125 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The court based its decision to award indefinite alimony here not just on the UBS payments, but on other factors under FL \u00a7 11-106(b) that Husband fails to mention. <em>First, </em>as to whether Wife could become self-supporting (FL \u00a7 11\u2014 106(b)(2)), the record supports the court\u2019s finding that Wife could not gain more education or training to allow her to enter a more lucrative profession without sacrificing her current profession: \u201cObtaining these additional certifications or ongoing continued education programs, however, will come at a cost to her. In addition, as a business owner, she would be required to take time off from work in order to go forward with any of these certification or continuing education programs, which would cause her to lose additional salary, on top of the out-of-pocket costs for such classes or programs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>Second, </em>as to the parties\u2019 \u201ccontributions to the well-being of the family,\u201d (FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(5)), while both parties contributed to the marriage by working, they agreed at trial that Wife had assumed primary responsibility for helping the children with homework, taking them to after-school activities, and generally tending to their day-to-day needs. The court pointed out that Husband did coach some of the children\u2019s sports teams, but also noted Wife\u2019s testimony that Husband \u201coften stayed out late, liked to party and drink and sometimes would not come home\u201d \u2014 behavior that played a major role in the relationship\u2019s breakdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><em>Third, </em>as to the \u201ccircumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties,\u201d (FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(6)), the court blamed Husband for the deterioration of the marriage, both generally and as it examined this factor in the context of indefinite alimony. Although Husband obviously disagrees, this is a factual finding that was supported by the record and that was not clearly erroneous. The court noted Husband\u2019s \u201chistory of inappropriate interactions with other women,\u201d and the confrontation in February of 2006 that led to the first separation. The court summed it up well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">Although multiple witnesses testified to the tumultuous relationship of the parties throughout the years, the testimony of both parties and other witnesses leads this Court to believe that the nature of this \u201cvolatile\u201d relationship was mainly due to [Husband\u2019s] inappropriate behavior throughout the duration of the marriage. Therefore, it is appropriate for the Court to draw the inference that [Husband\u2019s] behavior was what ultimately led to the break-up of the marriage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The court also pointed to the fact that Wife had no opportunity to save for retirement, whereas Husband had \u201ca valuable deferred compensation plan, retirement and pensions benefits and stock options through his employment at UBS.\u201d The court took into account numerous factors in concluding that \u201cequity and justice and [Wife\u2019s] financial needs make her a candidate for alimony,\u201d and the trial court properly considered and weighed the indefinite alimony factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>B. Husband Did Not Ask The Trial Court To Find A Constructive Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Husband claims that he asked the trial court to create a \u201cconstructive trust\u201d for him in the bar as an equitable solution to what he views as Wife\u2019s unfair majority ownership in Park Place. He claims that, as a matter of fact, he funded the purchase of the bar, did the work to refurbish it, and that he should reap the benefits of ownership. We agree with Wife, though, that Husband waived this argument early in the trial (if it was properly before the circuit court at all). At the beginning of his opening statement, counsel for Husband raised the issue of a constructive trust, but he did not actually ask the court to do anything in connection with it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">Your Honor, before we begin, ... [f]irst of all, as the Court may have been aware of from reviewing the file, there was a separate lawsuit that my client had filed against [Wife], seeking the Court to establish a constructive trust of the LLC interests that are in dispute in this case. It was denied recently by [a different judge.] We just wanted to for the record object to that. We believe that the basis that we set forth in that original motion asking the Court to consolidate that case with this case is appropriate. So if the Court would like any further on that or I can prepare to move on, as well. I just want it known for the record that we are objecting to the Court\u2019s denial of the consolidation with the constructive trust case with the divorce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Wife\u2019s counsel replied that the issue had been decided by another judge, in a ruling that the trial judge hearing the divorce proceeding did not have \u201cany right to reconsider,\u201d and Husband had not filed a motion to reconsider in the other case. Wife\u2019s counsel replied that \u201c[Husband] may not like it, but until they file a motion to reconsider with the Court \u2014 an appeal or something like that, the ruling stands,\u201d and Husband\u2019s counsel conceded the point: \u201cUnderstood, Your Honor. I wanted to put that on the record. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">We do not really see the purpose of counsel simply putting this on the record, and if anything his specific mention of it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>without actually seeking the remedy of a constructive trust, effectively waived the issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, although Husband <em>did </em>ask the court to award him 77% of the property under the marital award, that was a different request and one that the court adequately considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Even if we were to consider the argument, though, Husband would lose on the merits. He cites <em>Gosman v. Gosman, </em>271 Md. 514, 517-18, 318 A.2d 821 (1974), but overlooks an important and distinguishing factor: there, as even Husband concedes, \u201cthe parties had no written agreement as to their ownership interest\u201d in the disputed property. Here, on the other hand, the Park Place LLC agreement (that Wife only entered into reluctantly, and at Husband\u2019s behest) affirmatively vested majority ownership in her <em>in order to circumvent ethical limitations imposed by Husband\u2019s employer. </em>We find it inappropriate to look to extrinsic evidence for the purposes of (a) establishing an \u201cintent\u201d that contradicts the unambiguous documents, and (b) giving Husband the benefit, via court order in an equitable proceeding, of a financial relationship he could not ethically have entered.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>C. The Trial Court Properly Found Husband In Contempt For Failing To Pay Child Support.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In February 2013, Husband received a payment from UBS totaling $600,000. Wife testified that despite receiving this money, Husband had not kept current with his child support payments and was $11,064 in arrears at the time of trial. The court agreed, and found Husband in contempt of the parties\u2019 consent order. Husband appeals that decision, arguing that he had already made the payment by depositing it into an account the parties had designated for child support payments, but that Wife\u2019s failure to pay a credit card led the creditor (UBS) to take money out of the account directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Again, this finding was entirely one of fact, and we do not disturb the trial judge\u2019s decision unless clearly erroneous. The court explained its reasoning: Husband had been ordered to pay Wife a total of $56,000 in child support under the consent order, representing four months of arrears and advance support payments for December 2012 through March 2013. Wife testified that Husband still owed over $11,000. Husband argued that UBS had automatically removed nearly $10,000 from a credit card account where Husband had placed the support payment, and that he should not be punished by having to \u201cdouble-pay,\u201d when Wife was at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Husband\u2019s position at trial, and here, suggests a certain arrogance that may well have come through to the trial court, given its credibility findings. It is not up to <em>Husband </em>to determine whether a garnishment by a third party constitutes a payment of his child support obligations, when the Consent Order required that he pay child support directly to Wife. We will not substitute our own judgment for that of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">D. We Will Not Consider Issues Raised For The First Time In Husband\u2019s Reply Brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">In response to Wife\u2019s eighteen-page merits brief, Husband submitted a twenty-seven page reply brief in which he not only attempted to rebut Wife\u2019s responses to <em>his </em>issues on appeal, but also raised new issues that we will not consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>here. The purpose of a reply brief is to <em>reply </em>within the boundaries established by first, the appellant\u2019s brief and then, more narrowly, the appellee\u2019s brief. <em>See Federal Land Bank of Baltimore, Inc. v. Esham, </em>48 Md.App. 446, 459-60, 406 A.2d 928 (1979) (\u201cThe reply brief must do what it purports to do: it must respond to the points raised in the appellee\u2019s brief which, in turn, are addressed to the issues <em>originally </em>raised by the appellant.\u201d). Here, though, Husband newly attacked the court\u2019s finding that he dissipated marital assets and, for the first time, disputed the trial court\u2019s calculations in that regard. He did the same thing when he claimed that the trial court \u201cerred in valuing various assets used in its monetary award calculation,\u201d and in attempting to revive factual questions about litigation between Park Place and the Verizon Center about the alleged purchase of a skybox, especially when he attached documentation that did not appear in the trial court here (which, incidentally, would have been equally improper if it had been attached to his original brief). He mounted a new challenge to the trial court\u2019s transfer of a Porsche to Wife. And he argued that the child support award is incorrect for the <em>additional </em>reason that Wife made misrepresentations on her financial statement regarding claimed expenses for the couple\u2019s daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">None of these arguments appeared in Husband\u2019s opening brief, which raised narrow appellate questions about the character of the UBS payments, the award of indefinite alimony, and the contempt finding. Had we reversed or vacated the trial court\u2019s decisions on any of those issues, that decision would have required us to vacate the court\u2019s other financial decisions. But we are affirming the trial court\u2019s findings on the issues Husband properly challenged, and we will not disturb any other parts of the court\u2019s opinion, least of all the parts that Husband did not attack until too late in the game.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">E. Wife\u2019s Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Wife filed a cross-appeal in which she argues that the trial court erred when it used the wrong figure for alimony on the child support guidelines worksheet. Of course, in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>\u201cabove-guidelines\u201d case like this, the child support guidelines are advisory, and the trial court specifically (and correctly) recognized that it had discretion to set child support and, as courts often do in these situations, the court extrapolated a \u201cpossible child support level consistent with [Husband\u2019s] high income.\u201d <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 12-204(d) (\u201cIf the combined adjusted actual income exceeds the highest level specified in the [basic child support obligation] schedule, the court may use its discretion in setting the amount of child support.\u201d) The court considered the children\u2019s \u201ceconomically privileged\u201d circumstances in reaching an ultimate figure of $4,927 per month. The change Wife seeks would have increased Husband\u2019s monthly payment by less than $200, and the need for these payments has been eliminated by the only minor child\u2019s eighteenth birthday on April 28, 2014. We decline to disturb the court\u2019s discretionary decision now.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Did the court abuse its discretion in granting Wife indefinite alimony when the testimony and evidence showed that Husband had no ability to pay alimony, Wife was self-supporting, Wife failed to prove an unconscionable disparity in standards of living if alimony was not awarded, the court focused on a period six months prior to separation to determine the parties' pre-separation \"standard of living\u201d based on debt, and in light of the two monetary awards and other property transferred to Wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-15\">III. Did the court err when it failed to find a constructive/resulting trust for Husband's interest in the bar when all funds came from loans Husband was solely responsible for, Husband was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the party who worked to rehab the bar and hire personnel and the testimony supported the parties\u2019 intention that Husband own the bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">IV. Did the Court err when it found Husband in contempt in the absence of any intent by Husband to violate a court order and failed to credit Husband for the $9,827.63 which Husband could not pay from the agreed upon account when Wife\u2019s sole debt and failure to pay her credit card resulted in UBS garnishing that amount from the account?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\">. In <em>Harper, </em>the Court of Appeals held (in connection with real property, but the definition applies equally here) that the term \"acquired\u201d in the statute means that \u201ccharacterization of property as nonmarital or marital depends upon the source of each contribution as payments are made, rather than the time at which legal or equitable title to or possession of the property is obtained.\u201d <em>Harper v. Harper, </em>294 Md. 54, 80, 448 A.2d 916 (1982). But again, adopting Husband\u2019s argument would require us to supersede the trial court\u2019s factual findings with a finding of our own that some part of the UBS payments did not constitute non-marital property, a leap we decline to make.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\">. Although Husband complains that the trial judge improperly believed \"everything Wife said,\u201d and \"stretched to give Wife every benefit of [the] doubt,\u201d the trial judge's role is to assess the credibility of the parties. The court was not required to find Mr. Shedlin credible merely because he was an expert; that finding, which we agree appeared often in the trial court\u2019s opinion, obviously affected how the court viewed the evidence and framed the factual conclusions it reached.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b193-6\">. That another judge had already denied Husband the remedy he seeks here suggests that <em>res judicata </em>might bar the trial court from considering the issue, too, but that question has not been raised before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\">. Husband\u2019s citation to <em>Levin v. Levin, </em>43 Md.App. 380, 405 A.2d 770 (1979), likewise fails to help him. There, we held that where a couple had invested jointly in a liquor store, but only the husband\u2019s name appeared on the lease, the wife could still share in the benefits of ownership by way of a \"resulting trust.\" We explained that a \"resulting trust is an implied trust which rests upon the presumed intention of the parties,\" and that a trial court can effectively create such a trust when one party furnishes consideration, but the other takes legal title, \"provided the circumstances surrounding the transaction do not demonstrate a contrary intention by the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 405 A.2d 770. But the court pointed out not only the heavy burden borne by a party seeking to establish a resulting trust, but also reiterated that the question for the chancellor there (the fact-finding equivalent of the trial court here) was a factual one: \"We must accept the chancellor\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous,\" and \"[t]he credibility of the witnesses was for him to determine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386, 405 A.2d 770. So <em>Levin\u2019s </em>applicability depends entirely on factual findings that, in this case, do not support Husband\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
