Twenty-one years later, on April 18, 2012, skeletal remains later identified as Christine\u2019s were found buried under the backyard shed of the home on Claire Drive in Howard County in which Christine had previously resided with her husband, Robert A. Jarrett, Jr. (\u201cJarrett\u201d). In the evening of April 18, 2012, Jarrett was placed under arrest. Jarrett was subsequently charged with murder and associated crimes relating to Christine\u2019s death. Following a jury trial, Jarrett was convicted of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>On appeal, Jarrett raises four issues for our review, which we have rephrased slightly as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">1. Whether the circuit court erred by permitting the State to play for the jury certain recordings of jail calls between Jarrett and his son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">2. Whether the circuit court abused its discretion by declining to give a jury instruction on the gross negligence variation of involuntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">3. Whether the circuit court abused its discretion by giving a concealment of evidence jury instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">4. Whether the circuit court abused its discretion by declining to give a \u201cmissing evidence\u201d jury instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">For the following reasons, we answer each question in the negative. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Howard County.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">The following evidence was adduced at trial. Jarrett and Christine were high school sweethearts who married in 1974. In 1983, they moved to 6050 Claire Drive, in the Elkridge area of Howard County. They had two children, Robert Jarrett, III (\u201cBobby\u201d) and Michael Jarrett, ages ten and five, respectively, at the time of Christine\u2019s disappearance in 1991. Jarrett worked in the HVAC industry, and Christine was employed in a factory until she suffered a work-related injury in the late 1980s, after which she became a full-time homemaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">The Jarretts\u2019 marriage suffered from frequent quarrels over money, and both Jarrett and Christine had engaged in extramarital affairs. Bobby described his parents\u2019 marriage as \u201ctumultuous\u201d and saw his father push his mother to the floor during an argument on at least one occasion. Christine\u2019s friends, Donna Madera, Marsha Smallwood, Cindy Fryer, and Cindy Travis, were aware of Christine\u2019s unhappiness with respect to her marriage. Christine had made comments to Madera and Smallwood about wanting to leave and not return, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>but, according to Christine\u2019s friends, Christine was a devoted mother who would not have left her sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Patricia Mueller, Christine\u2019s sister, remembered a particular altercation between Christine and Jarrett in June of 1990. Christine called Patricia and Patricia\u2019s son, David, in tears and asked them to pick her up from a nearby drugstore. Patricia and David went to pick up Christine. When they arrived at the drugstore, the side of Christine\u2019s face was red and swollen, Christine had a cut on the bridge of her nose, and Christine\u2019s glasses were broken. Christine told Patricia and David that Jarrett and she had argued about an outfit she planned to wear to a neighborhood barbeque. Christine further described how Jarrett had grabbed and beaten her. Patricia and David encouraged Christine to go to the emergency room and seek medical attention for her injuries, but Christine refused, saying that she did not want to get Jarrett in trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">On January 4, 1991, when Bobby woke up to get ready for school, Christine was nowhere to be found in the family\u2019s home. Bobby saw Jarrett sleeping on top of the covers of the bed, fully dressed. Bobby remembered thinking it was unusual for Jarrett to be home on a weekday. In the evening of January 4, 1991, Jarrett contacted neighbors and friends, explaining that he was looking for Christine because she had left the previous evening following an argument and failed to return. Jarrett contacted the police after he learned that none of Christine\u2019s friends had heard from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The following day, Officer Thomas O\u2019Connor met with Jarrett. Jarrett completed a missing persons report. Officer O\u2019Connor noted that Jarrett was \u201cextremely concerned and emotional.\u201d The case was turned over to Detective Steve Greisz after Christine failed to return within several days. Detective Greisz met with Jarrett on January 7, 1991. Jarrett told Detective Greisz about Christine and Jarrett\u2019s history of marital discord, including a separation for several months in mid-1990. Jarrett told Detective Greisz that on the evening of January 3, 1991, Christine and he had argued about finances. According to Jarrett, he went to sleep in the base<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>ment following the argument. Later that evening, Jarrett went up to the bedroom, but Christine was not there. Jarrett explained that Christine had not returned the next morning. Jarrett showed Detective Greisz a bank withdrawal slip showing that Christine had withdrawn $4,200.00 in cash <em>from </em>a bank account in mid-December of 1990. In his report, Detective Griesz noted, \u201cno physical, no push, in past \u2014 yes\u2014hit her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Detective Greisz continued to investigate Christine\u2019s disappearance by meeting with Christine\u2019s friends and family members. On January 9, 1991, Detective Greisz met with Norman Raines, a former high school friend of Christine\u2019s with whom Christine had a brief affair in 1990. Raines told Detective Greisz that he had spoken to Christine on several occasions in late 1990, but initially, Raines did not mention a sexual relationship. Raines told Detective Greisz that he was engaged in recreational \u201cshooting\u201d at Fort Meade on January 3, 1991. When Detective Greisz met with Raines again on September 25, 1991, Raines acknowledged that Christine and he had engaged in sexual relations in October of 1990. Raines told Detective Greisz that Christine had initially contacted him in the summer of 1990. According to Raines, Christine would call him once a week and tell him she loved him. Raines further explained that Christine and he had several lunches together. Raines acknowledged that Christine had told him that she \u201csometimes\u201d thought about taking her money and leaving town.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Raines was called as a witness by the defense at trial and testified that he had a brief affair with Christine in 1990. He further testified that the last time he saw Christine was on December 21, 1990. Raines denied killing Christine or burying her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Forensic analysis performed at the Jarretts\u2019 home of the basement, stairs, and a mobile home owned by the Jarretts tested negative for blood. Detective Greisz testified that, to the best of his recollection, he had not gone around the outside of the Jarrett property. Christine\u2019s medical and dental rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ords were entered into a missing persons database and, within a year, the investigation was classified as inactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Jarrett began a relationship with Martha Jarrett (\u201cMartha\u201d), his second wife, some months after Christine\u2019s disappearance. Jarrett told Martha that his relationship with Christine had not been \u201chealthy\u201d and that Christine and he had discussed divorce before Christine went missing. Martha and Jarrett married in June 1993 and their daughter was born in October 1993. Martha had a difficult relationship with Jarrett\u2019s sons and, as a result, Bobby moved out of the home in 2005. Martha and Jarrett ultimately separated in or around December 2011. Jarrett vacated the home on Claire Drive while Martha continued living at the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Jarrett\u2019s siblings, Brian and Donna, did not have a good relationship with Martha. On January 25, 2012, Jarrett engaged in a relevant email conversation with Brian and Donna. A printout of the email thread was admitted into evidence at trial. The siblings were discussing a location for a family dinner. The following conversation occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">Jarrett: Yanna, You better hurry up with the Kitchen project cause Char[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] said something Sunday about our next dinner date with gf[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] was going to be at your house next.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACI\">Donna: Lock Martha in the shed and have it on Claire Drive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">Brian: Oh my.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">Donna: Was that wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">Jarrett: I might need a bigger shed, its [sic] getting crowded in there, should I put her beside the one that\u2019s already in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">Brian: It wouldn\u2019t be soon enough!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">Brian testified that \u201cYanna\u201d was a nickname Jarrett used for their sister, Donna, and that no one else used that nickname. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Brian further testified that he interpreted Jarrett\u2019s comment to be a joke.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Special Investigator Nicholas DeCarlo had assumed responsibility for Christine\u2019s case by 2005. Investigator DeCarlo was a retired detective from Montgomery County who was employed in a civilian capacity by the Howard County Police to investigate cold case homicides. In April 2012, Investigator DeCarlo became aware that Martha and Jarrett had separated and that Jarrett had left the Claire Drive residence. On April 17, 2012, Investigator DeCarlo went with Detective J. Daniel Lenick to meet with Martha at the home. They explained that they were investigating Christine\u2019s disappearance and asked for permission to search the property, including the shed and the ground beneath it. Martha consented to the search. During their search, Investigator DeCarlo and Detective Lenick observed that the shed had plywood floors and determined that additional tools were needed. They secured permission from Martha to return the following day with appropriate tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Investigator DeCarlo and Detective Lenick returned the following morning accompanied by a forensic technician. They removed the plank flooring of the shed and found approximately six inches of gravel below. They continued to dig and discovered a four-foot by two-foot, oval-shaped concrete slab with material embedded inside. They found what appeared to be human bone and stopped the excavation until a search warrant could be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">A warrant was secured later that day. Investigator DeCarlo, Detective Lenick, and Office of the Medical Examiner (\u201cOME\u201d) representatives returned to the Claire Drive residence and continued the excavation. Skeletal remains were found under the concrete block. Dr. William Rodriguez, an independent consultant for the OME and an expert in the area of forensic anthropology, supervised the removal of the remains. The deceased appeared to have been wearing a Disney shirt but had no undergarments or shoes. Personal items were recovered adjacent to the remains, including a jacket, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>jewelry, purse, eyeglasses, photos of family members, and a Mickey Mouse wallet containing photographs and the name \u201cMichael\u201d in child-like handwriting. Several of the personal items were identified by Christine\u2019s family members as items that belonged the Christine, and various individuals confirmed that Christine had visited Disney World multiple times and often brought back Disney souvenirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Following the recovery of the remains, Jarrett was placed under arrest on the evening of April 18, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">An autopsy was performed on April 19, 2012 by Assistant Medical Examiner Dr. Patricia Aronica-Pollack. Dr. AronicaPollack identified the deceased as Christine by comparing the teeth to Christine\u2019s dental records. Evaluation of the skeletal remains showed no signs of trauma, asphyxiation, or disease. Dr. Aronica-Pollack was unable to ascertain a cause of death, but she did determine that the manner of death was homicide. At trial, Dr. Aronica-Pollack testified that there are \u201chomicidal causes of death\u201d that cannot be determined in circumstances when \u201cthe soft tissues are gone.\u201d Dr. Aronica-Pollack explained that it is possible for a person to have died from a gunshot wound, stabbing, blunt force trauma, or asphyxiation without any damage to the bones. Dr. Aronica-Pollack issued an informal report to Investigator DeCarlo and the State\u2019s Attorney on May 2, 2012 and issued her official written report on June 7, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">After the autopsy was complete, the OME released Christine\u2019s remains to the family. Bobby and Michael planned to cremate the remains, but they contacted Investigator DeCarlo before pursuing the cremation to ask whether it was acceptable to proceed with the cremation. Investigator DeCarlo advised Bobby that cremation would not interfere with the investigation. Christine\u2019s skeletal remains were cremated shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Jarrett\u2019s case proceeded to trial on April 9-23, 2013. Jarrett was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to thirty years\u2019 incarceration. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Additional facts will be included as necessitated by our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">At trial, the State sought to play recordings of certain telephone calls between Jarrett and his son, Michael, for the jury. In one conversation, Michael asked Jarrett to assist \u201cmoney-wise\u201d for the cremation of \u201cmom.\u201d Jarrett agreed to help with cremation expenses. Defense counsel objected to the conversations being played for the jury, arguing that the defense was unable to cross-examine Michael. Defense counsel further argued that the conversations included inadmissible hearsay. The prosecutor countered that Michael\u2019s statements were not hearsay because they were not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. The prosecutor further argued that Jarrett\u2019s statements were admissible as tacit admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The trial court permitted the recordings to be played, ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">But the argument and I\u2019m accepting it so we\u2019re getting near the end of this, is that by not saying, you want money from me to cremate somebody I don\u2019t know, is an admission, tacit admission that he knows whose remains they are and that he agrees that they\u2019re the mother\u2019s remains because that\u2019s what he\u2019s been told and he\u2019s been asked to finance or contribute to the cremation. That\u2019s the argument. Also, I\u2019ll note, during opening the Defense told the jury that the State destroyed the evidence. You used the word destroyed the evidence. And the State I think has a \u2014 is permitted to indicate that the Defendant, either individually or the Defense as a group but certainly the Defendant was aware of the impending disruption, if that\u2019s what the Defense wants to use. I don\u2019t use that word but the impending cremation. So I think it\u2019s admissible for two different reasons. Any final words? I\u2019m going to overrule the objection and allow it in[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Recordings of portions of four telephone calls were played for the jury, and transcripts of the recordings were entered into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">On appeal, Jarrett asserts that the trial court erred by permitting the April 24, 2012 conversation to be played for the jury. First, Jarrett argues that the conversation was not relevant. Second, Jarrett argues that the conversation contained inadmissible hearsay and the tacit admission exception to the hearsay rule does not apply. In response, the State argues that the conversation contained relevant information. The State further contends that the statements made by both Michael and Jarrett were not hearsay because they were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. In the alternative, the State argues that if Jarrett\u2019s statements were hearsay, they were admissible under the party-opponent exception to the hearsay rule. We agree with the State that the recordings were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The April 24, 2012 telephone conversation that was played for the jury included the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">Michael: Um, Bobby got a phone call from the M.E. today and they released mom\u2019s remains and I think we\u2019re going to ... you there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">Jarrett: Yeah, I\u2019m listening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">Michael: Oh, okay, um, I think we\u2019re going to go ahead and get her cremated, um, Frank\u2019s helping us out with all that kind of stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">Jarrett: Um-hum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">Michael: Would you be able to help us out with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aem\">Jarrett: Money-wise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">Michael: Yeah[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-13\">Jarrett: Yeah, how much you looking at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-14\">Michael: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know yet, that\u2019s (inaudible) but T mean, I\u2019ll let you know ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-15\">Jarrett: Okay[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-16\">Michael: before we do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-17\">Jarrett: Yeah[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Michael: Okay, alright.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">Jarrett: How, how soon is all that going to happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">Michael: Urn, well, the funeral home has her now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">Jarrett: Has what?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">With respect to the relevance of the telephone conversation, we note that \u201c \u2018[rjelevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5^101. The issue of whether the skeletal remains were, in fact, Christine\u2019s remains was raised at trial, and defense counsel had further argued that evidence was \u201cdestroyed\u201d when the remains were cremated \u201cbefore [the defense] could get it.\u201d The telephone recording was relevant because Jarrett arguably acknowledged that the remains were Christine\u2019s by agreeing to contribute financially to the expenses for the cremation of \u201cmom.\u201d Furthermore, the telephone recording was relevant to show that Jarrett was aware that his sons were planning to move forward with Christine\u2019s cremation. Jarrett, however, did not ask his sons to delay the cremation, nor did Jarrett take any other steps to postpone the cremation. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by determining that the telephone recording was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Turning to Jarrett\u2019s contention that the recording contained inadmissible hearsay, we note that all out-of-court statements are not necessarily hearsay. \u201cHearsay\u201d is defined as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Md. Rule 5-801(c). \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by [the Maryland] rules or permitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes, hearsay is not admissible.\u201d Md. Rule 5-802. Despite the general rule against hearsay, certain out-of-court statements are admissible. Indeed, we have explained that \u201c[a]n out-of-court statement is admissible <em>if it is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted </em>or if it falls within one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Handy v. State, </em>201 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>521, 589, 30 A.8d 197 (2011) (quoting <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132,158, 729 A.2d 910 (1999)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Our review of the record reveals that none of Michael\u2019s statements in the recording were offered for their truth. Michael\u2019s statements were not offered to prove that Michael and Bobby were planning to have Christine\u2019s remains cremated, that Frank was helping with arrangements, or that the funeral home had the remains at the time. Rather, Michael\u2019s statements were offered to show their effect on Jarrett. Accordingly, because Michael\u2019s statements were offered for a non-hearsay purpose, the circuit court did not err in admitting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">With respect to Jarrett\u2019s statements, several of the statements were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Several of the phrases uttered by Jarrett were questions rather than statements. Jarrett\u2019s questions could not have been admitted for the truth of the matter asserted because the questions did not assert any truth. Rather, the questions asked by Jarrett were introduced to prove that Jarrett, in fact, asked those particular questions of Michael. To the extent that Jarrett\u2019s statements constitute hearsay, however, they are admissible as statements of a party-opponent. Maryland Rule 5-803(a) provides that \u201c[a] statement that is offered against a party and is: [t]he party\u2019s own statement, in either an individual or representative capacity\u201d is excluded from the hearsay rule. Accordingly, Jarrett\u2019s statements, which were offered into evidence by the State, were admissible. Because the telephone recordings contained relevant evidence, which was admissible either as non-hearsay or as an exception to the rule against hearsay, the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion by admitting the telephone recordings into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\"> Jarrett\u2019s second contention is that the circuit court erred by denying his request for a jury instruction on the gross negligence form of involuntary manslaughter. Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>land Rule 4-325(c) provides that \u201c[t]he court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law[.]\u201d We review \u201ca trial court\u2019s refusal or giving of a jury instruction under the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Stabb v. State, </em>423 Md. 454, 465, 31 A.3d 922 (2011). The Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">We consider the following factors when deciding whether a trial court abused its discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny a request for a particular jury instruction: (1) whether the requested instruction was a correct statement of the law; (2) whether it was applicable under the facts of the case; and (3) whether it was fairly covered in the instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Gunning v. State, </em>347 Md. 332, 351, 701 A.2d 374 (1997)). \u201cThe burden is on the complaining party to show both prejudice and error.\u201d <em>Tharp v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 319, 329, 742 A.2d 6 (1999), <em>aff'd, </em>362 Md. 77, 763 A.2d 151 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">When determining whether the trial court abused its discretion by declining to give a particular jury instruction, we consider the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">Judicial discretion is a composite of many things, among which are conclusions drawn from objective criteria; it means a sound judgment exercised with regard to what is right under the circumstances and without doing so arbitrarily or capriciously. Where the decision or order [of the trial court] is a matter of discretion it will not be disturbed on review except on a clear showing of abuse of discretion, that is, discretion manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds, or for untenable reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-9\"><em>Bazzle v. State, </em>426 Md. 541, 549, 45 A.3d 166 (2012) (quoting <em>Stabb, supra, </em>423 Md. at 465, 31 A.3d 922 (quoting <em>In re Don Mc., </em>344 Md. 194, 201, 686 A.2d 269 (1996))).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">In the present case, the parties do not dispute that Jarrett\u2019s proposed instruction on the gross negligence variation of the involuntary manslaughter was a fair statement of law that was not otherwise covered in the instructions actually given. The only question is whether the gross negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>variation of the involuntary manslaughter instruction was applicable under the facts of the case. The requested instruction, Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 4:17:8B (2nd ed. 2012), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">The defendant is charged with the crime of involuntary manslaughter. In order to convict the defendant of involuntary manslaughter, the State must prove:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">(1) that the defendant acted in a grossly negligent manner; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">(2) that this grossly negligent conduct caused the death of (name).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">\u201cGrossly negligent\u201d means that the defendant, while aware of the risk, acted in a manner that created a high risk to, and showed a reckless disregard for, human life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Regarding when a particular instruction is generated by the evidence, the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">A requested jury instruction is applicable if the evidence is sufficient to permit a jury to find its factual predicate. As we said in <em>Dishman v. State:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">The threshold determination of whether the evidence is sufficient to generate the desired instruction is a question of law for the judge.

The court explained that \u201c[t]he difficulty [it was] having ... [was that] in order for an involuntary manslaughter instruction to go, there has to be some evidence that [Jarrett] did something and was grossly negligent doing it, which caused [Christine\u2019s] death ... Here we don\u2019t have anything except for [a] statement that there was a verbal argument.\u201d The trial court ultimately concluded that a gross negligence variation of involuntary manslaughter instruction was not generated by the evidence, ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">[W]hen the evidence is generated, I\u2019m obligated to give the instruction. And there\u2019s nothing, nothing here to suggest what, if anything, Mr. Jarrett did to cause the death, specifically the death of Christine Jarrett, as far as being gross negligence or conduct like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">I mean, the evidence here from the State\u2019s perspective is that he suffocated her and they\u2019ll argue the inferences to be drawn from the evidence that\u2019s actually in as opposed to\u2014 and there\u2019s going to be a fine line that we\u2019re all going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>enjoy visiting tomorrow during closing no doubt about where \u2014 what has been generated as an inference and what is mere and pure speculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">I mean, by way of example if the Defense gets up and starts arguing that she fell down stairs, that\u2019s kind of hard to draw into anything that you can draw an inference from. It\u2019s one thing to say, are you convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that she didn\u2019t fall down the stairs for example. But if you start speculating that she did, well \u2014 and I\u2019m using that because I don\u2019t know of anything that\u2019s been said that could possibly be supportive of] using that speculative way of death, but who knows. I might be wrong about that, too. I\u2019m not making any preliminary rulings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">But I don\u2019t know of any evidence period that would support gross negligence as a form of involuntary manslaughter, and as I said, I\u2019ll think about it overnight. And you all can do your research.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">During jury instructions, the trial court instructed the jury on involuntary manslaughter but declined to give an instruction on the specific gross negligence variation. The court instructed the jury on involuntary manslaughter as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWW\">The defendant is charged with the crime of involuntary manslaughter. A person does not have to intend to kill or intend to inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result when he commits the act that causes the death to be found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. In order to convict the defendant of involuntary manslaughter, the State must prove: (1) the defendant committed an assault upon Christine Jarrett; (2) that the defendant killed Christine Jarrett; and, (3) that the act resulting in the death of Christine Jarrett occurred during the commission of the assault upon Christine Jarrett.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Having carefully reviewed the record in the present case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to instruct the jury on the gross negligence variation of involuntary manslaughter. As the trial court found, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>was no evidence presented to suggest that Jarrett was grossly negligent by acting in a manner that created a high risk to, and showed a reckless disregard for, human life. Because there was no evidence which would demonstrate Jarrett acted in a grossly negligent manner, the requested instruction was not generated by the evidence. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion by declining to give the gross negligence variation of the involuntary manslaughter instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Jarrett\u2019s third contention is that the circuit court abused its discretion by propounding a concealment of evidence jury instruction. As discussed <em>supra, </em>we review the trial court\u2019s decision to provide a concealment of evidence instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>Stabb, supra, </em>423 Md. at 465, 31 A.3d 922. Jarrett takes issue with the trial court\u2019s concealment instruction for two reasons. First, Jarrett asserts that the instruction erroneously implied that Jarrett was guilty of the crimes charged. Second, Jarrett asserts that the concealment instruction was not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The trial court propounded the following concealment of evidence instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">You have heard that the defendant concealed and/or destroyed evidence in this case. Concealment or destruction of evidence is not enough by itself to establish guilt, but may be considered as evidence of guilt. Concealment or destruction of evidence may be motivated by a variety of factors, some of which are fully consistent with innocence. You must first decide whether the defendant concealed and/or destroyed evidence in this case. If you find that the defendant concealed and/or destroyed evidence in this case, then you must decide whether that conduct shows a consciousness of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Jarrett contends that, because the trial court\u2019s instruction included a reference to the jury having \u201cheard that <em>the defendant </em>concealed and/or destroyed evidence,\u201d the instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>tion \u201cwas tantamount to a statement of guilt.\u201d We are unpersuaded by Jarrett\u2019s attempt to place unreasonable emphasis on two words in the first sentence of the trial court\u2019s instruction. The instruction, viewed as a whole, was proper. First, we note that the instruction given by the court is a verbatim reading of Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 3:26.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The pattern instruction, like the instruction given in this case, provides language instructing jurors that they \u201chave heard that the defendant _ evidence in this case.\u201d We have explained that \u201c[ajlthough the use of a pattern jury instruction does not insulate a conviction against review, it is a factor in our analysis.\u201d <em>Yates v. State, </em>202 Md.App. 700, 723, 33 A.3d 1071 (2011), <em>aff'd, </em>429 Md. 112, 55 A.3d 25 (2012). Indeed, we have repeatedly \u201crecommended that trial judges use the pattern instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Minger v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 157, 161 n. 1, 849 A.2d 1058 (2004) (\u201cAppellate courts in Maryland strongly favor the use of pattern jury instructions\u201d); <em>Green v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 758, 771, 736 A.2d 450 (1999) (recommending that trial judges give pattern jury instructions)). Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s instruction explicitly informed the jury that it \u201cmust first decide whether the defendant concealed and/or destroyed evidence.\u201d We, therefore, hold that the instruction, viewed as a whole, was proper and did not impermissibly imply that Jarrett was guilty of the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>We now turn to Jarrett\u2019s contention that the concealment instruction was not generated by the evidence. As discussed <em>supra, </em>a particular instruction is generated by the evidence \u201cwhen a defendant can point to some evidence\u201d that supports the instruction. <em>Malaska, supra, </em>216 Md.App. at 517, 88 A.3d 805. Jarrett asserts that there was no evidence presented of post-crime behavior that reflects a consciousness of guilt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Significant evidence was presented at trial upon which a jury could have concluded that Jarrett concealed Christine\u2019s body by burying it under the floor of the shed in his backyard. Cindy Fryer, a friend of Christine\u2019s, testified that shortly after Christine disappeared, she observed Jarrett build a wooden shed around an older metal shed in the backyard, after which Jarrett \u201ctore the metal shed out.\u201d Fryer further testified that within two to three months after Christine\u2019s disappearance, she observed empty concrete bags outside of Jarrett\u2019s shed. Furthermore, evidence was presented that Jarrett had referred, in an email, to locking Martha in a shed. Jarrett commented that he \u201cmight need a bigger shed\u201d because it was \u201cgetting crowded in there,\u201d and asked whether he \u201c[sjhould put [Martha] beside the one that\u2019s already in there.\u201d Our review of the record leads us to conclude that there was ample evidence presented upon which a reasonable jury could have determined that Jarrett buried Christine under the floorboards of his shed and encased her remains in concrete.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Jarrett argues that a concealment instruction is only appropriate when the jury can draw four specific inferences which were set forth by the Court of Appeals in <em>Thompson v. State, </em>393 Md. 291, 311-12, 901 A.2d 208 (2006). In <em>Thompson, </em>the Court of Appeals adopted the approach that a flight instruction should not be given unless the four inferences set forth by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>United States v. Myers, </em>550 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir.1977), can reasonably be drawn. The four inferences are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">(1) from the defendant\u2019s behavior to flight; (2) from flight to consciousness of guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged to actual guilt of the crime charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><em>Thompson, supra, </em>393 Md. at 312, 901 A.2d 208 (quoting <em>Myers, supra, </em>550 F.2d at 1049).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We note that Jarrett points to no cases applying the factors set forth in <em>Thompson </em>to a concealment rather than a flight instruction. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the <em>Thompson/Myers </em>factors apply, we hold that the four inferences can be reasonably drawn based upon the evidence. A fact-finder could have reasonably concluded that Jarrett concealed Christine\u2019s remains beneath the shed, encased the remains in concrete, and made jokes about doing so in an email many years after Christine\u2019s murder. Furthermore, a fact-finder could have inferred that this behavior suggested consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged, and that the consciousness of guilt implied actual guilt of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Accordingly, we hold that the concealment of evidence instruction did not erroneously imply that Jarrett was guilty of the crimes charged. Further, because the concealment instruction was supported by the evidence presented at trial, the circuit court neither erred nor abused its discretion by propounding the concealment of evidence instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Jarrett\u2019s final contention is that the circuit court abused its discretion by declining to give a missing evidence instruction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Jarrett asserts that such an instruction was warranted because the State permitted the release and subsequent cremation of Christine\u2019s remains before the defense had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the opportunity to seek an independent evaluation. Jarrett argues that because of the State\u2019s actions, he was deprived of the opportunity to have his own experts evaluate the remains for purposes of identification and cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">As discussed <em>supra, </em>we review the trial court\u2019s decision not to propound the missing evidence instruction applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Stabb, supra, </em>423 Md. at 465, 31 A.3d 922. The Court of Appeals has explained that a missing evidence instruction \u201cis designed to draw a jury\u2019s attention to a simple, straightforward premise: that \u2018one does not ordinarily withhold evidence that is beneficial to one\u2019s case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cost v. State, </em>417 Md. 360, 370, 10 A.3d 184 (2010) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Litzenberg, </em>115 Md.App. 549, 562, 694 A.2d 150 (1997)). A missing evidence \u201cinstruction does not require that a jury make an adverse inference in situations involving the spoliation of evidence; rather, it merely permits such an inference.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Whether to give a missing evidence instruction is a decision within the trial court\u2019s broad discretion. <em>Patterson v. State, </em>356 Md. 677, 688, 741 A.2d 1119 (1999). The Court of Appeals has explained that \u201cregardless of the evidence, a missing evidence instruction generally need not be given; the failure to give such an instruction is neither error nor an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although a trial court is required to instruct the jury on the applicable law in a case, a trial court is not generally required to instruct the jury as to facts and inferences. <em>Id. </em>at 684, 741 A.2d 1119. The Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">\u201cThe failure to grant an affirmative instruction does not remove the availability of the inference. As a consequence, whatever prejudice may usually come from not giving an advisory instruction is diminished, because the inferential thought process is still available. The prejudice is simply that such an inference is not given preferred instructional attention over any other inferences available from the testimony or absence of testimony. Possibly for that reason, judges hesitate to grant the missing witness instruction; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>they do not wish to emphasize one legitimate inference over all others which the jurors have been told are solely within their judgment.\u201d <em>Yuen v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 109, 114, 403 A.2d 819[, 823] (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 685, 741 A.2d 1119 (1999) (quoting <em>Bailey v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 594, 611-12, 493 A.2d 396 (1985)). Indeed, despite the trial court\u2019s decision not to give a missing evidence instruction, the jury was still free to infer that the destroyed evidence would have been detrimental to the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Our research has unearthed only one case in which the Court of Appeals found that a trial court abused its discretion by failing to give a missing evidence instruction. <em>See Cost, supra, </em>417 Md. 360, 10 A.3d 184. In <em>Cost, </em>a defendant was charged with crimes arising from the stabbing of a fellow inmate in a prison cell. 417 Md. at 363, 10 A.3d 184. Before the crime scene could be examined, the cell was cleaned by prison officials and no physical evidence \u2014 -such as towels, bedding, and blood-stained clothing \u2014 was preserved. <em>Id. </em>at 366-67, 10 A.3d 184. The Court of Appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to give the missing evidence instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 382, 10 A.3d 184. The Court emphasized that the case was \u201cnot typical\u201d and had \u201cunusual facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380, 10 A.3d 184. The Court further explained that the type of evidence destroyed was \u201chighly relevant evidence in [the State\u2019s] custody that it normally would have retained and submitted to forensic examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 10 A.3d 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\"><em>Cost </em>is readily distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Cost, </em>the crime scene was cleaned rather than preserved. In the present case, the crime scene was preserved, evidence was submitted for testing, and the remains were subject to an autopsy. In <em>Cost, </em>the Court emphasized that the destroyed evidence was evidence that normally would have been retained. Here, there is no indication of any regular practice of retaining remains following an autopsy. To the contrary, testimony from Dr. Patricia Aronica-Pollack established that it is the Office of the Medical Examiner\u2019s regular practice to release remains to family members after an autopsy is com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>pleted. Indeed, there are strong policy reasons to support this practice in order to give closure to the deceased\u2019s family and loved ones.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">We further note that there was no evidence presented at trial that <em>the State </em>destroyed evidence or allowed the destruction of evidence. Rather, the Office of the Medical Examiner released Christine\u2019s remains pursuant to its departmental policy. Thereafter, Christine\u2019s sons decided to cremate the remains. Furthermore, we note that Jarrett was notified of the impending cremation before it occurred, when Michael asked him to contribute financially to the cremation expenses, and Jarrett acquiesced.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Jarrett further asserts that the cremation of Christine\u2019s remains constituted State action because Christine\u2019s sons conferred with Investigator DeCarlo prior to cremating Christine\u2019s remains. Investigator DeCarlo testified that he did not have authority over the release of the remains; rather, release of remains was at the discretion of the Office of the Medical Examiner. Investigator DeCarlo simply answered the fami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ly\u2019s inquiry appropriately by telling Michael and Bobby that cremation would not interfere with the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Under the circumstances, the circuit court acted within its discretion when it declined to propound a missing evidence instruction. Whether to provide such an instruction with respect to a factual inference is a decision for the trial court. We will not second-guess the trial court\u2019s decision to decline giving such an instruction. Moreover, Christine\u2019s remains were properly released to her family members pursuant to department policy. The State had no affirmative duty to preserve the remains after the autopsy was completed. Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by declining to give Jarrett\u2019s requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In sum, we reject Jarrett\u2019s contentions with respect to all four issues raised. We hold that the circuit court did not err by permitting the State to play highly relevant recordings of certain jail calls between Jarrett and his son. We further reject Jarrett\u2019s contentions with respect to jury instructions. We hold that the circuit court neither erred nor abused its discretion by declining to propound a jury instruction on the gross negligence variation of involuntary manslaughter when such an instruction was not generated by the evidence. Furthermore, we hold that the circuit court acted within its discretion when it propounded a concealment of evidence jury instruction. Finally, we hold that the circuit court neither erred nor abused its discretion by declining to propound a missing evidence jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-13\">. \"Char\u201d was a reference to Charlotte, Jarrett\u2019s mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-14\">. \"Gf\u201d was a reference to Jarrett's new girlfriend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\">. In his brief, Jarrett asserts that the trial court's instruction was based on Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 3:24. He is mistaken. The trial court's instruction was a verbatim reading of Maryland Criminal Pattern Juty Instruction 3:26, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">You have heard that the defendant_evidence in this case.

The instruction Jarrett requested was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-11\">If you find that the State destroyed evidence or allowed the destruction of evidence, namely the remains alleged to be those of Christine Jarrett, you may infer that the destroyed evidence was unfavorable to the State's case. In order to infer that the destroyed evidence was unfavorable to the State, you must find that the State either destroyed the evidence or allowed the destruction of the evidence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\">. We note further that we are not necessarily convinced that Christine\u2019s remains constitute evidence that would be subject to a missing evidence instruction. A California state court addressed a similar issue in <em>People v. Vick, </em>11 Cal.App.3d 1058, 90 Cal.Rptr. 236 (1970). In <em>Vick, </em>a defendant argued that his due process rights were violated when he was unable to conduct his own post mortem examination of the remains because the remains had been released to the family and cremated after the State\u2019s autopsy. The <em>Vick </em>court observed: \"There is a clear distinction between examination of physical evidence such as handwriting exemplars, fingerprints, written statements, and the body of a human being. The former are susceptible of examination without the likelihood of outrage to the emotional feelings of the living. As reflected in our laws, our society extends more respect to a dead body than to other physical evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240. Accordingly, the <em>Vick </em>court held that due process did not require that a coroner retain possession of a body until a defendant requests permission to conduct his own autopsy examination. <em>Id. </em>at 242. Although we need not reach a conclusion on this particular issue, we note that it is an open question whether human remains constitute evidence for which a missing evidence instruction could be given when the remains are released by the medical examiner before the defendant requests permission to conduct an independent evaluation of the remains.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
