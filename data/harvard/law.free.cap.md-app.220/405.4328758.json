The tenants, appellants Thomas A. Huggins (\u201cThomas\u201d) and his company, TAH, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>(\u201cTAH\u201d), contend that the landlord has no such right; the landlord, a related family business by the name of Huggins &amp; Harrison, Inc. (\u201cH &amp; H\u201d), contends that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The Circuit Court for Montgomery County determined that the pertinent lease provision was unambiguous and, accordingly, declined to consider Thomas\u2019s and TAH\u2019s extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 alleged intentions at the time when they drafted the lease. The court proceeded to declare that, under the language of the pertinent provision, H &amp; H did not have the right to terminate the lease at the time when Thomas and TAH first filed this suit, but that the right to terminate had arisen during the pendency of the suit. Thomas and TAH took this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Thomas and TAH raise two issues on appeal, which, for clarity and concision, we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">I. Did the circuit court err in ruling that the termination provisions of the lease were unambiguous and in excluding extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 alleged intentions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">II. Did the circuit court issue an improper advisory opinion concerning H &amp; H\u2019s right to terminate the lease on the basis of events that occurred during the pendency of the litigation? <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">For the reasons that follow, we find no error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">We recount the facts in the light most favorable to H &amp; H, the party that prevailed below. <em>Green v. McClintock, </em>218 Md.App. 336, 341, 97 A.3d 198 (2014); <em>L.W. Wolfe Enters., Inc. v. Maryland Nat\u2019l Golf L.P., </em>165 Md.App. 339, 343, 885 A.2d 826 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">A. The Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Thomas is the president of TAH. Thomas and TAH run a gasoline and service station, as well as a U-Haul franchise, at the property located at 10619 Connecticut Avenue, in Kensington, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">H <em>&amp; </em>H is a Maryland corporation and is the owner and landlord of the property. Before his death in 1993, Thomas\u2019s father, Francis M. Huggins Jr., owned all of the shares in H &amp; H. Upon Mr. Huggins\u2019s death, his shares went to his wife, Helen H. Huggins, who became H &amp; H\u2019s president.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Mrs. Huggins transferred some of her shares to her children during her lifetime, but remained the majority shareholder until her death on November 13, 2009. Upon Mrs. Huggins\u2019s death, the remaining shares of H <em>&amp; </em>H went to each of her children in equal percentages. Hence, Thomas is a shareholder of H &amp; H, as are the other Huggins siblings: William Huggins (\u201cWilliam\u201d), Harold Huggins, Marion Coleman, Elizabeth Ann Pender, Patricia Mudgett, and Linda Huggins (via an irrevocable trust).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">B. Prior Rental Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Thomas has operated the gasoline and service station at the property since approximately 1986. At first, Thomas operated the station pursuant to a verbal agreement between himself and his late father. Under that agreement, Thomas paid an initial base rent of $2,500 a month. In or about 1993, that amount increased to $3,500 a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">In 1993, a few months before Thomas\u2019s father died, he allegedly signed no fewer than three different leases for the property, none of which are fully completed and executed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Thomas failed to produce a version with the original signatures affixed, and he and his sister Linda acknowledged that some of the blanks on some of the documents were filled in after their father\u2019s death. Other than Linda and Thomas, none of the Huggins siblings knew of any of the 1998 leases at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The other siblings first learned of a 1993 lease some years later, when Thomas told his sister Patricia Mudgett about a potential sublease for the property. Ms. Mudgett, a realtor, informed Thomas that he could not sublease the property because he had no lease. Thomas evidently responded by showing her a lease, but he also admitted to her that he had filled in the blanks. In 2002, Ms. Mudgett and her younger brother William questioned the validity of the 1993 lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">On May 9, 2002, Mrs. Huggins, as president of H &amp; H, signed a formal lease for the property. The lease provided for an initial term of six years, to be followed by six successive terms of six years each (for a total of 42 years). The new lease did not prohibit Thomas from subleasing the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">When Thomas\u2019s siblings learned of the lease, they discussed its implications with their elderly mother. As a result of those discussions, Mrs. Huggins signed an affidavit stating that she had not understood the terms of the lease. In addition, she demanded that Thomas terminate the lease, which he did on June 15, 2002. William then presented Thomas with another lease, which Thomas refused to sign. Consequently, there was, at that time, no valid lease for the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">By this time, in the early 2000s, H &amp; H was cash poor and was struggling financially. In the summer of 2002, Helen Huggins and family members discussed this problem, and each member was encouraged to find the \u201chighest and best use\u201d for the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">At about this time, William became aware that Montgomery County was undertaking a zoning study of Kensington\u2019s master plan. In light of the potential change to the plan, William explored possibilities for the property that were consistent with the goal of \u201chighest and best use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>C. The Current Lease Documents</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">On October 16, 2002, Thomas and H &amp; H (through his mother, Mrs. Huggins) executed temporary lease documents that would apply until the parties could reach a final determination about the property. The parties signed the documents in anticipation of a trip to Europe that Mrs. Huggins planned to take for several months in late 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The temporary lease provided that if Mrs. Huggins did not return from her trip, Thomas would have a six-year lease with the option to renew the lease for two successive leasehold terms of six years each, \u201cand for an additional leasehold term thereafter of two [] years in duration.\u201d Under this lease, Thomas would have no right to sublease the property. On the other hand, if Mrs. Huggins did return, the lease provided that it would terminate automatically on May 31, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">After Thomas\u2019s mother returned safely from her trip, the parties signed an extension of the October 2002 lease, effective May 31, 2003, so that negotiations could continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">On August 27, 2003, Thomas (individually and as president of TAH) and Helen Huggins (as president of H &amp; H) signed an addendum. The addendum extended all terms of the October 2002 lease, subject to several new conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Specifically, according to sections 2(a)-(d) of the addendum, the lease would terminate upon the first of the following events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">(a) The appropriate Government officials allow or require a zoning change for the Premises, or a building permit is issued for the development of the Premises, at which time the parties will renegotiate this Lease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">(b) Tom [Thomas] shall no longer be personally involved in the day-to-day operating of a gas station on the Premises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">(c) The Lessee [Thomas] shall be in violation of the terms of this Lease; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">(d) Upon thirty (30) days written notice of termination from the Lessee [Thomas] to the Lessor [H &amp; H],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>In summary, the current lease documents consist of the lease of October 16, 2002, the extension of May 31, 2003, and the addendum of August 27, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">D. H &amp; H\u2019s Efforts to Develop the Property</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Between 2003 and 2005, H &amp; H explored various plans to redevelop the property, with and without a service station. Eventually, however, Mrs. Huggins decided not to proceed with the plans because of her advanced age and the financial risks that were associated with the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">E. Mrs. Huggins\u2019s Death, and H &amp; H\u2019s Effort to Renegotiate the Lease</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Helen Huggins died in November 2009, and her son William succeeded her as H <em>&amp; </em>H\u2019s president in January 2010. Thereafter, in July 2011, the Huggins siblings met to discuss what to do with the property. The siblings decided that the property would be advertised for sale or lease. All of the siblings, including Thomas, voted in favor of trying to sell or lease the property \u2014 Thomas stated that he \u201cwould not stand in the way\u201d of a sale or lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">On February 14, 2012, William sent a letter on behalf of H &amp; H to Thomas, citing a right to renegotiate the lease under section 2(a) of the addendum (which, by its terms, is triggered when \u201c[t]he appropriate Government officials allow or require a zoning change for the Premises\u201d). William sent the letter in anticipation of a zoning change for the town of Kensington; he believed that approval was imminent and that a reasonable amount of time would be needed to renegotiate the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">When Thomas did not respond, William sent another letter on March 9, 2012, again requesting renegotiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">On March 20, 2012, the County Council for Montgomery County approved a draft of the Planning Board Kensington Sector Plan, which, among other things, would allow for a zoning change for the property. On March 28, 2012, William sent yet another letter to Thomas, in which he again requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>renegotiation and stated that the Council had taken a formal vote pertaining to this Kensington Sector Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Despite these letters, however, Thomas refused to renegotiate the lease and further indicated that he wanted to pay the same rent ($3,500 a month) that he had been paying since about 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">On April 10, 2012, counsel for H &amp; H sent a letter to Thomas, titled: \u201cNOTICE OF VIOLATION OF LEASE AND LANDLORD\u2019S DESIRE TO REPOSSESS THE LEASE PREMISES.\u201d The letter referred to William\u2019s letter of March 28, 2012, and asserted that Thomas had violated the lease because of (1) his failure to respond to prior requests for lease renegotiation pursuant to section 2(a) of the addendum, and (2) his \u201cfailure to keep the leased premises in a clean, orderly, and sanitary condition, free of trash, junk and debris, and for using adjacent property that is not part of the leased premises for the parking and/or storage of vehicles.\u201d Counsel\u2019s letter notified Thomas of H &amp; H\u2019s desire to repossess the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">F. The Declaratory Judgment Action</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">In response, Thomas and TAH commenced this lawsuit on May 18, 2012, by filing a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. In brief, they contended that the addendum was ambiguous and therefore that the court should consider parol evidence, which, they said, would establish that the parties intended for section 2(a) to be triggered only if government officials required or allowed a zoning change or issued a building permit in response to a request by H &amp; H.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">While the case was pending, in October 2012, Montgomery County officially rezoned the property, as William Huggins had anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">G. The Circuit Court\u2019s Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">After denying H &amp; H\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court conducted a four-day trial. The trial included an extensive airing of the extrinsic evidence on which Thomas relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>The circuit court issued a memorandum opinion and a declaratory judgment on September 24, 2013. Among other things, the court declared that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">(1) the addendum is valid and enforceable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">(2) section 2(a) of the addendum is not ambiguous, vague, or indefinite;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">(3) Thomas and TAH had not materially breached the lease on the grounds asserted in the letters from William and H &amp; H\u2019s counsel in March and April <em>2012 </em>\u2014 i.e., Thomas and TAH had not materially breached the lease by failing to renegotiate the lease because of the mere prospect of a future zoning change or by failing to keep the property in a \u201cclean, orderly, and sanitary condition\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">(4) to require renegotiation of the lease under section 2(a) of the addendum, H &amp; H was not required to make specific requests or applications to Montgomery County or the Town of Kensington for any zoning change;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">(5) Thomas and TAH had no present obligation to renegotiate the lease pursuant to section 2(a), because the triggering zoning changes had not yet occurred when H &amp; H requested renegotiation in early 2012; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">(6) H &amp; H nonetheless was not precluded from demanding that Thomas and TAH negotiate with H &amp; H pursuant to section 2(a), as the triggering zoning change had occurred after the start of the litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">Because the circuit court concluded that section 2(a) was unambiguous, it disregarded Thomas\u2019s and TAH\u2019s extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 alleged subjective intention that the provision would apply only if the \u201cappropriate Government officials allow[ed] or require[d] a zoning change\u201d in response to a request by H &amp; H.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">Thomas and TAH took a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">The Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">The central question in this case is whether section 2(a) of the addendum is ambiguous. \u201c[T]he determination of ambiguity is one of law, not fact, and that determination is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>subject to <em>de novo </em>review by the appellate court.\u201d <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 434, 727 A.2d 358 (1999); <em>accord Ocean Petroleum Co., Inc. v. Yanek, </em>416 Md. 74, 86, 5 A.3d 683 (2010) (quoting <em>Clancy v. King, </em>405 Md. 541, 556-57, 954 A.2d 1092 (2008)) (\u201c \u2018the determination of whether a contract is ambiguous, is a question of law,\u2019 which we review <em>de novo </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">I. The Circuit Court Correctly Concluded that Section 2(a) Was Not Ambiguous</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">A. The Applicable Legal Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\u201cCourts in Maryland apply the law of objective contract interpretation, which provides that \u2018[t]he written language embodying the terms of an agreement will govern the rights and liabilities of the parties, irrespective of the intent of the parties at the time they entered into the contract, unless the written language is not susceptible of a clear and definite understanding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dumbarton Improvement Ass\u2019n v. Druid Ridge Cemetery Co., </em>434 Md. 37, 51, 73 A.3d 224 (2013) (quoting <em>Slice v. Carozza Props., Inc., </em>215 Md. 357, 368, 137 A.2d 687 (1958)). For that reason, \u201c \u2018[a] contract\u2019s unambiguous language will not give way to what the parties thought the contract meant or intended it to mean at the time of execution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dumbarton, </em>434 Md. at 51-52, 73 A.3d 224 (quoting <em>Sy-Lene of Washington, Inc. v. Starwood Urban Retail II, LLC, </em>376 Md. 157, 167, 829 A.2d 540 (2003)). \u201cOur task, therefore, when interpreting a contract, is not to discern the actual mindset of the parties at the time of the agreement, but rather, to \u2018determine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dumbarton, </em>434 Md. at 52, 73 A.3d 224 (quoting <em>Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Daniels, </em>303 Md. 254, 261, 492 A.2d 1306 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">\u201cMaryland law generally requires giving legal effect to the clear terms of a contract and bars the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>prior or contemporaneous agreements or negotiations to vary or contradict a written contractual term.\u201d <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 432, 727 A.2d 358. \u201cUnder the parol evidence rule, a written agreement \u2018discharges prior agreements,\u2019 thereby rendering legally inoperative communications and negotiations leading up to the written contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 213 (1979)). Parol evidence becomes admissible only when \u201cthe written words are sufficiently ambiguous.\u201d <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 433, 727 A.2d 358; <em>accord Dumbarton, </em>434 Md. at 56, 73 A.3d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u201cThe requirement that courts give legal effect to the unambiguous provisions of a contract and the rule that prohibits the admission of parol evidence for ascertaining the parties\u2019 intent provide a necessary legal foundation for the certainty of contracting parties.\u201d <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 432-33, 727 A.2d 358; <em>accord Newell v. Johns Hopkins Univ., </em>215 Md.App. 217, 235-36 (2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>437 Md. 424, 86 A.3d 1275 (2014). \u201cThis is all the more true\u201d in the case of a lease <em>(see Newell, </em>215 Md.App. at 236, 79 A.3d 1009), which, as a document granting an interest in land, is required to be in writing under the Statute of Frauds. Md.Code (1974, 2010 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-103 of the Real Property Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Under the objective view of contracts, \u201ca written contract is ambiguous if, when read by a reasonably prudent person, it is susceptible of more than one meaning.\u201d <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 436, 727 A.2d 358; <em>accord Dumbarton, </em>434 Md. at 53, 73 A.3d 224; <em>Newell, </em>215 Md.App. at 235, 79 A.3d 1009. \u201cThe determination of whether language is susceptible of more than one meaning includes a consideration of \u2018the character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of execution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 436, 727 A.2d 358 (quoting <em>Pac. Indem. Co. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>302 Md. 383, 388, 488 A.2d 486 (1985)). Furthermore, \u201cthe parol evidence rule would not bar a court from considering the context of the transaction or the custom of the trade in a determination of ambiguity.\u201d <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 436, 727 A.2d 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Nonetheless, \u201c \u2018[a]n ambiguity does not exist simply because a strained or conjectural construction can be given to a word.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dumbarton, </em>434 Md. at 53, 73 A.3d 224 (quoting <em>Belleview Constr. Co. v. Rugby Hall Cmty. Ass\u2019n, </em>321 Md. 152, 159, 582 A.2d 493 (1990)). Nor does an agreement become ambiguous merely because two parties, in litigation, offer different interpretations of its language. <em>Diamond Point Plaza Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>400 Md. 718, 751, 929 A.2d 932 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">B. Section 2(a) of the Addendum Is Not Ambiguous</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We could reverse the circuit court for refusing to consider extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 alleged intentions only if, after a plenary, <em>de novo </em>review of the addendum, we concluded that its language, when read by a reasonably prudent person, \u201cis susceptible of more than one meaning.\u201d <em>Calomiris, 353 </em>Md. at 436, 727 A.2d 358. We cannot do so. The language was susceptible of only one meaning, and the circuit court properly interpreted the addendum according to that meaning without regard to any extrinsic evidence that might have indicated otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">As previously stated, under section 2(a) of the addendum, signed by all parties in August 2003, the lease would terminate upon the first of four events, which was that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">(a) The appropriate Government officials allow or require a zoning change for the Premises, or a building permit is issued for the development of the Premises, at which time the parties will renegotiate this Lease....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Notably, the plain language of section 2(a) says nothing to limit its scope only to \u201czoning changes\u201d that \u201c[t]he appropriate Government officials\u201d might \u201callow or require,\u201d or to building permits that the officials might issue, in response to a request by H &amp; H.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">The circuit court examined this section and determined that the language \u201cwas not susceptible of more than one meaning.\u201d Specifically, the court ruled that \u201ca reasonable person at the time of formation would have thought that [section 2(a) ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>would apply whenever a zoning change for the Premises was allowed or required or a building permit was issued for the development of the Premises \u2014 not just for a particular project,\u201d such as the project that H &amp; H briefly explored from around 2003 through 2005. Under this interpretation, the court further ruled that the zoning change that occurred in October 2012 was a \u201csufficient basis\u201d for H &amp; H to terminate the lease and to require Thomas and TAH to engage in renegotiations for a new lease agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">We agree with the circuit court, which reached the proper conclusion by employing the proper analysis. In examining the addendum anew, we hold that section 2(a) meant only that the lease would terminate, and that H &amp; H could require Thomas and TAH to renegotiate a new lease, when the \u201cappropriate Government officials\u201d either \u201callow or require\u201d a \u201czoning change\u201d or issue a building permit. In this regard, we note that had the parties intended to allow H &amp; H to terminate the lease and require a renegotiation only when the officials allowed or required a change or issued a permit that H &amp; H had requested, as Thomas and TAH contend they did, it would have been easy enough to include limiting language to that effect. The absence of any such language confirms the correctness of the circuit court\u2019s conclusion. Neither the circuit court nor we are at liberty to revise the agreement to include language that the parties did not themselves include.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Thomas and TAH expend a great deal of effort in detailing their extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 alleged intentions, but little effort to explain why the final language of the written agreement is ambiguous under the objective approach to contract interpretation. They come closest to an explanation when they argue that the relevant language (\u201c[t]he appropriate Government officials allow or require a zoning change for the Premises, or a building permit is issued for the development of the Premises\u201d) involves \u201cactive terms\u201d that, they say, signify H &amp; H as the \u201cactor in pursuing such efforts.\u201d Their argument has no linguistic foundation: under the plain lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>guage of the clause in question, the \u201cactors\u201d are the \u201cappropriate Government officials,\u201d who take the action of \u201callow[ing] or requiring] a zoning change\u201d and by whom any \u201cbuilding permit\u201d would be \u201cissued.\u201d Nothing in the relevant language envisions or requires that H <em>&amp; </em>H must take any action at all.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Thomas and TAH thus fail to proffer any reasonable alternative meaning to the language of section 2(a). Instead, they decry the circuit court\u2019s alleged failure to \u201cdeal with the meaning of the terms \u2018allow\u2019 and \u2018require,\u2019 \u201d and, even more generally, argue that the court \u201cshould have found [section 2(a) ] \u2018susceptible of more than one meaning\u2019 and therefore, ambiguous.\u201d We are not persuaded: the contractual language was susceptible of only one meaning, the one attributed to it by the circuit court below. To this Court, the use of \u201callow\u201d and \u201crequire\u201d indicates that the triggering zoning change can be the result either of a specific request that is approved by the pertinent government officials or of the government officials\u2019 unsolicited exercise of their regulatory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Thomas and TAH also insist that this Court may examine evidence of the parties\u2019 subjective intentions because a determination of ambiguity requires courts to consider the \u201ccontext of the transaction,\u201d as well as \u201cthe character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of execution.\u201d <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 436, 727 A.2d 358. Thomas and TAH have got it wrong. A consideration of the \u201ccontext of the transaction\u201d and of \u201cthe character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of execution\u201d cannot possibly mean that a court may consider extrinsic evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>order to determine whether an agreement is ambiguous: otherwise, a court could consider extrinsic evidence to determine whether to consider extrinsic evidence, which is absurd. Under Thomas\u2019s and TAH\u2019s contention, a rule of construction would swallow the parol evidence rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">We further reject Thomas\u2019s and TAH\u2019s argument that, even absent any ambiguity, the circuit court nevertheless erred when it interpreted section 2(a) of the addendum without proper regard to the parties\u2019 \u201ctrue\u201d intentions. In essence, Thomas and TAH do no more than ask this Court to arrive at the parties\u2019 intentions by considering extrinsic evidence <em>outside </em>the scope of the addendum and the lease. \u201c[O]ur task,\u201d however, \u201cis to examine the agreement the parties did sign, not the agreement that one or the other now wishes they had negotiated instead.\u201d <em>Newell, </em>215 Md.App. at 242, 79 A.3d 1009. Under the agreement that the parties did sign, the lease terminates, and H &amp; H can require Thomas and TAH to renegotiate, when the \u201cappropriate Government officials require or approve a zoning change,\u201d regardless of whether H &amp; H initiates the change. Accordingly, the circuit court, correctly concluded that the agreement was unambiguous and correctly declined to use \u201cprior or contemporaneous agreements or negotiations to vary or contradict\u201d the written contractual terms. <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 432, 727 A.2d 358. Those \u201cprior or contemporaneous agreements or negotiations\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>were discharged upon the execution of the unambiguous addendum. Id.<footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">II. The Circuit Court Correctly Ruled That H &amp; H Could Rely on Section 2(a) in the Future, as There Was a Justiciable Controversy</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Even though Thomas and TAH commenced this lawsuit by requesting a declaratory judgment, they argue that the circuit court \u201cexceeded [its] proper role and authority\u201d by declaring the parties\u2019 rights and obligations, because, they say, no justiciable controversy was before the court. Thomas and TAH specifically argue that the matter was \u201cunripe,\u201d as \u201cthe state of facts had not yet accrued when the legal decision in this case was sought and demanded by plaintiffs before the circuit court.\u201d Thomas and TAH specifically insist that the court improperly declared that H <em>&amp; </em>H was \u201cnot precluded\u201d from relying on section 2(a) after the litigation, \u201cas defendant, H &amp; H, had neither done so, nor was there any certainty that H &amp; H, as lessor, would do so.\u201d We hold that the circuit court did not err, as there was a justiciable controversy on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Under Md.Code (1974, 2013 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-409(a)(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u201ca court may grant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>declaratory judgment or decree in a civil case, if it will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding, and if ... [antagonistic claims are present between the parties involved which indicate imminent and inevitable litigation[.]\u201d In view of H <em>&amp; </em>H\u2019s assertions that Thomas and TAH had breached the lease and were obligated to renegotiate the lease, as well as H &amp; H\u2019s contemporaneous threats to repossess the property, there is no serious dispute that antagonistic claims were present and that a declaratory judgment would terminate the controversy. Indeed, the declaratory judgment did terminate the controversy about whether Thomas and TAH had breached the lease by failing to keep the property in a \u201cclean, orderly, and sanitary condition\u201d and whether Thomas and TAH were obligated to renegotiate the lease in response to the demands that H &amp; H made in early 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Thomas\u2019s and TAH\u2019s complaint is not so much that the court declared the parties\u2019 rights as it is that the court declared the parties\u2019 rights with respect to events that occurred during the pendency of the litigation \u2014 specifically, the zoning change that occurred in October 2012. We disagree that the circuit court lacked the power to issue that declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The ripeness doctrine prohibits a court from declaring future rights in anticipation of an event that may never happen; thus the doctrine requires a court to desist until the event actually occurs. However, \u201cif a court is satisfied that the \u2018ripening seeds\u2019 of an actual controversy exist, the facts are not too contingent or speculative for declaratory relief.\u201d <em>Boyds Civic Ass\u2019n v. Montgomery Cnty. Council, </em>309 Md. 683, 691, 526 A.2d 598 (1987). The <em>Boyds </em>Court explained that \u201c \u2018ripening seeds\u2019 ... describes a state of facts indicating \u2018imminent\u2019 and \u2018inevitable\u2019 litigation, provided the issue is not settled and stabilized by a tranquilizing declaration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Edwin Borchard, <em>Declaratory Judgments </em>57 (2d ed. 1941)).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Here, the event at issue (the Kensington zoning change) had not yet occurred when H <em>&amp; </em>H first demanded that Thomas and TAH renegotiate, and the zoning change was still in development when Thomas and TAH filed this suit. The parties, however, stipulated that the change had occurred by the time that the circuit court issued its ruling. At that time, the concerns animating the parties had not dissipated. Moreover, according to the interpretation the court had given to section 2(a), it was all but inevitable that further litigation would ensue over whether that provision permitted H &amp; H, in the future, to require renegotiation of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">In light of the certain continuation of the dispute, and the transformation of the zoning change from a mere contingency to an undeniable reality, it would have been irresponsible for the court not to exercise its authority to declare H &amp; H\u2019s future right to require renegotiation of the lease under section 2(a) of the addendum. Because H <em>&amp; </em>H\u2019s rights were based on a state of facts that had already accrued and was neither future, contingent, nor uncertain, the circuit court did not err in issuing a declaration on that subject. <em>Boyds, </em>309 Md. at 690, 526 A.2d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s ruling on this issue, as it was presented with a justiciable controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\">. Thomas and TAH phrased their questions in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-11\">I. The Lower Court Failed to Engage in Proper Interpretation of the Lease Provision at Issue in This Case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-12\">II. Where the Trial Court Failed to Interpret the Lease in Accordance With the Reasonable Interpretation of the Parties at the Time it was Effected, the Court Should Have at Least Found and Declared Ambiguity in the Lease Provision at Issue, [Sub-paragraph 2(a) of the 2003 Addendum to Lease] and, Thereupon, Considered the Substantial Extrinsic Evidence it Appeared to Take at Trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-13\">III. The Court Exceeded the Justiciable Controversy Before it by Rendering Determination Based on Facts Yet to Occur.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\">. Although the addendum is not ambiguous on its face, its meaning might conceivably be ambiguous <em>as applied </em>in various, hypothetical scenarios. For example, there might be ambiguity about whether a zoning change had been required or approved by an \"appropriate\u201d official. Or there might be ambiguity about whether a change was really a \"zoning\u201d change, as opposed to some other type of change in the complex scheme of land-use regulation. There might also be an ambiguity about whether a change had really been approved, or whether the approval was merely tentative or preliminary. On the facts of this case, however, none of those ambiguities have arisen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\">. The court considered the \"context of the transaction\u201d and \"the character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of execution\u201d when it considered the long history of Thomas\u2019s leasehold interest in the property, as well as the intra-family dispute concerning the limitations on that interest <em>(e.g., </em>how long the lease would last, when the rent might increase, and whether Thomas could sublease the property). Those \"facts and circumstances\u201d are not \"extrinsic evidence\u201d for purposes of the parol evidence rule; \"extrinsic evidence\u201d is evidence of \"prior or contemporaneous agreements or negotiations to vary or contradict a written contractual term.\u201d <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 432, 727 A.2d 358 (citing <em>Equitable Trust Co. v. Imbesi, </em>287 Md. 249, 271-72, 412 A.2d 96 (1980)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\">. Thomas and TAH express consternation that the circuit court held the addendum to be unambiguous and excluded the extrinsic evidence after hearing four days of testimony. The court did so, however, only because another circuit judge had previously denied H &amp; H\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which the court had the discretion to do even if summary judgment was otherwise appropriate. <em>Havilah Real Prop. Servs., LLC v. Early, </em>216 Md.App. 613, 625 n. 12 (2014) (quoting <em>Dashiell </em>v. <em>Meeks, </em>396 Md. 149, 164, 913 A.2d 10 (2006)) (\u201ca court 'possesses] discretion to refuse to pass upon, as well as discretion to affirmatively deny, a summary judgment request in favor of a full hearing on the merits ... even though the technical requirements for an entry of such a judgment have been met\u201d). In these circumstances, it made sense for the circuit court to allow for the full development of the record before rendering a decision. Of course, the denial of the summary judgment motion did not preclude the court from later determining that H &amp; H was entitled to prevail as a matter of law. <em>See, e.g., Ralkey v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>63 Md.App. 515, 522-23, 492 A.2d 1358 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
