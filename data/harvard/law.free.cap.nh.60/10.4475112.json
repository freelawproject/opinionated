Facts agreed. This is an action to recover damages, paid by the plaintiffs, upon a judgment recovered by Charles H. Varney against the city of Manchester for injuries sustained by said Varney by reason of an incumbrance upon a public highway. The incumbrance was lumber placed in the highway by the defendant, who was seasonably notified in writing of said suit, and requested to defend it. Varney recovered judgment for damages and costs, &lt;$3,224.99, which was paid by the city, as alleged in the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-10\">Upon application of Quimby to the mayor and aldermen, a license was granted to him, May 12, 1876, \u201cto encumber a portion of the corner of Hanover and Elm streets, opposite his building on said corner, while making repairs upon said premises, complying with the ordinances of said city relative to the same, and also complying with the following conditions, upon which this license is granted: \u201cFirst. He is at no time to encumber more than one third the width of either of said streets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-11\">\u201cSecond.

But tbe granting of tbe license to the defendant was a legal authority, conferred upon him by tbe city, to encumber tbe street with his lumber; and if lie observed tbe conditions contained in the license (a fact to be found by the jury), he could not be liable for damages occasioned by an obstruction in the street, which was expressly authorized by the city.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-7\">The license constituted a contract between tbe city and the defendant, which took the place of the statute remedy, and was a waiver by the city of that remedy.

Stats., c. 70, <em>s. </em>7. Aside from tlie city ordinances and without the license, if the defendant bad placed an obstruction in the street, and tbe city bad been compelled to pay damages in consequence of it, we suppose it would not be seriously claimed that the defendant would not be liable under the statute. <em>Littleton v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Richardson, 34 N. H. 179. It is admitted that at common law the defendant had a right to use the highway subject to the public easement. In various ways this right has been abridged or regulated by the city ordinances. If at common law the defendant had a right to pile boards in the street, subject to the statutory liability imposed upon him for damages arising therefrom, is he freed from that liability by reason of the city\u2019s license granting to him his common-law right ? The license amounted to a temporary suspension, as to him, of a municipal restriction of common-law rights, on certain conditions. Without any conditions, it would have left the defendant the same rights with the same responsibilities, with reference to the subject-matter of the license, that were possessed by abutting owners generally before the passage of the ordinances; and he would have been responsible, under the statute, for damages arising from obstructions placed in the street by him. Nor would this be any the less true, if, by accepting the license, he had agreed in terms to assume the statutory liability. <em>Chamberlain </em>v. Enfield, 43 N. H. 356; <em>Littleton </em>v. Richardson, 34 N. H. 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">But the city did not grant him all his common-law rights in the premises : certain conditions were annexed to the license, the performance of which the defendant desires to have passed upon by the jury. But whether the incumbrance was rightfully or wrongfully in the street, whether it occupied more, or less, than one third of the street, or whether the defendant kept lights through the night that all obstructions could be seen, are immaterial questions in this case. If he placed an obstruction in the street which caused damage to another, and the city has been compelled to pay that damage, his liability necessarily follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">The defendant, therefore, having bad due notice to defend in the suit of Varney against the city, is bound as a privy by the judgment in that action. That judgment could not have been rendered unless the jury had found that the injury was caused by an incumbrance in the highway. It is conclusive on that point and on the amount of the damages. As the case finds that the incumbrance was placed in the street by the defendant, there is nothing for the 3W7-</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b22-7\">Allen, Stanley, Smith, and Clabk, JJ., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
