There was evidence that on the afternoon of the accident the plaintiff, in Dover, walked from one street to another parallel street upon the defendants\u2019 railroad, which crossed both streets at grade. He walked by a path between the two tracks of the railroad, and when he reached the second street and turned to cross one of the tracks within the limits of the street, he was struck by the defendants\u2019 train of cars and injured. From the point where he was struck to the railroad station from which the train had just before started, a distance of about five hundred feet, there was an unobstructed view. He heard the noise of a train before he was struck, and knew it was time for the train to pass. <em>A </em>companion spoke of the train, but the plaintiff understood it was coming on the other track, and did not stop or turn to see where the train was coming. The train was running at the rate of twelve to fifteen miles an hour ; the bell upon the locomotive was not rang, nor was the whistle sounded, and the engineer was looking back towards the station before and at the time of the collision. There was no flagman at the crossing, nor signal of any kind. The rate of speed of the train was in controversy ; and the plaintiff, subject to exception, was permitted to show the distance from Dover to Alton Bay, whither the train was bound, the distance between intermediate points, the running time, and the number of stations at which stops were made. Witnesses living near to and in sight of the crossing were also permitted to give their estimate of the rate of speed at which the defendants were accustomed to run fhe same train, before and after the injury. The defendants moved that a verdict be directed in their favor for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>want of evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s care, and also that the court instruct the jury that the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was conclusive, and a bar to his right to recover. The motions were denied, and the defendants excepted. Verdict for the plaintiff, and motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-5\"><em>Yeaton </em>(with whom was <em>Wheeler), </em>for the defendant, on the point of no evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s care,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKS\">cited <em>Ill.

There was evidence that the defendants\u2019 train was running at an unlawful rate of speed, and this fact might affect the question of the plaintiff\u2019s care. It may have been reasonable for the plaintiff to act upon the belief that the defendants were aware of the speed law, and would obey it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine </em>Railroad, 58 N. H. 408, 410. The fact that the plaintiff did not stop and look for the approaching train before attempting to go over the track at a street crossing, is not, as matter of law, conclusive of the plaintiff\u2019s want of care contributing to the injury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Manchester &amp; Lawrence </em>Railroad, 52 N. H. 528. The plaintiff\u2019s belief in the defendants\u2019 knowledge and presumed obedience of the speed law may have been a sufficient excuse for his want of vigilance in not observing the approaching train ; and whether or not it was a sufficient excuse is a question of fact, which was properly submitted to the jury. <em>Warren v. Fitchburg </em>Railroad, 8 Allen 227; <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railway Co., </em>100 Mass. 214; <em>Wheelock </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>105 Mass. 206. There was no error in the admission of evidence of the distance from Dover to Alton Bay and intermediate stations, and of the running time between. The time taken to run over the whole road or any given part of it would have some tendency to show the velocity of the train at any given point between stations, and the evidence was admissible for that purpose. Whether evidence of the speed at which the defendants\u2019 trains were run at the same place at other times was admissible, was a question of fact depending upon remoteness of time and place, to be decided at the trial. The judgment of the court admitting the evidence disclosed no error. The usual rate of speed may have had some weight on the question of the rate at the time and place of the accident. <em>State </em>v. <em>Manchester &amp; Lawrence Railroad, </em>52 N. H. 528, 549, 550; <em>State </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine </em>Railroad, 58 N. H. 410, 412. The estimate of the rate of speed of the train by witnesses living near, and who were in the habit of observing the passage of trains, was competent on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-7\">Blodgett, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
