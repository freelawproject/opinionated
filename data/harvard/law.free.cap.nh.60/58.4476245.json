The defendants demur to the -bill, which avers the following facts: July 30, 1877, the plaintiff\u2019s husband desiring to hire money for his own use, the plaintiff and Mrs. Woodward orally agreed that Mrs. Woodward would loan Mr. Buss $200, and take from the plaintiff an absolute deed of her land, to be held by Mrs. Woodward as security, and reconveyed to the plaintiff on payment of the debt; and, in pursuance of this agreement, the money was loaned, and the land was conveyed as security: July 5, 1878, in execution of a conspiracy of the defendants to defraud the plaintiff, Mrs. Woodward conveyed the land to Forbush to enable him to turn the plaintiff out of possession* and deprive her of her right, for the benefit of Mrs. Woodward,'both the defendants well knowing all the facts, and the right and claim of the plaintiff.

Laws 1876, <em>e. </em>32. This chapter is entitled \u201cAn act to remove the disabilities of married women; \u201d but, so far as it applies to this case, it is a disabling act, imposing a new protective incapacity. At common law, a married woman could charge her separate estate with the payment of her husband\u2019s debts. <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>58 N. H. 419; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Ela, </em>58 N. H. 490. By this statute no \u201c conveyance by a married woman as surety or guarantor for her husband \u201d is binding on her. The plaintiff\u2019s conveyance of her land as security for her husband\u2019s debt, was a conveyance by her as surety for him, within the meaning of the statute. Laws 1877, <em>c. </em>22. She asks equitable relief upon payment of the debt, and the bill shows no legal or equitable ground on which she can be es-topped to claim the protection of her new disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">\n<em>Demurrer overruled,</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b69-10\">Bingham and Clark, JJ., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
