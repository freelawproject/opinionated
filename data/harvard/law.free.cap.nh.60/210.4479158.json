The writ was dated June 18, 1880, and was served by an attachment and giving a copy to the defendant June 21, 1880. On the first day of the first term, the defendant entered a general appearance on the docket, and moved for a continuance. The motion was argued and denied. Afterwards, within the first four days of the term, the case was tried on its merits; and at the trial, the defendant moved to dismiss because the libel was not filed till the first day of the term, no order of notice was issued, and no legal service made. The court denied the motion, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-11\"><em>Weeks </em>and Q-afney, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9T\">A plea in abatement, or motion to dismiss, is not excluded by the defendant\u2019s general appearance. <em>Colby </em>v.

If objections to such defects were not waived by the defendant\u2019s general appearance <em>(Colby </em>v. Knapp, 13 N. H. 175; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>Wright </em>v. Boynton, 87 N. H. 9, 19; <em>March </em>v. <em>Eastern R. R., </em>40 N.
