Pacts found by a referee. The defendant orally agreed to sell the plaintiff a piece of land for $175, to be paid in monthly instalments of $20 each. The writing claimed by the plaintiff to be a memorandum of the agreement contained no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>allusion to the price or time of payment. The plaintiff did not make the stipulated payments, but abandoned the land, went to Massachusetts, and apparently abandoned the contract. The defendant being in no fault, but having been ready to perform his agreement, and hearing nothing from the plaintiff for a long time, sold the land to another person four years after his agreement was made with the plaintiff. There are no facts from which a promise of the defendant to pay the plaintiff anything can be implied.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-5\">Quarles, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-6\">Weeks, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b516-7\">Dob, C.
