He forgot to do so, and the demand was thereby lost. Within four months after the attachment, and more than thirty days after the judgment, the debtor filed his petition in bankruptcy, upon which no further proceedings have been had. The facts not being in dispute, a verdict for the plaintiff was ordered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b214-8\"><em>Qurrier </em>and Whipple, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b214-9\">Hibbard, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-10\">By tbe United States bankrupt law (Rev. Stats. U. S., s. 5044), it was the assignment of the bankrupt\u2019s property, and not the petition, that dissolved an attachment made within four months next preceding the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. There being no assignment, there was no dissolution of the attachment. At the time of the petition there was no attachment to be dissolved. It had been lost, and the receiptor discharged at the end of thirty days from the judgment, and the deputy\u2019s neglect to avail himself of the attachment lien within that time fixed the defendant\u2019s liability.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b214-11\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFt\">The debtor, whose goods the defendant\u2019s deputy attached upon mesne process, filed his petition in bankruptcy within four months after the attachment, and no proceedings have been had upon the petition since. The mere filing of a petition in bankruptcy did not divest the debtor of his title to the property, nor dissolve attachments made upon it within four months prior to the filing. Though the assignee\u2019s title relates back to the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings, he takes his title by virtue of an appropriate deed, and until the assignment is made no lien existing when the proceedings commenced could be dissolved. It is the assignment, and not the filing of the petition, that dissolves an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>immature attachment. Rev. Stats. U. S., s. 5044; <em>Hampton </em>v. Rouse, 22 Wall. 208, 278. In this case the question oi the dissolution of the attachment by the bankruptcy proceedings can have no effect, for the plaintiff\u2019s lien by attachment was lost at the end of thirty days after the judgment, and the bankrupt\u2019s petition had not then been filed. So far as the plaintiff\u2019s rights were concerned, there was no attachment to be affected by a petition in bankruptcy. The defendant\u2019s deputy, having received an execution on a judgment obtained by the plaintiff, with instructions to levy upon the property attached, neglected to do so. Having a good receipt for the property, he made no demand upon the receiptor, and took no steps whatever to have the execution satisfied. He offers no excuse for his want of diligence. The attachment lien existed at the time, and by the deputy\u2019s neglect the plaintiff has lost his remedy upon the attached property, and for this neglect the defendant is liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b215-6\">Foster, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
