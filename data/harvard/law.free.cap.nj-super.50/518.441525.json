A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ-\">This is an action of libel tried in the Morris County District Court without a jury. The trial judge found for the plaintiff and awarded him $1,200 as compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The alleged libel was a letter sent by defendant, as operator of a collection agency, to plaintiff\u2019s employer, an agency of the United States Army. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">\u201cBonded Adjustment Bureau Credit Control Division</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">5 East Blackwell Street Dover, New Jersey December 4, 1956</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">Personnel Director c/o Mrs. Olmstead Picatinny Arsenal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-12\">Dover, N.

If he continueg to ignore this obligation our customer may elect to use more drastic measures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">Will you help us keep this on a friendly basis? A self addressed envelope is enclosed for your convenience in offering any recommendations or suggestions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">Very truly yours, (Signature)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">Bonded Adjustment Bureau By\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">As a result of the receipt of the foregoing, the letter was transmitted to plaintiff by a, superior with a notice informing him that the employer \u201cwill not consider as a fit employee anyone who contracts a debt and then without sufficient excuse neglects to make payments,\u201d and that dismissal would result if such were found to be the case and payment was not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Plaintiff and his wife testified that he was nervous and upset and lost his appetite because of fear of dismissal over the letter. He was not, in fact, discharged. From all the proofs it is clear that the debts in question had been incurred by plaintiff\u2019s son, who at one time had lived with him. There was also proof on plaintiff\u2019s behalf, not controverted, that he had previously received letters and many phone calls over a period of months from the defendant, requesting payment of these items, and had on each occasion told the defendant\u2019s representatives that he was not the debtor and that he was the only \u201cFred Stickel\u201d employed at the Arsenal.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">The statement of evidence and proceedings by the trial judge states that \u201cit was stipulated at the trial * * * that the defendant is liable for compensatory damages and that plaintiff will not prove malice except that plaintiff may rely upon such proof of malice as may be inferred from the previous notices from defendant to plaintiff.\u201d Defendant takes the position that the stipulation referred to is of no presently binding import as to liability, as legal conclusions may he drawn only by the court, citing 50 <em>Am. Jur., Stipulations, </em>\u00a7 5, <em>p. </em>607; <em>Schulz v. State Board of Education, </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>345, 349 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945); <em>Cummings v. Police</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>men\u2019s Pension Commission, </em>109 <em>N. J. L. </em>97, 99 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932). Prom plaintiff\u2019s brief and argument we discern no contention that defendant is now barred from arguing the question of the libelous nature of the letter because of the stipulation, and, since the trial court did not rely upon it for its conclusion, we will treat the matter as open for appellate determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The libel question presented is one of first impression in this State. To be distinguished is an imputation concerning one in business or commerce that he does not or is unable to pay his debts or obligations. There is general agreement that such a charge is defamatory as harming him in his trade or calling. 1 <em>Harper and James, Law of Torts </em>(1956), \u00a7 5.2, <em>p. </em>351. In application to other kinds of plaintiffs the question has become confused, partly because of the rule in some jurisdictions which carries the distinction between slanderous statements <em>per se </em>(so-called) and such as are actionable only where special damages are proven, from the field of oral statements to that of libel. We held in <em>Herrmann v. Newark Morning Ledger Co., </em>48 <em>N. J. Super. </em>420, 444 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958), reaffirmed on rehearing, 49 <em>N. J. Super. </em>551 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958), that under the law of this state all libel is actionable, without proof of special damages. Damage is presumed in the case of all defamatory libels, as distinguished from slanders. <em>Ibid. </em>The cases in other jurisdictions which hold that a statement that one not in trade refuses to pay his debts is not actionable without proof of special damage because it does not fall within the rigid common law categories of statements slanderous <em>per se </em>(including those in respect to one\u2019s trade or calling), see 33 Am. <em>Jur., Libel and Slander, </em>\u00a7 60, <em>p. </em>18; <em>Mell v. Edge, </em>68 <em>Ga. App. </em>314, 22 <em>S. E. 2d </em>138 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1942); <em>M. Rosenberg &amp; Sons, Inc., v. Craft, </em>182 <em>Va. </em>512, 29 <em>S. E. 2d </em>315, 151 <em>A. L. R. </em>1095 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1944); <em>Patton v. Jacobs, </em>118 <em>Ind. App. </em>358, 18 <em>N. E. 2d </em>189 <em>(App. Ct. </em>1948), are therefore not helpful. Whether or not stated concerning a person in trade, a writing which is \u201cinjurious to the reputation of another or exposing him to hatred, contempt or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ridicule or subjecting him to a loss of the good will and confidence entertained towards him by others constitutes a libel * * <em>Leers v. Green, </em>24 <em>N. J. </em>239, 251 (1957), without the need of proving special damages, <em>Herrmann v. Newark Morning Ledger Co., ubi cit., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><em>We </em>turn to the writing before us to consider whether it injures plaintiff\u2019s reputation under the criteria stated. <em>Harper and James </em>take the position that a writing charging failure or inability to pay debts or obligations should not be considered defamatory (in the case of non-traders) \u201cunless it fairly implies that the plaintiff has failed to pay the debt from dishonest motives and from a desire to defraud the creditor.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(1, \u00a7 5.2, <em>p. </em>358). In <em>Prosser, Torts (2d ed. </em>1955), it is concluded that it is defamatory \u201cupon its face\u201d to say that plaintiff \u201crefuses to pay his just debts\u201d (\u00a7 92, <em>p. </em>575). There is long standing authority for the view that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201cIt is not dishonorable to be indebted to another, nor is it libelous to publish of another that he owes money. <em>Reg. v. </em>Coghlan, 4 <em>Fost. &amp; F. </em>336. To be in debt is very common and to be unable to make payment does not necessarily involve moral turpitude.\u201d <em>Hollenbeck v. Hall, </em>103 <em>Iowa </em>214, 72 <em>N. W. </em>518, 519, 39 <em>L. R. A. </em>734 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1897).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Two courts of respectable authority have held, however, that a letter from a creditor to an employer stating, in effect, that the plaintiff has persisted unjustifiably in refusing to pay or in ignoring a just debt could be found defamatory by a jury. <em>Neaton v. Lewis Apparel Stores, </em>267 <em>App. Div. </em>728, 48 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>492 <em>(App. Div. </em>1944); <em>Holt v. Boyle Brothers, Inc., </em>95 <em>U. S. App. D. C. </em>1, 217 <em>F. 2d </em>16 <em>(D. C. Cir. </em>1954). The <em>Neaton </em>case went on the basis that such a letter might be taken to impute that plaintiff ignored his debts generally, while the <em>IIolt </em>ease took the position that a charge of refusal \u201cto pay a just debt\u201d could \u201churt the plaintiff in the estimation of an important and respectable part of the community.\u201d The <em>Holt </em>court went further than it liad to, however, as the imputation there was not merely refusal to pay the debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>but persistence in such refusal after \u201cevery reasonable effort to collect direct has failed.\u201d And see <em>Sheppard v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, </em>71 <em>F. Supp. </em>942 <em>(D. C. S. D. N. Y. </em>1947); <em>cf. Turner v. Brien, </em>184 <em>Iowa </em>320, 167 <em>N. W. </em>584, 3 <em>A. L. R. </em>1585 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">We are not here concerned with the question of liability' in tort for invasion of privacy or improper or illegal methods of collecting debts, as the case pleaded, tried and determined was strictly one of libel. Compare <em>Quina v. Robert\u2019s, </em>16 <em>So. 2d </em>558 <em>(La. Ct. App. </em>1944); <em>M. Rosenberg &amp; Sons, Inc., v. Craft, supra; Thompson v. Adelberg &amp; Berman, </em>181 <em>Ky. </em>487, 205 <em>S. W. </em>558, 3 <em>A. L. R. </em>1594 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1918); <em>Schieve v. Cincinnati &amp; Suburban Bell Tel. Co., </em>126 <em>N. E. 2d </em>817 <em>(Ohio Ct. App. </em>1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Clearly there is libel where a claimant writes an employer imputing dishonesty in connection with a debt of the employee, <em>Vail v. Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>103 <em>N. J. L. </em>213 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1927) (charge that plaintiff rode on defendant\u2019s train tendering an expired ticket). The precise question before us is as to whether the letter sent to plaintiff\u2019s employer could, from all the evidence, reasonably be taken to lay to him conduct ox characteristics which would substantially lower his reputation with his employer. Some affirmative evidence is afforded by the notice from the employer indicating that it would not regard as a fit employee one who contracted a debt and neglected to pay it without sufficient excuse. A fact-finder might not unreasonably conclude that the \u201cignoring\u201d of two comparatively small obligations for articles purchased in stores, notwithstanding efforts \u201cfor some time\u201d on the part of the creditor\u2019s representative \u201cto secure\u201d the \u201ccooperation\u201d of the plaintiff, bespoke a refusal to pay without sufficient excuse. Certainly, where a statement goes beyond merely charging that plaintiff is indebted on a single obligation and indicates, as here, that he has persistently, over a period of time, ignored efforts to collect from him on two obligations of moderate amount, owing to different creditors, it might reasonably be inferred therefrom by the reader that plaintiff was ignoring his just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>debts, despite the fact that he was able to pay them if he wanted to\u2014an attitude which the average person might regard as a dishonest or otherwise reprehensible refusal to pay his debts, with distinctly damaging effects upon his good reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">While a non-defamatory meaning could also be reasonably derived from the letter\u2014that plaintiff merely was unable to pay\u2014there was enough support for the more invidious inference in the entirety of the proofs to make the question as to how it was understood by the addressee an issue for the fact-finder. <em>Leers v. </em>Green, <em>supra </em>(24 <em>N. J. </em>at <em>page </em>253). The written decision of the trial judge states: \u201cThis letter of December 4, 1956 I hold to be libelous <em>per se </em>as it accused plaintiff of not paying his debts which is a charge of dishonesty.\u201d We accept the decision by the trial judge as a permissible determination of the factual issue in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Defendant does not charge the amount of the'judgment to be excessive as compensatory damages for mental anguish. See <em>Bock v. Plainfield </em>Courier-News, 45 <em>N. J. Super. </em>302, 311 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
