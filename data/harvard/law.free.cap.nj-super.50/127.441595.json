A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AsM\">Defendant was enjoined in the Chancery Division from the use of the third tees (one men\u2019s, the other women\u2019s), as presently located on its golf course. Plaintiffs\u2019 home is some 50 feet from these tees, their rear property line somewhat closer. The trial court found that the use of the tees for golfing purposes involved \u201cthe extreme invasion of the peace and quiet of the plaintiffs\u2019 home,\u201d and also, in effect, constituted a denial to plaintiffs of the right to the use of a lake on the defendant\u2019s property in which plaintiffs were deemed to have certain privileges by virtue of arrangements hereinafter described.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Defendant\u2019s golf course, as well as plaintiffs\u2019 property, are part of a combination residential and \u201ccountry club\u201d development in the boroughs of Ramsey and Allendale, Bergen County, planned and executed during the 1940\u2019s by a New York organization incorporated as National House and Farms Ass\u2019n., Inc. (referred to hereinafter as \u201cNational\u201d). Exhibit P-17 in evidence is a map which shows the projected layout. A nine-hole golf course was laid out in the center of the western portion of the development, and this is shown on the map to be surrounded by numbered residential lots on all sides of it. There are also two or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>three lakes and other recreational facilities. The plan was that every purchaser of a home or lot in the development had the right of membership in the country club and the common use of its facilities. Later non-residents of National\u2019s development tract were permitted to he admitted to club membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The defendant was incorporated to operate the golf club, and in 1945 National conveyed to it the golf course and recreational areas, including the lakes. The deed was made subject \u201cto the riparian rights of present or future owners\u201d of certain lots, including those now owned by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs purchased lot 53, block 7, as shown in the map aforementioned, from National in 1949, and also two adjoining lots after they built their home on lot 53. The map, which indicates the general layout of tees and holes on the golf course, shows no tee at the present location of the third tees. Plaintiffs\u2019 deeds grant no riparian or other rights in relation to any body of water. The property conveyed to them lies close to the northern end of Mirror Lake, a part of defendant\u2019s holdings. Their property line does not, however, go to the lake shore. There is an intervening narrow strip of land, title to which was retained by National and conveyed to the defendant in 1955. Since then defendant\u2019s golfing members have used this strip in getting access to the third tees. Previously they walked across plaintiffs\u2019 land.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The present men\u2019s third tee was constructed in 1948. It was used continuously thereafter, but plaintiffs say they did not notice it until they were actually erecting their home in 1950. Mr. Sans testified that an officer of the club told him at the time that he could stop the use of the tee at any time. The placement of the third tees where they now are situated was done in order to give the course a \u201cwater hole\u201d of par-4 length. The hole is played across the narrow end of Mirror Lake. If the tees were removed to the other side of the lake, the water hazard would be removed and the distance to the cup would he considerably shortened. The hole would become par 3, and it was testified on behalf of defendant that this would be undesirable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>from a golfing standpoint. The first year or so after plaintiffs moved into their new home they made no complaint about use of the third tees, but as time went on and the membership of the club increased the extent and nature of the use of the tees became increasingly offensive to plaintiffs, and they complained to the defendant\u2019s officers frequently, but to no avail until the agreement of April 1955, mentioned hereinafter, was entered into.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The incompatibility between normal family use of plaintiffs\u2019 home and the club use of the third tee has been manifested in many ways. The course is played during the entire day, and summer play, particularly on week-ends, is from 6 a. m. to 8 p. m. Plaintiffs are frequently awakened by golfers in the early mornings. At times there are as many as 12 people at the tee, close to plaintiffs\u2019 back yard, waiting their turn to \u201ctee off.\u201d When plaintiffs\u2019 young children play around the house they are scolded by the golfers, who require absolute silence and immobility of everything in sight during the ritual of the pre-swing address of the ball, and, of course, during the critical moment of the swing itself. On one occasion an irate golfer clubbed plaintiffs\u2019 dog unconscious for barking while on plaintiffs\u2019 own property, when their child could not quiet the animal. Sometimes golfers bring their own dogs along and these attack plaintiffs\u2019 dog. The diverse sounds and voices of people at or near the tee at all hours envelop plaintiffs\u2019 home continuously. They cannot use their own back yard, which faces the lake, in any degree of privacy. Plaintiffs\u2019 leisure hours coincide with times of peak attendance by golfers. When they water their lawn golfers complain because the adjoining footpath becomes muddy. Mr. Sans testified: \u201cWe never feel relaxed or free at home. There is always someone in our back yard.\u201d Mrs. Sans has become so distraught over the situation as to require medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Plaintiffs also complain that their children cannot boat or skate on the lake with freedom, for fear of being struck by golf balls. They maintain this interferes with their right to recreational use of the lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>After many complaints by plaintiffs a written agreement was entered into by the parties April 8, 1955, under which the third tees would continue to be used by the club temporarily at reasonable hours, the agreement stating that the parties anticipated that plaintiffs would acquire the lakefront strip and the club would later that year extend the course and remove the tees. The latter steps never eventuated. Defendant decided it would cost too much to extend the course. Moreover, it acquired the strip from National itself instead of permitting plaintiffs to do so. The arrangement for reasonable hours of use of the tees is no longer being observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Defendant\u2019s first ground of appeal is that the decision is without support in the complaint or pretrial order. The complaint is for trespass <em>q. c. f. </em>and for enforcement of alleged agreements with National and with defendant. The pretrial order, however, goes further and states among the issues to be tried: \u201c2. Do the defendants, its members and guests interfere with the plaintiffs\u2019 use and enjoyment of their property; 3. Do the plaintiffs have any rights in and to Mirror Lake and the marginal area around said lake.\u201d Moreover, at the outset of the trial plaintiffs made known that their position was that the presence of the tee and the manner of its use by defendants was a nuisance. Defendant offered no objection, and, since the case was clearly tried on that theory, and our affirmance of the judgment will rest on the same cause of action, this point of appeal is without substance. <em>R. R. </em>4:15-2; <em>Barber v. Hohl, </em>40 <em>N. J. Super. </em>526, 533 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">We are in accord with defendant\u2019s second ground of appeal\u2014that there was no unlawful interference with plaintiffs\u2019 rights to use Mirror Lake. The reference to riparian rights of lot owners in the deed to defendant is of nebulous significance, for present purposes. National may at one time have entertained the notion of giving lakeside lot owners special rights of use of the lake, but such a plan was apparently never effectuated. In any case, no rights in reference to the lake were specified in the plaintiffs\u2019 deeds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>All they received in respect to lake rights was the common right of all country club members to use the lake for recreational purposes, incidental to membership in the club, not by reason of their land title. In this regard the use of the lake was subject to reasonable regulation by the club, including the right of the club to make the use of the property, including the lake, for golf purposes primary, and for other recreational purposes secondary. This was not unreasonable as golf is obviously the principal recreational objective of the defendant organization. In that light, it was reasonable for the defendant to bring the lake into the schematic architecture of the third hole as part of a water hole, and any incidental inconvenience in plaintiffs\u2019 use of the lake for other purposes was not actionable. Thus, to the extent that the judgment of the trial court was based on impairment of plaintiffs\u2019 rights in the lake, it is not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">However, our review extends to the judgment, not merely to the supporting opinion. We deem the injunction well founded in a cause of action for private nuisance. The trial court\u2019s oral conclusions indicate this theory played a coordinate part in the determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The remedy at law or in equity for private nuisance is broad and flexible. It is founded in the maxim, <em>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas. </em>\u201cEvery person is bound to make a reasonable use of his property so as to occasion no unnecessary damage or annoyance to his neighbor.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Seaman, </em>63 <em>N. Y. </em>568, <em>577 (Ct. App. </em>1876), quoted in 1 <em>Harper and James, Law of Torts </em>(1956), \u00a7 1.24, <em>p. </em>71. At an early date in our law it was stated: \u201cAny business, however lawful, which causes annoyances that materially interfere with the ordinary comfort, physically, of human existence, is a nuisance that should be restrained * * <em>Cleveland v. Citizens Gas Light Company, </em>20 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>201, <em>205 (Ch. </em>1869). The number of ways in which the manner of use of one\u2019s property can become so offensive to others as to warrant judicial relief, although not unlawful <em>per se, </em>is manifold. See 1 <em>Harper and James, op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 1.24, <em>pp. </em>69, 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The leading modern New Jersey case is <em>Benton v. Kernan, </em>130 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>193 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1941). The court there was concerned with the commonly implicated nuisance of noise, but its quotation with approval from a Massachusetts case appears to us to provide the broadly controlling consideration in any type of alleged nuisance (130 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>at <em>page </em>198) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">\u201c* * * noise becomes actionable only when it passes the limits of <em>reasonable adjustment </em>to the conditions of the locality <em>and the needs of the maker to the needs of the listener. </em>What those limits are cannot be fixed by any definite measure of quantity or quality. They depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">See also <em>Damadio v. Levinsohn, </em>111 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>84 <em>(Ch. </em>1932); <em>Kosich v. Poultrymen\u2019s Service Corp., </em>136 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>571 <em>(Ch. </em>1945); <em>Lieberman v. Saddle River Tp., </em>37 <em>N. J. Super. </em>62 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955); <em>cf. State v. New York Central Railroad Co., </em>37 <em>N. J. Super. </em>42, 49 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955); 4 <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 822-831.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\"> In the present case we find a strangely anomalous kind of asserted nuisance, in that the objectionable condition consists not merely of the sights and sounds of what transpires on defendant\u2019s property, but in that plaintiffs\u2019 reasonably ordinary use of their own property is so offensive to the users of defendant\u2019s lands as to engender continual strain, discomfort and friction on both sides of the line. The sounds and activities ordinarily concomitant with everyday living in and about plaintiffs\u2019 property are incompatible with the requisite for peace of mind of the nearby golfers about to swing. At the same time, the time and nature of the ordinary activities of golfers at or in the vicinity of the tee were bound, as the evidence indicates actually happened, to wreak havoc with plaintiffs\u2019 comfort and reasonable sensibilities as ordinary human beings. The pertinent inquiry is whether defendant\u2019s activities materially and unreasonably interfere with plaintiffs\u2019 comforts or existence, \u201cnot according to exceptionally refined, uncommon, or luxurious habits of living, but according to the simple tastes and unaffected notions generally prevailing among plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>people.\u201d <em>Stevens v. Rockport Granite Co., </em>216 <em>Mass. </em>486, 104 <em>N. E. </em>371, 373 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1914); see also <em>Lieberman v. Saddle River Tp., supra, </em>37 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at <em>page </em>67. By these standards we think plaintiffs proved a canse of action here.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">It has been said that a nuisance may consist of the right thing in the wrong place\u2014\u201clike a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard.\u201d <em>Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 <em>U. S. </em>365, 388, 47 <em>S. Ct. </em>114, 71 <em>L. Ed. </em>303 (1926). In the present case the proofs leave no room for doubt that either the defendant\u2019s third tee or plaintiffs\u2019 house is in the wrong place. If it is the tee, the plaintiffs should retain the relief granted them in the Chancery Division. We think this is the case here. The defendant received its property on the basis of an integral plan whose paramount object was the creation of a residential community. The golf course was for the convenience of the dwellers, rather than <em>vice-versa. </em>Defendant is the gratuitous grantee, and, in a sense, the instrumentality of the grantor-developer. It stands in the latter\u2019s shoes, <em>vis-a-vis </em>the plaintiffs, and, in all equity, National owed plaintiffs a reasonably habitable location in the lots it sold them. While it is true that purchasers of home plots bordering the golf course must be held to have taken them subject to the ordinarily incidental discomforts of such proximity, such as the hazards of stray golf shots, yet at the same time the defendant and its creator, National, were reasonably bound to lay out their golf course with fair regard to the <em>minim,a </em>of residential comfort and convenience for the occupants of plots laid out along the borders of the course and sold for dwelling purposes as part of a common project. The present location of the third tee fails to meet this obligation, to the grievous and irreparable injury of plaintiffs if defendant is not enjoined. The balance of equitable convenience in requiring defendant to rearrange its golf layout in respect to the third tee, as against leaving the plaintiffs to continue to suffer as heretofore, seems to us to lie heavily in favor of the former alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
