A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AWzn\">The principal questions posed for resolution on this appeal are these. To what extent does the proprietor o\u00ed a combination bowling alley-bar owe Ms business invitees the duty of securing the premises against the hazard of entry by an armed bandit and consequent injury at the hands of the intruder in the course of a holdup of the proprietor? After such an entry has been effected is the proprietor under a duty to conduct himself in such a manner as to avoid inducing or encouraging resistance to the bandit by those present if resistance reasonably appears to entail a heightened risk of serious injury or death to one or more of those present? Assuming such a duty, was there sufficient evidence here of defendant\u2019s breach of duty to warrant submission of the liability question to the jury? There are collateral questions, the more important relating to proximate cause and contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">On the night of April 21-22, 1955 defendant was the owner of the White Horse Bowling Academy on Bordentown Road, Hamilton Township. The enterprise included a licensed bar for the sale and consumption on the premises of alcoholic beverages. At about 3:15 a. m. a masked gunman gained entry into the building. Defendant Fox, owner of the place, four of his employees and six patrons were in the bar section of the premises, talking, some drinking beer. In the course of the ensuing holdup, one of the patrons, James Aversano, attempted to disarm the bandit but was shot and mortally wounded in the effort. Plaintiff, a close friend of Aversano, went to his aid and was also shot by the gunman, sustaining the serious injuries for which he now sues for compensation in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The basis for the action is negligence on the part of the proprietor, both in failing to secure the premises against unlawful entry and in encouraging and inciting activity conducive to gunfire after the robber\u2019s entry, either by design or imprudence. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the trial judge granted a motion for involuntary dismissal, resting his action solely on a lack of evidence showing a \u201cproximate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>connection between any acts of the defendant and the injuries sustained by this plaintiff.\u201d The judge concluded that the acts of Aversano and the plaintiff were done \u201cindependently\u201d of the defendant and he implied that these were intervening factors which broke the chain of legal causation between any negligence of the defendant and the damage sued for.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In reviewing the factual record in this procedural context we are, of course, guided by the precept that the plaintiff is entitled to have the sufficiency of his case appraised on the basis of the most favorable testimony introduced on his behalf along with all favorable inferences which a jury might properly draw therefrom, resolving in his favor all matters of credibility. <em>Martin v. </em>Bengue, <em>Inc., 25 N. J. </em>359, 362 (1957). We.therefore recite the facts we deem material in their most favorable relation to plaintiff's projected theories of recovery, but also allude to some other aspects of the proofs in the interest of contrast and background.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Defendant\u2019s business premises are divided roughly into two sections. The front portion, facing the road, consists of a barroom which includes booths, a dance floor and snack bar. The main entry door leads directly into the bar. The bowling alleys take up the Tear portion of the premises. There are two doors giving direct access between the bar and the alleys, but there are two other doors for direct entrance to the alleys from the outside, and still two other doors from which entry can be had from the outside to a corridor leading to either the bar or the bowling alleys. There are several windows in the bowling alley section of the structure. To the right (looking from the front) of the bowling alleys is a 10' x 10' office room wherein was situated a very large safe in which defendant kept certain moneys. There were six cash registers on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The bar was customarily closed at 2:00 A. m:., the legal closing hour, but closing time for the bowling alleys was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>indeterminate, varying from 2:00 a. m. to 6:00 a. m., depending on the volume of business. The most frequent closing hour was about 4:00 a. m. Thursday was a \u201cslow\u201d bowling night (April 21, 1955 was a Thursday), and the alleys generally closed between 2 :00 a. m. and 2 :30 a. m. on that night. Defendant testified (on depositions which plaintiff read into evidence) that he had read in the newspapers of increased armed robberies in the county, occurring more frequently in the late night hours than by daytime. Defendant had never sustained an armed robbery previously but there had been surreptitious thefts of money and property on occasion by employees. A combination porter-night watchman was employed, who usually came to work between 12:00 midnight and 12:30 A. m., and whose duties included locking up the bar after closing, cleaning up the bar, and, after the bowling alleys were vacated, checking to see that all the doors and windows in the premises were locked.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Plaintiff arrived at the premises at about 2:20 A. M., expecting to bowl with his close friend, James Aversano, and others. The doors were locked, but he was recognized by the bartender and admitted through the front door. The few bowlers, including defendant himself, were finishing their last game. At about 2 :35 a. m., the bowling concluded, and all the bowlers, together with defendant and his employees, Papp, the manager, Euccello, the watchman, Cimore, the bartender, and Potzer, a mechanic, congregated in the bar. The defendant asked the men \u201cto have a drink.\u201d He himself and at least one of the group had beer. Euccello was also drinking beer, but as part of his \u201clunch.\u201d The defendant stayed behind the bar until the advent of the gunman. Fuccello had not yet gone out to the alleys to check the doors and windows. By that time Papp was supposed to have \u201clocked up\u201d the entire building. Additional customers would be admitted through the front door, but only if they were known to the management. A front door alarm was in operation, set to ring whenever there should be a front door entry. When those then in the place left, no more customers were to be admitted. Another bowling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>customer, coming to inquire about a bowling ball, came in about 3:00 A. m. with a companion, and they joined the group in the bar in general conversation about an impending bowling tournament. There were thus 11 men in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">At about 3 :15 a. m. the left-side door between the alleys and the bar opened and the bandit entered. He carried a gun in each hand and a bandanna covered his face from the nose down. He wore a ski cap and a trench coat which were wet from the rain. The defendant and some of the others laughed when he said, \u201cThis is a stick-up. Who is the boss?\u201d thinking someone was playing a joke. All soon realized the intruder meant business, and the defendant identified himself. The bandit said, \u201cI want you to open the safe in the other room,\u201d to which defendant replied, \u201cWhat safe?\u201d and \u201csort of laughed.\u201d This evoked the rejoinder, \u201cYou know what safe I mean, in the other room. Get going.\u201d There is undenied testimony that defendant told the group, in effect, that his money was insured. Defendant testified he also said, \u201cLet\u2019s be calm about this,\u201d and, \u201cWe want no trouble,\u201d or, \u201cLet\u2019s not have no trouble because there\u2019s so many of us in here.\u201d Erom other testimony, however, the jury could have concluded the latter remarks were not made. Defendant testified that as soon as he realized a holdup was actually in progress he felt the situation was dangerous \u201cbecause all these men were friends of mine and they are liable to do something for me that might be very dangerous to all of us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The gunman directed the entire group to precede him out of the right-side bar door leading to the alleys and thence to the room where the safe was kept. Vogler, one of the bowlers, protested sharply when the thug poked a gun in his back to hurry him along. Papp, in the corridor with Euccello before the bandit left the bar, told Euceello to sneak into the men\u2019s toilet, and the latter did so, taking one of the other men with him. They locked the door and escaped through a window to summon the police. The gunman yelled for the fugitives to return, and then said to the remaining group, \u201cWe have still got time to do this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>before the cops get here. 1 know one got away, get going and nobody will get hurt.\u201d Defendant testified he realized the danger in the situation had increased with the escape of the two men.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The remaining nine men were herded into the office where the safe was, a room about ten feet square. The entrance was close to the right corner of the room (looking in the door). The large safe stood against the wall to the left of the door. There was a closet on the opposite (far) wall. The gunman stood just inside the door, Aversano to his right, and the others ranged about the small room. The gunman told Eox to open the safe. On the first try Eox missed the combination. The gunman became angry, remarked again that one man had escaped and told him to hurry up. Eox opened the safe, took a box of money out of it, turned around with his back to the bandit, walked across the room and laid the box on the closet on the opposite side of the room. While this was going on the gunman exchanged angry words with Agabiti, one of the group, who he thought was staring at him, and he threatened to kill the man if lie did not look out the window. Aversano told the gunman not to get \u201ctrigger happy,\u201d that \u201cnobody was going to do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Fox then made a remark to the gunman which has been worded in various ways by the witnesses. Plaintiff testified Fox said \u201cthere was still more money in the safe and if he [the gunman] wanted it lie would have to go and get it * * that \u201cthe box was bolted to the safe.\u201d A written statement to the police by the manager, Papp, on the night of the occurrence (Papp was deceased at the time of trial) was to the effect that Fox said, \u201cDo you want to look in the safe and see what you want?\u201d The witness Terlicky (a bowler) said that the gunman asked for the rest of the money after Fox put the box on the closet and that Fox responded, \u201cThere is more in there, but it is bolted down. I can\u2019t give you that. You can go in and take it yourself if you want to.\u201d This same witness said the gunman wanted Fox to \u201churry up with the extra money\u201d but that Fox \u201ckind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>of slowed down a little bit.\u201d In any case, while the gunman hesitated a moment or two after Pox\u2019 last remark, Aversano suddenly struck or tackled the gunman, the two went out of the door and a shot rang out from the alleys. Immediately Genovay, the plaintiff, from the far side of the room, ran out of the door, and there, seeing the gunman \u201cover Jimmy [Aversano] and it looked like he was going to shoot him again,\u201d, jumped on the gunman and was himself seriously wounded by gunshot. The bandit ran out of the front door and escaped. Aversano died later at the hospital. The lapse of time between the entry of the bandit and the shootings was between five and ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">It may be material to note that Aversano and Genovay were both World War II veterans, aged respectively 38 and 35. Genovay had been in the Marine Corps. As already stated\u2019, they were close friends and bowling companions, apparently to defendant\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">An inspection of the premises after the holdup showed all doors and windows locked with the exception of one window on the left side of the bowling alley section of the building, which was unlocked and open about an inch.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">As indicated above, plaintiff projects his case on two general hypotheses of defendant\u2019s tortious conduct, one based on events prior to the appearance of the gunman, the other on those subsequent. As defendant justifies the result at the trial on the contentions both of absence of duty and lack of proximate cause, as well as the other defenses mentioned above, we must consider the duty phases of the case before inquiring into whether the trial judge was justified in concluding there was no proximate connection between defendant\u2019s conduct and plaintiff\u2019s injury. We turn our attention first to the theory of duty on the part of the defendant to safeguard the premises in order to protect plaintiff invitee against harm from armed robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s position is that defendant, as his \u201cbusiness invitor,\u201d is liable for exposing him \u201cto danger of crime and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>resistance thereto which he foresaw.\u201d He argues the duty is accentuated because defendant was operating a \u201cdisfavored, intensely regulated but substantial nighttime enterprise past legal hours.\u201d We dispose at once of the suggestion that the character of the business as involving the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages increased the duty of care of the proprietor in respect to the risk to invitees of harm from armed intruders. There is no perceivable relationship between the considerations which justify the exercise of the state\u2019s police power in regulation of such a business and danger to invitees therein from armed gunmen intending to rob the proprietor. Therefore the fact that the defendant was serving liquor at the bar past the legal closing hour of 2 :00 A. ii. has relevance to the duty here sought to be established, if at all, only to the extent that it may be thought that there is greater general risk of armed robbery late at night, and not to the violation of regulations as to the closing hour of licensed bars as such. See <em>Daniels v. Brunton, 7 N. J. </em>102, 107, 108 (1951); <em>cf. Evers v. </em>Davis, 86 <em>N. J. L. </em>396, 204 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Plaintiff places his right of protection by the defendant squarely upon his status as a business invitee, and we proceed upon that assumption. The proprietor of premises to which the public is invited for the business purposes of the proprietor owes a duty of reasonable care to see that those who enter the premises upon that invitation have a reasonably safe place to do that which is within the scope of the invitation. <em>Brody v. Albert Lifson &amp; Sons, </em>17 N. <em>J. </em>383, 389 (1955); <em>Bohn v. Hudson &amp; Manhattan Ry. Co., </em>16 <em>N. J. </em>180, 185 (1954). The measure of care has also been described as \u201cdue care under all the circumstances.\u201d 2 <em>Harper and James, Law of Torts </em>(1956), \u00a7 27.12, <em>p. </em>1487; see <em>Latzoni v. City of Garfield, </em>22 <em>N. J. </em>84, 92 (1956). The conventional classifications of degrees of care owing by land occupiers to different kinds of visitors are undergoing erosion in the law in favor of a broadening application of the general tort obligation to exercise reasonable care against foreseeable harm to others, the status of the defendant as a land occupier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>and of the visitors as invitees, licensees or trespassers tending merely to be regarded as circumstances going to the existence of due care. See 2 <em>Harper and James, op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 27.1, <em>p. </em>1432; Cowan, <em>\"Torts \u201d </em>9 <em>Rutgers L. Rev. </em>157, 164 (1954); <em>Imre v. Riegel Paper Corp., </em>24 <em>N. J. </em>438 (1957); <em>Mistretla v. Alessi, </em>45 <em>N. J. Super. </em>176 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957); <em>Cropanese v. Martinez, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>118 <em>(App. Div. 1955).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The' occupier-invitee cases broadly involve two kinds of asserted default, the condition of the premises and the activities carried on by the occupier. In such cases the hazard usually involved is that of accident to the invitee by reason of the unsafe condition or activity. We are at the moment considering the alleged default of the present defendant in not taking measures to keep armed intruders out of the premises. Here the hazard is voluntary criminal activity by a third person, rather than a condition of the premises making the ordinary use of the premises by plaintiff unsafe. Plaintiff points to the unlocked window through which the gunman inferably made entry. He argues that defendant should have had an alarm system in effect which would have automatically indicated the fact that a window or door was unlocked; and that the defendant and his employees were either negligent or ineffectual in keeping out armed intruders.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The fact that the risk of harm to the plaintiff was attributable to voluntary activity of others not under the control of the defendant does not of itself preclude liability if the harm by human intervention was foreseeable and a reasonable man so situated would take precautions to prevent it. <em>Prosser, Law of Torts (2d ed. </em>1955), \u00a7 32, <em>p. </em>138; <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7 302(b); <em>Kinsley v. Von Atzingen, 20 N. J. Super. </em>378, 382 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952). This general tort rule is applicable to occupiers of land, and many cases have held such persons liable for injuries inflicted on invitees by the foreseeable misconduct of third persons. <em>Prosser, op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 75, <em>p. </em>431; 2 <em>Harper and James, op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 27.12, <em>p. </em>1488, <em>n. 57. </em>Typical examples are failing to protect against crowds and unruly patrons. See <em>Restatement of Torts, </em>\u00a7 348, illustrations, <em>p. </em>955; <em>Annotation, </em>20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number><em>A. L. R. 2d </em>8 (1951). The criminality of the activity is but one circumstance in the foreseeability of harm. Feezer and Favour, <em>\u201cIntervening Crime and Liability for Negligente,\u201d </em>24 <em>Minn. L. Rev. </em>635 (1940); <em>Note, </em>24 <em>Minn. L. Rev. </em>666 (1940); <em>Harpell v. Public Service Coordinated Transport, </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>309 (1956); <em>Lillie v.

E. 2d </em>311 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1955); <em>McLeod v. Grant County School Dist., </em>42 <em>Wash. 2d </em>316, 255 <em>P. 2d </em>360 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1953); <em>Annotation, </em>78 <em>A. L. R. </em>471, 480 (1932) ; <em>Prosser, op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 32, <em>p. </em>142; <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7 302(b), <em>comment </em>(n); \u00a7 449. The leading New Jersey case is <em>Brower v. New York Central &amp; H. R. R. Co., </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>190 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1918). (Defendant liable for theft by passersby of contents of wagon strewn on road after collision due to negligence in operation of train.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">But the fact that the harmful behavior of an intervening third person is criminal will ordinarily militate against its being held foreseeable. <em>Prosser, op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 32, <em>p. </em>141. Compare <em>Saracco v. Lyttle, </em>11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>254 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951), holding that one who leaves his car unlocked with the keys in the ignition is not liable for harm caused by the negligent operation of the car by a thief; and <em>cf. Kinsley v. Von Atzingen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">It must be conceded that an armed holdup of such business premises as those of this defendant is a foreseeable possibility. Any business establishment in which money of any considerable amount may be expected to be on hand is the possible subject of an attempt at robbery. The critical inquiry, however, is whether it is debatably unreasonable conduct for the proprietor of an ordinary business establishment which is normally kept open and accessible to the general public in the course of its usual business <em>(e. g., </em>restaurants, bars, retail stores, <em>etc.) </em>to fail to take security measures against the entry of an armed robber, in relation to the risk of injury to a business invitee. We have no hesitation in answering the question, as a general proposition, in the negative. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>inconvenience and expense of such precautions, together with the accompanying impediment to the necessary untrammeled access to the premises by customers, so far outweighs the probability of bodily harm to a business invitee from an armed robber as to make it unreasonable, in our judgment, to put the proprietor to the trouble, expense and business inconvenience of effective measures to keep the criminal out. There may, of course, be kinds of businesses so attractive to armed gunmen, either because of their nature (banks, <em>etc.) </em>or because in other respects or particular circumstances presenting good robbery risks, as to reasonably require security measures for the protection of invitees. We are here concerned only with the situation before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Generally the determination of what constitutes reasonable care in a given factual context is the function of the jury, but the courts will not permit a person to be required to take a precaution which is clearly unreasonable. <em>2 Harper and James, op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 15.3, <em>p. </em>881; \u00a7 16.10, <em>p. </em>937. The real significance of general terms like \u201cnegligence\u201d and \u201creasonable care\u201d emerges only against the background of a specific set of facts and circumstances. <em>Gentile v. Public Service Coordinated Transport, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>45, 51 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). The law of negligence does not prohibit the creation of all risks, even appreciable ones\u2014it generally requires only that the standard of conduct required or enjoined be not unreasonable in relation to the nature of the risk. <em>Bohn v. Hudson &amp; Manhattan Ry. Co., supra. </em>The <em>Restatement of Torts </em>declares that the law balances the magnitude of the risk of harm against the utility of the actor\u2019s conduct, \u00a7\u00a7 291, 292, 293. See <em>Spalt v. Eaton, </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>327, 333 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1937), affirmed 119 <em>N. J. L. </em>343 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1938); <em>Halpern v. Barbara Holding Corp., 5 N. J. Super. </em>87, 90 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The only case cited to us which, in principle, approaches the specific problem as to the duty of a business invitor to protect his invitees against the danger of intrusion by armed robbers is <em>Altepeter v. Virgil State Bank, </em>345 <em>Ill. App. 585, </em>104 <em>N. E. 2d </em>334 <em>(App. Ct. </em>1952). Here the court affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>a judgment on the pleadings in favor of the defendant where the plaintiff had been shot by an armed robber engaged in holding up the defendant bank, plaintiff being in the premises on business. It was held that the mere assertion of a duty on the part of the defendant to exercise a high degree of care for plaintiff\u2019s safety as a customer and to see to it that the premises should be a safe place to transact business with the bank did not state a cause of action. It was held that no facts were stated from which it could be concluded that the defendant failed to take sufficient precautions to safeguard the person of the plaintiff from injury on its premises. The court also implied that in the absence of any facts indicating that defendant\u2019s knowledge of the probability or possibility of such a robbery was superior to that of the plaintiff, the perils of such a contingency were within the equal knowledge of both parties and not to be held peculiarly foreseeable by defendant, so as to make it liable to the plaintiff in the particular case (104 <em>N. E. 2d </em>at <em>page </em>340). The court cited <em>Restatement of Torts, </em>\u00a7 348, which declares that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201ca public utility or other possessor of land who holds it out to the public for entry for his business purposes is subject to liability to members of the public while upon the land for such a purpose for bodily harm caused to them by the accidental, negligent or intentionally harmful acts of third persons if the possessor by the exercise of reasonable care could have (2) discovered that such acts were being done or were about to be done, and (b) protected the members of the public by * * * controlling the conduct of the third persons * \u00ae</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The provision was apparently deemed not applicable for lack of foreseeability by the defendant of the criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In several cases there has been collateral concern with the question as to whether the negligent failure of a non-occupier of premises to leave the premises secure after entry in the absence of the owner would create liability to the owner for losses from thieves who were thus enabled to enter. <em>Jesse French Piano &amp; Organ Co. v. Phelps, 47 Tex. Civ. App. </em>385, 105 <em>S. W. 225, 227 (Civ. App. </em>1907) (theft of articles from a house is a \u201cnatural, reasonable, and probable\u201d consequence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>of the door being left open by defendant); but see <em>Strong v. Granite Furniture Co., </em>77 <em>Utah </em>292, 294 <em>P. </em>303, 78 <em>A. L. R. </em>465 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1930); <em>Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. </em>Adams, 199 <em>Ark. </em>254, 133 <em>S. W. 2d </em>867 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939). This question does not, of course, concern us here, except by way of. contrast with the hazard involved in the present case. While plaintiff argues that defendant\u2019s customary practices with respect to securing the premises at night were with a view to excluding armed robbers and protecting patrons, this is not a fair inference from the testimony. The premises were customarily locked up after all customers had left, and the only legitimate inference is that this was to guard against sneak thieves, not against armed gunmen bent on holding up the proprietor or any people who might be found in the premises, at gunpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Although we do not consider that any duty normally exists on the part of the proprietor of a business to take measures to keep armed robbers off the premises in relation to the risk of harm to business invitees, yet, as suggested above, special circumstances may be envisaged in which such a duty might arise from the extraordinary likelihood of felonious intrusion in the particular fact situation presented. Plaintiff argues that this is such a case, citing the lateness of the hour, the fact that the doors were already locked against admission to strangers, and knowledge by the defendant of the generally increasing incidence of crime. We do not regard the lateness of the hour as determinative. Defendant was still conducting business in the bar in the normal fashion although the legal closing hour had passed. Plaintiff claims he was still a business invitee at the time and must consequently accept the corollary that defendant was still doing business at that hour. The front door was locked only to prevent any further influx of new business that night, not to bar armed robbers. This building was frequently open for bowling business until 4:00 A. m., and occasionally as late as 6 :00 A. m. The hour was therefore not relatively late for business invitees to be on the premises. The lights in the bowling alley were still on, there was also a light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>in the bar, and there were cars parked outside. The evidence is that this establishment had never been subjected to armed robbery before and there is therefore no particular significance in defendant\u2019s knowledge that there was a general increase in armed criminality in the community, at least where not shown to have risen to an extraordinary degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">It is consequently our considered opinion that the proofs did not make for a jury question as to the existence of a duty owing by the defendant to the plaintiff to secure him from bodily harm at the hands of gunmen by taking measures to exclude such intruders from the premises at the time of the illegal entry here involved. As to this phase of the ease, then, we do not reach the question as to whether a factual causal connection has been sufficiently shown between the failure to secure the premises and the actual entry, see <em>McCappin v. Park Capitol Corp., 42 N. J. Super. </em>169 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956); <em>Panglorne v. Weiss, </em>86 <em>N. J. L. </em>386 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914), nor as to whether there is an absence of showing of proximate connection between the asserted negligence and the eventual injury in any other respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">We next approach what we consider the more difficult question as to the sufficiency of the evidence to establish a case of negligence for the jury in respect to defendant\u2019s conduct after the gunman made his entry and up to the shooting of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">In this phase of the case it is necessary to carefully distinguish between substantive duty and the sufficiency of the evidence to create a jury question as to default in any such duty. We must arrive at conclusions as to the existence and scope of the duty before we can undertake the appraisal of the proofs in connection with the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">The problem inspires a return to the fundamentals of tort duty set forth in the classic exposition in <em>Heaven v. Pender, </em>[1883] 11 <em>Q. B. </em>503, 509, recently quoted in <em>Collopy v. Newark Eye and Ear Infirmary, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>29 (1958) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>\u201cwhenever one person is placed by circumstances in such a position with regard to another that every one of ordinary sense who did think would at once recognize that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct with regard to those circumstances he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s position is that after the entry of the gunman it was defendant\u2019s duty to plaintiff and his other invitees to refrain from any conduct reasonably calculated, intentionally or otherwise, to incite, encourage or otherwise to have the effect of inducing or increasing the likelihood of resistance to the bandit on the part of any of those present, because such activity would involve an unreasonable risk of grave injury or death to such invitees.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">As we have already observed, the reasonableness in law of a defendant\u2019s behavior in a given context depends not only on the degree of risk of harm to others created or increased by his conduct but also upon the \u201cutility\u201d of the actor\u2019s conduct. <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7 291. The latter element, in turn, is analyzed by the <em>Restatement </em>as including (a) the social value which the law attaches to the interest protected by defendant\u2019s conduct, (b) the extent of the chance that the interest will be advanced or protected by such conduct, and (c) the extent of the chance that the interest can be adequately protected by a less dangerous course (\u00a7 292). There is no quantitative or other formula by which these criteria can be made to supply a ready answer to the specific question here at hand. As stated by Judge Learned Hand in <em>Conway v. O\u2019Brien, 111 F. 2d </em>611, 612 (2 <em>Cir. </em>1940), reversed in another connection, 312 U. <em>S. </em>492, 61 <em>S. Ct. </em>634, 85 <em>L. Ed. </em>969 (1941), a solution in terms of the application of the foregoing factors \u201calways involves some preference, or choice between incommensurables, and it is consigned to a jury because their decision is thought most likely to accord with commonty accepted standards, real or fancied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In the present case, assuming the hypothesis that defendant\u2019s conduct had the effect of increasing appreciably the risk of serious injury or death to persons on the premises by gunfire, there may be advanced as justification in terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>of social utility the protection of the defendant\u2019s property from robbery and the vindication of society\u2019s interest in frustration of crime. Do these factors so outweigh the risks of life and limb in the scale of social <em>desiderata </em>as to warrant extending immunity to the defendant as a matter of law? A Texas court has seemingly answered this question in the affirmative. <em>Helms v. Harris, </em>281 <em>S. W. 2d </em>770 <em>(Tex. Civ. App. </em>1955). It was there stated by way of <em>dictum </em>that if a storekeeper being held up at gunpoint resisted a gunman, and a customer were wounded by gunshot as a result, there would be no liability on the part of the storekeeper to the customer, as the action of the storekeeper would be in exercise of the right of self-defense or defense of one\u2019s property. The logic of this position is weakened, however, by the concession by the court that there may be liability if the defense of property is undertaken in circumstances involving a realized unreasonable risk of harm to innocent third parties (at <em>page </em>772).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Weighing additionally on defendant\u2019s side in the evaluation of duty is the possibility that the nature of the situation in which he was projected by the armed intrusion was one of emergency. This would become less relevant, however, if the fact-finder concluded that there was purposeful activity by the defendant designed to entrap the gunman. If that thesis were rejected and his responsibility weighed on the basis of negligent rather than intentional promotion of resistance to or frustration of the bandit, and if the fact-finder concluded that defendant was placed in a position allowing little time or opportunity for reasoned thought or judgment and had necessarily acted largely upon impulse or instinct, there might be no liability. <em>Prosser, op. cit., supra; </em>\u00a7 32, <em>p. </em>137; <em>Dobrow v. Hertz, </em>125 <em>N. J. L. </em>347, 349 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940) ; <em>Wagner v. International R. Co., </em>232 <em>N. Y. </em>176, 177, 133 <em>N. E. </em>437, 438, 19 <em>A. L. R. </em>1 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1921). The choice of action \u201cmay be mistaken and yet prudent,\u201d <em>Kane v. Worcester Consol. St. R. Co., </em>182 <em>Mass. </em>201, 65 <em>N. E. </em>54 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1902, Holmes, C. J.). But see <em>Harpell v. Public Service Coordinated Transport, supra </em>(20 <em>N. J. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>page </em>317). This consideration controlled the decision in favor of the defendant in <em>Noll v. Marian, </em>347 <em>Pa. </em>213, 32 <em>A. 2d </em>18 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943), where plaintiff, a depositor in defendant\u2019s bank, was standing at a teller\u2019s cage and was hit by gunfire from a robber shooting at a teller who had dropped behind the counter in disregard of a command not to move. <em>Cf. Laidlaw v. Sage, </em>158 <em>N. Y. </em>73, 52 <em>N. E. </em>679, 44 <em>L. R. A. </em>216 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1899); <em>Sinn v. Farmers\u2019 Deposit Sav. Bank, </em>300 <em>Pa. </em>85, 150 <em>A. </em>163 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1930) (where a customer of defendant bank was held entitled to recover for failure of warning that nearby crank had just threatened to dynamite the place); <em>Fulfer v. Sherry\u2019s Liquor Stores, </em>149 <em>P. 2d </em>734 <em>(Cal. D. Ct. App. </em>1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Our review of the authorities leads us to the conclusion that the seriousness of the risk of grave injury or death inherent in the confrontation of the group of men in defendant\u2019s company by the armed robber was such that there cannot be said to have been any right on defendant\u2019s part as a matter of law to take any measures he might choose to frustrate the gunman and secure his capture without regard to the effect of such actions on the safety of the others present. The social utility of such objectives was for the consideration of the jury in forming an over-all judgment as to whether what they concluded the defendant had done or caused to be done constituted reasonable conduct, in the light of all the circumstances, including the hazards to which defendant\u2019s companions were exposed. The value of human life and of the interest of the individual in freedom from serious bodily injury weigh sufficiently heavily in the judicial scales to preclude a determination as a matter of law that they may be disregarded simply because the defendant\u2019s activity serves to frustrate the successful accomplishment of a felonious act and to save his property from loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In the foregoing discussion we have assumed that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to draw such factual inferences as would warrant its concluding that defendant\u2019s behavior constituted unreasonable conduct in light of the duty found to be owing. We must now consider defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>argument that such tactual inferences and consequential conclusion were not sufficiently supported evidentially to warrant submitting the issues to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">There is no direct evidence in this case that defendant induced, encouraged or persuaded Aversano to take the step which eventuated in his own death and Genovay\u2019s injury. Plaintiff argues, however, that the circumstances justify the inferences that defendant\u2019s actions were designed or reasonably foreseeably calculated in effect to influence any of the group who might see an opportunity to disarm or capture the bandit to launch such an effort, in which the others would join, and that Aversano\u2019s action and Genovay\u2019s rescue attempt were natural and expectable results of defendant\u2019s behavior. The most critical issue in this case is whether the proofs raise a reasonably debatable question as to the validity of such inferences. If so, the question was for the jury. If not, the result at the trial should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The Supreme Court has recently stated that \u201ccircumstantial or presumptive evidence, as a basis for deductive reasoning in the determination of civil issues, is defined as \u2018a mere preponderance of probabilities, and, therefore, a sufficient basis for decision\u2019\u201d (citing <em>Jackson v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>487 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1933)). <em>Joseph v. Passaic Hospital Ass\u2019n, </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>557, 574 (1958). \u201c[I]t need not have the quality of certainty, but it must be a presumption grounded in reason and logic; mere guess or conjecture cannot be substituted for legal proof. * * * The evidence must be such in quality as to lead a reasonably cautious mind to the given conclusion.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>at <em>page </em>575. These admonitions, of course, are not to be applied to our own direct reactions to the evidence, but stand as the criteria for the guidance of the fact-finders, if they are permitted to function; and our own appellate responsibility is strictly confined to determining whether fair minds could reasonably debatably draw the inferences requisite to liability consistently with the general precepts stated, so as to call for delegation of the issues to the jury. Normally, when the existence of negligence depends upon the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>to be drawn from a variety and combination of circumstances considered in their relation to and their reaction upon each other, the jury and not the court is the proper tribunal to draw the conclusion. <em>Fagan v. Central R. R. </em>Co., 94 <em>N. J. L. </em>454, 457 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1920). We think this is that kind of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">We do not <em>agree </em>with plaintiff in his assessment of culpability of any of defendant\u2019s actions prior to the arrival of the assemblage in the office where the safe was kept. The antecedent circumstances are, however, significant, in foreshadowing the tension which might be found to have pervaded all of the group, particularly after the escape of two of the men, and the psychological predisposition for what eventuated. As indicated above, the defendant knew there was danger of an attempt by some of the group to disarm the gunman. The remarks of Vogler, Agabiti and Aversano to the <em>gunman </em>indicated the cockiness of the group in the face of the bandit\u2019s two guns and further flagged the danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">If each of the actions of the defendant in the office is analyzed separately from the others, it may plausibly be explained as consistent with due care. The first failure to open the safe could have been inadvertent or under stress of excitement; the placing of the box of money across the room on the closet, because there was no more convenient place to lay it down; the suggestion that the gunman take the remaining cash from the safe himself because it would have been inconvenient\u2019for defendant to scoop up any petty cash and proffer it to the bandit. But the combination of all of these events dilutes the probability of the hypothesis of prudence in these actions and increases the persuasiveness of the theory of a plan for apprehending the bandit. <em>Cf. Rourke v. </em>Hershock, 3 <em>N. J. </em>422, 425, 426 (1950). The missing of the combination of the safe delayed the proceedings and tended, to increase the tension, already mounting because of the imminence of the arrival of the police. If the gunman had gone across the room for the money on the closet, or had stepped between the safe doors for the remaining money, as he was invited by defendant to do, he would have been surrounded and vulnerable to concerted attack by the nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>others in the small room. We are persuaded that a jury could not unreasonably have found, from all the facts and circumstances, that defendant\u2019s acts were designed to communicate to the others the availability of that recourse if the gunman took or began to take either of these steps. If not designed, a jury was free to find that these actions wore dangerously imprudent as probably suggesting such action to the others. \"The assessment of conduct is ordinarily a factual function <em>* </em>* <em>Taneian v. Meghrigian, </em>15 <em>N. J. </em>267, 283 (1954). Whether defendant\u2019s actions were the excusable result of an emergent situation was also, we think, for the jury. <em>Harpell v. Public Service Coordinated Transport, supra </em>(20 <em>N. J. </em>at <em>page </em>317).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">We are further of the view that the momentary hesitation of the gunman in determining his next step after defendant\u2019s last suggestion, or in meeting the problem of the placement of the money box, may have reasonably been found by the jury to have prompted Aversano to seize upon it as a propitious opportunity to catch the bandit unawares by a sudden assault. Or it may have properly concluded that defendant\u2019s actions provided the encouragement and incitement which either directly induced Aversano\u2019s seizure of the initiative or resolved any uncertainty in his mind as to whether he should do so. Any of these hypotheses would have sufficed to supply the necessary causal bridge in fact between defendant\u2019s impugned behavior and the unfortunate outcome of the affair.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">We next consider the specific basis for the dismissal stated by the trial judge\u2014absence of proximate cause. The court considered the actions of Aversano and the plaintiff as independent intervening causes of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. If there was an actual break in the chain of causation in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>between defendant\u2019s actions in the office and Aversano\u2019s direct precipitation of the catastrophic outcome of the affair, defendant would not be liable, even if negligent. But we have already held that the evidence permitted a finding that defendant\u2019s actions encouraged, induced or created a propitious setting for an attempt to disarm the bandit. While there is evidence of a predisposition on the part of the group, generally, to essay the move, defendant is not exculpated on the basis of proximate cause by the fact that his conduct was only one of several independently contributing causative factors of the injurious occurrence. In this regard, so long as the negligent act is a substantial factor in bringing about the injuries complained of, liability may be found. <em>Hartman v. City of Brigantine, </em>42 <em>N. J. Super. </em>247, 261 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956), affirmed 23 <em>N. J. </em>530 (1957); <em>Lutz v. Westwood Transp. Co., </em>31 <em>N. J. Super. </em>285, 289 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954), certification denied 16 <em>N. J. </em>205 (1954). We are satisfied that the jury could have here found from the evidence that defendant\u2019s behavior did contribute causally, and substantially, in respect of other potential causative factors, to plaintiff\u2019s injury. <em>Cf. Martin v. Bengue, Inc., supra </em>(25 <em>N. J. </em>at <em>page </em>374).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Defendant\u2019s alternative basis for advancing lack of proximate cause as a block to recovery is that it was not foreseeable that the premises would be subject to armed robbery or that Aversano would attack the gunman. Preliminarily, we pause to contribute our concurrence in the increasingly accepted view that foreseeability in the negligence field is more appropriately allocable to the sphere of definition of duty than to that of proximate cause. <em>Mitchell v. Friedman, </em>11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>344, 347, 348 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951); 2 <em>Harper and James, op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 20.5, <em>p. </em>1137; <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7 433 (1948 <em>Supp.). </em>See the comprehensive collection of the authorities in <em>Glaser v. Hackensack Water Company, </em>49 <em>N. J. Super. </em>591 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958). To have to apply the foreseeability criterion twice in any given ease, once for testing the existence of \u2019Scope of duty, and again to meet the supposed requirements of the rule of proximate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>cause, is unwarrantably duplicative and conceptually confusing. <em>2 Harper and James, ubi. cit., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In any event, the foreseeability of a holdup is not relevant in the present inquiry, as the measure of defendant\u2019s duty, in the light of our stated conclusions as to liability, began when the holdup became an established fact. As to the incidence of Aversano\u2019s action as an expectablesequel of defendant\u2019s conduct, we have already indicated why we think a finding of the likelihood of some such result of the existing atmosphere and defendant\u2019s actions was well within the supportive scope of the proofs. It is, of course, fundamental that the tortfeasor need not have anticipated the very occurrence which resulted so long as it can be said that the injury was the natural and probable consequence of the wrongful act and that it was foreseeable that harm of some kind might befall the plaintiff. <em>Hartman v. City of Brigantine, supra </em>(42 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at <em>page </em>262). That test is fully met in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">As to plaintiff\u2019s personal intervention in the fracas, it is clear that if we accept the evidence as permitting the conclusion of negligence in the defendant causally contributive to Aversano\u2019s action, liability would also extend to&gt; plaintiff\u2019s injury as the result of the foreseeable evocation by Aversano\u2019s plight of the instinct of rescue in the plaintiff. <em>Cafone v. Spiniello Construction Co., </em>42 <em>N. J. Super. </em>590 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956); <em>Wagner v. International Railway Co., supra. </em>Defendant has argued that the plaintiff\u2019s projection of himself into the affray was so imprudent and wanton as to amount to assumption of risk and contributory negligence. We think these issues were for the jury, under the proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Plaintiff contends there was reversible error in the exclusion at the trial of a statement made to him by the defendant at the hospital the <em>Hay </em>after the shooting in which defendant thanked plaintiff for his actions and said he knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>they had saved others from being killed. We notice the point in view of the impending retrial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument as to the relevancy of the statement is based on his added theory of defendant\u2019s supposed breach of duty in not having gone to the assistance of Aversano and plaintiff after the latter were embroiled with the gunman. We have not hitherto mentioned that theory. We regard it as totally without merit. The danger of such a course is so obvious that it could not reasonably be imposed on the defendant as a duty. Consequently the statement was irrelevant as a claimed admission and its exclusion was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
