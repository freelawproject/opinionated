That order was not appealed from, and stands operative and in full force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">The defendants were required by the order to accept, after plaintiffs were in default, amended complaints which fell far short of conformity to the order requiring them to be served. We have held, upon another appeal, that defendants should not have been required to receive the proposed amended complaints. It follows that the present motions to strike them out should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">Order appealed from is, in each case, reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motions granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
