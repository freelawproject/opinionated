In case any of the children died before her death his lawful issue was to take the share the parent would have taken, if living. The will also created a trust for a son for life, with remainder to the issue of any of testatrix\u2019s children who \u201cshall have died\u201d before the death of the life tenant. <em>Held, </em>that children of a son who predeceased testatrix took the share the son would have taken if he had survived.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b136-11\">[Ed.

The will was executed on the 6th day of July, 1909. On that date there were living three sons and four daughters. Another son, Michael Kane, had died on December 13, 1903, prior to the execution of the will. The plaintiff and the defendant Rosemary Kane are daughters of said Michael Kane, who left no other issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-21\">There is a single question involved in this appeal, arising upon the construction of the fourth clause of Bridget Kane\u2019s will. That clause, so far as is relevant, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-22\">\u201cAll the rest, residue and remainder of my estate both real and personal and wheresoever situated, I divide into as many shares or portions as I may have children living at my death and one of such shares or portions I give, devise and bequeath to each of my children surviving at the time of my death, * * * In case any of my children <em>shall die </em>before me, leaving lawful issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>surviving, then such issue shall take the share or portion the parent would have taken if living at the time of my death. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The judgment appealed from denies to the children of Michael Kane the right to take under the will. With this conclusion 1 am not in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The wording of the will is faulty and inaccurate. The two clauses quoted are contradictory of each other. There are two rules of interpretation which are to guide us in construing this will: (1) The intent of the testatrix is to govern the interpretation of the will when that intent be ascertained, and words may be transposed and the tense of a verb changed if necessary to give expression thereto. (2) A strong presumption exists that the testatrix did not mean to disinherit alone the children of her deceased son. Matter of Brown, 93 N. Y. 299; Matter of Crawford, 113 N. Y. 366, 374, 375, 21 N. E. 142. In the defendants\u2019 answers no claim is made that Michael Kane had received his portion of the estate prior to his death, nor upon the face of the pleadings is there any reason apparent why any discrimination should be made as against the living children of the deceased child. Again, in the fifth clause of the will, the share of Peter is put in trust for his life, with the remainder to his lawful issue, if any. If not, the will reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">\u201cThen I give, devise and bequeath the share of my estate so held in trust for him as aforesaid, to my children living at the time of Ills death, and the issue of any of my said children who <em>shall have died </em>before the death of my said son Peter J. Kane. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">That the children of Michael are included in this provision is undoubted, and in view of this fact, and of the inaccuracy of expression found throughout the will, and of the presumption that the issue of the child that died before the making of the will should share equally with the issue of the children who should die thereafter, it seems fair that the provision for the children who \u201cshall die\u201d before the death of the testatrix includes this plaintiff and her sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">This exact phrase has been the subject of judicial construction in wills. In Re Chapman\u2019s Will, 32 Beav. 382, the will recites in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">\u201cThat in case any of my nephews and nieces or great-nephews and great-nieces, <em>shall die in my Ufelim-e </em>leaving any child or children who shall be living at my decease,\u201d the child or children of such nephew, or niece should take the share of its parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">It was there held that the issue of a child who had died before the making of the will was entitled to share. In the opinion, Sir John Romilly says, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">\u201cMuch stress cannot be placed on the words \u2018shall die in my lifetime.\u2019 It is vague. It is argued that it means \u2018shall hereafter die,\u2019 but I think the expression is constantly used in the sense \u2018shall be dead at the time of my death.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">In Loring v. Thomas, 1 Dr. &amp; Sm. 497, the court held that the words \u201cshall die\u201d did not import future dying, but are equivalent to the words \u201cshall be dead\u201d or \u201cshall have died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The expression in the statute providing against the lapse of legacies, where a child \u201cshall die\u201d during, the lifetime of the testator, was construed by both the prevailing' and dissenting opinions to refer to a death before or after the making of the will in Pimel v. Betjemann, 183 N. Y. 194,, <em>76 </em>N. E. 157, 2 E. R. A. (N. S.) 580, 5 Ann. Cas. 239. This case is strongly relied upon by respondents to sustain this decision. If our conclusion that the words \u201cshall die,\u201d as used in the fourth subdivision of the will, shall be construed as \u201cshall have died\u201d as used in tire fifth subdivision of the will, this case is clearly distinguishable from the case cited, which was simply a bequest to children as a class without express provision for those dying before testator\u2019s death. The decision in the case cited also rests in part upon a provision in the will that the legacy should not be payable until the beneficiary reached the age of 21 years, which was held to indicate that young children of a deceased child were not intended to be included. In the case at bar, the will contains no such provision. The case at bar is also distinguishable from the Turner Case, 208 N. Y. 261, 101 N. E. 905, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 245, in which was construed a will containing a bequest to collaterals, and not to direct descendants. In such case tire same inference does not exist as where tire question of exclusion ig of one\u2019s own blood. Each will must be construed in the light of the special circumstances under which it was made, and in view of other provisions in the same will. I cannot escape the conviction that the testatrix never intended to exclude the plaintiff and her sister from their share of her bounty.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The order and judgment should therefore be reversed, with costs, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. Order filed. All concur.</p>\n<author id=\"b138-6\">LAUGHLIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY0\">(concurring). I concur in the views expressed by Mr. Justice SMITH, and vote for reversal. I am of opinion that the provision of the will directing that the residuary estate be divided into as many shares or portions as the testator left children him surviving is qualified by the further provision with respect to the prior death of a child leaving issue, and that the true construction of the will is that, if the testator left children and the issue of a deceased child, no matter whether the death of such child occurred before or after the making of the will, the residuary estate should be divided into a number of shares equal to the number of sons and daughters of the testator who survived him, plus the number of his sons and daughters who predeceased him leaving issue surviving the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The plaintiff and the defendant Rosemary Kane, who are tire children of the testator\u2019s son Michael, are therefore entitled to take the share which Michael would have taken, had he survived the testator.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
