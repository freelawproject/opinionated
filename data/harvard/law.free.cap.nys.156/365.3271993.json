There is nothing in the testimony that would make the defendant corporation liable for the assaults of Mitchell, and for that reason the finding that Mitchell was acting within the scope of his authority, and that the defendant appellant was liable for Mitchell\u2019s assaults, is reversed, the judgment reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
