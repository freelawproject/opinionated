In January, 1914, defendant contracted with plaintiff\u2019s assignor, the International Yacht Publishing Company, for insertion of its advertisement in a \u201cSouvenir and Program of International Yacht Races,\u201d for which defendant agreed to pay \u201cupon publication and delivery of one copy of the same.\u201d These books, priced at 25 cents, were to serve as an advertising medium. In the early part of August, some of the books were printed and bound, with defendant\u2019s hotel advertisement opposite the picture of a yacht. About 2,500 copies, at 25 cents each, were sold and distributed, and about 400 or 500 copies placed on news stands for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">About August 15th or 17th, the Yacht Club committee having charge of the races (in which this publication company had no voice or control) declared the same off, because of the war. The challenger, Shamrock IV, did not arrive till August 20th, and at this time three Ameri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>can yachts were having trials to ascertain which should be chosen to defend the cup in the September races. On August 25th plaintiff\u2019s assignor wrote defendant that a sample copy of Souvenir and Program of the International Yacht Races, with defendant\u2019s advertisement inserted therein, had been mailed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">\u201cAs you are no doubt aware, the cup races have been postponed until 1915 on account of European disturbances. Even without the races, the book as a souvenir is a good seller and a good advertisement. We expect an unprecedented sale before and after the races, many of which have already subscribed for cash in advance. We claim it is the best book ever for the price. The work will be placed on public sale later. Kindly remit us your check.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Obviously defendant and the publishing company had in view the September cup racing. Defendant\u2019s advertisement was in connection with this contest. A program is for events to which it relates, and a souvenir \u201ccannot recall what has not taken place.\u201d Alfred Marks Realty Co. _v. \u201cChurchills,\u201d 153 N. Y. Supp. 264, 265. The issue of the exhibit here, though styled program and souvenir, was anticipatory. Such an issue and sale for the convenience of plaintiff\u2019s assignor is not a \u201cpublication\u201d in the sense of this contract. A condition is implied of two contestants being named for the time and place of a race; and, where this feature is obvious, a failure, by giving up the expected contests, abrogates the contract. Lorillard v. Clyde, 142 N. Y. 456, 463, 37 N. E. 489, 24 L. R. A. 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> This is not where a promisor has failed to guard himself against a vis major. It is not a performance on one side, the other having no appropriate clause to excuse default; but it is where the situation, as it turns out, has frustrated the entire design on which is grounded the promise. An advance issue of the programs cannot fairly be held to be what defendant was to pay for. The\" object in mutual contemplation having failed, plaintiff cannot exact the stipulated payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The order of the Appellate Term should be reversed, and the judgment of the Municipal Court for plaintiff reversed, with costs of the appeal, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
