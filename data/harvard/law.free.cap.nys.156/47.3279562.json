It is claimed that the question was raised by the motions to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the complaints at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case. Among other grounds stated in support of the motion were these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-3\">\u201cThat the plaintiff has not made out any cause of action, and that he is not entitled to any relief in a court of equity upon the proof submittedalso \u201cthat the proof submitted makes no case for any equitable relief whatever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">We think the grounds so stated, in connection with the other grounds urged, did not call attention of the trial judge specifically to the claim that plaintiffs\u2019 remedy was at law rather than in equity. The motion seems to have been based rather upon the claim'that plaintiffs had not made a case entitling them to relief in any court.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> But, assuming that it was the intention of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to raise the question that plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law, we think it was too late at that time to raise such a question. The rule seems to be settled by authority in this state that such a ground of defense must be pleaded by the defendant in his answer. Kobbi v. Underhill, 3 Sandf. Ch. 277; Town of Mentz v. Cook, 108 N. Y. 504, 15 N. E. 541; Ketchum v. Depew, 81 Hun, 278, 30 N. Y. Supp. 794; Baron v. Korn, 127 N. Y. 224, 27 N. E. 804; Watts v. Adler, 130 N. Y 646, 29 N. E. 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The other questions urged by appellants as ground for reversal are, we think, sufficiently and correctly considered and disposed of by the opinion of Mr. Justice Wheeler at Special Term. 88 Misc. Rep. 615, 151 N. Y. Supp. 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">It was conceded upon the argument that the judgments should be modified, so as to provide for the return to the defendants of the securities which plaintiffs received of them. The proper form of such modifications is as follows: .</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">In the Bloomquist Case there should be inserted in the next to the jast paragraph of the judgment, after the words \u201chave execution thereof,\u201d and before the words \u201cThis provision to become operative at the expiration of ten days,\u201d the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">\u201cThat upon recovery of said sum from the said defendants plaintiff deliver to said defendants, or to their attorneys, the said ten bonds of the North Sterling irrigation district and the said ten bonds of the Greeley-Poudre irrigation district so sold and delivered by the defendants to the plaintiff, numbered as hereinabove stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">In the Snow Case there should be inserted, after the words \u201chave execution therefor,\u201d and before the words \u201cThis provision to become operative at the expiration of ten days,\u201d etc., the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-11\">\u201cThat upon recovery of said sum from the said defendants the plaintiff deliver to said defendants, or to their attorneys, the said eight bonds of the North Sterling irrigation district and the said eight bonds of the GreeleyPoudre irrigation district so sold and delivered by the defendants to the plaintiff, numbered as hereinabove stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">The judgments appealed from should be modified as above stated, and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs, and the orders granting plaintiffs extra allowances of costs should be affirmed, without costs. All concur..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
