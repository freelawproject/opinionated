In support of its position, the defendant appellant cites a number of cases, such as McElroy v. Mumford et al., 128 N. Y. 303,28 N. E. 502; Nat. Mech. Bkg. Ass\u2019n v. Conkling et al., 90 N. Y. 116, 42 Am. Rep. 405, note; De Camp v. Bullard et al., 22 Misc. Rep. 441, 50 N. Y. Supp. 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Defendant does not contest their application, but contends that they hold that, in addition to the recitals in a bond or undertaking, the circumstances surrounding the transaction must also be taken into consideration in order to determine whether and to what extent the apparently general obligation of the surety is to be held limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">It is not necessary for a determination of this appeal to decide which interpretation of these cases is correct, because respondent points to no circumstances, known to defendant or o f which defendant would be chargeable with knowledge upon any possible theory, which would in any wise affect the evident limitation upon the appellant\u2019s liability indicated by the recital. The only circumstance which I can find even hinted at is that one off the attorneys who in this action appear for the defendant was the plaintiff in the action in which the execution was issued, and that defendant\u2019s present attorneys appeared as attorneys, in that action for the plaintiff therein, and also appeared for the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>plaintiff in the successful action brought against him by the execution debtor. There is not the slightest suggestion that these attorneys were attorneys for the appellant at the time the bond was given, even assuming that there were circumstances which would modify the effect of the recital, and further assuming that knowledge of such circumstances on the part of the defendant\u2019s general attorneys would be imported to the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
