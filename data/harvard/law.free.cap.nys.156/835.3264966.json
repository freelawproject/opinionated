Y., in the early afternoon of January 6, 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>The trial court, in accordance with then existing decisions, instructed the jury that the burden of proof of contributory negligence was upon the plaintiff, to which instruction the plaintiff duly excepted. The jury rendered a verdict of -no cause of action. It having been subsequently held in Sackheim v. Pigueron, 215 N. Y. 62, 109 N. E. 109, that section 841b applied to a death happening prior to tire enactment of the section, tire judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial granted, unless it must be held, as contended by the defendant, that the nonsuit asked by it should have been granted upon the ground that under the undisputed evidence the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence, and hence that the plaintiff was not harmed by reason of the instruction to the jury as to the burden of proof as to contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> In determining this question we should be governed by the two well-established rules: (a) That the plaintiff is entitled to the most favorable inferences deducible from the evidence, and all disputed questions of fact are to be resolved in her favor; and (b) that less evidence is required from the plaintiff to establish the freedom <em>qf </em>her intestate from negligence than would have been required from him if he had survived and been able to testify. Sackheim v. Pigueron, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\"><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> The plaintiff received the injuries, which resulted in his death a few days later, while passing over the defendant\u2019s track at a rural highway crossing. Pie had approached the crossing from the west, driving a team of horses attached to a lumber wagon. One of the horses was four years old and is referred to by the witnesses as tire colt. The other was six years old, and tire team was active and high-lived. Prom the evidence which was most favorable to the plaintiff it apy pears that the view of deceased towards the south, from which direction tire colliding train came, was at places more or less obstructed by buildings, clothes hung out to dry, and leafless trees, and that from a point about 35 feet westerly of the nearest rail a person could see down the track southerly about 350 feet, tire line of vision being lengthened as the person approached the track. The only eyewitness of the event, called to testify, said that the deceased approached the crossing with his coat collar turned up about his ears, his hat pulled down upon his head, and his team upon a trot; that as <em>the </em>team neared the track the colt became restive and pranced ahead of the other horse; and that when the deceased was at a point about 30 feet, and the heads of his horses about 18 feet, from the crossing, the deceased, having pulled up his horses in an effort to hold them back, clucked to the team, which then went faster and itself cleared the crossing, but the engine struck the rim of the hind wheel, and deceased was thrown from his wagon and injured. There was also testimony to the effect that the train, which was a combination freight and passenger train, was a little behind time, and was traveling at the rate of 35 miles per hour, and that prior to reaching the crossing it did not slacken its speed, and did not give any signal of its approach by either whistle or bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">. The foregoing is a brief summary in a most general way of material evidence upon the part of the plaintiff bearing upon the main issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>in the case. Much of it is the subject of positive contradiction upon the part of the defendant\u2019s witnesses. The burden is upon the defendant to satisfy this court that the motion for a nonsuit should have been granted, and hence that the plaintiff was not prejudiced by the instruction as to the burden of proof. It is impracticable to attempt to review, within the brief limits of an opinion, the testimony contained in a record of two hundred pages. Suffice it to say that a careful examination of the evidence has convinced us that no error was committed by the trial court in denying the motion for a nonsuit. Hence this court is not warranted in disregarding the exception of plaintiff to the instruction relating to the burden of proof as to contributory negligence. That the plaintiff was entitled to have the question of the contributory negligence of plaintiff\u2019s intestate submitted to the jury was also the opinion of the trial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">We think that the judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
