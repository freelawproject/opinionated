The plaintiff merely proved that he delivered the goods to the defendant to be dyed, and that they were returned, with holes and breaks, showing a tenderness in the goods. Negligence cannot be predicated \u2022 merely upon the condition of the goods when returned. The condition might have resulted from the fact that, owing to the quality and texture of the goods, they deteriorated when subjected to a careful and skillful process of dyeing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>good materials and dyes. This requires a reversal of the judgment and the granting of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As there will be another trial, and plaintiff may be able to prove the negligence of the defendant, we call attention to the fact that the wrong measure of damages was applied. Inasmuch as the goods were returned to the plaintiff and all were not rendered unsalable, the measure of the damages was not the value of the goods as a total loss, but the difference in the value of the goods properly dyed and in their value as the work was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial granted, with $30 costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
