Abbott,\u201d which now appears therein as the name of the defendant. Upon the trial of the action this substitution was made by consent of the defendant. Plaintiff recovered a judgment, and by inadvertence the defendant\u2019s notice of appeal filed with the clerk contained the name of \u201cCharles E. Abbott\u201d as defendant, instead of \u201cAbbott\u2019s Bakeries, Incorporated,\u201d although correctly reciting the court, the amount of judgment, and date of its entry. The defendant also filed an undertaking correctly describing the judgment and the parties thereto. The plaintiff was in no way misled by- this misdescription of the defendant in the notice of appeal, and section 158 of the Municipal Court Code provides for just such contingencies, and gives the appellate court ample power to amend any \u201cdefects or omissions * * * necessary to perfect an appeal,\u201d etc. The motion in this respect should therefore be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The moving papers herein also ask for a stay pending an appeal from an order of the Municipal Court vacating the above-mentioned notice of appeal, and setting aside the undertalcing and directing that ah execution issue upon the judgment. It appears from the papers used on the motion that, after 20 days had expired from the date of entry of the judgment, the plaintiff moved for an order \u201cdirecting the clerk of the court to issue an execution upon the judgment heretofore obtained and for an order vacating and setting aside the notice of appeal filed herein and vacating the undertaking on ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>peal also filed herein.\u201d This motion was contested, and upon the hearing was granted, and what the defendant deems an order was entered, from which it has taken an appeal. A copy of this purported order entered upon the motion is handed up with the motion papers. It fails to comply with section <em>767 </em>of the Code of Civil Procedure, in that it contains no recital of the papers used upon the motion, either by reference to number or otherwise. That it was not intended as a final order is evidenced by the statement contained therein that \u201cunder the circumstances the plaintiff is entitled to an order granting his prayer herein.\u201d So far as now appears there is no order from which an appeal can be taken. In view of the amendment to the notice of appeal granted herein, the ground for an entry of an order vacating such notice has been removed, and therefore no order should be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Motion to amend the notice of appeal nunc pro tune granted, and motion for stay denied. Temporary stay vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
