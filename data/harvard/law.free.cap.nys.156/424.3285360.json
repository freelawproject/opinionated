The lease is dated August 25, 1909, and lets the premises 285-287 Jay street, Brooklyn, for a term of three years from January 1, 1910, to January 1, 1913, at the yearly rent of S3,600. The lease contains the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-21\">\u201cAnd the said party of the first part [plaintiff] does further covenant ana agree that at the expiration of said term the party of the second part [defendant} shall have an option to obtain a further lease from the party of the second (sic?) part of said premises for a period of five years upon the same terms, provided the said party of the second part shall, prior to three months before the expiration of the said term, give a written notice of its intention to take such a further lease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The defendant went into possession of the demised premises, and within the time prescribed by the last covenant, viz. bn September 30, 1912, sent the following written communication to plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">\u201cMrs. Grace L. Finn: * * * According to the terms of our lease, which ran for three years January 1, 1910, to January 1, 1913, we were to have the privilege of renewing same for five years more at the same time (sic?). We hereby wish to notify you that we desire to renew the lease at the expiration of the three years for another five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">\u201c[Signed] Krieger Shoe Company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">\u201cHaymond Healy, President.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Defendant remained in possession of the premises and paid the rent after the sending of this notice to plaintiff for two complete years after the expiration of the term of the first lease on January 1, 1913, namely, all of the year's 1913 and 1914; and while this action is for rent for the month of January, 1915, alone, it will determine the liability or nonliability of the defendant for three years\u2019 rent amounting to $10,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The defendant\u2019s contention is that the phrase \u201cthe party of the second part shall have an option to obtain a <em>further lease </em>from the party of the first parti,\u201d upon the giving of notice as provided in the covenant of the first lease, means the written instrument itself, which evidences a grant of a further term of five years. And it further contends, because of the failure to deliver to it a new written instrument granting the further term of five years, the plaintiff has broken her contract, and that therefore <em>the </em>holding over <em>the </em>original term constitutes the defendant a tenant from year to year only. If the defendant\u2019s contention be true, there would be no liability, because concededly the tenant vacated before the termination of 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> There has been much needless strife between the parties concerning the \u201cnew lease.\u201d Defendant demanded without any just right that plaintiff\u2019s husband join in the lease. Defendant asked that the new lease be made to its nominee, the Healy Shoe Company. Defendant asked that the new instrument grant it a new and similar option for a further lease of five years. It was entitled to compliance with none of these demands. The <em>Healy </em>Shoe Company could be made a tenant only with the consent of the plaintiff. The exercise of the option renewed all of the terms of the old lease, except that of the option itself. Pflum v. Spencer, 123 App. Div. 742, 744, 108 N. Y. Supp.. 344. See also, Burns v. City of New York, 213 N. Y. 516, 520, 108 N. E. 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">The defendant then instituted an action (while still in undisturbed possession) against the plaintiff and her husband to- compel the execution and delivery of a written instrument evidencing the lease. Plaintiff and her husband defaulted, by failing to appear or answer within 20 days. Application was made for judgment, and opposed on the grounds above recited. Subsequently Mrs. Einn consented to the entry of judgment against her. The offer of judgment was returned on the ground that she was in default. The facts above recited show the acts of the parties subsequent to the written notice, sent by defendant, exercising its option \u201cto obtain a further lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The word \u201clease,\u201d as used in the option, means, in my opinion, a term or' an estate for years, as distinguished from the written evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>deuce of one, commonly called an \u201cindenture of lease\u201d or a \u201clease.\u201d Was it necessary for plaintiff to do any thing to make this grant to the defendant? That brings us directly to the legal effect: (1) Of defendant\u2019s written notice, \u201cWe hereby wish to notify you that we desire to renew the lease at the expiration of the three years for another five yearsand (2) of defendant\u2019s remaining in possession and paying rent two years beyond the end of the original term.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> A tenant, whatever may be the length of the term under which he holds, must at the end of the term vacate the premises. Upon the tenant's failure to vacate, the landlord may evict the tenant, or compel him to hold over for another year, subject to the provisions of the former lease, except as to length of term. \u201cNo option is vested in the tenant, and the action of the landlord is by way of penalty; the element of mutuality does not enter into the situation.\u201d Kennedy v. City of New York, 196 N. Y. 19, 31, 89 N. E. 360, 25 L. R A. (N. S.) 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The tenant in the case at bar, however, had, in addition to holding over the term and payment of rent beyond the term, served the landlord with notice that it elected to exercise an option for a further term of five years. In this case, therefore, the \u201celement of mutuality\u201d <em>does </em>\u201center into the situation.\u201d That is the essential distinction between Kennedy v. City of New York, supra, and the case at bar. There can be no doubt that the defendant\u2019s acts constitute an election by it to remain in possession for five years additional at the same rent of $3,600 per year. In the case of Probst v. Rochester Steam Laundry Co., 171 N. Y. 584, 64 N. E. 504, it was held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">\u201cA lessee, who enters into possession of demised premises under a lease for a. fixed term, with the privilege of extending it by giving written notice to the lessor, and continues in possession after the fixed term has expired, paying the rent thereafter as it becomes due, thereby elects to exercise the option for an extension of the term.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">And this even if the tenant does not give the written notice, because it may be waived by the subsequent acts of the parties. The case of Doyle v. Hamilton Fish Corporation, 144 App. Div. 131, 128 N. Y. Supp. 898, was one involving much the same principles as the case at bar. In that case the option, however, was with the landlord. It was there held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">\u201cThe rights of the parties were fixed on November 13, 1907, when the landlord exercised its option and elected to renew the lease. From that date the mutual rights of the parties were established, each being entitled to insist that the other should execute a proper formal grant. After that date the landlord\u2019s election, which was not dependent; upon acceptance or rejection by the tenant, became irrevocable, except by the mutual agreement of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">To the same effect see Goodfield Realty Co. v. Boden, 116 N. Y. Supp. 703; Mattlage v. McGuire, 59 Misc. Rep. 28, 111 N. Y. Supp. 1083; McAdam on Landlord and Tenant (4th Ed.) \u00a7 152 et seq.; Chaplin on Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 288; Kuhlman v. Letup Brewing Co., 87 Neb. 72, 126 N. W. 1083, 29 L. R. A. (N. S.) 174, and note. It has previously been pointed out herein that the defendant had al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ready informed the plaintiff the kind of lease it would accept, and the form insisted upon was one to which defendant was not entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><bracketnum>[5, 6]</bracketnum> The appellant also' urges that error was committed by the learned trial judge, in that he excluded from evidence the complaint and answer in an action brought by one Eudden against the plaintiff for commissions based upon the exercise of the option in the lease. That complaint alleged the making and .expiration of the lease between plaintiff and defendant; that the lease provided for a renewal; that at the time of the making of the lease defendant agreed that, in the event of the renewal of the lease pursuant to the option contained therein, defendant would pay to Ludden 1 per cent, of the rent to accrue during said optional period, amounting to $180. Defendant admitted all of these allegations in her answer. The complaint then alleged :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">\u201cVIII. Upon information and belief that the said option of renewal has been exercised and the Healy Shoe Company, as successor in interest to the Krieger Shoe Company, has since January 1, 1913, and is now continuing as a tenant of said premises 285-287 Jay street pursuant thereto, and the defendant is collecting rent from said Healy Shoe Company thereunder at the rate of $3,600 per year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Defendant\u2019s answer denied the allegations contained in paragraph VIII above quoted. The exclusion of this complaint and answer was error, because it was a declaration of a party to this action which tended.to impeach her credibility. But I think it was not prejudicial error, in view of the other facts in tire case determining the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">I therefore recommend that the judgment be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
