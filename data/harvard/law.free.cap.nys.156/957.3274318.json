The proceedings before the Commission disclose a basic misapprehension as to the meaning and requirements of sections 21, 67, and 68 of the law, and the outcome is an award upon a claim which should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">The deceased was an assistant foreman in the employ of the street department of the Brooklyn Union Gas Company. His duties were negligible, so far as active physical work or exertion was concerned. While he was sweeping dirt and pebbles off the paving in the vicinity of the work being done by the gang of men to which he was attached, he suddenly fell to the street. Seventeen days later he died in tire hospital, and an autopsy revealed that in his fall he had evidently received a fracture of the skull. The same autopsy disclosed that the fall had in all probability been due to an attack of cardiac syncope, to which the previous condition of the heart predisposed it. At the time the deceased was recovering his wits, after his fall to the pavement, he told a fellow workman that \u201ca weak spell must have come to him,\u201d and on the following day he told an examining physician that \u201che had .a dizzy spell.\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">The claimant\u2019s original theory had evidently been that this cardiac syncope and fainting was due to the presence of an excessive quantity of gas emanating from the trench near which the decedent was when he fell. The proof wholly failed to give any support to that theory, and the Commission based its award instead upon a finding that Collins \u201cstumbled over some obstruction in the street and fell to the ground.\u201d All the evidence adduced before the Commission negatived the idea that there was any \u201cobstruction in the street,\u201d anything over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>which Collins did stumble or might have stumbled. There was no evidence adduced to indicate that Collins did stumble, or that he fell as a consequence of doing or while doing any particular act or while putting forth any particular exertion. There was not a vestige of evidence in the case to indicate that Collins\u2019 fall was due to anything except that, while standing in the street, he happened to have a sudden attack of cardiac syncope, to which he was predisposed. There was nothing to sustain the finding that his injury was \u201caccidental,\u201d or that it arose \u201cout of\u201d the employment, except in the sense and to the extent that his sudden spell of fainting came during working hours and had more serious consequences, because at the time he was standing on a hard pavement.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The claimant in fact presented no \u201cproof\u201d or \u201cevidence\u201d at all, and rested her case solely upon the \u201cemploye\u2019s claim for compensation,\u201d a paper so \u201cfearfully and wonderfully\u201d drawn that it did not correctly state the deceased\u2019s employment or the street in which he fell, and left doubt for the most part whether the claimant\u2019s husband was alive or dead at the time the paper was filled out. Even the allegations of this paper showed no \u201cstumbling,\u201d no \u201cobstruction,\u201d no \u201caccident,\u201d nothing arising \u201cout of\u201d the employment; the employer\u2019s proofs disproved the \u201cgas\u201d and the \u201cobstruction\u201d theories, and indicated that there was no \u201cstumbling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Nevertheless, at the close of the hearing, the deputy who sat in behalf of the Commission said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-7\">\u201cI am going to deny your request, and allow the claim on the basis that the accident arose out of and in the course of the employment, in the absence of proof to the contrary, and on the further ground that the testimony of the witnesses would indicate that there was an accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-8\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> This, and the Commission\u2019s subsequent finding of fact as to an \u201caccident\u201d through \u201cstumbling over sonic obstruction,\u201d were, of course, as we have already pointed out, lacking in evidence tending to support the same, and hence fully reviewable here. It should, moreover, be said that the deputy commissioner incorrectly stated and applied the presumptions arising under section 21 of the act. There is nothing in section 21, or any other part of the act, which relieves a claimant from producing evidence that the injuries arose \u201cout o\u00ed and in the course of\u201d an employment of the injured person by the employer against whom the claim is directed. Once that evidence of the employment, the injury in the course of it, the injury as result of something arising from the employment, is submitted, the first presumption enumerated in section 21 carries presumption of the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction, the applicability of the statute, the \u201chazardous\u201d character of the employment proved, and the inclusion of the work being done by the injured person at the time of the injury within the scope of an \u201cemployment\u201d enumerated and defined as \u201chazardous\u201d (Matter of McQueeney v. Sutphen &amp; Myer, 167 App. Div. 528, 153 N. Y. Supp. 554; Matter of Kohler v. Frohmann, 167 App. Div. 534, 153 N. Y. Supp. 559), and the second, third, and fourth items of section 21 carry presumptions covering, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, the other conditions precedent specified in section 10. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>Commission is not authorized, however, to make an award under the act in the absence of at least some evidence that the employ\u00e9 met with an injury while he was at work for the specified employer and as a consequence of something that had a relation to the work of the employer, something done by him or by others while he was so employed. The act does not undertake to make the employer an insurer of the life, health, or regular heart action, of an employ\u00e9 during the hours of labor, in the absence of proof that injury was due, for example, to a fall caused by cardiac syncope arising from overexertion in the course of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">The errors of this Commission were such as to fall clearly within the powers, and duty of this court to curb and correct. The time has not yet come when money may be taken directly from an employer and indirectly from the patrons of a great public utility upon such a paucity of proofs and such a pretense of judicial findings as are revealed by this record. The claim is remanded to the Commission; unless further and satisfactory proof is adduced, it should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Award reversed, and matter remitted to the Commission for its action. All concur (LYON, J., in result), except KELLOGG, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">SMITH, P. J., was not a member of the court at the time of the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
