I. From this street the public (and specially the plaintiff, as an abutter on the street down to the high-water line) had a right to pass out to the navigable waters of the bay, and back from the bay landwards to the street, which right of ingress and egress extended over the place where the land highway meets the navigable waters. Matter of City of New York [Main St] 216 N. Y. 67, 110 N. E. 176. Though defendant\u2019s struc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>turcs stood on piling upon lands under water, they appropriate common property, as they tend to stop this free continuous passage, and are therefore actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\"><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> Plaintiff, as a riparian owner, and also having title to the middle line of West street, along which her lands extend to high water, has shown such special damage, in the nature of substantial and peculiar injury different from that of the general public, as entitles her to an injunction. Joyce on Injunctions, \u00a7 1082a. The requirement to show special injury and loss does not call for such exact amounts as she might have to prove in an action to recover damages. Wakeman v. Wilbur, 147 N. Y. 657, 42 N. E. 341; Ackerman v. True, 175 N. Y. 353, 67 N. E. 629. The fact that defendant has large capital here invested, so that it will sustain loss by having to withdraw its encroachment, does not justify the trespass or warrant withholding an injunction. Whalen v. Union Bag and Paper Co., 208 N. Y. 1, 101 N. E. 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">. The judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
