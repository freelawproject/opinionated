The employ\u00e9 subsequently elected to take compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, and accordingly, pursuant to section 29 of that act, assigned his claim against the defendant to the plaintiff, the insurance corporation liable for the payment of the compensation. As assignee the plaintiff brought this action, and the trial court granted a nonsuit, for the sole reason that, in the opinion of the court, the plaintiff in an action of this character is entitled merely to- be indemnified for the compensation paid under the law to the injured employ\u00e9; plaintiff having waived any such recovery and insisted upon the right to_ recover the same damages which the employ\u00e9 would have been entitled to if he had sued the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">That part of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law applicable is section 29, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\"><em>\u201cSubrogation to Remedies of Employ\u00e9. </em>If a workman entitled to compensation under this chapter be injured or killed by the negligence or wrong of another not in the same employ, such injured workman, or in case of death, his dependents, shall, before any suit or claim under this chapter, elect whether to take compensation under this chapter or to pursue his remedy against such other. Such election shall be evidenced in such manner as the commission may by rule or regulation prescribe. If he elect to take compensation under this chapter, the cause of action against such other shall be assigned to the state for the benefit of the state insurance fund, if compensation be payable therefrom, and otherwise to the person or association or corporation liable for the payment of such compensation, and if he elect to proceed against such other, the state insurance fund, person or association or corporation, as the case may be, shall contribute only the deficiency, if any, between the amount of the recovery against such other person actually collected, and the compensation provided or estimated by this chapter for such case. Such a cause of action assigned to the state may be prosecuted or compromised by the commission. A compromise of any such cause of action by the workman or his dependents at an amount less than the compensation provided for by this chapter shall be made only with the written approval of the Commission, if the deficiency of compensation would be payable from the state insurance fund, and otherwise with the written approval of the person, association or corporation liable to pay the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The learned trial justice regarded the use of the word \u201csubrogation\u201d by the Legislature as controlling in the disposition made of the controversy. It is contended by the appellant that, while ordinarily the word \u201csubrogation,\u201d in technical parlance, connotes indemnification, the title of the section under consideration, being \u201cSubrogation to Remedies of Employ\u00e9,\u201d indicates that subrogation is used in its primary sense of substitution, so that the state or private insurer is, after election made to resort to the act, put in the same place the employ\u00e9 would have been if he had not availed himself of the provisions of the statute, and that the further provision that the \u201ccause of action\u201d shall be assigned to the insurer carries with it the right to recover, under such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>assignment, all damages recoverable by the workman in the absence of an assignment. We do not consider this contention sound. \u201c 'Cause of action\u2019 implies a right to bring an action, and some one who has a right to sue, and some one who may be lawfully sued.\u201d Patterson v. Patterson, 59 N. Y. 574, 17 Am. Rep. 384. The clause, read in conjunction with the title of the section, does not necessarily import a right on the part of the insurer, under his assignment, to recover all the damages which the workman might recover if he elected to pursue his remedy against the third party tort-feasor, but only such recovery as is consistent with the purpose clearly defined in the title; i. e., the purpose of \u201csubrogation.\u201d Lester v. Ohio Elevator Co., 90 Misc, Rep. 649,153 N. Y. Supp. 1058. Subrogation is defined in the Standard Dictionary as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-3\">\u201cThe succession or substitution of one person or thing by or for another; in law, the putting of a person (as a surety) who has paid the debt of another in the place of the creditor to whom he has paid it, <em>so that he may use for Ms own indemnification </em>all the rights and remedies that the creditor possessed as against the debtor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">\u201cThe insurer, upon paying to the assured the amount of a loss * * * insured, is doubtless subrogated in a corresponding amount to the assured\u2019s right of action against any other person responsible for the loss.\u201d St. Louis, etc., R. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 139 U. S. 223, 235, 11 Sup. Ct. 551, 557 (35 L. Ed. 15-1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The general purpose of the statute is to. establish a system of state insurance of employ\u00e9s engaged in hazardous employment, and to provide in connection therewith a system of indemnification of the state. That it does not contemplate an accumulation of surplus profits to be derived from assignments of causes of action for personal injuries is made evident by an examination of the provisions of sections 95 to 97, both inclusive. Section 95 provides that the premium rate shall be\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\"><em>\u201cthe lowest possible rate </em>consistent with the maintenance of a solvent state insurance fund and the creation of a reasonable surplus and reserve; and for such purpose [the Commission] may adopt a system of schedule rating in such a manner as to take account of the peculiar hazard of each individual risk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Section 96 permits the formation of employers\u2019 associations for accident prevention, and provides that; \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">\u201cEvery sncii approved association may make recommendations to the Commission concerning tho fixing of premiums for classes of hazards, and for individual risks within such group.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Section 97 provides for the keeping of a detailed system of accounts as to each group or class of employment, and for a readjustment, at certain fixed periods, of the rates for each particular class; and, where it appears that the payments in any particular class or group have, after appropriate credits to the surplus and reserve funds, exceeded the amount of disbursements for that particular class, vests in the Commission the discretion to credit each individual employer of such group or class with a proportionate amount of such excess upon the next payment of premiums which may become payable to him, and further provides, in subdivision 4, that where premiums are paid by the employer upon an estimated amount of wages, and it subsequently ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>pears that the actual wages paid are less in amount than the estimate, such employer shall be entitled to receive a refund of such excess from the state insurance fund, or to have the amount of such excess \u25a0credited on subsequent premiums as they become due. These provisions are in harmony with the amendment of the act (chapter 16, Laws 1914) requiring premium rates of corporations and associations transacting business under the act to be approved by the state superintendent of insurance \u201cas adequate for the risks\u201d; i. e., the liability to which such corporation or association may be subjected under its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Construing section 29 in the light of the general purpose of the statute, it is evident, therefore, that the provision for \u201cSubrogation to Remedies of Employes,\u201d and the assignment of the workmen\u2019s \u2022cause of action to the state, is for purpose of indemnification only; and it follows that the extension of the same provision to individual or corporate insurers is subject to the same limitation, namely, the full indemnification of the insurer, and no more. To hold otherwise would be to construe the act as requiring repayment by the state to employers of surplus funds derived from the prosecution of negligence \u2022cases by the state as the absolute assignee of injured employ\u00e9s, and permitting the retention of the surplus obtained in such cases by individual or corporate insurers. The statute surely does not contemplate the granting to individual or corporate insurers of rights inconsistent with the rights vested in the state under like conditions and inconsistent with the general purpose of the statute to be so construed as to open the door for speculative profit to the insurer, through subsequent litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Under both the common law as recognized in this state, as well as under the Personal Property Law (Consol. Laws, c. 41, \u00a7 41, subd. 1, formerly Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 1910), a claim or demand to recover damages for personal injury is not transferable, and while there can be no question of the power of the Legislature, by subsequent enactment, to specifically or impliedly repeal such provision of the Personal Property Law, the rules of statutory construction require that, so far as possible, the later enactment shall be construed harmoniously with existing law, and so far as the later enactment modifies the existing law it shall be limited in its applicability to the particular purpose for which the later statute was enacted.

Peckham, 10 Barb. 656.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">\u201cWhen the intention can be collected from the statute, words may be modified, altered, or supplied, so as to obviate any repugnancy or inconsistency with such intention.\u201d Lewis\u2019 Sutherland\u2019s Statutory Construction (2d Ed.) vol. 2, \u00a7 347. \u201cThe intention of an act will prevail over the literal sense of its terms.\u201d Id. \u00a7 348. \u201cThe presumption is that the lawmaker has a definite purpose in every enactment, and has adapted and formulated the subsidiary provisions in harmony with that purpose. * * * <em>That purpose is an implied limitation on the sense of general terms.\u201d </em>Id. \u00a7 369. \u201cWords or clauses may be enlarged or restricted to effectuate the intention or to harmonize them \u25a0with other expressed provisions.\u201d Id. \u00a7 -376. \u201cA thing which is not within \u25a0the intent and spirit of a statute is not within the statute, though within the letter,\u201d Id. \u00a7 379.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">\u201cThe real intention, when accurately ascertained, will always prevail over She .literal sense of terms. * * * Statutes are likewise to be construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>in reference <em>to the </em>principles <em>of the common </em>law; for it is not to be presumed that the Legislature intended to make any innovation upon the common law further than the case absolutely required.\u201d 1 Kent\u2019s Commentaries (14th Ed.) 462.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The purpose of the statute now under consideration being the establishing of a self-supporting state insurance fund for the compensation of employes in certain classes of employment and for the fixing of the lowest possible premium rates for employers consistent with such purpose, section 29 must be construed to that extent as only impliedly repealing or modifying the existing law as to the non-transferability of claims of this character.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It is also a significant feature supporting this construction of the statute that, notwithstanding the previous enactment of statutes in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and other states containing provision for part payment to the injured employe,, or for the retention in the state insurance fund of any surplus amount collected by the insurer in excess of indemnification, no such provision is found in the present statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with $25 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
