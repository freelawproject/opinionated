As it is stated in both briefs, however, that the defendant is a corporation, it will be considered as such. None of the sales and deliveries going to make up the claim were proven, and the only basis for the judgment is certain telephone conversations claimed to have been had by plaintiffs\u2019 credit man with one Rosendorf, said to be the treasurer of the defendant, and other alleged admissions of the said Rosendorf; also admissions testified to have been made by one of the defendant\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 credit man swore: That he talked with one Rosendorf over the telephone thr\u00e9e times. That he called up Rosendorf and talked with him. That \u201cI was out at the time, and one of the girls answered, and when I returned I called up the number and asked for Mr. Samuel Rosendorf. He said that he was the person. He wanted to adjust the matter and pay me some time later for this account here. I told him that nothing but a check would do at this time, because I knew that he was being sued otherwise; that the bills were due, and it was necessary for him to pay it; and he said such an adjustment could not be made because he did not have the money at that time, but he would arrange to pay me some time later.\u201d That at the time the account was opened Rosendorf told the witness over the telephone that he was the treasurer and was responsible for all bills purchased by the Carlton Dress Goods Company. That he had received Rosendorf\u2019s personal check in payment of goods. That otherwise than over the telephone the witness never spoke with Rosendorf.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The alleged telephone conversations were not evidence against the defendant, because, even if it be assumed that the circumstances furnish some evidence of talks with Rosendorf, the alleged statement of the latter, either over the telephone, or in answer to the question put to him by the process server, that he was the treasurer of the defendant, was not binding upon the defendant, and it does not appear from the telephone conversations that any claim against the defendant\" was specified, for plaintiffs\u2019 witness says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">\u201cI told him that nothing but a check would do at this time, because I knew that he was being sued otherwise; that the bills were due, and that it was necessary for Mm to pay it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Although the credit man swore that he received Rosendorf\u2019s checks as treasurer, he subsequently testified that the checks were not signed by Samuel Rusendori, treasurer, that they were Rosendorf\u2019s personal checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The person who served the summons on Rosendorf testified that Rosendorf at the time of service said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-10\">\u201cI admit owing the bill, but I h'ave not got the money to pay for it now; if you will wait, I will pay the bill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">This statement referred solely to the individual, -and was in no sense an admission that the defendant corporation owed plaintiffs anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Neither was the admission made oyer the telephone by one of the defendant\u2019s attorneys to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney that the defendant owed the money competent evidence that the defendant did owe the money, for without express authorization such an acknowledgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>could not bind the defendant.

Supp. 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The plaintiffs failed to prove a prima facie case, and the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with $30 costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
