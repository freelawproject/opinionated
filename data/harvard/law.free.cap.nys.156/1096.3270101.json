Dillon, Mun. Corp. (5th Ed.) \u00a7 352. The corporate limits should not be a matter of deduction through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>legal reasoning, but are to be made obvious by having such bounds stated and described with common certainty. The same certainty necessary for original boundaries (Village Law, \u00a7 3, as amended by Laws 1915, c. 31) should be required in marking out annexed territory. The objections of the village authorities to\u2019 the appellant\u2019s petition were therefore well taken. Questions of disputed rights to levy taxes, or jurisdictional rights over waters (People ex rel. Gleason v. Town Board, 21 App. Div. 156, 47 N. Y. Supp. 409), carrying with them obligations to maintain bridges and highways, are not to be left-doubtful and obscure, when it is quite practicable to remove such difficulties by boundary lines definitely fixed, and otherwise to delimit with certainty the newly annexed territory. In these respects the petition laid before the board of village trustees was objectionably vague and indefinite, and justified the board in the prudent view that the boundaries attempted to be set out had not been located with sufficient accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Furthermore, the petition was not verified as required by Village Law, \u00a7 348, as amended by Laws 1915, c. 257. This provides that the petition is to be signed by a majority of the persons qualified to vote for town officers; also \u201cby the owners of a majority in value of the property therein, assessed upon the last preceding town assessment roll.\u201d Such petition must be \u201cverified by at least three persons signing the same to the effect that the petitioners constitute a majority of the qualified electors, if any, of such territory, and that the petition represents a majority in value of the property <em>as above described.\u201d </em>This petition began:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-6\">\u201cWe, the undersigned, a majority of the residents qualified to vote for town officers, and also the owners of a majority of value in real property of that territory not in a city or village, but adjoining the incorporated village of Patehogue, founded and described as follows: * * * \u2014petition the incorporated village of Patehogue, N. X., to extend its westerly boundaries so as to include the territory above described.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">A verification as provided by Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 526, to such a petition did not comply with this special statutory requirement, especially where the body of the petition did not allege the jurisdictional fact that its signers represented a majority in value of the property therein assessed upon the last preceding town assessment roll. Miller v. City of Amsterdam, 149 N. Y. 288, 43 N. F. 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">The board of trustees of Patehogue, therefore, could not be required, against their judgment, to submit to an election such a proposition to extend the village boundaries, as was set out in this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">The order denying a writ of peremptory mandamus is therefore affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.
