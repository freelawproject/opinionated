Cregan as administratrix with the will annexed of Jane A. McKenna, deceased. The petition alleges that the petitioners, a firm of lawyers, rendered legal services of the reasonable value of $4,000 to the respondent Cregan, in procuring for her the probate, in said Surrogate\u2019s Court, of the will of one Jane A. McKenna, by which will the said respondent was sole legatee; and that by the proceedings conducted by the petitioners for the respondent the will was admitted to probate, she was appointed such administratrix, and as such administratrix she obtained the full estate left by said McKenna, amounting to $30,841, all of which will, upon the close of the administration, belong to the respondent individually as such sole legatee. The petition further alleges that the said Cregan has refused to pay the petitioners for their said services, and that the petitioners have therefore a lien upon the said estate in the hands of the said Cregan as such administratrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">Upon the return of the citation issued to the respondent, she, by her attorney, moved to dismiss the petition upon the ground that the petitioners are not persons having an interest in the estate of the said McKenna; and the said surrogate, upon that ground alone, granted the motion, and the decree appealed from resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">The question involved here is whether or not the petitioners, upon the facts alleged in the petition, are persons \u201cinterested in the estate or fund,\u201d meaning the McKenna estate, in the hands of the administratrix within the meaning of subdivision la of section 2727 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as the term \u201cinterested\u201d is defined in subdivision 11 of section 2768 of such Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The petitioners here claim that, upon the facts alleged in their petition, they have a lien upon the interest of the said Cregan individually in the estate, which chances in this case to be the entire estate. I think that such claim should be sustained; and that, upon the facts so alleged, they have, under section 475 of the Judiciary Law, a lien for the value of their services upon the said Cregan\u2019s individual interest in the said estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\"><bracketnum>[2,3]</bracketnum> The respondent\u2019s counsel here claims that, in the Surrogate\u2019s Court, they claimed a lien upon the estate itself; and that the surrogate dealt with the matter upon that basis; and the form of the petition accords with that view. Still if, upon the facts, they have a lien upon respondent\u2019s interest in the estate as such legatee, T can see no reason why the petition should have been denied. It would seem that the larger claim should be held to include the smaller. Respond<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>ent\u2019s counsel, in his brief, cites Matter of Sayles, 57 Misc. Rep. 524, 109 N. Y. Supp. 972, in which a surrogate of Oneida county held that the holder of a judgment obtained against administrators for legal services rendered to them in the management of the estate was not, by virtue thereof, a,person \u201cinterested in the estate,\u201d and therefore could not petition for a compulsory accounting, for the reason that the claim for such services was against the administrators personally. In that case, however, there was nothing to show that the administrators individually had any beneficial interest in the estate, which w;as, by lien or judgment, subject to tire claim for such services. Here, upon the facts alleged in the petition, the petitioners have a lien upon the individual interest of the administratrix in the estate. Apparently counsel have been unable to find any other decision directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">It seems to me, however, that the contrary view is, by fair implication, involved in the decision of this court in Matter of Ross, 123 App. Div. 74, 107 N. Y. Supp. 899, wherein this court held that an attorney could maintain, directly against the estate, a lien for the value of his services rendered in recovering moneys for the estate, although his client in the proceeding was an executor or administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Also, in Matter of Regan, 167 N. Y. 338, 60 N. E. 658, the Court of Appeals held that the Surrogate\u2019s Court had power to vacate its decree rendered on a final accounting, because the same did not recognize and provide for the lien of attorneys upon the distributive interests in the estate for their services in the matter for the distributees.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">It would seem, moreover, that tire Surrogate\u2019s Court has, incidentally, power to determine the amount of the lien in a case where the lien exists against the estate. Matter of Smith, 111 App. Div. 23, 97 N. Y. Supp. 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">According to said subdivision 11 of section 2768 of the Code, the expression \u201cpersons interested\u201d includes \u201cevery person entitled, either absolutely or contingently, to share in the estate or the proceeds thereof, or in the fund, as husband, wife, legatee, next of kin, heir, devisee, assignee, grantee or otherwise except as a creditor.\u201d It seems to me that a person having a lien upon a legacy may be regarded as an equitable assignee of the legacy, in whole or in part, and as coming within the compass of the terms just quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">As to the lien acting as such assignment, see Close v. Shute, 4 Dem. Sur. 546, 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">If the statement made by the late Surrogate Coffin, in the case just cited, that an attorney could have no lien for services in the Surrogate\u2019s Court, was at that time correct, it seems to have been later decided to the contrary. Matter of Regan, supra, 167 N. Y. 338, 60 N. E. 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">I advise, therefore, that the order of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Kings County be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and that the matter be remitted to said court for further hearing and proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">JENKS, P. J., and CARR and RICH, JJ\u201e concur. PUTNAM, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
