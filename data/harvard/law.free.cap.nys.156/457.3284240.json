Lienors, materialmen, assert liens to the extent of the difference between the cost of completion and the amount of the contract price unpaid when the liens were filed. They met the burden of proving the essential fact of that difference by the certificates of the owner\u2019s architects, certifying to the cost of completion. The owner does not complain of the competency of that evidence, and the lienors have no other foundation for their judgment. Beecher v. Schuback, 1 App. Div. 359, 365, 37 N. Y. Supp. 325, affirmed on opinion below 158 N. Y. 687, 53 N. E. 1123; Zimmerman v. Jourgenson, 14 N. Y. Supp. 548, 549;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Watts v. Board of Education, 9 App. Div. 143, 41 N. Y. Supp. 141. On this appeal, however, the lienors would impeach the certificate on a question of fact in relation to the payment of wages of the laborers on the job for the week in which the work was abandoned. This item may be fairly within the proper scope-of the certificate. Non constat but that the owner would have been able to show that the payment was necessary to complete the work, had the lienors adopted another method of proving their cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> There is sufficient evidence to sustain, as proper and lawful payments on account of the contract price, the items of $35,000 and $5,783.84. The owner counterclaimed for damages for delay, liquidated, not actual. To such damages it was not entitled. Mosler Safe Co. v. Maiden Lane S. D. Co., 199 N. Y. at pages 487, 488, 93 N. E. 81, 37 L. R. A. (N. S.) 363; Crawford v. Becker, 13 Hun, 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The services of the architect were no part of the contract which the owner was completing on \u201ethe contractor\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The notice of lien of the Atlas Portland Cement Company is fatally defective. It fails to state the materials furnished t\u00bb the real property described in the notice as subject to the lien, and the agreed price and value thereof. This the lien law expressly requires. Section 9 of the Lien Law; Mahley v. German Bank, 174 N. Y. 499, 501, 67 N. E. 117. It grouped in the notice materials furnished under several contracts for the improvement of distinct pieces of real property widely separated, being improved as independent operations. Provision being made for the adjustment of priorities of conflicting liens where several pieces of property are improved under one contract (section 13 of the Lien Law), there is indication that the Legislature did not intend that a valid lien could be acquired by the notice under examination. See Leske v. Wolf, 154 App. Div. 233, 138 N. Y. Supp. 859; Chapin v. Persse &amp; Brooks Paper Works, 30 Conn. 461, 473, 79 Am.
