This defect is claimed to exist in the order of publication of the summons herein against unknown owners, which order directed that the same be published in the \u201cNew York Law Journal, published in the city of New York, borough of Manhattan,\u201d and in the \u201cEvening Telegram, published in the city of New York, borough of the Bronx.\u201d It appears that in the original order of publication, which was in type<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>writing, blank spaces had been left for the names of the papers wherein the advertisement was to be had, after which appeared the words \u201ccity of New York, borough of the Bronx,\u201d in typewriting. The judge, in making the order, struck out the word \u201cBronx\u201d and substituted the word \u201cManhattan,\u201d after the name of the Law Journal appeared, but did not do so in the corresponding space after the name of the Evening Telegram. The publication was had in the New York Law Journal and in the Evening Telegram, which is the only paper by that name published in the city of New York, and which as a matter of fact is published in the borough of Manhattan. There is no Evening Telegram published in the borough of the Bronx, nor any paper of a similar name. The publication was completed in these two papers. On August 30, 1915, the judge who signed the original order\u201d made another order amending it nunc pro, tune upon a recitation of his intention that the summons should have been published in the New York Law Journal and the Evening Telegram, both published in the city of New York, borough of Manhattan, the papers in which the publication had actually taken place. It is apparent that the error in the original order was purely a clerical one, and that the publication having taken place in the Evening Telegram, the only newspaper by that name in either borough, the court had authority to correct the error and to amend the original order nunc pro tune. Mishkind-Feinberg Realty Co. v. Sidorsky, 189 N. Y. 402, 82 N. E. 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s title to the premises in question, this being the only objection urged against the same, was therefore marketable, and under the stipulation plaintiff is entitled to a judgment for specific performance, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
