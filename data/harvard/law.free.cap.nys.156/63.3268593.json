When defendant, to defeat plaintiff\u2019s claim under the oral contract, introduced the written order signed by plaintiff, which contained a clause limiting defendant\u2019s liability in case the peach trees delivered proved untrue to name and not the varieties ordered, then plaintiff was entitled to show that the written order was void and of no effect, because plaintiff\u2019s signature thereto was obtained by the false representation of defendant\u2019s agent, Mull, to the effect that said written order contained nothing but an order for the goods which plaintiff had purchased. Wilcox v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 176 N. Y. 115, 68 N. E. 153, 98 Am. St. Rep. 650; Smith v. Ryan, 191 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>N. Y. 452, 84 N. E. 402, 19 L. R. A. (N. S.) 461, 123 Am. St. Rep. 609, 14 Ann. Cas. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Plaintiff\u2019s action was not grounded in fraud, but in contract; and plaintiff had the right, without pleading fraud, to overcome the effect of the written order by showing it to have been obtained by fraud. When defendant delivered trees of other varieties than those which plaintiff purchased, there was a breach of defendant\u2019s contract, for which it was liable in damages. Sanford v. Brown Bros. Co., 134 App. Div. 652, 119 N. Y. Supp. 333; s. c., 208 N. Y. 90, 101 N. E. 797, 50 L. R. A. (N. S.) 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\"><bracketnum>[3-6]</bracketnum> This without reference to any express warranty by the agent, Mull. There was an implied warranty that the trees defendant delivered were of the varieties plaintiff had ordered. Defendant could avoid liability only by satisfying the jury either that Mull did not falsely represent the contents of the written and printed order which plaintiff signed, or that plaintiff did, in fact, know the contents of that order. As defendant accepted the order and undertook to fill it, we think it was hound by any representation by its agent as to the contents of the order made to secure plaintiff\u2019s signature; hence, it is immaterial whether Mull had authority to make an express warranty or not. If it was error to admit evidence of an express warranty made by Mull on a sale to other parties, we think the error was harmless The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
