While the color of the box manufactured by the defendant and the white border are similar in appearance to those in which are sold the \u201cPall Mall\u201d cigarette, it is dear that the boxes do not contain either design, coat of arms, monogram, or words similar to those used upon the boxes in which the \u201cPall Mall\u201d cigarettes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>are sold. We are of opinion that the defendant\u2019s package complained of in no way so resembles the plaintiff\u2019s, and that in using the same the defendant is not guilty of a violation of the injunction contained in the judgment above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs.
