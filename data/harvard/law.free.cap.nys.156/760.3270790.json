Defendants represented to plaintiff that only the floors remained to be completed, whereupon the builder assigned the last payment, and defendants, being informed, agreed to make payment to plaintiff as feoon as the floors should be laid. <em>Held, </em>that in such case defendants, the floors having been laid, were estopped to deny that other work was necessary before the building was completed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b784-11\">[Ed.

Y.; final installment of $500 to be paid O\u2019Flynn \u201cwhen the whole building is in operating condition.\u201d O\u2019Flynn, being short of money, applied to plaintiff for an advance of this $500, offering to assign his claim for the last installment under the contract as security. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney thereupon called upon one Nichols, representing the defendants, substantially explaining this situation to Nichols, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-18\">\u201cMr. O\u2019Flynn has told us that there was a balance due on the building loan contract, and I asked how much. I believe he said $600. I says, \u2018How much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>work remains to be done under that building loan contract?\u2019 He says, \u2018The floors in the stores,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Will you consent to have Mr. O\u2019Mynn sign a receipt showing that he has received all the money he was entitled to under the building loan contract, and then you hold that money for us in escrow until those floors will be completed?\u2019 He says, \u2018Yes.\u2019 I then reported that to my client.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Thereupon O\u2019Flynn receipted on the bond for the last payment, and assigned to the plaintiff \u201cthe sum of $500 due from defendants as a balance under a contract for a building loan on premises, etc., upon the completion of the buildings in accordance with the terms of said contract.\u201d A few days thereafter plaintiff\u2019s attorney brought a duplicate of this assignment to Mr. Nichols, who thereupon instructed his bookkeeper, in the attorney\u2019s presence, to send a check for the $500 to the attorney \u201cas soon as she had a report that the floors were laid.\u201d Plaintiff thereupon paid the $500 to O\u2019Flynn. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney further testified that he \u201crelied entirely upon Mr. Nichols\u2019 statement as to what was necessary to be done in order to complete the building.\u201d Upon proof by plaintiff that the floors had been laid, he sued to recover from defendants the $500 balance under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Defendants, over plaintiff\u2019s objection, proved that the building was not completed in other respects. Plaintiff\u2019s objection was based on the theory that defendants were estopped to claim that the building, was uncompleted except in respect of the floors in conformity with the statement of Mr. Nichols to plaintiff\u2019s attorney. There seems to he no doubt that plaintiff has properly invoked the doctrine of estoppel in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">No denial of the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s counsel was made at the trial, nor is it now suggested that it was not literally true.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Defendants urge that plaintiff\u2019s claim is in some way in contradiction to or in derogation of the terms of a written contract, referring to the assignment given by O\u2019Flynn to the plaintiff which recites that the balance of $500 is to be paid \u201cupon completion of the building in accordance with the terms of said contract.\u201d It is not necessary to say anything further in regard toi that point than that plaintiff is suing, not in derogation of the terms of that contract, but strictly within its terms. He claims that the building is completed, but claims also that defendants are estopped to deny its completion because of their previous statement as to what remained to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Defendants also' contend that there is no room for the application of the doctrine of estoppel here because the statement of defendants\u2019 representative was merely \u201ccasual,\u201d and because, in order to invoke the doctrine, the party appealing to it must not only have been destitute of knowledge concerning the real facts in respect of which the representation has been made, but also without convenient and available facilities for obtaining such knowledge. But it is quite manifest that these two factors were present in the case at bar. Indeed, plaintiff\u2019s attorney testified, in answer to the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-10\">\u201cQ. Did you examine the building before you made this advance to Mr. O\u2019Mynn based on this assignment? A. No, sir. The property is up in Highland Halls, I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>To characterize the statement upon which the estoppel is predicated as casual would be a violent misnomer. It is difficult to surmise how a statement could be less casual than one made in the course of an important business negotiation by one party in reply to a question of the other upon a point having a manifestly important bearing upon the intended conduct of the inquiring party.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and, inasmuch as defendants have evidently exposed their entire case and rely purely on the questions of law involved, judgment should be directed in favor of plaintiff, with $30 costs of this appeal and appropriate costs in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
