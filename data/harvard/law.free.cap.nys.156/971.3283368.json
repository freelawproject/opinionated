At the time of his death he was earning $5.50 a week. It appears from the evidence, and the Commission has found, that \u201cas he progressed in his trade his wages at the end of two years would, under normal conditions, have increased to $12 per week, and upon arriving at his majority he would have earned in his trade from $12 to' $18 per week.\u201d An award has been made to a dependent mother and sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The appellant does not dispute the facts, but contends against the consideration by the Commission of a probable increase in the wages of the deceased minor employ\u00e9, and against an award based on such consideration. The Commission has assumed that its power to make the award appealed from arises from the language of section 14 of the act. The- relevant parts of the section read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-6\">\u201cSec. 14. <em>Weekly Wages Basis of Compensation. </em>Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the average weekly wages of the injured employ\u00e9 at the time of the injury shall be taken as the basis upon which to compute compensation or death benefits, and shall be determined as follows: * * * If it be established that the injured employ\u00e9 was a minor when injured, and that under normal conditions his wages would be expected to increase, the fact may be considered in arriving at his average weekly wages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">Arriving at his average weekly wages for what purpose ?_ Tor the purpose of computing \u201ccompensation or <em>death benefits.\u201d </em>This answer comes out of the first paragraph of section 14 itself. This is not tire case of widely separated and apparently discordant sections of a statute, which the court is to attempt to harmonize. Here the language under consideration is all in one section and treats of one subject. Stripped of matters not germane to the subject in hand, we find that section 14 provides that the average weekly wages of the injured employ\u00e9 at the time of the injury shall be taken as the basis upon which to compute compensation or <em>death benefits, </em>and if the injured employ\u00e9 was a minor when injured, and under normal conditions his wages would be expected to increase, that fact may be considered in arriving at bis average weekly wages. Therefore it follows that the Commission acted in accordance with the exact letter, as well as the spirit, of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The attempt of the appellant to invoke the last sentence of section 16 in support of its contention fails entirely, as we comprehend the statute. The sentence in question is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-10\">\u201cAll questions of dependency shall be determined as of the time of the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">This is simply a command to the Commission, whenever it attempts to ascertain who are dependents of a deceased employ\u00e9, to take into consideration the circumstances at the time of the accident. It relates in no manner to the right of the Commission to consider the probable earning capacity of an injured employ\u00e9 who was a minor when hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">The award should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
