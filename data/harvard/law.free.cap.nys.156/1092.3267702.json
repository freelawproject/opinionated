This attempted notice of abandonment of traffic at No. 7 Grove street, accompanied by a transfer of the right of such traffic to another location, was a wrong to plaintiff, not to be remedied at law. People ex rel. Spang v. Carey, 167 App. Div. 949, 152 N. Y. Supp. 569. It therefore called for equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">These acts enabled appellants to take over this liquor traffic to a new location and stop and disable plaintiff from traffic at No. 7 Grove street. While not strictly null and void, they were subject to be canceled, and the liquor tax license reassigned in equity. All the first four conclusions of law, however, are modified, so as to strike out at the ends the words \u201cnull, void, and of no effect,\u201d and substitute \u201cin known violation of the plaintiff\u2019s rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">The decree, being conditional upon repayment of the tenant\u2019s indebtedness to the Brewing Company, with interest, fully protected the defendants\u2019 equitable rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">The judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
