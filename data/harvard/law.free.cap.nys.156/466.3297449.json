Blue Points Co., 156 N. Y. Supp. 465, decided herewith, it must be held that defendant unlawfully encroaches on the foot of West street. Though not strictly an abutter on West street, this respondent, Bourne, has a right of direct access to the bay through West street from his land on South Country road, and further, as appurtenant to his other lands, holds a residuum of certain landing and strand rights covering the easterly half of West street, as it extends to and upon the shore, all of which entitled him to tire relief granted by the court. Its findings of fact are therefore confirmed; but the first conclusion of law is enlarged by striking out the limitation to first cause of action, and amending same at folio 108, so as to read, \u201cwhich entitles him to maintain the causes of action alleged in his complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
