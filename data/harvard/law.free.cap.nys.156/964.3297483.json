The evidence authorized the finding of the Commission that at the time Vito Mazzarisi received the injuries resulting in his death he \u201cwas working for his employer driving some piles on the beach at Coney Island and was assisting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>driving sheeting.\u201d This sheeting was to be used in a jetty to extend into the ocean for the protection of the municipal baths on the water front at Coney Island. In work of this character, sheeting is a form of piling. Volpe v. Cederstrand, 126 Minn. 355, 148 N. W. 119. The Century Dictionary defines \u201csheeting\u201d as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-5\">\u201cIn hydraulic engineering, a lining of timber to a caisson or cofferdam formed of sheet piles or piles with flanking between. Also any form of piling used to protect river banks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">The \u201cdriving\u201d of \u201csheeting\u201d was, indubitably, under the evidence and the authorities, the driving of \u201csheet piling,\u201d and brought Mazzarisi\u2019s employment within group 11 of the enumerated employments, to wit, \u201cpile driving.\u201d The fact that the deceased may, at the moment he met with injury, have been engaged in performing a physical act more approximately incident to the making of this sheeting than to the driving of it down into' the sand, could not, had the same been-found by the Commission, or were the same required by the evidence, require reversal of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The immediate cause of death was septicaemia, which actually, naturally, and apparently unavoidably, ensued from the injuries to the abdomen and bladder occasioned by the decedent\u2019s fall. Workmen's Compensation Law, \u00a7 3, subd. 7. The Commission\u2019s inquiry on this point was thorough and skillful; this court has no reason to challenge its conclusion. Doubtless there was a diseased condition before the injury; it may be that the injury would not have caused his death but for these antecedent conditions; the injury may have been but one of concurring causes, set in motion by the injury. None of these facts, if found or clear from the evidence, would warrant vacating of the present award.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">The award should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
