The principal contention is that the mother was not dependent. But it has been determined by the Commission, as a fact, that she was dependent, and under section 20 of the act, where there is any evidence to support such a finding, the decision of the Commission is \u201cfinal\u201d and we are not permitted to review. Matter of Hendricks v. Seeman Bros., 155 N. Y. Supp. 638, handed down at the November term. In the record before us there is much evidence on the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>of the dependency of the mother, and, although it is extraneous to our province to express ourselves upon the subject, we may say that we are convinced that the finding of the Commission was fully justified by the facts presented. The mother had some small means and some other sources of revenue at the time her son died, but the courts will not hold that a claimant must be reduced to- absolute want or be declared a pauper, in order to come within the provisions of the act. Partial dependency is sufficient. Matter of Walz v. Holbrook, Cabot &amp; Rollins Corporation, 155 N. Y. Supp. 703, handed down at the November term.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The appellant contends that the method of computing the deceased\u2019s wages was incorrect. We think the conclusion reached by the Commission was correctly worked out. Of course, we are unable to say what mental processes the Commission employed in arriving at the figures given in their <em>decision; but it </em>seems to us that, under the evidence, the figures given might, very properly, have been the result of the method of computation pointed out in subdivision 3 of section 14. But here again a finding of fact, based upon evidence, is presented to us, and we are powerless to criticize, modify, or revoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">It is not well for this court to fall into the habit of discussing the facts, even for the purpose of showing that the findings of fact are reasonable and meet with our approbation. We cannot, except by usurpation, invade the realm of facts, for it was the clear intent of the Legislature that \u201cthe decision of the Commission shall be final as to all questions of fact.\u201d Of course, if there are no facts, and the decision is arbitrary, unfair, and unreasonable, a question of law arises, and we may right the wrong. Matter of Lizzie Gardener v. Horseheads Construction Co., 156 N. Y. Supp. 899, handed down herewith. But it is wholly improbable that the Commission will make any such decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">The Commission is the sole judge and the \u201cfinal\u201d judge of the facts, and this court is not only forbidden to trespass upon the jurisdiction of the Commission in this field, but, by section 20 of the act, it is circumscribed, even, in its review of questions of law. It was the purpose of the Legislature to create a tribunal to do rough justice \u2014speedy, summary, informal, untechnical. With this scheme of the Legislature we must not interfere; for, if we trench in the slightest degree upon the prerogatives of the Commission, one encroachment will breed another, until finally simplicity will give way to complexity, and informality to technicality.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">The award should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">KELLOGG, P. J., and WOODWARD and COCHRANE, JJ\u201e concur. LYON, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
