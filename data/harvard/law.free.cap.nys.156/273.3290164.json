The answer set up a defense of payment and a general release.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">Plaintiff testified that he made various small loans to defendant during a period of about a year and a half, and such loans aggregated at least $1,579. Thereafter the plaintiff, the defendant, and the latter\u2019s attorney had a conference, in which it was agreed that the plaintiff had advanced that amount, and that the defendant had already paid $540 on account. If these figures were correct, there remained due $1,039. The defendant at that conference paid $750 more, and received from the plaintiff a general release under seal. Plaintiff testified that the release was prepared by defendant\u2019s attorney, who said it was a \u201creceipt\u201d; that he (the plaintiff) did not read it, but believed it to be merely a receipt \u00abfor the $750, though a copy of it was given to him at the time. He further testified that the defendant promised to pay the balance in a few days. If this testimony is true, plaintiff\u2019s claim was not without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">The judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
