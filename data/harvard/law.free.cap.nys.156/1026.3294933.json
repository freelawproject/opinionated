In substance it provided that the parties of the first part should act as managers for the parties of the second part in their capacity as teachers of dancing and public performers in that art. The third clause of the contract reads as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-19\">\u201cThird. That for their services as managers as aforesaid the parties of the first part shall receive twenty (20) per cent, or less according to circumstances, to be decided upon by mutual agreement of all moneys earned by the parties of the second part or either of them by teaching dancing and from 15 to 25 per cent, of all moneys earned by the parties of the second part by exhibition dancing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-20\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> The demurrer was interposed on the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and also that there is a defect of parties defendant. For some reason, which is not explained, the second ground of demurrer does not appear to have been passed on by the learned judge below; and as to the first ground he was of opinion that there was a mutuality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>agreement. It is perfectly manifest that there is a defect of parties defendant, the agreement being joint both as to the parties of the first part and the parties of the second part, and that therefore the omission to make the other party, who is jointly liable with defendant, a party to the action is fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">As to the so-called agreement itself, it seems to me to be equally apparent that no terms of compensation have been fixed; it being evidently contemplated in the clause which I have quoted that the agreement was incomplete and that a binding agreement would be made subsequently. There is therefore no agreement. Petze v. Morse Co., 125 Apt. Div. 267, 109 N. Y. Supp. 328, affirmed 195 N. Y. 584, 89 N. E. 1110; Mayer v. McCreery, 119 N. Y. 434, 23 N. E. 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion of defendant for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the complaint, granted, with costs to appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
