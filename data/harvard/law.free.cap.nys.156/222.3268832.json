On October 8th the defendant appeared specially, and filed with the clerk of the court a notice of appearance, and an objection to the jurisdiction of the court, pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>to section 88 of the Municipal Court Code which went into effect September 1, 1915. Upon a hearing of the objections, the same were overruled, by the trial justice, and the defendant was given leave to plead within two days thereafter, upon payment of $10 costs. No answer having been filed, a judgment was entered by default against the defendant. The defendant thereupon made a motion before the justice who heard the objections, for leave to appeal to the Appellate Term, which was denied, and he now makes the same motion in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">Section 88 of the Municipal Court Code provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">\u201cAn objection that the court has no jurisdiction of the person of the defendant or no jurisdiction of the subject [matter] of the action, may be taken by filing a notice of special appearance as hereinbefore provided. All other objections which heretofore might have been taken by demurrer may be taken by motion. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">It will be seen that, where objection is taken to the jurisdiction of the court over either the person or the subject-matter of the action, it must be by filing a notice of special appearance; but there seems to he no provision for an appeal from an order made determining such a motion, in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Section 154, subd. <em>7, </em>permits an appeal from an order sustaining or overruling an objection taken to a \u201cpleading\u201d as prescribed in sections 88 and 89 of the Municipal Court Code. Clearly an objection taken to the jurisdiction of the court is not an objection taken to a pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
