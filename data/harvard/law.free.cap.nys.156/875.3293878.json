This is not even denied, and is not satisfactorily explained. Under the circumstances disclosed, a judgment so obtained cannot be permitted to stand without a reflection upon the administration of justice by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-17\">The order denying motion for a new trial should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant to abide the event, and motion granted, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
