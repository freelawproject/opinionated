Y. Supp. 170; 161 App. Div. 949, 146 N. Y. Supp. 1089), the evidence showed a use of these inclined planks, not only by em-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>pi oyes of the contractor, but also by employ\u00e9s of defendant, including other trackwalkers besides deceased; and this use was testified to as frequent and participated in by trackwalkers, both by night and openly in the daytime. The issue whether defendant had actual or imputable knowledge that its trackwalkers actually used these planks in going about their duties upon this elevated structure was fairly before the jury. While it is urged that three juries having found for plaintiff must carry special weight, and even imports a finality, such cumulative verdicts do not relieve this court from a careful scrutiny of the testimony to ascertain whether this judgment now under review is sustainable. Upon such examination of the present record, we find no reversible error in course of the trial, and in view of -the later and ampler proofs, we cannot pronounce the verdict against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Therefore the judgment and order are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">JENKS, P.
