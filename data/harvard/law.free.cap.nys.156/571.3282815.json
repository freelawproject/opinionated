By her last will and testament, after making certain bequests, she directed, by the \u201cfourteenth\u201d paragraph thereof, that the surplus of her personal property \u201cbe deposited in trust as hereinafter set forth.\u201d Such surplus was thus included in tire trust created as to her realty by the \u201csixteenth\u201d paragraph of her will, by which, after providing for tire \u201capplication of tire net rents, issues and profits thereof for and toward the maintenance and education of my grandson Herman Krug until he has attained the age of twenty-one years,\u201d she provided for the disposition of any surplus until he became 21, when the same was to be paid over to him. The rents, issues, and profits were to be paid over to Herman Krug semiannually thereafter until he shall have attained the age of 25 years, \u201cwhen I give, devise and bequeath all my said real estate unto him my aforesaid grandson, Herman Krug, to have and to^ hold the same for himself, his heirs and assigns forever, and in case he my said grandson should die prior to attaining the age of twenty-five years leaving issue him surviving, then and in that case I give, devise and bequeath all my aforesaid real estate unto such issue, to be divided by and between such issue share and share alike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">It is the contention of the appellants that there were three contingencies which might occur in reference to the trust estate: (1) The cestui que trust attaining the age of 25 years, when he would become absolutely entitled to the remainder. (2) The cestui que trust dying prior to attaining the age of 25 years, leaving issue him surviving, between whom the entire trust estate was to be divided. The appellants contend that in either of these contingencies, for which the will expressly provides, no higher transfer tax than 1 per cent, could be imposed, as Herman Krug, is decedent\u2019s grandson and nearest next of kin. The respondent does not dispute this. But there is a third contingency, the death of Herman Krug before attaining tire age of 25 years and leaving no issue him surviving, for which the will has made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>no provision. Appellants contend that in that event decedent Zitzlsperger would have died intestate as to the remainder of the trust estate, and as the same would pass to her heirs at law and next of kin who were such at the time of her death, and as Herman Krug answered both those descriptions, and he was in the 1 per cent, class, no higher tax than this could be imposed on the transfer. On the other hand, respondent claims that at the death of Krug without issue the ultimate beneficiaries of the trust might be in the 5 per cent, class, and therefore, under Tax Law (Consol. Laws, c. 60) \u00a7 230, the highest possible rate of tax must be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\">As we construe the will of decedent, upon her death title to the trust estate vested at once in Krug, subject only to be divested in case of his death before attaining 25 years, leaving no issue him surviving. There are no words used in the will indicating any intention to postpone the vesting of title in him. Not only was title at once vested in him as legatee and devisee, but in so far as there was any contingency outstanding the happening of which would defeat that vesting, upon such happening the effect would be to create a new title in Krug as heir at law and nearest next of kin of decedent, which would revert back to the date of decedent\u2019s death and vest in him as of that date. So that in any event title was in Krug, upon whose interest no higher tax than 1 per cent, could be imposed. If Krug should die before attaining 25 years of age, without leaving issue, the tax then to be levied would be on his estate, and not that of Zitzlsperger.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The order appealed from will therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the application to reduce the tax on the remainder from 5 per cent, to 1 per cent, granted. Settle order on notice. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
