The main facts of tire charge the respondent admits, except that he says that the $3,000 was paid to him by way of counsel fee, and not for the purpose of procuring bail, and that it was agreed between himself and his client that the money should be retained by him as counsel fee. This story tire official referee rejects, and properly so, upon the evidence before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Without attempting to detail that evidence in extenso, it is quite evident that the money was paid to respondent for the purpose alleged in the charges, that he undertook to apply it for that purpose, that he did not do so, and that he converted it to his own uses against the wishes and intentions of his client. That this client appears to have been a person of doubtful character is quite true, but that is no reason why he should be robbed of his money, nor is it any answer to this application that later on, under a pressure of possible prosecution, the respondent repaid to his client a portion of the money which he had converted. That circumstance simply serves to establish the fact, well established by the evidence, that the amount which he retained was exorbitant and was extorted from his client against his will. Evidently the respondent thought that, as his client was compelled to go abroad and was resting under serious charges, he could sateiy make away with the money and not be brought to account for it. The referee finds, and we entirely concur with his findings, that the respondent has been guilty of serious dereliction of duty in his office as an attorney and counselor at law, of -a character which demonstrates his unfitness to remain a member of the liar.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">He is therefore disbarred. Settle order on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
