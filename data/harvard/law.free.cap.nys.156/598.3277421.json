The evidence fairly establishes that employment was for six months, with an agreement not to engage in plaintiff\u2019s business in the borough of Manhattan for a year in any other service. Without apparent cause defendant left plaintiff\u2019s service, and is now engaged in collecting wash and soliciting customers for a rival concern, and has succeeded in taking from the plaintiff a number of its customers to its rival. The action is brought to restrain the defendant from soliciting the plaintiff\u2019s customers for its rival, and to restrain him from engaging in tire wet wash business for the period of a year, according to his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">The order appealed from denied a temporary injunction. That order should be reversed, and the defendant should be enjoined during the pendency of the action from soliciting or collecting wash from any person who was a customer of the plaintiff while defendant was in its employ.
