Said checks were duly countersigned by Rosenzweig to the order of one Bennett, and, after subsequent indorsement, sold and delivered to the plaintiff company for value.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The answer denies that defendant has information sufficient to form a belief as to the various allegations of the complaint, and denies that any sum is now due and owing from defendant to the plaintiff, and sets up as separate and distinct defenses: First, that the countersignature of Rosenzweig was obtained by fraud, with notice thereof to plaintiff, before parting with value for said checks; second, that said checks were delivered to one Curtis and one Davidson for a special purpose, of which the plaintiff had knowledge, and were diverted from such purpose by them and converted to their own use, with notice to plaintiff of such diversion, prior to the sale and delivery thereof to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Before considering whether or not the judgment in favor of plaintiff is supported by competent evidence, it is necessary to consider the order appealed from, denying defendant\u2019s motion for the issuance of a commission to take the testimony of Rosenzweig. The rule is well recognized that it is mandatory upon a Municipal Court judge to' grant a motion for the issuance of a commission, provided the moving papers, which include, under section 768 of the Code, the pleadings in the action, made out a prima facie case for the issuance of a commission, and that the evidence sought is material. Oakes v. Riter, 118 App. Div. 772, 103 N. Y. Supp. 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The answer alleges knowledge on the part of the plaintiff, prior to the purchase of the checks, that the signature of Rosenzweig, whose testimony defendant desired to take by commission, was obtained by fraud, and th\u00e1t the checks, after being so countersigned, were delivered for a special purpose and diverted therefrom, and that plaintiff, through its president, had knowledge of such fraud and of such diversion of the checks. This answer constituted part of the moving papers, and the evidence of Rosenzweig as to the facts and circumstances under which he countersigned the checks and delivered the same to Curtis and Davidson was material to the issues. The denial of the motion was therefore error, as was the failure of the justice to state the grounds for such denial. John J. Daly Iron, Steel &amp; Metal Co. v. U. S. Metal &amp; Mfg. Co., 76 Misc. Rep. 576, 137 N. Y. Supp. 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">The judgment and order must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event, and motion for commission granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
