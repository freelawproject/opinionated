On that day defendant made a motion to compel plaintiff to separately state and number the causes of action, which was dismissed by reason of defects in the moving papers. Thereupon, being in default in serving an answer, he applied to the court for an order opening said default and for time to plead. Said motion was granted, and in the order entered therein it was provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-17\">\u201cThat the defendant be permitted to serve the proposed answer, upon payment of $10 costs, said costs to be paid and answer served within five days of the date of the entry of the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-18\">On the same day defendant paid the $10 costs provided for in the order, but failed to serve an answer, and instead -made the motion which resulted in the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-19\">Rule 22 of the General Rules of Practice provides that a motion to make a complaint more definite and certain must be made before answer. The order opening his default in pleading gave defendant leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>to answer, but did not reserve to him the right to make the motion resulting in the order appealed from, nor was any right given him by stipulation. There was, therefore, a,waiver of all objections to the complaint and a bar to the motion. Brooks v. Hauchet, 30 Hun, 70; Post v. Blazewitz, 13 App. Div. 124, 43 N. Y. Supp. 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-3\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
