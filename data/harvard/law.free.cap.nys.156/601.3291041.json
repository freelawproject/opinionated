The judgment demanded is that the bond and mortgage given by the plaintiff be canceled and discharged, and, if security for the performance of the lease on the part of the lessee be required by Hecht, that the defendant Piser Furniture Company be directed to furnish it, or indemnify plaintiff therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Each defendant separately demurred to the complaint, on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Upon the complaint and demurrers the plaintiff moved, under section 547 of the Code of Civil Procedure, for judgment on the pleadings- The court overruled the demurrers, with leave to defendants to withdraw same and answer on payment of $10 costs, in default of which final judgment was ordered for the relief asked in the complaint. The defendants appealed from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">I am of the opinion the order should be reversed, and the demurrers sustained. When Hecht entered into the lease with the plaintiff\u2019s husband, he required him to give a bond for $10,000, secured by mortgage conditioned as collateral security for the performance by the lessee of the terms and covenants on his part to be performed. Before the bond and mortgage were given, plaintiff\u2019s husband died, and she thereupon, with the consent of Hecht, took his place in the lease and gave a bond and mortgage as previously agreed by him. There are no allegations in the complaint to the effect that when the assignments were made by the plaintiff to Piser &amp; Co., and by it to the Piser Furniture Company, either corporation agreed to give Hecht a bond and mortgage as collateral security for the performance of the covenants on the part of the lessee to be performed, or that-Hecht agreed to release the plaintiff from her obligation to perform tire terms of the lease or to surrender tire bond .and mortgage which she-had given. The term of the lease was for seven years, with an option to renew for an additional three years. The rent stipulated to be paid was $15,000 a year, or $105,000 for the seven years, to say nothing of the option to renew, and before Hecht would enter into the lease he required that the bond and mortgage be given. The complaint contains no allegation to the effect that Hecht has ever agreed to give up the security, or that he has done anything which entitles the plaintiff to have the same canceled and returned to her. Obviously, one who has taken collateral security for the payment of rent by a lessee cannot be deprived of it without his consent, and Hecht\u2019s consent cannot be implied from the fact hat he has accepted 'rent from the Piser Company or the Piser Furniture Company; in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>words, the substitution of one tenant in place of another does not operate to discharge, as matter of law, the first tenant from future performance of his covenant to pay rent. Walton v. Stafford, 14 App. Div. 310, 43 N. Y. Supp. 1049, affirmed 162 N. Y. 558, 57 N. E. 92; Jackson v. Brownson, 7 Johns. 227, 5 Am. Dec. 258; Ranger v. Bacon, 3 Misc. Rep. 96, 22 N. Y. Supp. 551; McAdam on Landlord &amp; Tenant, vol. 1, p. 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The order appealed from, therefore, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs to each defendant, and the demurrers sustained, with leave to the plaintiff, on payment of such costs, to serve an amended complaint within 20 days. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
