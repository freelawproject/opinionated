From a judgment for plaintiff, and an order denying new trial, defendants appeal. Reversed, and complaint dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-18\">Appeal by defendants from a judgment for plaintiff, entered April 12, 1915, upon a verdict for $6,500 for personal injuries after a trial at the Westchester County Trial Term; also from an order denying defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial. Plaintiff is suing his employers, for whom he had worked 18 years. Defendants were accustomed to send him out to assemble and set up brick machinery which they manufactured, to be installed at different brickyards. For 5 years plaintiff had been engaged on these special machines.' Defendants contracted to put up a mixer machine at a brickyard near Beacon. In this yard such machines take their power from horizontal shafting of about 3 inches diameter, running 8 or 10 feet above the ground, leading out from a central power plant. Each separate machine connects with this shafting by a countershaft with a friction clutch having two gears. In the old machinery, which defendants took down, was an iron collar for this shaft; its purpose being to stop the lever from sliding past it. This old collar was taken away by defendants, and bored out and shipped back, to be put on the extended shafting for the new machine. The collar went around the shaft, in two halves, clamped together by two set screws. On Thursday, 2 days before this accident, as plaintiff attached this collar, he found that a set screw which came with it, even when screwed in tightly, projected five-eighths of an inch above the collar\u2019s surface. He pointed this out to one Cite, defendants\u2019 superintendent, who said to-morrow he would send other screws, but to go on with the work. On Friday the screws did not come, but there was some talk with Cite, who asked plaintiff to have job finished Saturday; he also promised plaintiff he would ask the brickyard foreman not to put on the power while plaintiff was finishing the installation. But at 7 a. m. Saturday the yard plant started up, and kept this shafting, collar and all, turning with this set screw still in the condition it had been since Thursday. The foreman refused plaintiff\u2019s request to stop, saying he must be making brick.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-19\">After plaintiff had done other finishing work, he had to measure above this shafting for placing the friction lever for connecting the power with the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>machine. With a helper, he put up a plank platform about 5 or 6 feet above the ground, and about 2% feet beneath this collar. To take these measurements plaintiff got on this platform he had erected, standing sideways toward tile main shafting, which was about a foot or 6 inches away. The clutch was at plaintiff\u2019s front, and this set screw about a foot in his rear. By an inadvertent motion, probably turning and bending over, his trowsers were caught in this set screw, whirling him about the shaft, and then throwing him to the ground, injuring- the right leg, so that it was amputated below the knee.</summary>\n<seealso data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"seealso\" id=\"b364-17\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>See, also, 166 App. Div. 904, 150 N.

The judgment was then reversed, and a new trial granted. 106 App. Div. 901, 150 N. Y. Supp. 1082. On tills second trial respondent claimed that he was absorbed in making these measurements, which induced a concentration of mind, which produced \u201cmomentary forgetfulness\u201d of his peril.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b365-6\">Argued before CARR, STAPLETON, MILLS, RICH, and PUTNAM, Jj.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-7\">Thomas E. Curran, of Yonkers, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-8\">Sydney A. Syme, of Mt. Vernon, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b365-9\">PUTNAM, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeU\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The testimony upon the second trial, from the plaintiff himself, that his attention was so centered on his measuring that he did not think of the revolving set screw behind him, does not change plaintiff\u2019s rights. Elis learned counsel, in support of the doctrine of \u201cmomentary forgetfulness,\u201d cites Palmer v. Bearing, 93 N. Y. 7, 11, where one was passing down a stairway in a tenement house, and Larsen v. Lackawanna Steel Co., 146 App. Div. 238, 240, 130 N. Y. Supp. 887, a failure to guard set screws.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">But the case at bar is not one for the doctrine that allows for the tendency of continued routine to deaden by familiarity the effect of earlier warnings, such as dangers along one\u2019s daily pathway (Thompson on Negligence, \u00a7 6266), or the liability to forego earlier precautions, after one has been long and continuously absorbed in new duties. Plaintiff had himself clamped on this collar, and had noted its obvious peril. There was nothing we can hold to be adequate to dim or obliterate his perception of what stood in plain sight. It was not during the monotony of the round of daily duty, but as a special approach for a brief and single purpose, that he got up beside this revolving screw. It was not an act in panic, or compelled by a sudden emergency. There was, therefore, no legal ground to excuse or palliate his forgetfulness. While courts and juries have excused an inadvertent step in places which the person had known to be defective, such prior knowledge was slight, or remote in time, and faded from the mind, or there was an allowable presumption that the danger had been removed, of which there had been some promise. As was said by Thomas, J.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\">\u201cNo one would ever be negligent, it it were sufficient to forget.\u201d Brown v. Associated Operating Co., 165 App. Div. 702, 704, 151 N. Y. Supp. 531.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-12\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The judgment and order must therefore be reversed, with costs; and, as the facts at the trial established contributory negligence, warranting a nonsuit, the complaint should be dismissed, under Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 1317, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
