Defendant neither appealed from the order nor amended his pleading.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-9\">In this condition of the pleadings, the case came on for trial before the court and a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-10\">On the trial the court directed a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount, and ordered defendant\u2019s exceptions .to be heard in the first instance at general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-11\"><em>Elliott Sandford, </em>attorney, and of counsel, for plaintiff, on the points decided by the court, urged:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEK\">I. When the action was tried below, the case stood as if .the first defense had never been pleaded. A defendant cannot avail himself at the trial of defenses to which demurrers have been interposed and sustained (Baldwin <em>v. </em>U. S. Telegraph Co., 1 <em>Lans. </em>125, 135). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The only issue, therefore, to be considered at the trial, .was the rendition of services.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-5\">II. During the trial, defendant\u2019s attorney moved to dismiss the complaint for the reason that the plaintiff had not shown that he had been recognized as an officer by the judges. The motion was correctly denied, for the reason that there was no such issue in the case, the complaint alleging that such was the fact and the answer not denying it. furthermore, there was proof already before the court that plaintiff had been employed and rendered service under the eye of the court, and that, in law, was an appointment and a recognition.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-6\"><em>Win. C. Whitney, </em>counsel to the corporation, and <em>Charles P. Miller, </em>of counsel for defendants, on the points decided by the court, urged:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkE\">The position taken by defendants is, that the allegation in the second paragraph or subdivision of their answer, which denies \u201cthat plaintiff performed any services whatever, as an attendant and messenger in the superior court,\u201d during the months for which suit is brought, raises the issue fairly, for if plaintiff performed no service, there could have been no ratification or recognition\u2014there being nothing to ratify or recognize.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b213-7\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcT\">Plaintiff\u2019s claim to compensation rests upon his appointment by the board of supervisors, his recognition as such appointee by the judges of the court, and the rendition of services in pursuance thereof. The answer of the defendants, as interposed, contained two distinct defenses pleaded separately, The first was to the effect that the supervisors had no power to appoint, and the second put in issue the rendition of the services. They were not connected by any averment.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">On plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to the first defense it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>held at special term (50 <em>How. Pr..91), </em>upon the authority of Brennan <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c. (62 <em>N. Y. </em>365), that the naked plea of want of authority in the supervisors was, in the absence of any denial of the alleged adoption and ratification of the appointment by the court, insufficient in law to constitute a defense, but leave was granted to the defendants to amend their answer on payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Of this privilege they did not see fit to avail themselves, nor did they appeal, and consequently the adjudication of the special term disposed of defendants\u2019 first defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Under the former practice, when judgment was given for the plaintiff upon his demurrer to a plea, the defendant was bound in all cases in which the judgment given was not a final one, but merely a <em>respondeas </em>ouster, to plead anew, or his default in not pleading could be entered; and though the nature and office of the demurrer have been essentially changed under the new system introduced by the Code, yet the effect of an adjudication such as has been made in this case, is very much the same as it was before. The defense which has been disposed of by the proceedings on the demurrer is no longer available.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Moreover it appears that the allegation of plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint that the several judges of the court recognized and employed the plaintiff in and about said court as an attendant, is nowhere denied in the answer, and hence it must, under the requirement of section 168 of the Code, be taken as true for the purposes of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">It is therefore plain that the only issue to be determined on the trial related to the rendition of the services. On this point the testimony was sufficient to authorize the direction of a verdict. Defendant\u2019s counsel did nob ask to have this question submitted to the jury. True, he asked to be allowed to go to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>jury on the question of recognition. But that question, as already showed, was not in issue, and having made a request for a specific purpose, for which he had no right to make it, he cannot on appeal and on a mere exception resort to it for another and different purpose (Schroff <em>v. </em>Bauer, 33 <em>N. Y. Superior Ct. </em>199, and cases there cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">None of defendants\u2019 exceptions being tenable, the exceptions should be overruled and judgment absolute ordered for plaintiff on the verdict, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Curtis, Ch. J., and Sanford, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
