The complaint further averred that the defendant accepted said deed, intending thereby to assume and in equity and good conscience did assume and agree to pay said mortgage, as part of the consideration of her purchase; that by xdrtue of such conveyance defendant became seized, in fee of said premises subject to said mortgage, and became thereby bound to indemnify and save harmless the said plaintiff from the said mortgage and all the conditions therein. The foreclosm-e of the said mortgage by the assignees thereof xvas also averred, the result of such foreclosure being a judgment against the plaintiff for a deficiency of $5,585.71.

She further denied that by reason of anything in said deed contained she became or ever was or is now bound to indemnify the said plaintiff or to save Mm harmless from the said mortgagee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">The answer put in issue all the allegations of the complaint not specifically admitted, and set up affirmative defenses, which it is unnecessary to state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-6\">Upon the trial the plaintiff proved, among other tilings, that on February 14, 1873, he was seized in fee and possessed of the house and lot described in the complaint; that on February 15, 1873, he mortgaged the same to one Luyster, to secure the payment of $15,000, with interest thereon ; that on February 5, 1873, he made an agreement with William Leonard to sell and convey to him the said premises for the price of $21,500, subject to the said mortgage, and to the payment thereof by Leonard as part of such contract price; that in and by said agreement Leonard agreed to purchase said premises on the terms and conditions therein mentioned, and to pay said purchase money by assuming the payment of said mortgage as part thereof, and to pay the residue partly in cash and partly by a conveyance of other property to the plaintiff; that subsequently to said February 5, 1873, Leonard directed the plaintiff to execute a deed to the defendant herein, instead of executing the same to the said Leonard, and that on or about February 18, 1873, the plaintiff, for value received, and by direction of Leonard, executed and delivered to the defendant a deed of said premises, bearing date February 18, 1873, whereby the said plaintiff, therein described as the party of the first part thereto, for an expressed consideration of $26,000,\u2014 recited to have been paid to Mm by the defendant, who was therein described as the party of the second part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>conveyed to said defendant the said premises, \u201c subject, nevertheless, to a certain indenture of mortgage given by the party hereto of the first part to secure the principal sum of $15,000, and interest, . . . which said mortgage the party hereto of the <em>first </em>part hereby assumes and agrees to pay as part of the consideration hereinbefore expressed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-5\">The plaintiff further proved that on April 1, 1873, by deed bearing date on that day and duly executed under her hand and seal, the defendant for the consideration therein expressed of $28,000, conveyed the said premises to one Edward D. Bell, describing them in and by said deed as \u201cthe same premises conveyed to the said party of the first part, (the defendant) by Benjamin P. Fairchild, (the plaintiff) by deed, dated February 18, 1873, and recorded, February 20, 1873;\u201d such conveyance was made, subject to the mortgage mentioned and referred to in the deed from plaintiff to defendant, and Bell, the defendant\u2019s grantee, therein and thereby assumed and agreed to pay the said mortgage as part of the consideration of the said conveyance from defendant to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\">The plaintiff .further proved that the deed executed by him to defendant was drawn by an attorney, one George F. Demurest, at his request; that he handed to Demurest Ms contract with Leonard and instructed Mm to prepare a deed in accordance therewith, substituting the name of the defendant for that of Leonard, as grantee ; and that he intended to execute a deed subject to the mortgage, the grantee assuming and agreeing to pay it. He testified that he never knew of the phraseology of the deed whereby it was stated that the party of the <em>\u201cfirst\u201d </em>part assumed payment of the mortgage, until the answer of the defendant was served in the present suit. Demurest testified that he received instructions from the plaintiff to prepare the deed in accordance with the contract- between the plaintiff and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Leonard, and delivered the deed to Leonard for the defendant. It was not delivered to the defendant personally. He supposed the deed conformed to the contract, until after the commencement of this suit; and he testified, without objection, that the clause of the deed, whereby the party of the <em>first </em>part thereto assumed and agreed to pay the mortgage as part of the consideration therein expressed, was strictly and clearly a clerical error, as the intention was that the grantee should assume the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-5\">The plaintiff further proved that by sundry mesne assignments thereof the said mortgage with the bond therein mentioned was transferred to the trustees of Elizabeth 0. Chauncy, deceased, and that, the same having become due, by reason of default in the pay ment of interest, agreeably to certain conditions therein contained, an action was commenced by the said trustees in the supreme court, on September 23, 1874, for the foreclosure of said mortgage. Plaintiff, defendant and said Bell were, with others, made parties defendant, and such proceedings were thereupon had, that a judgment was finally rendered in said suit, for the recovery by said trustees of the said sum of $5,585.71, against the said plaintiff, the said sum being a deficiency of the proceeds of the sale of said mortgaged premises, to satisfy the amount adjudged to be due to said trustees upon the said mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-6\">The plaintiff also proved that he had paid the said sum with interest to said trustees as required by said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-7\">By the record of the said judgment which was put in evidence on the part of the plaintiff, it appeared that the defendant answered the complaint in foreclosure, and, by her answer thereto, expressly admitted that the plaintiff herein sold and conveyed to her the mortgaged premises, and that she received the deed therefor. She also admitted that she received the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>land, subject to the said mortgage, and afterward sold and conveyed said land to said Bell subject thereto; but she therein denied that she had ever agreed to pay the mortgage, and denied that under the deed to her she was bound to pay it. The judgment of foreclosure and sale was rendered upon the consent of her attorney, and did not charge her with personal liability for any deficiency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\">At the close of the evidence on the part of the plaintiff, counsel for defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that there had been no proof that the defendant adopted or agreed to the contract between plaintiff and Leonard, or in any way agreed to assume the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\">The court dismissed the complaint, counsel for plaintiff duly excepting, and judgment was thereupon entered in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b280-7\"><em>S.

The cause of action, stated in the complaint, entitles plaintiff to both the equitable and legal relief prayed for, and those causes of action were properly joined <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 167; Haire <em>v. </em>Baker, 5 N. <em>Y. </em>362 ; Bradley <em>v. </em>Aldrich, 40 <em>Id. </em>509, 511, 512; Sternberger <em>v. </em>McGovern, 56 <em>Id. </em>20; Bruce <em>v. </em>Kelly, 5 <em>Hun, </em>229 ; Anderson <em>v. </em>Hunn, 12 <em>Sup.

The right to legal relief being shown by the complaint, the court does not lose its right to grant such legal relief, even if the plaintiff fails to obtain the equitable relief prayed for (Barlow <em>v. </em>Scott, 24 N. <em>Y. </em>45; Sternberger <em>v. </em>McGovern, <em>supra; </em>Bradley <em>v. </em>Aldrich, <em>supra; </em>N. Y. Ice Co. <em>v. </em>N. W. Ins.

The circumstances of the case show that the words used in the <em>habendum </em>clause of the deed, by which \u201c the party of th <em>&amp; first </em>part\u201d assumes payment of the mortgage, were inserted by mistake, that they do not declare the intention of the parties, and that the intention of the parties was that \u201cthe party of the <em>second </em>part \u2019 \u2019 should assume such payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-5\">IV. But the defendant did receive the deed, and she fully consummated the contract of sale, in precisely the same manner as Leonard would have done. She conveyed, or caused to be conveyed (it matters not which), to the plaintiff, the lots described in the contract ; and she paid, or caused to be paid in cash, the balance of the purchase-money according to the contract ; and, she sold the property to Bell in 1873, requiring Bell to assume payment of the mortgage <em>(Vide </em>Campbell <em>v. </em>Smith, 8 <em>Hun, </em>6).</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-6\">V. If the defendant did not know when the deed was delivered what its contents were, she must have believed that the deed conformed to the contract. If she did know the contents of the deed as delivered to her, she was guilty of a fraud on the plaintiff, and this alone is sufficient to authorize reformation of the deed (Wells <em>v. </em>Yates, 44 <em>N. Y. </em>525; Cited and approved, Bryce v. Lorillard Fire Ins. Co., 55 <em>Id. </em>243. The fraud need not be set forth in complaint, <em>Ib.).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-7\">VI. There is no principle of equity more fully established than that courts of equity will reform and correct written instruments where, from accident or mistake, they fail to express the intention of the parties thereto.

Even although it be the mistake of one party only (Andrews v. Gillespie, 47 N. Y. 490 ; Nevins v. Dunlap, 33 <em>Id. </em>680). A mistake of the scrivener who prepared the instrument, is sufficient ground for reforming the instrument (Nevins v. Dunlap, <em>supra; </em>Wood v. Hubbell, 10 N. Y. 484; <em>Willard's Eq. </em>73 ; <em>Story's Eq. </em>\u00a7 164, f; Huss v. Morris, 63 <em>Pa. </em>367, note A; Van Darge v. Van Darge, <em>23 </em>Mich. 321; Hunt v.

But aside from the question of the plaintiff\u2019s right to equitable relief, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the covenant in the deed, as it stands, without any reformation.

To entitle a party to a decree reforming a written instrument, the plaintiff must bring himself 'within the following rules : (1.) The mistake must have been a mutual mistake, and must be plain, and clearly proved. (2.) The mistake must be of fact, not of law; and a mistake as to the meaning of language is a mistake of law. (3.) It must be clearly shown to the court what the real contract was. If any doubt be left on this point, the written contract cannot be disturbed (Kent v. Manchester, 29 <em>Barb. </em>595 ; Mills v. Lewis, 37 <em>How. Pr. </em>418; 55 <em>Barb. </em>179; Fennel v. Wilson, 2 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>N. <em>S. </em>466 ; Lyman v.

In this case the plaintiff not only fails to prove the basis of his compl\u00e1int, that the defendant intended to assume the mortgage, but it was clearly proved by plaintiff that defendant never entered into any contract or agreement, verbal or otherwise, with, or made any promises to the plaintiff; nor did she pay any part of the consideration. On the contrary, the contract was made by plaintiff with Mr. Leonard ; the consideration was paid by Mr. Leonard ; the deed was actually delivered to Mr. Leonard, and the deed was made to defendant simply because Mr. Leonard asked it, and because, as plaintiff understood, Mr. Leonard had made a trade with defendant. There is not only nothing to connect the defendant with the transaction but the evidence shows positively that she had nothing to do with the transaction in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-6\">III. There is no delivery of the deed to the defendant (Perstetson v. Hughes, 65 <em>Barb. </em>134).</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-7\">IV. A conveyance made \u201csubject\u201d to a mortgage does not bind the grantee to pay the mortgage (Minor v. Terry, 6 <em>How. Pr. </em>208 ; Binsse v. Paige, 1 Keyes, 87).</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-8\">Y. The question of intent on the part of defendant to assume the mortgage was a question of fact simply ; and \u201c the rule that the report of the referee, like the verdict of a jury, is conclusive as to the questions of fact, is applicable to the findings of a judge. He takes the testimony, hears and sees the withesses, and is quite as well able as a jury or referee to arrive at a right conclusion as to the facts\u201d (N. Y. Superior Court, Ritter v. Cushman, 35 <em>How. Pr. </em>284 ; Lewis v. Greider, 49 <em>Barb. </em>606).</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\"> Note.\u2014Of course, if the facts constituting the legal cause of action are not averred in the complaint and the defendant raises the point that although the facts proven constitute a legal cause of action, yet such cause of action is not complained upon, no recovery can be had thereon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arx\">The acceptance by defendant Lynch, of the conveyance of plaintiff to her, would have held her to the performance of any agreement on her part stated therein (Atlantic Dock Co. <em>v. </em>Leavitt, 54 <em>N. Y. </em>35; Spaulding <em>v. </em>Hallenbeck, 35 <em>Id. </em>206), although she did not sign. In her answer in this action she denied ever accepting the deed, averring in substance, that when she conveyed the property, she supposed that the plaintiff had conveyed to Leonard and Leonard to her. The plaintiff took the position, that Leonard acted as defendant\u2019s agent when he accepted the conveyance made by plaintiff. The evidence on this issue was favorable to plaintiff, and there was no conflicting or explanatory testimony. The defendant had conveyed the land by a deed, in which her grantee agreed to pay the mortgage in question, \u201cthe same being a part of the purchase money of this conveyance.\u201d In the foreclosure action of this mortgage, the complaint alleged that Fairchild (who is plaintiff here) sold and conveyed the premises to Lynch (the defendant here) by a deed in which \u201c the said Theresa Lynch assumed the said mortgage as part of the consideration on such purchase and agreed to pay the same.\u201d She, by her verified answer, admitted that the present plaintiff sold and conveyed to her. Further, her answer alleged, \u201cand this defendant received the said deed. And this defendant admits that this defendant received said land subject to said mortgage,\u201d but she therein denied that she had ever agreed to pay the mortgage, and denied that under the deed to her, she was bound to pay the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">There was enough evidence, therefore, that Leonard acted as her agent in fact in accepting the conveyance, and that she thereupon became bound to perform any agreement on her part contained in it. The appellant claims that the following clause is an agreement by her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>to pay the mortgage, viz: \u201cSubject nevertheless to a certain indenture of mortgage, given by the party hereto of the first part to secure the principal sum of $15,000 and interest, which said mortgage is recorded, &amp;c., and which said mortgage the party hereto of the <em>first part </em>assumes and agrees to pay, as part of the consideration hereinbefore expressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">A correct interpretation of this is that the mortgage is to be paid by the party of the second part, without a resort to the contract which the conveyance consummated or to any other extrinsic facts. There was plainly a mistake of the pen. There is no ambiguity in the words, but there is a mistake. The manifest intent was that whoever was to pay the consideration agreed to pay the mortgage. Theresa Lynch was to pay it, and she was by an error that happens often in speech, in writing, and in printing, designated as the party of the first part. There is no doubt as to who was meant to be designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">If it is necessary to give a rule, which justifies this conclusion, that rule is <em>verba intentionietnone contra debent inservire, ut res magis valeat quam pereat. </em>This requires that the whole of the instrument shall be examined, and any part which is inconsistent with or repugnant to the intent of the whole instrument, as is shown with certainty by the other parts, is to be rejected or modified according to the intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">In Jackson <em>v. </em>Topping, 1 <em>Wend. </em>890, there was a condition that if the grantee neglected to pay certain debts of the grantor, and suffered the grantor to be put to cost or trouble on account of the same, the grantor might re-enter, &amp;c. The case was that some of the debts had not been paid, but the grantor had not been put to any cost or trouble on account of such debts.' Although the law is never more subtle and exacting than in construing a condition, so that there may be no forfeiture, the court held that in view of the whole in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>strument the conjunction \u201cand\u201d should be made to mean \u201c or,\u201d and that a mere neglect to pay the debts without more, was a breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In Sanders <em>v. </em>Betts, 7 <em>Wend. </em>287, the covenant of warranty against all persons claiming \u2018 \u2018 from and under him the said party of the second part\u201d was construed so as to reject as repugnant to the rest of the covenant the words \u201cthe said party of the second part,\u201d although the legal effect would be the same, as if the words were written party of the first part (Gardner <em>v. </em>Gardner, 10 <em>Johns. </em>47).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In Buck <em>v. </em>Burk, 18 <em>N. Y. </em>339, the contract was to deliver goods at not above 25 per cent, of the cost price, and the court held, counsel not arguing to the contrary, that it meant, 25 per cent, over and above the cost price, inasmuch as no other rational interpretation could be given to the terms, and the nature of the transaction and the circumstances forbidding any other construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In Morse <em>v. </em>Salisbury, 48 <em>N. Y. </em>637, the action involved title to land, under a written contract made by B, which purported to convey all \u201c the land and timber excepting the hard wood \u00f3n 100 acres of land.\u201d The contract was in duplicate and the other part delivered to B was the same excepting the word \u201cbark\u201d was in place of \u201cland.\u201d The court looked at both parts of the contract and the whole of them, and from them adjudged that \u201cland\u201d was not meant to be conveyed, thereby rejecting the word \u201cland\u201d as repugnant to the intent as learned from the whole taken together, and making it mean \u201c bark!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">In Bache <em>v. </em>Proctor, 2 <em>Doug. </em>383, the condition of the bond was that if A should render a fair, just and perfect account of all sums received, \u201c the bond should be void.\u201d A rendered a just account but did not pay over the sums received. Lord Mansfield said that the fair construction of the condition was that A should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>pay. Justice Bulles likened the case to one in the common pleas where the condition of a bond was that it should be void, if the obligor did not pay, and the court held that the palpable mistake of a word should not defeat the true intention of the parties. Here he said it never could be meant that so large a penalty should be taken merely to enforce the making out a paper of items and figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In Mills <em>v. </em>Wright, 1 Freeman, 247, the bond was conditioned \u201cif he do not pay the money, the bond should be void.\u201d The court said that the condition was absurd and void, but the bond was good.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In 1 <em>Saunders, </em>66, note b, it is said that the principle has been extended to promissory notes and a note containing the words \u201c I promise not to pay \u201d was held to be a valid promissory note <em>(Bayley on Bills, </em>4 Ed. p. 6). Simpson <em>v. </em>Vaughan, 2 <em>Atk. </em>32, contains a reference to a case where the note was for \u2018\u2018 \u00a320 borrowed and received, which I promise never to pay.\u201d The latter clause was modified by the promise implied from the first clause. In Vernon <em>v. </em>Alsop, (1 <em>Leo. </em>77, <em>T. Ray, </em>68, 1 <em>Sid. </em>105, 1 <em>Kel. </em>356, 415, 451), there was a bond, with the condition to pay \u00a37 by two shillings a week, until the \u00a37 were paid, and if he failed of the payment of the 2 shillings at any of the days, whereon it ought to be paid, the obligation to be void else to remain in full force. The condition was rejected and there was a recovery upon the bond, after a plea that the defendant had failed to pay, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">In Furgerson <em>v. </em>Harwood, 7 <em>Cranch, </em>413, the declaration set out a contract that the said Walter delivered to the said Enos three hogsheads of tobacco, \u201che the said Enos to be allowed per cent, therefor, the highest six months credit price.\u201d The contract produced in evidence did not have the words \u201che the said Enos,\u201d and Judge Stoet considered whether the contract would have been materially changed if those words had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>in. He said that it was very clear that the word \u201cEnos\u201d was by a mere slip inserted instead of \u201cWalter.\u201d It is repugnant to the sense and meaning of the contract that the creditor who received the tobacco at a stipulated price in part payment of his debt, should allow to himself that price. From the nature of the transaction the debtor must be entitled to the allowance. If the same words had been introduced into the written contract itself, they must have been rejected as nonsensical or repugnant, or have had imposed upon them a sense exactly the same as if the words had been \u201cthe said Walter.\u201d Burr v. Broadway Ins. Co., 16 <em>N. Y. </em>268, sustains the principles of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">It has been hardly necessary to cite these cases, except to show that there was no need of resorting to equity, to reform the defendant\u2019s agreement for mistake, but that, where the mistake appears from the instrument itself, the law will enforce the obligation according to its true legal construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">There can be no doubt, that the rest of the deed\u2019 shows that the amount of the mortgage was part of' the consideration, and from that it follows, that the mortgage, as between the parties to the conveyance,' was - to be paid by the defendant, the grantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">I am therefore of opinion that the complaint should not have been dismissed, inasmuch as the plaintiff had made a <em>prima facie </em>cause of action, at law, even if. there was no case for a reformation of the agreement,. in equity, but that the court should have proceeded to judgment in favor of plaintiff, for the sum he had been compelled to pay on the mortgage, with, interest, the defendant not having demanded a trial by jury, or raised any objection on that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed,, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Sanford, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
