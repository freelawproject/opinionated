About two months ago, on a Saturday night, after ten o\u2019clock, Newfield came to' my house with Samuel Joseph, and asked me to allow them to come in ; Wagner and Schneider\u2019s furniture factory was on fire at the time; and they said they thought my home was burning, and they came to see; I let them in, and they and I stood by the window looking at the fire; while there, Newfield said to Joseph\u2014\u201c How would wadding burn ? Suppose my factory got on fire, how would it burn?\u201d Joseph said, \u201c Why do you ask me ? Do you want to set your factory on fire?\u201d Newfield said \u201cThere were so many fires now that it was very dangerous, and after a while he would see how things would be, \u201d Joseph said New-field had had several before. I asked Joseph why he asked that question of Mr. Newfield, and he replied, that he asked it because Newfield had several fires in his place before. Before that fire, I knew Mr. Newfield well; he told me he wanted to dispose of his factory, but could not; he said he offered it to his foreman, but the foreman would not take it. I have known Mr. Newfield for two and one half years in New York ; never did business with him ; he owes me nothing, and I have no ill feeling towards him ; that is all I know about the matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-7\">Hayman Copperman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-8\">Sworn to before me, this 7th day of June, 1871,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-9\">P.

When he called, the fire marshal showed him the deposition set out in complaint. Thereafter the fire marshal made investigation into the cause of the fire that destroyed plaintiff\u2019s property. The fire marshal said charges had been made against the plaintiff for the fire. After an examination of the plaintiff, no further legal proceedings were taken against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-7\">The fire marshal was called as a witness, and proved that the investigation was founded upon information, received by him from one Davies ; that thereupon he caused a subpoena to be served upon the defendant, who appeared under it, and upon request stated the matter set out in the deposition, which was reduced to writing by the fire marshal and signed by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The plaintiff testified that the matters stated in the depositions wer\u00e9 untrue. The defendant and Joseph, named in the deposition, swore that they were true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-5\">The judge on the trial held that there was no cause of action for malicious prosecution shown, but the plaintiff might recover as for libel, provided the jury should find the evidence sustained it. He therefore sent the case to the jury as one of libel, and the jury found for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">Upon a motion for new trial the judge considered that the defendant was not liable as for libel, inasmuch as it consisted of his testimony as a witness in a judicial proceeding as to matters pertinent to the inquiry, and granted a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-7\"><em>Lewis B. Sanders, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-8\"><em>James C. Spencer, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b313-9\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvH\">On the allegations of the complaint, and the testimony of the fire marshal, as to which there was no contradiction, it appeared he had competent jurisdiction to examine witnesses in the investigation pending before him ; that the defendant did not set on foot that investigation, but simply gave testimony in answer to questions of the fire marshal, after a subpoena had been served. The matters stated were relevant and material to the subject matter of the inquiry. I therefore think that the learned judge was right in holding that no action will lie upon the falsity of the evidence. The cases cited fully support the position (Perkins <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 31 <em>Barb. </em>461; Marsh v. Ellsworth, 50 N. <em>Y. </em>309 ; Gan <em>v. </em>Selden, 4 <em>Id. </em>91).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">If the matter of the alleged libel were irrelevant and immaterial to the charge of arson against the plaintiff, then clearly it was not a libel. There is no charge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>crime and no tendency to convince any one that a crime was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">I am further of opinion, that if the contents of the deposition are libelous, being statements of some matters of remote circumstantial evidence, and if the signing, at the request of a judicial officer, is such a writing that the oral slander becomes a libel, and if the communication to the public officer, is a publication technically (as to which questions no decision is meant to be intimated), still, so far as the case for the plaintiff went, the deposition was the complaint or the foundation of the charge, and the damage arising from it to the plaintiff was only its tendency to set upon foot and establish a groundless prosecution. There was no proof of a general publication, or a publication beyond its being made before a judicial officer, and its being shown to the plaintiff himself (Lyle <em>v. </em>Classon, 1 Caines, 580; Waistel v. Holman, 2 <em>Hall, </em>173 ; Snyder <em>v. </em>Andrews, 6 <em>Barb. </em>43). In such cases, I understand the law to be (Howard v. Thompson, 21 <em>Wend. </em>319), that plaintiff must show a want of probable cause for the prosecution itself. If there were probable ground for the prosecution, this defendant suffered no damage by the false statement of circumstantial evidence. There would be <em>injuria absque damnum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">For this reason I think, that after it appeared, as it did on the trial, that there was no proof of want of probable cause for the institution of the investigation, the complaint should have been altogether dismissed, and not held as in an action for the libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">There was no question upon the trial as to whether the libel having been under an oath competently administered its falsity could have been established by a less <em>quantv/tn </em>of evidence than would have been necessary to prove the defendant guilty-of perjury under an indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The order granting a new trial should be affirmed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>and the judgment on the verdict be reversed with costs to the defendant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Curtis, Ch. J., and Speir, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
