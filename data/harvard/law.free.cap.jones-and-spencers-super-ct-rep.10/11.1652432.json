J.</author>\n<p id=\"As-\">The plaintiff sues to recover for work claimed to have been performed at the request of the defendant, and for plants and flowers furnished to the defendant, between January 3, 1870, and April <em>SO, </em>1872.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-14\">The main question presented by the case is, whether the work was performed for the defendant, and the flowers and plants furnished to him or his wife at his request. The defendant and his wife lived with Mr. Cambreleng, during this period, in the house owned by the latter, and to which a conservatory and a garden were attached. Mr. Cambreleng, who was the father of the defendant\u2019s wife, died June 34, 1872.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-15\">\u2019 The plaintiff testifies that sometimes the defendant and his wife, and sometimes one or the other, ordered the flowers and plants in question, and that he charged them on his books to the defendant\u2019s wife, and sent the bill to him, and that he called on the defendant with the bill on several occasions, but that he never promised to pay it personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-16\">The plaintiff called a witness who testified that he called on the defendant many times in relation to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>bill, when he would sometimes say: \u201cI can\u2019t do anything to-day,\u201d or would answer affirmatively when asked by witness if he should call again. But as the defendant was at this time the executor of Mr. Cambreleng\u2019s estate, it may have been that he was answering in that capacity, especially as the plaintiff was seeking' to collect this same claim from that estate, and to its liability for which no question was raised. It appears that this estate was insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The defendant testified, that he did not order these plants or flowers, and that the only transaction he ever had with the plaintiff\u2019s firm, was the purchase of a boquet, fifteen years previously, which he paid for; that he never authorized the trusting of his wife, or knew of it; that no bill was made ont to her until after her father\u2019s death ; and that she attended to her father\u2019s commissions, he being advanced in years, such as making purchases for the house; and that he had heard him direct her to go and order plants, but that he never knew her to do so except for her father. The defendant also testified that no bill was ever made out against him, and that when he first received the bill made out against his wife, he notified the plaintiff that it was improperly made out against her, and that it should be made out against Mr. Cambreleng.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">In examining the testimony of the plaintiff (for it will be observed that the case rests chiefly upon the testimony of the two parties), there are some circumstances that do not tend to sustain the statements of the plaintiff at the trial. For instance, the defendant, on June 23, 1873, wrote plaintiff\u2019s firm the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-7\">\u201cHew York, June 23, 1873.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE\">\u201cMessrs. Bridgemak <em>&amp; </em>Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-8\">\u201cDear Sirs: I am not aware that any of the articles in your bill were ordered for me or on my credit. Your bills have always been made out, rendered to, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>and paid by Mr. Stephen Cambreleng, and were for work done in, and plants furnished to his garden and conservatory, No. 35 Great Jones street, which plants were appraised as part of his estate. There was a bill for these very articles rendered in Mr. Cambreleng\u2019s lifetime, made out to him, as every bill ever rendered by you was made out to him, and the only account ever kept by you was with him. I shall resist firmly any attempt to make me liable for any goods or labor furnished or alleged to have been furnished by you to Mr. Cambreleng, or for his house and garden. Tour claim, if any, is against Mr. Cambreleng\u2019s estate, and has been already made against his estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-5\">\u201cYours truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-6\">\u201cJ. Pyne.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">In answer to that note, the case admits that the plaintiff sent the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-8\">\u201cNew York, June 26, 1873.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-9\">\u201cJohn Pyne, Esq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-10\">\u2018 \u2018 Dear Sir: You have mistaken the tenor of our note, in supposing that we expected to make you liable for the bill. Not at all. The bill <em>is, as you </em>say, against the estate of Mr. Stephen Cambreleng, and the <em>reason </em>why we wrote and sent to you, was for the reason that-knowing you to be one of the executors, you might be able to satisfy us in regard to the payment; as being <em>very short </em>at present, and having waited so long, we thought, that probably the estate was in such a condition now, as to admit of the payment of the bill. We hope you will consider us right in this matter, and as soon as the estate will be in a condition for payment, notify us, and you will greatly oblige</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-11\">\u2018\u2018 Yours respectfully,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-12\">\u201cBridgeman &amp; Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b22-13\">This last communication appears to be an explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>disavowal of any claim against the defendant personally for the bill, and was written at a time when the facts were fresher than at the trial, in the memory of the plaintiff. This seems to bring the case within the principle, that where a party\u2019s oath is flatly contradicted by his own letters written long previous to the commencement of the action, it is entitled to no consideration (Boyd <em>v. </em>Colt, 20 <em>How. Pr. </em>384).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The next circumstance affecting the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, arises from the affidavits made by him in the usual form, September 1, 1873 (two months and more after writing the last letter), to substantiate his claims upon the estate of Mr. Cambreleng. By these, he confirms under oath his statement in the letter, that this bill in controversy was a claim against the estate of Mr. Cambreleng. The plaintiff stated at the trial, that he knew the claim was against Mr. Pyne, and believed that he had no claim., against Mr. Cambreleng, none whatever, but that he made the affidavits at the defendant\u2019 s request, and that he took the latter to be an honorable man, and that on his- statement that he would get some money, he felt justified in making the affidavits. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">It is probably not the first time that a claim has been sworn to and presented against the estate of a deceased person from that motive, but I am not aware that any court has held it a justification for a knowingly false affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">There are some other features in the case, that strengthen the defendant\u2019s testimony, that the bill was Mr. Cambreleng\u2019s, besides the letter and affidavits of plaintiff. It is conceded that, in July, 1871, Mr. Cambreleng\u2019s note at ninety days for $330.90, being for a part of this bill, was taken by the plaintiff, and subsequently protested.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s firm had attended to Mr. Cambreleng\u2019s garden, and supplied plants for his house and conser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>vatory for a long term of years, before the bills in question were incurred, and these latter were originally made out in his name. No charge appeared on the plaintiff\u2019s books against the defendant personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The case presented is one where the court must pass upon the weight of conflicting evidence (Finch <em>v. </em>Parker, 49 N. <em>Y. </em>1). The result of the examination is a conviction that the verdict of the jury cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Under such circumstances the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">Speir, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
