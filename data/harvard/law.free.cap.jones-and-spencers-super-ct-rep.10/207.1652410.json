Thereafter defendant\u2019s attorney, about September 28, 1876, served on plaintiff\u2019s attorney a notice that on the above order, and the minutes of the trial of the cause, and an affidavit by defendant\u2019s attorney setting forth \u201cthat when the jury went out to consult he left the court-room for a few moments, and upon his return he found to his surprise that the jury had, during his short absence, rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and had been discharged, and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had left the court-room, and consequently he had no opportunity to move for a new trial on the minutes,\u201d\u2014a motion would be made at the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>term of this court, before his Honor Wi. E. Cubtis (the judge before whom the cause was tried), on October 3,1876, that a new trial be ordered on said minutes, or for such other or further order in the premises as might be just.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-5\">When the motion, initiated by this notice, came on to be heard, plaintiff\u2019s attorney read in opposition an affidavit, setting forth \u201cthat defendant appealed from the judgment to the general term on May 10,1876, and served his proposed case July 13, 1876, amendments to which were served July 24, 1876, which amendments were accepted by defendant\u2019s failure to notice the same for settlement, as required by the rules of court; that defendant\u2019s attorney noticed a motion for a new trial herein in May, 1876, but Judge Speib, who was holding special term, declined to hear the same, but gave defendant leave to make his motion before Judge Cubtis, who tried the cause ; that defendant neglected , to make such motion before Judge Cubtis at May term.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-6\">The motion for' a new trial on the minutes was denied, and an order to that effect entered \u25a0 October 13, 1876, and an appeal was taken from such order to the general term on October 15, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-7\">The cause came before the general term upon this appeal from the order denying the motion for a new trial on the minutes, and on the appeal from the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-8\">For the purpose of the appeal from the judgment, a case was made and settled containing the following single exception:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-9\">James E. Boyd was recalled on behalf of plaintiffs, and asked, \u201c When you brought this money\u2014the $300, back to Beman, did you report any thing to him ?\u201d He answered \u201c I did.\u201d He was then asked, \u201cWhat took place?\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel objected, the objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>was overruled, and an exception taken (fol. 88 of fclie case). The witness answered, \u201cMuck, as I was told that Mr. Wilson had no more than \u00a7300, and that when the note was paid the balance would be handed over to Mr. Beman.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-5\">The preceding evidence had shown that Runyon W. Martin, acting as agent for the alleged firm of Martin &amp; Co., had given the note in suit to one Beman to get discounted for the firm of Martin &amp; Co. Beman entrusted the note to James R. Boyd, who took it to Mr. Wilson and obtained from him \u00a7300 thereon, and Boyd had previously testified that Wilson at the same time promised to hand over the balance when the note was paid.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-6\"><em>Wm. P. </em>Lee, attorney, and of counsel for appellant, on the points decided by the court, urged:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASe\">I. It has been intimated by the counsel for the plaintiff that he shall claim that the order denying the motion for a new trial on the minutes should be affirmed, for the reason that the motion was not made within the time required by the rules. 1. The cause was tried at the May term, 1876, and the motion was made in May.. The fact that it was not finally heard until October cannot prejudice the appellant. 2. At any rate, the objection as to the time of moving for a new trial should have been taken when the motion was heard, and as a preliminary objection. This was not done, and plaintiff cannot avail himself of it here..</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-7\">II. The question which was allowed by his, honor-the Chief Judge, was not properly allowed. The question was immaterial, as what took place between Beman and Boyd could not affect the rights of the defendant King, if he were not a partner in the firm of the makers of the note, as is claimed that he was not, nor yet could it affect the rights of the makers of the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>note, whoever they might be. The question, therefore, should not have been admitted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-5\"><em>Daniel G. </em>Wild, attorney, and of counsel for respondent, on the points decided by the court, urged:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWv\">I. The motion for a new trial on the judge\u2019s minutes was properly denied. 1. The cause was tried in May, 1876, and a motion on the judge\u2019s minutes could only be made at the same term <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 264). 2. The motion was not made until October, 1876. The objection that the motion was not made within the time prescribed by law, was expressly raised by the affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s attorney on the motion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-6\">II. The exception is untenable. Beman, the witness, was acting for B. W. Martin, the agent of the defendants, Martin &amp; Co. Boyd had been employed by Beman to get the note discounted, and the testimony objected to is the report made by Boyd to Beman of the fact that he could get $300 on the note, and that when the note was paid, the balance could be paid over to Beman. The testimony was admissible as the acts and statements of the defendants\u2019 agent; and it was also part of the transaction itself; the defendant having claimed that the discount was usurious, it was competent to show that it was arranged through their agent, Beman, that defendants were to receive the balance of the note over $300.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b215-14\"> Note by Reporters.\u2014The question as to whether leave to move at a subsequent term or terms may not be granted under sections 174 and 405, does not appear to have arisen. It was not adverted to by counsel or by the court, either because it was assumed that the principle of the decisions, holding that the time to appeal could not be extended under section 174, applied to a motion for a new trial, or because the application at special term was not for leave to move at a subsequent term, and the order gave no such leave. The latter, from the views <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>presented by the counsel in their points, and the fact that the order simply gave leave in general terms, the term at which the cause was tried not having closed, would seem to be the real cause why the question was not raised. It seems to the reporters, however, that neither the court nor any judge thereof can give leave for the making of such a motion at any term other than that at which the cause was tried.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b220-7\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMI\">Section 264 of the Code provides that a motion for a new trial, if heard ' upon the minutes, can only be heard at the same term or circuit at which the trial is had. The motion, therefore, was made too late. It should have been made on h case.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">But even if it had been regularly made, either in - time on the minutes, or subsequently on a case, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>might well, and indeed within the principles laid down in Rowe <em>v. </em>Stevens (N. <em>Y. Superior Ct. </em>436), it should have been denied. It stated no ground upon which it was made, and, as matter of fact, no motion had been made for a nonsuit or the direction of a verdict, nor had any exception been taken to the charge of the court, under which all the issues appear to have been fully and fairly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Under these circumstances I do not feel called upon to examine the entire testimony with the view of testing the correctness of the finding of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The question was properly allowed. As the defendant claimed that the note had been usuriously discounted, it was competent and material for plaintiff to show, by way of rebuttal, what the real arrangement was; and as the whole arrangement had been \"made by an agent of defendant\u2019s firm, plaintiff had a right to show under what circumstances the money was handed over to, and accepted by such agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The judgment and order appealed from should be severally affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Sanford, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
