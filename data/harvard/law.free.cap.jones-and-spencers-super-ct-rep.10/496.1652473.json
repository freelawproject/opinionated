The justice cites <em>Chitty Pr. </em>vol. 1, p. 667, as sole authority for the proposition that though a common law court cannot set off unliquidated claims against a judgment, it can stay execution upon a judgment with a view to enable a defendant to obtain a judgment in a cross action. The proposition in Chitty is not supported by the authority of the single case cited in support of it, Masterton <em>v. </em>Malin (7 <em>Bing. </em>435). Mr. Chitty\u2019s interpretation of the decision of the case is as follows: \u201cThe court will sometimes even stay execution in an action till judgment has been obtained by the defendant therein, viz., a cross action, so as to enable the latter afterwards to obtain such set-off.\u201d Fisher and Harrison <em>(Dig. </em>7,774) state the same case in the following language : \u201cA plaintiff having been non-suited and costs taxed for defendant, the court refused to allow the plaintiff to set them off against costs to be - taxed for him in an ejectment in which he had obtained a Verdict, but which defendant had obtained a rule <em>nisi </em>to set aside and. enter a nonsuit.\u201d With two directly counter interpretations of the same case, and with Judge Sedgwick\u2019s citation of it as sole authority for his decision in the present case, it is well <em>petere fontes </em>\u2014and see the case itself, which will be found to be a mere practice motion, and not stated with absolute correctness by any of the learned gentlemen. Whatever else it is, it is not the slightest authority for the position taken by its latest interpreter. Its remoteness and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>obscurity is sufficient evidence that cases which support the view taken in the order appealed from are difficult to find.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-5\">II. But if there were authority for such a ruling, Mr. Knox is in no position to claim this relief. He withdrew the counter-claim (the subject-matter of Knox <em>v. </em>Hexter) at the last moment of the trial in Hexter <em>v. </em>Knox. The opportunity of adjudicating all matters in controversy by one verdict he voluntarily repudiated nearly three years ago. This course on his part precludes him from asking relief from the'consequences of his desire to continue rather than end litigation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-6\">III. The court, however, has undertaken to make, by an order, what is in effect a judgment in an injunction suit upon a misconstruction of a private agreement between the parties, viz., the stipulation. Such action by a common law court is without jurisdiction. . Further than this, the interpretation of the instrument is erroneous. The stipulation provides that no proceedings shall be taken by Hexter to enforce payment of the balance left in Knox\u2019s hands until the expiration of thirty days from the determination of the appeal to the general term; and that, if Hexter shall appeal therefrom to the court of appeals, proceedings shall be further stayed until the decision of the court of appeals. And it also expressly provides that the balance of the judgment against Knox is to be in lieu of all security which might be required from Hexter to obtain a stay of proceedings in two cases : 1st. On the appeal then pending in the general term. 2nd. On any appeal by Hexter thereon to the court of appeals. Also, that in case the judgment against Hexter is reversed he shall be at liberty to collect and recover said balance from Knox and his sureties. The judgment being reversed, Hexter is entitled to collect the balance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-7\">IV. The whole tenor of the stipulation shows the balance left in Knox\u2019s hands was a mere substitute for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the statutory undertakings which would have been required by Hexter on his appeal to the general term, and in case of a decision adverse to him in that appeal, in lieu of a similar undertaking on appeal by him to the court of appeals. There is not a single expression or word in the stipulation giving Knox any right to retain the money in case of an appeal by him ; such an appeal is not even referred to in the stipulation, and it is not competent to the court to delay Hexter\u2019s proceedings by a forced construction not warranted by the agreement of the parties. There is now no judgment against Hexter, and he is entitled to collect the balance due to him from Knox.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-5\"><em>Wm. McDermott, </em>attorney, and <em>John M. Scribner, Jr., </em>of counsel for respondent, among other things, urged:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APs\">I. Nothing contained in the stipulation precluded Knox from making the application which he made at special term. There was a distinct provision for <em>two </em>appeals by Hexter ; and although, by its precise terms, it does not appear to guard against the contingency of a <em>reversal </em>of Knox\u2019s judgment at the general term, yet, <em>as a whole, </em>the stipulation was manifestly intended to create an <em>armistice </em>until the court of appeals should decide whether Knox was entitled to his quarter\u2019s rent, after the <em>verdict </em>obtained by Hexter in the other case, which, at the general term of this court, and in the court of appeals, was upheld as an <em>indemnity </em>to which Hexter was entitled, for want of possession of the demised parts of the new buildings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-6\">II. Even if it should come to the conclusion that the stipulation, in its strict language, is not broad enough to cover the appeal by Knox, the court, for the promotion of justice, should not hesitate to reform it, or give it such an equitable construction as will prevent injustice, especially in a case where no harm can result to the appellant. Knox has exhibited confidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>the merits of his suit <em>by giving stipulation for judgment absolute, if he is defeated on </em>appeal, and he ought not to be denied the benefit of such appeal, which would be the effect of a reversal of Judge Sedgwick\u2019s order, in view of the alleged (and substantially undisputed) want of responsibility on the part of Mr. Hexter. It was sufficient at special term, and is sufficient now, to maintain the order, that the undisputed facts disclosed that Hexter was protected and <em>secured; </em>that Knox, on the contrary, was in <em>peril. </em>Justice and equity, therefore, required the interposition of the court, to the end that neither party should be allowed an unjust advantage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-5\">III. The court has power to grant the stay (Ferry <em>v. </em>Roberts, 15 <em>How. Pr. </em>65; Durkin <em>v. </em>Vanderburgh, 1 Paige, 622; People <em>v. </em>N. Y. Com. Pleas, 13 <em>Wend. </em>649 ; Baker <em>v. </em>Hoag, and Macy <em>v. </em>Stott; 6 <em>How. Pr. </em>201; Smith <em>v. </em>Towden, 1 <em>Sandf. </em>696; Cole <em>v. </em>Grant, 2 <em>Caines, </em>105; Dewy <em>v. </em>Bower, 3 <em>Johns. </em>247). Assignment does not cut off the right (Chamberlain <em>v. </em>Day, 3 <em>Cow. </em>353 ; Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Power, 3 <em>Paige, </em>365; Graves <em>v. </em>Newsbury, 4 <em>Hill, </em>559). Equities between the parties are paramount to attorney\u2019s lien for costs (Roberts <em>v. </em>Carter, <em>24 How. </em>44 ; Mohawk Bank v. Burrows, 6 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>317 ; De Figaniere <em>v. </em>Forrey, 2 <em>Robert. </em>670; Nicoll v. Nicoll, 16 <em>Wend. </em>446; Brooks v. Hanford, 15 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>342).</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b504-15\"> For principal cases, see 39 <em>N. Y.

Knox shortly after procured his judgment against Hexter for rent of the premises, part of which he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>not put into the possession of Hexter. This latter judgment has been reversed by the general term, on the ground that Hexter is liable only for the use of that part of the premises actually occupied by him, but is liable for the part so occupied. Knox has appealed to the court of appeals, and given a stipulation for judgment absolute if he be defeated on appeal, claiming to be entitled under the lease to a quarter\u2019s rent. Should Hexter be allowed to collect from Knox the balance of his judgment under the decision of the trial term, he would still owe Knox for use of the premises actually occupied by him, even though Knox should not be entitled to recover the full quarter\u2019s rent. Knox ought not to be denied the benefit of such appeal which would result from the order made at special term, and especially so in view of the alleged want of responsibility on the part of Mr. Hexter. It is therefore sufficient to sustain the order by the facts disclosed that Hexter was protected and secured, while Knox, on the contrary, was in peril and exposed to loss, and that the effect of the order under the stipulation will finally adjust -the rights of the parties between themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">It is claimed by counsel that the court had not the power to make the order. The rule as laid down in Chitty\u2019s General Practice, vol. 1, page 666, is that the superior courts favor the equitable mode of adjusting-accounts between the same parties at common law, if there be cross-actions, or suits, and allow one judgment to be set off against the other, and sometimes <em>even stay executions ' in </em>an action till judgment has been obtained by the defendant by a cross-action so as to enable the latter afterwards to obtain an off-set (Masterman <em>v. </em>Malin, 7 <em>Bing. </em>435). It is claimed that this authority cited by the elementary writer does not sustain the rule. It is true the case shows the rule obtained to support the motion for the set-off was discharged by the court; but not until the court had de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>termined to make the rule absolute by granting it, and so communicated its decision to counsel, whereupon the counsel furnished an affidavit proving that the judgment in the suit sought to be stayed had actually been levied under a <em>ca. sa. </em>The reporter was consequently authorized to announce the rule as stated by Mr. Philips. On these pri\u00faciples relief has been granted in all the courts (Terry <em>v. </em>Roberts, 15 <em>How. Pr. </em>65). It is the equitable control which they are authorized to exercise over the parties and proceedings in causes before such courts to promote equity and prevent injustice. The late chancellor of this State has said this power of a court of chancery to set off on motion, is the same as that of a court of common law, but that the jurisdiction of the court of chancery is more extensive than that of the common law court (Duncan <em>v. </em>Vandenburg, 1 Paige, 622). If no possible injury results to the parties by a stay of proceedings, it seems difficult to perceive why a stay of execution on a judgment for a brief period should not be granted, until a judgment has been obtained by the defendant, in a cross-action to enable him to make an off-set.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The subject matters of the two actions are such as justly call for a settlement, without further trial of issues of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">If, therefore, the order of the court below staying the proceedings on execution until the decision of the question of law involved will finally adjust the rights of the parties without gaining advantage or suffering harm from the fact that one judgment is prior in point of time to the other, the order should not be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The order appealed from must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
