We vacate the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-18\">The district court referred this \u00a7 1983 action to the magistrate judge pursuant to \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). Thereafter a notice of a <em>\u201cFlowers\u201d </em>hearing issued to the parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The magistrate judge held the <em>Flowers </em>hearing after announcing that the court would conduct \u201can evidentiary hearing.\u201d The magistrate judge heard witnesses for both sides and at the conclusion found that McAfee had not carried his burden of proof and recommended dismissal of his action. The district court accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-23\">McAfee complains first that the magistrate judge improperly held a <em>Flowers </em>hearing after he had demanded a jury trial. The record reveals that McAfee made a jury demand within ten days after Boyd and Mittasch filed their answers. We are satisfied therefore that McAfee made a timely jury demand under Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-24\">Although appellees do not argue that McAfee\u2019s participation in the magistrate judge\u2019s hearing without objection was an implicit waiver of his earlier jury demand, we have considered whether this legal result should follow. <em>See Casperone v. Landmark Oil &amp; Gas Corp., </em>819 F.2d 112, 116 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-25\">Because the right to a jury trial is a fundamental right, however, courts should \u201cindulge every reasonable presumption against waiver.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Bennett, </em>629 F.2d 1092, 1095 (5th Cir.1980) (quoting <em>Aetna Ins. Co. v. Kennedy, </em>301 U.S. 389, 393, 57 S.Ct. 809, 812, 81 L.Ed. 1177 (1937)). A waiver should not be found in a \u201cdoubtful situation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-26\">The question, then, narrows to whether McAfee faced a doubtful situation. A magistrate judge\u2019s expanded evidentiary hearing like the one at issue amounts to a bench trial replete with credibility determinations and findings of fact. At the commencement of McAfee\u2019s hearing, the magistrate judge called it \u201can evidentiary hearing.\u201d She did not use the term \u201ctrial\u201d until well into the proceeding and then without explaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>difference between a trial and an evidentiary-hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">When the magistrate judge set the hearing, she called it \u201can expanded evidentiary hearing pursuant to Flowers_\u201d The order did not explain what a <em>Flowers </em>hearing was. That order was issued before this court, in <em>Brown </em>and Clark<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, had sorted out what a <em>Flowers </em>hearing is. Additionally, counsel for the appellees, an assistant state attorney general, asserts that the hearing was not a trial. Thus, if the defendants\u2019 lawyer reading the transcript does not know that the hearing was a trial, McAfee\u2019s contention that he did not understand that the magistrate was conducting a trial rings true. The situation was doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Accordingly, the magistrate judge erred in holding the \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) hearing in the face of a timely jury demand. The judgment entered on the basis of the magistrate judge\u2019s finding at that hearing is vacated and the ease is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-19\">. <em>Flowers v.
