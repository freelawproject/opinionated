His amended complaint named numerous defendants, including two federal district judges, an assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Customs and DEA officials, U.S. Marshals, three federal court reporters, a judicial law clerk, a secretary, and several of Abella\u2019s co-defendants and their respective attorneys. Abella claimed that the defendants knowingly and willfully conspired to convict him falsely by fabricating testimony and other evidence against him, in violation of his Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendment rights. Abella sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and compensatory and punitive damages. The district court dismissed the complaint, noting that Abella\u2019s claims collaterally attacked the validity of his underlying criminal convictions and therefore should be dismissed because Abella had not first exhausted federal habeas remedies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Dees v. Murphy, </em>794 F.2d 1543, 1545 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-21\">On appeal, Abella asserts that the dismissal was unduly harsh because the statute of limitations may run on his <em>Bivens </em>claims before he is able to exhaust his federal habe-as remedies. Abella argues that the proper disposition would have been to stay the proceedings, and toll the statute of limitations on his <em>Bivens </em>claims, pending resolution of his criminal appeal and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 claims. At the time the district court dismissed Abel-la\u2019s claims, Abella may well have been correct that a stay was the appropriate disposition of some of his claims under the current Eleventh Circuit law. <em>Cf. Prather v. Norman, </em>901 F.2d 915, 919 (11th Cir.1990) (Where monetary damages sought in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 challenge to validity of claimant\u2019s state conviction or sentence, court should stay action pending exhaustion of state remedies if it appears dismissal will result in expiration of the statute of limitations.). However, since the district court dismissed this action, the law has changed, <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and we are obliged to apply the new law retroactively to Abella\u2019s claims. <em>Harper v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Taxation, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 2517, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-26\">I. ABELLA\u2019S <em>BIVENS </em>DAMAGES CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-27\">In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>[ 1 ]n order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\">\u2014 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. Thus, a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 damages action which would demonstrate the invalidity of a conviction or sentence does not accrue until the conviction or sentence has been invalidated. <em>Id. </em>at -, 114 S.Ct. at 2374. Such an action, if brought prior to invalidation of the conviction or sentence challenged, must therefore be dismissed as premature. <em>Id. </em>at -, 114 S.Ct. at 2372.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">Although <em>Heck </em>was a \u00a7 1983 ease, suits under \u00a7 1983 and <em>Bivens </em>are very similar. A \u00a7 1983 suit challenges the constitutionality of the actions of state officials; a <em>Bivens </em>suit challenges the constitutionality of the actions of federal officials. \u201cThe effect of <em>Bivens </em>was, in essence, to create a remedy against federal officers, acting under color of federal law, that was analogous to the section 1983 action against state officials.\u201d <em>Dean v. Gladney, </em>621 F.2d 1331, 1336 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 983, 101 S.Ct. 1521, 67 L.Ed.2d 819 (1981). Thus, courts generally apply \u00a7 1983 law to <em>Bivens </em>eases. <em>E.g., Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 500, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2907, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978) (A federal official sued under <em>Bivens </em>has the same immunity as a similar state official sued for identical violation under \u00a7 1983.); <em>Dean, </em>621 F.2d at 1336 (As in \u00a7 1983 cases, liability in <em>Bivens </em>actions cannot be based upon theory of respondeat superior.). In fact, the specific <em>pre-Heck </em>rule requiring exhaustion of habeas remedies in <em>Bivens </em>cases, applied by the district court to dismiss the instant case, was borrowed from \u00a7 1983 caselaw. <em>See Dees, </em>794 F.2d at 1544 (borrowing exhaustion requirement from <em>Richardson v. Fleming, </em>651 F.2d 366 (5th Cir.1981), a \u00a7 1983 case).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">There are, of course, federalism and comity concerns present when a federal court entertains a \u00a7 1983 challenge to the actions of state officials that do not exist in a similar <em>Bivens </em>challenge. However, the <em>Heck </em>rule is not based upon the unique comity concerns that a \u00a7 1983 claim presents. Rather, the Court\u2019s purpose was to limit the opportunities for collateral attack on state court convictions because such collateral attacks undermine the finality of criminal proceedings and may create conflicting resolutions of issues. \u2014 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2371. The same rationale applies with equal force to <em>Bivens </em>challenges; collateral attacks on federal criminal convictions pose the same threat to the finality of federal criminal trials and have the same potential for creating inconsistent results as collateral attacks on state court proceedings. Thus, we hold that the <em>Heck </em>rule applies to <em>Bivens </em>damages claims. <em>Accord Stephenson v. Reno, </em>28 F.3d 26, 27 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-14\">Abella\u2019s damages claims rest on the contention that the defendants unconstitutionally conspired to convict him of crimes he did not commit. Judgment in favor of Abella on these claims \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction.\u201d <em>Heck</em>, \u2014 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. Because Abella\u2019s convictions have not been invalidated, his <em>Bivens </em>damages claims are not ripe. Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing Abella\u2019s claims. We affirm the dismissal of Abella\u2019s claims with prejudice; Abella may bring his <em>Bivens </em>damages claims in the future should he meet the requirements of <em>Heck.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>II. ABELLA\u2019S OTHER <em>BIVENS </em>CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">With respect to Abella\u2019s other claims, <em>Heck </em>reaffirmed that, under <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973), \u201chabeas corpus is the exclusive remedy for a state prisoner who challenges the fact or duration of his confinement and seeks immediate or speedier release.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2364. Thus, declaratory or injunctive relief claims which are in the nature of habeas corpus claims \u2014 i.e., claims which challenge the validity of the claimant\u2019s conviction or sentence and seek release \u2014 are simply not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>This rule applies equally to <em>Bivens </em>actions. <em>See Dees v. Murphy, </em>794 F.2d at 1545 (citing <em>Preiser </em>as support for dismissal of <em>Bivens </em>claim challenging validity of plaintiffs conviction). Resting on the same premise as his damages claims, that Abella was the victim of an unconstitutional conspiracy to falsely convict him, Abella\u2019s declaratory and injunctive relief claims challenge the validity of his conviction. Because these claims are not cognizable <em>Bivens </em>claims, the district court did not err in dismissing Abella\u2019s declaratory and injunctive relief claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">III. STAY OR DISMISS</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">As Abella argues, we have said that stay rather than dismissal is the appropriate disposition of some \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>Prather, </em>901 F.2d at 918-19. Although the petitioner in <em>Prather </em>presented claims for both monetary damages and for injunctive and declaratory relief, we suggested that stay was appropriate because of our concern that the statute of limitations would run on Prather\u2019s damages claims pending exhaustion of Prather\u2019s state remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 918-20. This is no longer a concern because, as <em>Heck </em>teaches, such damages claims do not accrue until the plaintiffs conviction or sentence has been invalidated; the statute of limitations will not run on \u00a7 1983 or <em>Bivens </em>damages claims while the plaintiff exhausts state or federal remedies. Thus, Abella\u2019s argument that the district court should have stayed his damages claims to prevent the tolling of the statute of limitations on those claims is no longer viable under <em>Heck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">IV.CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order dismissing Abella\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1100-18\">. <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">. On the other hand, \"if the district court determines that the plaintiff's action, even if successful, will <em>not </em>demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff, the action should be allowed to proceed, in the absence of some other bar to the suit.\" <em>Id. </em>at -, 114 S.Ct. at 2372-73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1101-17\">. Because we dismiss Abella's claims on ripeness grounds, Abella may choose to bring his <em>Bivens </em>claims again if he eventually satisfies the precondition to a valid claim under <em>Heck; </em>i.e., when and if his narcotics convictions are invalidated. Thus, defendants, including those who may also be protected by absolute immunity, may potentially be sued again on the same claims. Wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>er some of these defendants are entitled to absolute immunity might be a threshold issue which we should decide before dismissal on ripeness grounds under <em>Heck. See Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994) (Absolute immunity issues must be decided when dismissing on ripeness grounds under <em>Heck </em>to protect absolutely immune defendant from future suit on particular facts alleged.). However, on appeal, defendants rely solely on <em>Heck </em>and do not make an absolute immunity argument. Therefore, we do not decide this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">. Some of our cases appear to treat <em>Preiser </em>as a rule of exhaustion rather than cognizability. <em>See, e.g., Richardson v. Fleming, </em>651 F.2d 366, 373 (5th Cir.1981) (Following <em>Preiser, </em>our cases \"have consistently held that any \u00a7 1983 action which draws into question the validity of the fact or length of confinement must be preceded by exhausting state remedies.\"); <em>but see Fulford v. Klein, </em>529 F.2d 377, 381-82 (5th Cir.1976) (specifically reserving question of whether plaintiff would have \u00a7 1983 cause of action after exhaustion), <em>adhered to en banc, </em>550 F.2d 342 (1977). These cases imply that exhaustion is the only barrier to a \u00a7 1983 (or Bivens) claim which challenges the fact or duration of the claimant\u2019s confinement, and that such a claim would be cognizable after the claimant had exhausted ha-beas remedies. <em>See, e.g., Richardson, </em>651 F.2d at 375 (\"Once Richardson has exhausted his state and federal habeas corpus remedies, he may then proceed under \u00a7 1983....\u2019\u2019). <em>Heck </em>clarifies that <em>Preiser </em>is a rule of cognizabilily, not exhaustion. -U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2369 <em>(\"Preiser </em>did <em>not </em>create an exception to the 'no exhaustion\u2019 rule of \u00a7 1983; it merely held that certain claims by state prisoners are not <em>cognizable </em>under that provision, and must be brought in habe-as corpus proceedings.\u201d). Therefore, injunctive and declaratory relief claims which challenge the fact or duration of confinement are simply never cognizable in \u00a7 1983 or <em>Bivens </em>actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
