Green, General Counsel for the Board. Hulsey sued Owens and Green \u201cin their individual/personal capacities for acts taken in their official capacities as board members,\u201d seeking damages. The district court adopted a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that Hulsey\u2019s complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Hulsey appeals; we AFFIRM the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">Hulsey contends that (1) his reinearceration was based on an assault charge that was later dropped, (2) he was not provided with a copy of the hearing officer\u2019s findings, (3) the Board ignored his motion to reopen his revocation proceedings, and (4) Owens and Green \u201callowed state employees to revoke parole and stamp or forge the Board members\u2019 signature ... to make it appear that members of the Board had actually voted a decision on a revocation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">A magistrate judge found that (1) Owens and Green are absolutely immune from liability, and (2) inasmuch as Hulsey is not constitutionally entitled to parole, his due process and equal protection complaints about the pardons and parole system in Texas do not state a claim for which relief may be granted, and (3) Hulsey is required to exhaust his state habeas corpus remedies before he can pursue a \u00a7 1983 claim or any federal habeas relief challenging his reincarceration. The magistrate judge recommended that Hulsey\u2019s complaint be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-17\">Following a <em>de novo </em>review of the file, the district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge reiterating that Hulsey\u2019s proper cause of action, provided he first exhausts his state habeas remedies, is a writ <em>of </em>habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and not a civil-rights action under \u00a7 1983. The district court dismissed Hulsey\u2019s complaint without prejudice. Hulsey appeals, contending that the members of the Board are not immune.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hulsey contends that the statute of limitations on his \u00a7 1983 action will expire if he is forced to pursue a habeas remedy first, ignoring the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), in which the Court held that the statute of limitations for bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim for damages based on an inmate\u2019s conviction or imprisonment does not begin to run until the conviction or sentence has been invalidated in another proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">We address first the question of whether the Board members are entitled to absolute immunity from Hulsey\u2019s claims. Absolute immunity is immunity from suit rather than simply a defense against liability, and is a threshold question \u201cto be resolved as early in the proceedings as possible.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994). Thus, \u201cit is appropriate for the district courts to resolve the question of absolute immunity before reaching the <em>Heck </em>analysis when feasible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Siegert v. Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 231-33, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 1793, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The Supreme Court has granted absolute immunity to judges in the performance of their judicial duties. <em>Nixon v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 731, 745, 102 S.Ct. 2690, 2699, 73 L.Ed.2d 349 (1982). The Court employs a \u201cfunctional\u201d approach to determine if other officials are entitled to absolute immunity. <em>See, e.g., Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 113 S.Ct. 2606, 2613, 125 L.Ed.2d 209 (1993) (state prosecutor denied absolute immunity in suit that involved job functions that were investigatory rather than prosecutorial in nature and thus were not performed in role as advocate for state).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Officials whose responsibilities are \u201cfunctionally comparable\u201d to those of a judge are also absolutely immune from damages liability. <em>See Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 513-14, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2914-15, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978) (finding administrative law judge absolutely immune from damages liability for performing adjudicatory functions). Thus, it is \u201cthe nature of the function performed, not the identity of the actor who performed it, that inform[s] our immunity analysis.\u201d <em>Forrester v. White, </em>484 U.S. 219, 227-29, 108 S.Ct. 538, 544-35, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988) (denying judge absolute immunity when performing administrative rather than judicial duties).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Although the Supreme Court has not expressly extended absolute immunity to parole board members, the Court has noted with approval that \u201cfederal appellate courts have so held.\u201d <em>Cleavinger, </em>474 U.S. at 200-01, 106 S.Ct. at 500; <em>Walrath v. United States, </em>35 F.3d 277, 282 n. 3 (7th Cir.1994). Most circuits now hold that \u201cparole board members are absolutely immune from suit for their decisions to grant, deny, or revoke parole.\u201d <em>Walrath, </em>35 F.3d at 281 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">This circuit first granted absolute immunity to a parole board member over fifteen years ago. <em>See Cruz v. Skelton, </em>502 F.2d 1101 (5th Cir.1974). Since then, we have repeatedly held that parole board members are absolutely immune when performing their adjudicative functions, distinguishing such decision-making activities from administrative functions for which parole board members are entitled to only qualified immunity. <em>See, e.g., Walter v. Torres, </em>917 F.2d 1379, 1383 (5th Cir.1990) (finding parole board members absolutely immune and reiterating that \u201cdefendant\u2019s immunity depends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>on function, not on identity\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Seventh Circuit has long held that parole board members\u2019 conduct that is \u201cinexorably connected with the execution of parole revocation procedures\u201d is entitled to absolute immunity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Walrath, </em>35 F.3d at 282 (quoting <em>Trotter v. Klincar, </em>748 F.2d 1177, 1182 (7th Cir.1984)). The parole revocation functions to which the Seventh Circuit accords absolute immunity are \u201cnot only the actual decision[s] to revoke parole, but also the activities that are part and parcel of the decision process.\u201d <em>See Trotter, </em>748 F.2d at 1182. We see no reason to hold differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The conduct of which Hulsey complains is conduct for which the Board members are absolutely immune from suit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> First, Hul-sey\u2019s claim that his parole revocation was based on an assault charge that was later dropped is a challenge to a \u201cdecision that involved an exercise of discretion in determining whether parole revocation was appropriate in this particular instance.\u201d <em>See Wal-rath, </em>35 F.3d at 282-83 (holding parole board members to be absolutely immune from charge that they conspired to revoke inmate\u2019s parole based on charges they knew to be false). Second, Hulsey\u2019s claim that the Board failed to provide him with a copy of the hearing officer\u2019s findings in a timely manner <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is analogous to a claim against a judge for denying an inmate the right to a speedy trial. <em>See id. </em>at 283 (comparing challenge to parole board members\u2019 delay in scheduling a parole revocation hearing to a defendant\u2019s seeking \u201cmonetary damages from a judge for violation of his speedy trial rights\u201d). Third, the Board\u2019s denial of Hulsey\u2019s request to reopen revocation proceedings is adjudicatory in nature. <em>See id. </em>at 281-82 (citing <em>Trotter, </em>748 F.2d at 1182-83, as holding that \u201cparole board officials who declined a request to conduct a second preliminary parole revocation hearing were absolutely immune from suit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Hulsey also contends that Owens and Green allowed staff members to stamp Board members\u2019 signatures on reincareeration decisions that no Board member ever reviewed. Hulsey concedes that a designee may conduct a revocation hearing, and make recommendations based upon that hearing, in the place of a Board member,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but he argues that the ultimate decision must still be made by a Board member. We addressed a similar claim in <em>Walter, </em>in which an inmate challenged the parole board\u2019s enactment of a statute eliminating the necessity of conducting a formal hearing before revoking an inmate\u2019s parole on the grounds that the inmate had committed a felony while on parole. <em>See Walter, </em>917 F.2d at 1380. We held that, in enacting the statute, the parole board was \u201cexercising a rule making power broader <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>than simply making rules of practice,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 1384, but we noted that if the parole board \u201chad been making a rule of practice for a judicial body, it would have been entitled to absolute immunity in making as well as applying the rule\u201d <em>see id. </em>In the present case, we hold that the Board members\u2019 alleged practice of allowing their signatures to be placed on reincarceration certificates that they never reviewed is a rule of practice; thus, even if we assume that Hulsey is challenging the creation as well as the application of the practice, the Board members are absolutely immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Because we find that Owens and Green are absolutely immune from suit, we will not reach the other issues discussed by the magistrate judge and the district court. The district court\u2019s dismissal is accordingly modified to read DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE, and we AFFIRM the dismissal AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-13\">. We liberally construe the brief of a <em>pro se </em>appellant, <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993), and thus read Hulsey's brief to argue that Owens and Green are not immune from suit or liability for damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b405-14\">. <em>Heck v. Humphrey </em>prevents an action for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 when the complaint, directly or indirectly, challenges the legality of the complainant's conviction or imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. A \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must first prove that his conviction or sentence has been invalidated in a proper pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ceeding prior to bringing a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Id. </em>If the sentence or conviction has not been invalidated there can be no action for damages under \u00a7 1983, and the statute of limitations does not begin to run. <em>Id.; see also Stephenson v. Reno, </em>28 F.3d 26, 27 (5th Cir.1994) (recognizing that \u00a7 1983 action does not accrue until conviction or sentence has been invalidated). Consequently, the statute of limitations on Hulsey\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim will not begin to run until <em>after </em>he has obtained habeas relief, if warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\">. <em>See also Cleavinger v. Saxner, </em>474 U.S. 193, 201, 106 S.Ct. 496, 501, 88 L.Ed.2d 507 (1985) (summarizing absolute immunity doctrine and noting that its extension has been based on job function challenged rather than defendant\u2019s status); <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 808, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2733, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982) (granting absolute immunity to the president based on public policy of preventing outside pressures from directly impacting president's execution of official duties); <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 423-24, 96 S.Ct. 984, 991, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976) (prosecutor granted absolute immunity for conduct integrally related to judicial system due to policy considerations similar to those supporting absolute immunity for judges and grand jurors).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b407-6\">. <em>See also Johnson v. Kegans, </em>870 F.2d 992, 995-96 (5th Cir.)

Mississippi State Parole Bd., </em>836 F.2d 969, 974 (5th Cir.1988) (focusing on the nature of the official\u2019s responsibilities and not on the official\u2019s status or rank); <em>Cruz v. Skelton, </em>502 F.2d 1101, 1102 (5th Cir.1974) (granting absolute immunity to parole board members when they are \"engaged in the performance of quasi-judicial duties\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\">. While the Fifth Circuit has addressed the absolute immunity of parole board members, see, e.g., <em>Walter v. Torres, </em>917 F.2d 1379 (5th Cir.1990), the Seventh Circuit recently reviewed absolute immunity of parole board members in much greater detail, <em>see Walrath v. United States, </em>35 F.3d 277 (7th Cir.1994). Although <em>Walrath </em>concerned a federal parole board, the Supreme Court has held that \u201cthere is no basis for according to federal officials a higher degree of immunity from liability when sued for a constitutional infringement ... than is accorded state officials when sued for the identical violation under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 500, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2907, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b407-11\">. Green is General Counsel for the Board.
