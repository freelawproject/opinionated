As the trial judge found, the police had probable cause to think that defendant\u2019s automobile contained the contraband. The police, without a warrant, seized the automobile which was on the parking lot maintained by defendant\u2019s employer for employes, and had it towed to the police garage. The police thereafter obtained a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\">The trial judge held that in addition to probable cause, exigent circumstances to seize or search an operable automobile must exist before such can be done without a warrant. This was error. <em>See State v. Greene, </em>30 Or App 1019, 568 P2d 716 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
