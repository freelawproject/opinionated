In this case, the indictment alleged defendant \"did * * * knowingly, by forcible compulsion, engage in sexual intercourse * * etc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">In order to extend ORS 161.300 from its stated applicability (\"the intent * * * element of the crime\u201d) to a rape alleged to have been committed knowingly, defendant would have us interpret \"intent\u201d in ORS 161.300 as meaning any culpable mental state recognized by the criminal law. The legislative history is to the contrary. When the draftsmen began consideration of what became ORS 161.300, they noted that Model Penal Code \u00a7 4.02(1) (Tent Draft No 4,1955) provides that psychiatric evidence is admissible to prove that a defendant \"did or did not have a state of mind which is an element of the offense.\u201d They expressly rejected this formulation, preferring a formulation permitting psychiatric evidence to negate \"a specific intent or purpose which is an element of the crime\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">\"* * * Professor Platt first pointed out that the phrase in section 1, 'specific intent or purpose which is an element of the crime,\u2019 was designed primarily to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>indicate that only where a specific intent was involved would the partial responsibility doctrine apply. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-3\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">\"Judge Bums then noted that the Model Penal Code section 4.02 used the term 'state of mind\u2019 and asked if there was a difference between that phrase and 'specific intent or purpose\u2019 as employed in the proposed draft. * * *\u201d Minutes, Criminal Law Revision Commission, Subcommittee No. 3, September 20, 1968, pp 1-2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Later in the drafting process the phrase \"specific intent or purpose\u201d was changed to simply read \"intent,\u201d was adopted in that form by the Legislative Assembly and now appears as ORS 161.300. The legislative history contains no explanation for this latter change, although we can speculate that it may have been based on the fact that other statutes then being drafted removed the concept of \"specific intent\u201d from Oregon law. <em>State v. Booth, </em>30 Or App 351, 567 P2d 559 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">This history shows a purposeful decision to limit the admissibility of partial-responsibility evidence to situations where the crime charged included an \"intent\u201d element. We decline defendant\u2019s invitation to extend ORS 161.300 to crimes involving other mental elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We are aware of possible incongruities in the statutory scheme. Intent is defined as conscious purpose, ORS 161.085(7); knowledge is defined as conscious awareness, ORS 161.085(8). A logician might have difficulty explaining why partial-responsibility evidence can negate purpose but cannot negate awareness. However, the Legislative Assembly is entitled to make, and in ORS 161.300 did make, such a policy decision. Moreover, historically the doctrine of partial responsibility was closely linked with the legal effect of intoxication. Oregon\u2019s statute on intoxication, ORS 161.125(1), permits evidence thereof \"to negative an element of the crime charged.\u201d This, presumably, would allow intoxication evidence to negate knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>edge, although partial-responsibility evidence cannot. If anomalies these be, they are not of our making.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\"> Defendant stipulated to the facts alleged in the indictment.
