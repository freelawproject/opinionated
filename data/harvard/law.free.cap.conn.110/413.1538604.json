A. Caputo, two hundred and forty-four dollars with interest at the rate of <em>1% </em>per centum per annum at 266 N.

[Seal.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">........................ [Seal.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The defendant filed a general denial, but upon the trial admitted the execution of the note, and that it had not been paid. In a second defense he pleaded that the right of action upon the note did not accrue within six years next before the commencement of the action. The plaintiff, in reply, denied the allegations of the second defense. Since the note fell due November 29th, 1920, and this action was not commenced until March 21st, 1927, and no new acknowledgment was pleaded, the plaintiff could not truthfully deny the allegation that the right of action did not accrue within six years prior to its commencement, and the defendant was entitled to judgment under his second defense upon the face of the pleadings. Both the court and counsel have treated the pleadings as though the question whether the action upon this note was subject to the six-year statute of limitations (General Statutes, \u00a7 6153) or the seventeen-year statute (General Statutes, \u00a7 6151), had been raised by demurrer to the second defense and we will so treat it.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">General Statutes, \u00a7 6151, provides: \u201cNo action shall be brought upon any contract under seal, or promis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>sory note not negotiable, but within seventeen years next after an action on the same shall accrue.\u201d General Statutes, \u00a76153, provides: \u201cNo action for an account, or for a debt due by book to balance book accounts or any simple or implied contract, or upon any contract in writing not under seal, except promissory notes not negotiable, shall be brought but within six years next after the right of action shall accrue.\u201d The note in question is a negotiable instrument although it bears a seal. General Statutes, \u00a7 4364. Action upon it is controlled by \u00a7 6153 unless, because the word \u201cseal\u201d follows the signature of the maker, it is to be construed as a contract under seal, and thus within the provisions of \u00a7 6151.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Whatever its terms may be, an instrument will not be a specialty, or contract under seal, unless it be both signed and sealed by the maker. It is as necessary that the seal be his seal as that the signature be his signature. In other words, he must have performed the act of affixing a seal as his seal as well as the act of executing the instrument by affixing his signature to it. \u201cWhether an instrument is under seal or not is a question for the court upon inspection; whether a mark or character shall be held to be a seal depends upon the intention of the executant, as shown by the paper.\u201d <em>Jacksonville, M. P. Ry. &amp; Nav. Co. </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>160 U. S. 514, 519, 16 Sup. Ct. 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In ancient times the impression upon wax by the signet ring of the maker of the instrument was as distinctively his personal act as his signature itself. Under modern statutes providing that the addition of the word \u201cseal\u201d or the letters \u201cL. S.\u201d shall constitute the paper a sealed instrument, the mere presence of these letters upon the instrument is not necessarily conclusive that the signer has also sealed it. That fact must be proved as well as the fact that the sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>nature appearing upon the paper is actually the signature of the person which it purports to be. That is unquestionably so under our statute, \u00a7 6742 of the General Statutes, in which it is provided: \u201cAll instruments in writing executed by any person or corporation not having an official or corporate seal, purporting and intended to be a specialty or under seal, and not otherwise sealed than by the addition of the word 'seal\u2019 or the letters \u2018L. S.\u2019, . . . shall be deemed in all respects sealed instruments, and received in evidence as such.\u201d The addition of the word \u201cseal\u201d or of the letters \u201cL. S.\u201d does not make the instrument a specialty unless the instrument itself, apart from such word or letters, purports to be a specialty, and it appears that it was intended to be such. To constitute such an instrument a contract under seal there must therefore be some recognition of the fact on the face of the instrument, other than the mere addition of such word or letters. The customary phrases, \u201csigned and sealed\u201d or \u201cgiven under my hand and seal\u201d or some similar phraseology would constitute such a recognition, and the instrument would then be one purporting to be a specialty. The fact that the maker of the instrument himself wrote the word \u201cseal\u201d or the letters \u201cL. S.\u201d after his signature at the time that he executed it, or that the instrument was one whose validity was dependent upon its being under seal, might indicate his intention. Here the instrument in question is a negotiable promissory note, not required by law to be under seal and not customarily carrying a seal. The note is upon a printed form, and the defendant\u2019s signature is upon one of three lines at the end of each of which appears the printed word \u201cSeal.\u201d The instrument does not purport to be a contract under seal, an inspection of it discloses no intention to make it such, nor is there any evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>aliunde </em>as to the intention of the maker. Our decision must depend largely upon our statute (General Statutes, \u00a7 5742) and authorities from other jurisdictions are not particularly helpful. They will be found collected in 19 Amer. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ann. Cas. 677, in an annotation to <em>Matter of Pirie, </em>198 N. Y. 209, 91 N. E. 587. In that case it was held that \u201cthe mere attaching of a seal after the signature upon a promissory note does not raise a presumption that the note is a sealed instrument unless there be a recognition of the seal in the body of the instrument by some sucn phrase as \u2018witness my hand and seal\u2019 or \u2018signed and sealed\u2019.\u201d In <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>215 Mass. 552, 102 N. E. 1094, relied on by the plaintiff, the note concluded \u201cgiven under my hand and seal\u201d and the court held that it was manifest that the parties intended it to be an instrument under seal. The plaintiff\u2019s right of action accrued more than six years before the commencement of this action, and the trial court was right in directing a verdict in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
