Nor were the paragraphs of the motion to correct in proper form, while the exceptions were not accompanied by any excerpts from the evidence. Errors assigned in reasons of appeal four and seven are not specific and are too indefinite and general to be considered. <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Eastern Machinery Co., </em>77 Conn. 484, 493, 59 Atl. 611; <em>Lawton </em>v. <em>Herrick, </em>83 Conn. 417, 76 Atl. 986.
