A careful examination of this record discloses evidential support for all the findings of the trial court. There was much contradictory evidence and the defendant-appellant seeks to change the finding in certain vital respects, but these are based almost entirely upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>the testimony of the defendant\u2019s truck driver and his helper. They are, for the most part, flatly contradicted by the testimony of witnesses produced by the plaintiffs. It was the right of the trial court to decile what testimony was credible, and the refusal to make the changes requested, was justified. The conclusions reached by the court that the defendant\u2019s driver was . guilty of negligence and that the plaintiff Chester was free from contributory negligence, are sound and reasonable conclusions from the subordinate facts found, and the claims of the appellant must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
