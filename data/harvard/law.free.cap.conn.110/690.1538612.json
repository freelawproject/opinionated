The defendant made a general denial of this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The issue between the parties was one of fact. The case turned largely upon whether the changed contract was presented to the plaintiff by the defendant or whether it was drawn and prepared in the office of plaintiff\u2019s attorney. A comparison of two other agreements admittedly drawn in the office of plaintiff\u2019s attorney satisfied the trial court that all of these documents were drawn in the attorney\u2019s office and this fact was largely responsible for the court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s version of this transaction was thoroughly discredited by this documentary evidence. Other evidence tended to confirm this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We do not think the court erred in its conclusion or in the ruling setting aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
