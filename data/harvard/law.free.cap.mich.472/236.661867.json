We hold that specific loss benefits under MCL 418.361(2) do not require an amputation. It is sufficient to qualify for such benefits if the limb or body part has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>lost its usefulness. Regarding total and permanent disability benefits under MCL 418.361(3)(b), which covers the loss of both legs, as with specific loss, if the legs have lost their usefulness, even though not amputated, the worker qualifies for total and permanent disability benefits. We therefore affirm the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission (WCAC).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">This case was previously before us in <em>Cain v Waste Mgt, Inc, </em>465 Mich 509, 513; 638 NW2d 98 (2002) <em>(Cain I), </em>where we summarized the facts describing plaintiffs injuries as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">Plaintiff Scott M. Cain worked as a truck driver and trash collector for defendant, Waste Management, Inc. In October 1988, as he was standing behind his vehicle emptying a rubbish container, he was struck by an automobile that crashed into the back of the truck. Mr. Cain\u2019s legs were crushed. Physicians amputated Mr. Cain\u2019s right leg above the knee. His left leg was saved with extensive surgery and bracing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">In February 1990, Mr. Cain was fitted with a right leg prosthesis, and he was able to begin walking. He returned to his employment at Waste Management and started performing clerical duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">Mr. Cain\u2019s left leg continued to deteriorate. In October 1990, he suffered a distal tibia fracture. Doctors diagnosed it as a stress fracture caused by preexisting weakness from the injury sustained in the accident. After extensive physical therapy and further surgery on his left knee, Mr. Cain was able to return to Waste Management in August 1991, first working as a dispatcher and then in the sales department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">Waste Management voluntarily paid Mr. Cain 215 weeks of worker\u2019s compensation benefits for the specific loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>his right leg. MCL 418.361(2)(k). However, there was disagreement concerning whether he was entitled to additional benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">To understand the benefits that are at issue, it is necessary to review several sections of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (WDCA), MCL 418.101 <em>et seq. </em>Specific loss. benefits are payable under MCL 418.361(2)(k) to an employee \u201cfor the loss of\u201d a leg.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Total and permanent disability benefits are payable \u201c[w]hile the incapacity for work resulting from a personal injury is total,\u201d MCL 418.351(1), and MCL 418.361(3) defines what \u201ctotal and permanent disability\u201d means.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Of particular relevance here are two of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>definitions of total and permanent disability found in MCL 418.361(3)(b), \u201cLoss of both legs or both feet at or above the ankle,\u201d and MCL 418.361(3)(g), \u201cPermanent and total loss of industrial use of both legs or both hands or both arms or 1 leg and 1 arm . ..</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In <em>Cain I, </em>we determined that because Mr. Cain had a brace on his left leg that enabled him to return to work, he had not lost industrial use of both legs, as required by MCL 418.361(3)(g).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We noted there is a difference between specific loss and loss of industrial use, and we \u201cadopt[ed] as our own\u201d the analysis of the WCAC in its April 1997 opinion. <em>Cain </em>7, <em>supra </em>at 521. In accord with that analysis, we held that the \u201ccorrected\u201d standard applies to claims for permanent and total loss of industrial use under MCL 418.361(3)(g), and we remanded to the WCAC \u201cto consider plaintiffs specific loss claim.\u201d <em>Cain I, supra </em>at 524. On remand, the WCAC determined actual amputation is unnecessary to qualify for specific loss benefits and, because plaintiffs leg is essentially useless, his injury \u201cequated with anatomical loss.\u201d The WCAC cited as authority <em>Hutsko v Chrysler </em>Corp, 381 Mich 99; 158 NW2d 874 (1968), and <em>Tew v Hillsdale Tool &amp; Mfg Co, </em>142 Mich App 29; 369 NW2d 254 (1985). Both are cases in which specific loss claims were allowed where there had been a loss of use, but not an anatomical loss. The WCAC then concluded without further explanation that \u201c[h]aving shown specific loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>of each leg, plaintiff is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits.\u201d On appeal, the Court of Appeals majority, citing <em>Pipe v Leese Tool &amp; Die Co, </em>410 Mich 510; 302 NW2d 526 (1981), affirmed the decision of the WCAC. 259 Mich App 350; 674 NW2d 383 (2003). It concluded that each of plaintiffs legs qualified for specific loss benefits (one through amputation and one through lost industrial use), and that these losses, when considered together, equaled a \u201closs of both legs\u201d under MCL 418.361(3)(b), thus entitling plaintiff to total and permanent disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Both the defendant employer and the Second Injury Fund sought leave to appeal. We granted both applications for leave, ordering the appeals to be argued and submitted together. 470 Mich 870 (2004). We directed the parties in both appeals to include among the issues to be briefed whether the \u201closs of industrial use\u201d standard may be applied to claims of specific loss under MCL 418.361(2) and whether <em>Pipe, supra, </em>should be overruled. We further directed the parties in Docket No. 125180 to address the issues whether the WCAC exceeded the scope of this Court\u2019s remand order by awarding plaintiff total and permanent disability benefits and whether total and permanent disability benefits under MCL 418.361(3) (b) (loss of both legs) may be awarded on the basis of plaintiffs specific (anatomical) loss of one leg and his specific (industrial use) loss of the other leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">We review de novo questions of law in worker\u2019s compensation cases. <em>Mudel v Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co, </em>462 Mich 691, 697 n 3; 614 NW2d 607 (2000). Entitlement to worker\u2019s compensation benefits must be determined by reference to the statutory language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>creating those benefits. <em>Nulf v Browne-Morse Co, </em>402 Mich 309, 312; 262 NW2d 664 (1978). As we have noted in the past, when we construe a statute, our primary goal is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature and our first step in that process is to review the language of the statute itself. <em>In re MCI Telecom Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999). The Legislature has specified the proper approach to construing statutory language, saying in MCL 8.3a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">All words and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common and approved usage of the language; but technical words and phrases, and such as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall he construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">ANALYSIS: SPECIFIC LOSS</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We turn first to the question of specific loss and therefore focus our analysis on MCL 418.361(2). The loss provision of this section repeatedly has been held to be intended to compensate workers who have suffered one of the losses enumerated in this provision, regardless of the effect on the worker\u2019s earning capacity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Cain I, supra </em>at 524; <em>Redfern v Sparks-Withington Co, </em>403 Mich 63, 80-81; 268 NW2d 28 (1978). This means if a worker, for example, loses an arm, thumb, finger, leg, or so on in a workplace injury, specific loss benefits, as set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>forth in the schedule, will be awarded even if no time is missed from work. At issue here is whether a limb (here, a leg), crushed but not severed, is to be treated as lost, thus entitling the injured worker to specific loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Defendants argue that the word \u201closs\u201d unambiguously means \u201camputation,\u201d especially in the context of \u00a7 361(2)(k), which expressly mentions amputation. As they argue it, amputation is required because MCL 418.361(2)(k) provides benefits for the loss of a leg by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">Leg, 215 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">An amputation between the knee and foot 7 or more inches below the tibial table (plateau) shall be considered a foot, and an amputation above that point shall be considered a leg.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Thus, defendants assert that the amputation language, at least regarding legs, limits the word \u201closs\u201d in the statute to mean that only amputations are compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Plaintiff, on the other hand, while agreeing that the statute is unambiguous, argues that defendants\u2019 approach is flawed because it disregards the original meaning of the specific loss provisions when the WDCA was enacted almost a century ago in favor of a modern perception of the word\u2019s meaning. The original meaning, plaintiff asserts, is controlling because, although the statute has been amended many times since its enactment in 1912, the word \u201closs\u201d has remained unchanged and without express qualifications or limitations. Plaintiff analogizes our task in determining the meaning of \u201closs\u201d to that which we undertook in <em>Title Office, Inc v Van Buren Co Treasurer, </em>469 Mich 516, 522; 676 NW2d 207 (2004), where we determined what the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201ctranscript\u201d was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>1895. This analytical approach of plaintiff is sound. Because the statute itself does not define \u201closs,\u201d we agree with plaintiff that we must ascertain the original meaning the word \u201closs\u201d had when the statute was enacted in 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u201cWhen determining the common, ordinary meaning of a word or phrase, consulting a dictionary is appropriate.\u201d <em>Title Office, Inc, supra </em>at 522. In the dictionaries from the era of the original legislation, the definition of \u201closs\u201d is fairly broad: \u201cPerdition, ruin, destruction; the condition or fact of being \u2018lost,\u2019 destroyed, or ruined,\u201d <em>New English Dictionary </em>(1908); \u201cState or fact of being lost or destroyed; ruin; destruction; perdition; as <em>Loss </em>of a vessel at sea,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1921); \u201cFailure to hold, keep, or preserve what one has had in his possession; disappearance from possession, use, or knowledge; deprivation of that which one has had: as, the <em>loss </em>of money by gaming, <em>loss </em>of health or reputation, <em>loss </em>of children: opposed to <em>gain,\u201d Century Dictionary and Cylopedia </em>(1911). From this we can see that severance is but one way a loss may occur; loss also occurs when something is destroyed, ruined, or when it disappears from use. We conclude that amputation is not required in order for a person to have suffered the loss of a specified body part.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Having ascertained the commonly understood meaning of the word \u201closs,\u201d our substantive analysis of its definition is complete. <em>Gladych v New Family Homes, Inc, </em>468 Mich 594, 597; 664 NW2d 705 (2003). Our conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the same meaning for the word \u201closs\u201d is found in the cases construing late nineteenth-century private liability insurance plans for the aid of injured workers that were, in part, the models for the body-part loss provisions of our first worker\u2019s compensation act. When, in special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>session, the Legislature in 1912 passed that first act, known as Michigan\u2019s \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it was the culmination of the efforts of the five-person Employers\u2019 Liability and Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission appointed by Governor Chase S, Osborn in 1911.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The commission had been formed because of what was described at the time as \u201cwide dissatisfaction\u201d with the employer\u2019s liability at common law for injuries suffered by his employees. Report of the Employers\u2019 Liability and Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of the State of Michigan, 5 (1911) (Report). The commission was directed to \u201cinvestigate and report a plan for legislative action to provide compensation for accidental injuries or death arising out of and in the course of employment....\u201d <em>Id. </em>In its report, the commission, after concluding that the existing negligence-based system (1) failed to sufficiently encourage prevention of accidents, (2) did not protect employers against excessive verdicts, (3) resulted in inadequate compensation for injured workers, and (4) engendered animosity and strife, recommended a statute based on similar provisions already enacted in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and New Jersey.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Legislature, with very few changes to the recommended language, briskly enacted this pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>posal as Michigan\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation act less than three weeks after the bill was introduced. 1912 (1st Ex Sess) Journal of the House 13, 149-150.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In dealing with what today is described as total and permanent disability, the 1912 statute stated in \u00a7 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">While the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is total, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid as hereinafter provided, to the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to one-half his average weekly wages, but not more than ten dollars nor less them four dollars a week; and in no case shall the period covered by such compensation be greater than five hundred weeks, nor shall the total amount of all compensation exceed four thousand dollars. [1912 (1st Ex Sess) PA 10, part II, \u00a7 9.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In dealing with partial incapacity, the statute stated at \u00a7 10:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">While the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is partial, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid as hereinafter provided, to the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to one-half the difference between his average weekly wages before the injury and the average weekly wages which he is able to earn thereafter, but not more than ten dollars a week; and in no case shall the period covered by such compensation be greater than three hundred weeks from the date of the injury. In cases included by the following schedule the disability in each such case shall be deemed to continue for the period specified, and the compensation so paid for such injury shall be as specified therein, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">For the loss of a leg, fifty per centum of average weekly wages during one hundred and seventy-five weeks. [1912 (1st Ex Sess) PA 10, part II, \u00a7 10.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Section 9 allowed wage-based benefits to be paid to workers who were totally incapacitated from work, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>regardless of the type of work-related injury that caused the incapacity, while \u00a7 10 provided for benefits when the worker was partially incapacitated. Moreover, the latter part of \u00a7 10, with its schedule of benefits for specific losses, allowed a set amount of weeks that benefits would be awarded when a worker suffered one of the specific injuries described. In doing so, it was intentionally patterned after the specific loss provisions of the above-referenced employers\u2019 private liability insurance plans, which were designed to provide benefits to workers injured on the job. Report, supra,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The cases construing such insurance policies in that era, from Michigan and elsewhere, unmistakably indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>cate that the word \u201closs,\u201d just as it did in dictionaries of the time, meant not just severance or amputation but also the destruction of the usefulness of the member. In Michigan, our Court in <em>Fuller v Locomotive Engineers\u2019 Mut Life &amp; Accident Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>122 Mich 548, 553; 81 NW 326 (1899), construing the specific loss provision in an insurance policy, said just this, indicating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">where an insurance policy insures against the loss of a member, or the loss of an entire member, the word \u201closs\u201d should be construed to mean the destruction of the usefulness of the member, or the entire member, for the purposes to which, in its normal condition, it was susceptible of application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Simply stated, under such a policy in Michigan, no amputation was necessary for a loss. The rationale for not limiting loss just to amputation was the understanding by this Court and, as we will explain, by other American courts that the term \u201closs\u201d in such policies should be given its ordinary and popular meaning, which was broad enough to include loss of usefulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">As the Missouri Supreme Court said on this topic, the word \u201closs\u201d in insurance policies \u201cwas used in its ordinary and popular sense and [did] not mean that there should be a total destruction of the [member], anatomically speaking, but that the loss of the use of it for the purposes to which [the member] is adapted would be a loss of it....\u201d <em>Sisson v Supreme Court of Honor, </em>104 Mo App 54, 60; 78 SW 297 (1904). The Kansas Supreme Court stated it similarly: \u201cThe loss of a member of the body, as used in an accident insurance policy, unless restricted or modified by other language, carries the common meaning of the term \u2018loss,\u2019 which is the loss of the beneficial use of the member. Obviously this may occur when there is not a complete severance of the member from the body.\u201d <em>Noel v Continental Cas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>Co, </em>138 Kan 136, 139; 23 P2d 610 (1933). The Kansas court then reinforced its holding by citing thirteen cases from ten other states from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, holding to the same effect.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Also buttressing our analysis is that, in the early years of the act\u2019s existence, the decisions of the Industrial Accident Board (IAB), the WCAC\u2019s predecessor, also construed \u201closs\u201d as defined in the dictionary. That is consistent with its commonly understood meaning. This is consequential because half of the four IAB board members had served on Governor Osborn\u2019s commission and had recommended the very \u201closs\u201d language we are considering.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We find the interpretation these board members gave to the statute useful in the same way that the comments of drafting committees can be \u201cuseful interpretive aids\u201d for construing statutes. See <em>Gladych, supra </em>at 601 n 4. The IAB, in <em>Lardie v Grand Rapids Show Case Co, </em>1916 Workmen\u2019s Compensation Cases 17, 19, in discussing loss, stated that \u201ccourts have uniformly construed provisions of accident policies in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>suring against the loss of a member, to cover cases where the usefulness of the member was destroyed by accident without resulting in severance or amputation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 553. Similarly, that \u201closs\u201d in the context of worker\u2019s compensation specific loss benefits did not mean only amputations, but also included loss of usefulness, was indicated by the IAB\u2019s decisions in an unnamed case cited in Industrial Accident Bd, Bulletin No 3, 13 (1913);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Rider v C H Little Co, </em>Industrial Accident Bd, <em>supra </em>at 27, 29 (1913); <em>Hirschkom v Fiege Desk Co, </em>184 Mich 239; 150 NW 851 (1915); <em>Purdy v Sault Ste Marie, </em>188 Mich 573, 579; 155 NW 597 (1915); <em>Cline v Studebaker Corp, </em>189 Mich 514; 155 NW 519 (1915); <em>Lardie, supra; Carpenter v Detroit Forging Co, </em>191 Mich 45; 157 NW 374 (1916); <em>Packer v Olds Motor Works, </em>195 Mich 497; 162 NW 80 (1917); <em>Adomites v Royal Furniture Co, </em>196 Mich 498; 162 NW 965 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The same can be seen in large part in this Court\u2019s jurisprudence of the time. For example, in <em>Purdy, supra </em>at 579, the Court affirmed the IAB\u2019s specific loss award for a crushed leg.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>Lovalo v Michigan Stamping Co, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>202 Mich 85, 89; 167 NW 904 (1918), the Court held that the claimant had suffered the loss of his hand where four fingers and nearly all the palm were amputated, saying that \u201cthe loss of all the palm and all of the fingers of the hand could ... be reasonably considered the loss of the entire hand.\u201d Indeed, the only expressly contrary case in this era is <em>Wilcox v Clarage Foundry &amp; Mfg Co, </em>199 Mich 79; 165 NW 925 (1917), where the Court, in a case with difficult facts, determined that the specific loss provision required anatomical loss. The <em>Wilcox </em>Court made no effort to reconcile its holding with the IAB\u2019s clearly stated understanding of \u201closs,\u201d nor with <em>Fuller </em>or <em>Purdy, </em>but analogized instead to cases where the plaintiffs had suffered partial losses and this Court had required proof of <em>complete, </em>rather than <em>partial, </em>loss.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude that, given its outlier status, as well as the fact that the construction it seeks to give to the term \u201closs\u201d is inconsistent with the original meaning of \u201closs\u201d in the act, <em>Wilcox </em>was incorrectly decided. Thus, we overrule <em>Wilcox </em>so that its potentially confusing shadow will be removed from our case law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">To summarize, then, regarding this issue of the definition of \u201closs\u201d: the definition comes from its commonly understood meaning at the time of enactment. The contemporaneous uses of the word are corroborative and reinforcing of this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Defendants assert that, even given this conclusion, the 1927 amendments forever altered the definition of \u201closs.\u201d In 1927, the Legislature, for the only time in the twentieth century, consequentially amended the specific loss section of the statute by adding to the provision regarding a leg the language: \u201cAn amputation between the knee and foot six or more inches below the knee shall be considered a foot, above this point a leg[.]\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> 1927 PA 63. Keying off of this amendment, defendants urge that this language implicitly was designed to alter any previously broad understanding of the word \u201closs\u201d so that after the amendment there could be no specific loss without an amputation. We think this explanation insufficiently appreciates that the amendment came in the wake of a series of cases where this Court had made debatable calls on the nature of the loss after an amputation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That is, at what point on the limb had a loss become not just of a hand but of an arm, not just of a foot but of a leg? We believe the goal of the amendment was to bring certainty to this discrete set of determinations once there was an amputation. It is hard to conclude otherwise, given that the Legislature, in its amendment, did not expressly alter or redefine the word \u201closs\u201d itself and especially given that word\u2019s quite clear meaning in the dictionaries of the time as well as the above-referenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>decisions of the IAB and this Court. Moreover, this Court\u2019s leading postamendment decision in the 1930s on the issue of loss<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> is consistent with this understanding that the 1927 amendment was not intended to reverse the holdings of the IAB and this Court on what is a loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">This dominant theme of our case law, that loss does not require amputation, can be seen throughout the mid-century, albeit with some false starts.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Later in the century, in <em>Pipe v Leese Tool &amp; Die Co, </em>410 Mich 510; 302 NW2d 526 (1981), the Court correctly determined, consistent with the original understanding of the act and the earlier cases we have discussed, that amputation was not a prerequisite to a \u201closs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\"><em>Pipe, </em>however, in a phrase used frequently in these cases, described this loss of usefulness as \u201closs of the industrial use....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527. The phrase \u201closs of industrial use\u201d does not appear anywhere in the specific loss provisions, and seems to have been intended as judicial shorthand to describe the condition of the injured member from the standpoint of its use in employment. However, this description causes confusion because it does not adequately capture the proper standard, which is that specific loss is to be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>without reference to the plaintiffs earning capacity or ability to return to work. That is, it is paid if the loss has been incurred and it is not relevant whether the worker can work after the loss. <em>Miller v Sullivan Milk Products, Inc, </em>385 Mich 659; 189 NW2d 304 (1971); Shumate <em>v American Stamping Co, </em>357 Mich 689; 99 NW2d 374 (1959). We believe it was this concept that the <em>Pipe </em>Court was attempting to articulate and we clarify by means of this opinion that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">To be clear, we are endeavoring here not to craft a new standard, but to articulate clearly the standard enacted in 1912. We find that the original understanding the word \u201closs\u201d carried when the WDCA was enacted was its plain and ordinary meaning, consistent with how it had been construed in the context of insurance law. Thus, \u201closs\u201d includes not only amputation hut also loss of usefulness.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It was the intent of the drafters to write into the statute a word that was expansive enough to cover both situations and the words and language they chose conveyed this. Moreover, in our case law, this Court has with considerable consistency, albeit not unfailingly, upheld this construction. We do so again today, believing as courts have before us that the meaning we give to the word \u201closs\u201d in MCL 418.361(2) is the meaning originally intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Defendants\u2019 approach would require us to ignore the statutory drafters\u2019 and enactors\u2019 turn-of-the-twentieth-century understanding of the common and approved meaning of \u201closs\u201d in favor of a purportedly different contemporary understanding, divorced from its roots. This we cannot do. We are not free to substitute any other nonstatutory definition of a word or term for the meaning it indisputably had in 1912, and has main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>tained for almost a century. This duty traces to the simple notion that we are to construe a statute \u201cin the light of the circumstances existing at the date of its enactment, not in the light of subsequent developments. . . . \u2018The words of a statute must be taken in the sense in which they were understood at the time when the statute was enacted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wayne Co Bd of Rd Comm\u2019rs v Wayne Co Clerk, </em>293 Mich 229, 235-236; 291 NW 879 (1940), quoting 25 RCL, \u00a7 215, p 959. We therefore hold to the original meaning of the word \u201closs\u201d in the specific loss provisions: it does not require severance and there can be a \u201closs\u201d where the claimant suffers the loss of usefulness of the member.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In addition, we conclude that the WCAC properly applied the \u201cuncorrected\u201d standard. We discussed in <em>Cain I, supra </em>at 521-523, the propriety of applying the \u201cuncorrected\u201d standard to specific loss claims and the \u201ccorrected\u201d standard to total and permanent disability claims. We reaffirm that rule today.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The WCAC found the damage to Mr. Cain\u2019s left leg \u201cequated with anatomical loss and that the limb retains no substantial utility.\u201d The WCAC\u2019s factual finding is, in essence, that he lost the usefulness of his leg. Because that factual finding is supported by competent evidence in the record, it must be affirmed. <em>Mudel, supra </em>at 701. The Court of Appeals erred when it grafted a loss of industrial use standard onto the factual findings of the administrative tribunal. Nonetheless, it reached the correct result with regard to plaintiffs benefit eligibility. Accordingly, plaintiff is eligible for specific loss benefits for the loss of his left leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">ANALYSIS: TOTAL AND PERMANENT DISABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">We next turn to analyze whether the WCAC correctly allowed plaintiff benefits under the total and perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>nent disability provisions, MCL 418.361(3). Our task in interpreting the Legislature\u2019s work is, if possible, to read the seven eligibility requirements in \u00a7 361(3) so as to read none of them out or as an unnecessary duplication of another. In particular, we must endeavor to harmonize the three provisions concerning legs and to read them in a way that does not make any of the language surplusage. <em>Jenkins v Patel, </em>471 Mich 158, 167; 684 NW2d 346 (2004); <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas Co v Old Republic Ins Co, </em>466 Mich 142, 146; 644 NW2d 715 (2002). In short, we read the words in a statute together, to harmonize the meaning of the clauses and give effect to the whole. <em>G C Timmis &amp; Co v Guardian Alarm Co, </em>468 Mich 416, 421; 662 NW2d 710 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Defendants argue that we cannot construe \u201c[l]oss\u201d in \u00a7 361(3)(b) to mean less than amputation because then cases of lost industrial use would fall under both \u00a7 361(3)(b) and \u00a7 361(3)(g), rendering the latter surplusage. We disagree. We find the proper construction of the word \u201c[l]oss\u201d in \u00a7 361(3)(b) is that it has the same meaning given it in \u00a7 361(2).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This conclusion is unsurprising, we believe, given the juxtaposition of \u00a7\u00a7 361(2) and 361(3), which is itself a compelling reason to give them the same meaning. See, e.g., <em>Sibley v Smith, 2 </em>Mich 487, 491 (1853). Furthermore, doing so, as we will explain, causes no part of \u00a7 361(3) to be duplicative or nugatory. Dealing with \u00a7 361(3)(b) first, we find that using this definition of loss means that benefits are payable under this section not only when there is anatomical loss, but also when the limbs have no practical usefulness. Section 361(3)(g), on the other hand, as we discussed in <em>Cain I, </em>with its reference to permanent and total loss of industrial use, calls the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>fact-finder to look to wage-earning capacity and the injured worker\u2019s ability to function in industry. As is apparent, these words demand something distinct from \u00a7 361(3) (b)\u2019s simple inquiry regarding whether the legs or feet are amputated or have no practical usefulness. This means that what is covered under \u00a7 361(3)(b) may not be covered under \u00a7 361(3)(g). Stated more formally, \u00a7\u00a7 361(3)(b) and 361(3)(g) cover different things and defining loss as we have here does not make either provision nugatory. An example may make this distinction clearer. If the legs are rendered useless but can be braced so as to make the performance of the job possible, there has been loss under \u00a7 361(3)(b) but no loss of industrial use\" under \u00a7 361(3)(g). This worker, indeed like Mr. Cain, would under this reading qualify for total and permanent disability benefits under \u00a7 361(3)(b) but not \u00a7 361(3)(g). Conversely, a worker whose legs have basic function, i.e., are practically useful, but whose legs have no industrial use even if braced (such as a ballerina), would qualify under \u00a7 361(3)(g) but not \u00a7 361(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">These examples limn that the \u201ccorrected\u201d standard does not apply to \u00a7 361(3)(b), unlike \u00a7 361(3)(g). The reason is, as we explained in <em>Cain I, </em>that \u00a7 361(3)(g), with its utilization of permanent and total loss language, compels a conclusion that if the condition is correctable, it is not permanent and total. <em>Cain I, supra </em>at 519-520. In fact, when this language appears elsewhere in \u00a7 361(3), such as in \u00a7\u00a7 361(3)(a) and 361(3)(e), the doctrine of correctability also applies. Because there is no such permanent and total loss triggering language in \u00a7 361(3)(b), it follows that the requirement of looking to correctability is absent.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>In sum, Mr. Cain has clearly suffered the loss of his amputated right leg and the WCAC found that his left leg has \u201cno substantial utility.\u201d That is, his leg has no practical usefulness. Thus, he has suffered a \u201closs of both legs\u201d and falls within \u00a7 361(3)(b), qualifying for an award of total and permanent disability benefits under that provision.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, the WCAC and the Court of Appeals decisions are affirmed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In conclusion, we find that Mr. Cain has suffered the specific loss of his left leg under MCL 418.361(2) and that he qualifies for an award of total and permanent disability benefits under MCL 418.361(3)(b). Therefore, we affirm the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the WCAC.</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-7\">Cavanagh, Corrigan, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Taylor, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\"> The full text of MCL 418.361(2) reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In cases included in the following schedule, the disability in each case shall be considered to continue for the period specified, and the compensation paid for the personal injury shall be 80% of the after-tax average weekly wage subject to the maximum and minimum rates of compensation under this act for the loss of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">(a) Thumb, 65 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">(b) First finger, 38 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">(c) Second finger, 33 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">(d) Third finger, 22 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-12\">(e) Fourth finger, 16 weeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">The loss of the first phalange of the thumb, or of any finger, shall be considered to be equal to the loss of <em>xh </em>of that thumb or finger, and compensation shall be <em>xk </em>of the amount above specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">The loss of more than 1 phalange shall be considered as the loss of the entire finger or thumb.

The word \u201closs,\u201d as used in both subsections of the statute, includes not only amputation but also those situations in which there is a loss of the usefulness of the limb or member.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As noted by Chief Justice TAYLOR, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission (WCAC) essentially found that on these facts, plaintiff lost the usefulness of his left leg and that he accordingly was entitled to specific loss benefits for the loss of his left leg under MCL 418.361(2)(k). <em>Ante </em>at 258. There is competent evidence to support the WCAC\u2019s factual finding and we must defer to the WCAC on this finding. <em>Mudel v Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co, </em>462 Mich 691, 703; 614 NW2d 607 (2000). Further, plaintiff has suffered a \u201c[l]oss of both legs\u201d under MCL 418.361(3)(b) because his right leg has been amputated and he has lost the usefulness of his left leg. Consequently, he is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits. Therefore, I agree that the decisions of the WCAC and Court of Appeals should be affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b424-4\">KELLY, J., concurred with WEAVER, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-5\"> Dictionary definitions of the word \u201closs\u201d include: \u201cfailure to preserve or maintain\u201d and \u201cdestruction, ruin.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s New College Dictionary </em>(1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\"> While I agree with some of the basic conclusions of the majority, as should he evident from the fact that I am concurring separately, I do not sign on to all of the lengthy analysis on which the majority relies to support its conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
