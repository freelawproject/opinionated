Because the food in this case is neither \u201cfor accidental bodily injury\u201d under MCL 500.3105(1) nor \u201cfor an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation\u201d under MCL 500.3107(l)(a), we hold that the expenses for it may not be recovered under those provisions of the no-fault act. We thus reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">I. UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">On April 28, 1994, plaintiffs sixty-three-year-old husband, Douglas Griffith,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> suffered a severe brain injury as a result of a motor vehicle accident. He received treatment at in-patient facilities and hospitals until August 1995, at which time he was transferred to a residence where he received twenty-four-hour nursing and attendant care. On August 6, 1997, Griffith returned home with plaintiff. He remains confined to a wheelchair and continues to require assistance with basic daily tasks such as eating and bathing.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>After the accident, defendant provided coverage as Griffith\u2019s no-fault insurer. Until the time that Griffith returned home, the expenses that defendant covered included food expenses. After Griffith returned home, defendant denied plaintiffs claim for Griffith\u2019s food expenses, and plaintiff sued to recoup those expenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court ruled that Griffith\u2019s food costs are an \u201callowable expense\u201d under MCL 500.3107(l)(a) of the no-fault act and ordered defendant to pay a per diem food charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\">The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court relied on <em>Reed v Citizens Ins Co of America, </em>198 Mich App 443; 499 NW2d 22 (1993), which held that a person receiving at-home care is entitled to room and board costs under MCL 500.3107(l)(a) to the same extent that such costs would constitute an allowable expense if the injured person received the same care in an institutional setting. Thus, the panel concluded that, under <em>Reed, </em>Griffith\u2019s food costs are an \u201callowable expense\u201d under MCL 500.3107(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Defendant filed an application for leave to appeal to this Court, which this Court denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, this Court granted defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration and granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">n. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">This case requires us to determine whether an injured person\u2019s food costs constitute an \u201callowable expense\u201d under MCL 500.3107(l)(a). Issues of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>interpretation are questions of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Jenkins v Patel, </em>471 Mich 158, 162; 684 NW2d 346 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">III. PRINCIPLES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">When interpreting a statute, we must ascertain the legislative intent that may reasonably be inferred from the statutory language itself. <em>Sotelo v Grant Twp, </em>470 Mich 95, 100; 680 NW2d 381 (2004). When the language of a statute is unambiguous, the Legislature\u2019s intent is clear and judicial construction is neither necessary nor permitted. <em>Koontz v Ameritech Services, Inc, </em>466 Mich 304, 312; 645 NW2d 34 (2002). Because the role of the judiciary is to interpret rather than write the law, courts lack authority to venture beyond a statute\u2019s unambiguous text. <em>Id. </em>Further, we accord undefined statutory terms their plain and ordinary meanings and may consult dictionary definitions in such situations. <em>Hallaran v Bhan, </em>470 Mich 572, 578; 683 NW2d 129 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">IV ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">A. STATUTORY LANGUAGE AND LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">MCL 500.3105(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">Under personal protection insurance an insurer is liable to pay benefits <em>for accidental bodily injury </em>arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle, subject to the provisions of this chapter. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">According to the plain language of MCL 500.3105(1), a no-fault insurer is only required to pay benefits \u201cfor accidental bodily injury\u201d arising out of an automobile accident. The no-fault act <em>further </em>restricts a no-fault insurer\u2019s liability by defining the limited types of ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>efits that are payable \u201cfor accidental bodily injury... MCL 500.3107(l)(a), the statutory provision at the center of this case, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-3\">Except as provided in subsection (2), personal protection insurance benefits are payable for the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">(a) Allowable expenses consisting of all reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations <em>for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Thus, in addition to the requirement under MCL 500.3105(1) that benefits be \u201cfor accidental bodily injury,\u201d MCL 500.3107(l)(a) circumscribes benefits to those expenses consisting only of items or services that are reasonably necessary \u201cfor an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Both this Court and the Court of Appeals have interpreted and applied the above statutes in cases involving claims for food or \u201croom and board\u201d expenses. In <em>Manley v Detroit Automobile Inter-Ins Exchange, </em>127 Mich App 444, 448; 339 NW2d 205 (1983), rev\u2019d 425 Mich 140 (1986), the plaintiffs\u2019 minor son suffered severe head trauma in an automobile accident. He resided with the plaintiffs and received care from nurse\u2019s aides. <em>Id. </em>at 449. The plaintiffs sued the defendant no-fault carrier, seeking, among other things, reimbursement for his room and board costs. <em>Id. </em>at 448-449. The defendant insurance carrier argued that because the plaintiffs already had a legal duty to care for their child, room and board costs were not compensable. <em>Id. </em>at 451. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument, largely on the basis of a worker\u2019s compensation case that distinguished between \u201cordinary household tasks\u201d such as cleaning and washing clothes and nonordinary tasks such as \u201c \u2018[s]erving meals in bed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>bathing, dressing, and escorting a disabled person <em>Id. </em>at 452, quoting <em>Kushay v Sexton Dairy Co, </em>394 Mich 69; 228 NW2d 205 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The panel concluded that the distinction between ordinary and nonordinary tasks could be reconciled with the language of MCL 500.3107(a), which then provided that \u201cproducts, services, and accommodations not reasonably necessary for the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation are not \u2018allowable expenses.\u2019 \u201d 127 Mich App at 453. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">The necessity for the performance of ordinary household tasks has nothing to do with the injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation; such tasks must be performed whether or not anyone is injured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">This reasoning supports a generalization concerning the circumstances in which a product, service, or accommodation can fall within the definition of \u201callowable expense\u201d. <em>Products, services, or accommodations which are as necessary for an uninjured person as for an injured person are not \u201callowable expenses\u201d. [Id. </em>at 453-454 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The panel then opined that food \u201cis as necessary for an uninjured person as for an injured person\u201d and thus would not ordinarily constitute an \u201callowable expense\u201d under MCL 500.3107 for an injured person cared for at home. 127 Mich App at 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">When <em>Manley </em>was appealed to this Court, we effectively vacated the Court of Appeals room and board analysis. <em>Manley v Detroit Automobile Inter-Ins Exchange, </em>425 Mich 140; 388 NW2d 216 (1986). We stated that the \u201cquestion whether food, shelter, utilities, clothing, and other such maintenance expenses are an allowable expense when the injured person is cared for at home\u201d had neither been raised before the trial court nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>argued in the Court of Appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 152. Accordingly, this Court declined to address the issue and stated that the Court of Appeals analysis of the issue \u201cshall not be regarded as of precedential force or effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\">Justice BOYLE issued a concurring and dissenting opinion, asserting that the room and board issue was properly before this Court because the Court of Appeals had raised it sua sponte and discussed the issue in its opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 168 (BOYLE, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). She could find \u201cno principled basis\u201d for distinguishing between food provided in an institutional setting and food provided at home, and concluded that the Court of Appeals \u201cinjured person vs. uninjured person\u201d test was not only \u201cunwieldy and unworkable\u201d but that it effectively punished those who choose to care for injured family members at home. <em>Id. </em>at 168-169. Justice Boyle opined that MCL 500.3107 imposes three requirements for \u201callowable expenses\u201d: \u201c1) the charge must be reasonable, 2) the expense must be reasonably necessary, and 3) the expense must he incurred.\u201d 425 Mich at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Thereafter, in <em>Reed, </em>the Court of Appeals adopted Justice Boyle\u2019s <em>Manley </em>analysis. The insured in <em>Reed </em>had been severely injured in an auto accident. <em>Reed, supra </em>at 445. The plaintiff, the insured\u2019s mother, filed various claims against the defendant insurer and moved to amend her complaint to include a claim for room and board expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 445-446. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that such expenses were not recoverable under the no-fault act. <em>Id. </em>at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">We see no compelling reason not to afford the same compensation under the act to family members who provide room and board. Subsection 1(a) does not distinguish between accommodations provided by family members and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>accommodations provided by institutions, and we decline to read such a distinction into the act. Moreover, holding that accommodations provided by family members is [sic] an \u201callowable expense\u201d is in accord with the policy of this state. Denying compensation for family-provided accommodations while allowing compensation in an institutional setting would discourage home care that is generally, we believe, less costly than institutional care. Irrespective of cost considerations, it can be stated without hesitation that home care is more personal than that given in a clinical setting....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\"><em>We hold that, where an injured person is unable to care for himself and would be institutionalized were a family member not willing to provide home care, a no-fault insurer is liable to pay the cost of maintenance in the home. [Id. </em>at 452-453 (citations omitted; emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">In addition to the above reasoning, the Court of Appeals relied on the notion that because the no-fault act is remedial in nature, it \u201cmust be liberally construed in favor of persons intended to benefit thereby.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">B. INTERPRETATION OF STATUTORY LANGUAGE AND APPLICATION '</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">As previously stated, MCL 500.3105(1) and MCL 500.3107(l)(a) impose two separate and distinct requirements for \u201ccare, recovery, or rehabilitation\u201d expenses to be compensable under the no-fault act. First, such expenses must be <em>\u201cfor accidental bodily injury </em>arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle ....\u201d MCL 500.3105(1) (emphasis added). Second, these expenses must be \u201creasonably necessary ... for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d MCL 500.3107(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Defendant contends that MCL 500.3105(1) requires that allowable expenses be causally connected to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>person\u2019s injury. We agree. In fact, MCL 500.3105(1) imposes two causation requirements for no-fault benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\">First, an insurer is liable only if benefits are <em>\u201cfor </em>accidental bodily injury.. . .\u201d \u201c[F]or\u201d implies a causal connection.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c [Accidental bodily injury\u201d therefore triggers an insurer\u2019s liability and defines the scope of that liability. Accordingly, a no-fault insurer is liable to pay benefits only to the extent that the claimed benefits are causally connected to the accidental bodily injury arising out of an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Second, an insurer is liable to pay benefits for accidental bodily injury only if those injuries \u201caris[e] out of\u201d or are caused by \u201cthe ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle . . . .\u201d It is not <em>any </em>bodily injury that triggers an insurer\u2019s liability under the no-fault act. Rather, it is only those injuries that are caused by the insured\u2019s use of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In this case, it is uncontested that the insured\u2019s injuries arose out of his use of an automobile. Therefore, to the extent that the insured\u2019s injuries stem from an automobile accident, application of the second causal element noted above does not bar plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The first causal element, however, poses a problem for plaintiff. Plaintiff does not claim that her husband\u2019s diet is different from that of an uninjured person, that his food expenses are part of his treatment plan, or that these costs are related in any way to his injuries. She claims instead that Griffith\u2019s insurer is liable for ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>nary, everyday food expenses. As such, plaintiff has not established that these expenses are \u201cfor accidental bodily injury ... .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Even if ordinary food expenses were compensable under \u00a7 3105, an insurer would be liable for those expenses only if they were also \u201callowable expenses\u201d under MCL 500.3107(l)(a). This section provides that benefits are payable for \u201creasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d In other words, an insurer is liable only for the cost of \u201cproducts, services and accommodations\u201d \u201creasonably necessary\u201d \u201cfor an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">There is no dispute that Griffith is an \u201cinjured person.\u201d Thus, the question is whether food is reasonably necessary for his \u201ccare, recovery, or rehabilitation\u201d as an injured person. It is not contended here that the food expenses at issue are a part of the insured\u2019s \u201crecovery\u201d or \u201crehabilitation.\u201d Indeed, plaintiff does not allege that the food has special curative properties that might advance Griffith\u2019s recovery or rehabilita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>tion. The key issue, therefore, is whether the food expenses are necessary for Griffith\u2019s \u201ccare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\">Because \u201ccare\u201d can have several meanings depending on the context in which it is used, the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>is helpful in discerning the meaning of that term in this statute. This doctrine is premised on the notion that \u201cthe meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context.\u201d <em>King v St Vincent\u2019s Hosp, </em>502 US 215, 221; 112 S Ct 570; 116 L Ed 2d 578 (1991).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, under the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis, \u201c \u2018 \u201c </em>a word or phrase is given meaning by its context or a setting.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Koontz, supra </em>at 318 (citations omitted). As a general matter, \u201cwords and clauses will not be divorced from those which precede and those which follow.\u201d <em>Sanchick v State Bd of Optometry, </em>342 Mich 555, 559; 70 NW2d 757 (1955). When construing a series of terms such as \u201ccare, recovery, or rehabilitation,\u201d we are guided by the principle \u201cthat words grouped in a list should be given related meaning.\u201d <em>Third Nat\u2019l Bank in Nashville v Impac Ltd, Inc, </em>432 US 312, 322; 97. S Ct 2307; 53 L Ed 2d 368 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Generally, \u201ccare\u201d means \u201cprotection; charge,\u201d and \u201cto make provision.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001). Thus, taken in isolation, the word \u201ccare\u201d can be broadly construed to encompass <em>anything </em>that is reasonably necessary to the provision of a person\u2019s protection or charge. But we have consistently held that \u201c[c]ourts must give effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a statute and avoid an interpretation that would render any part of the statute sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>plusage or nugatory.\u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas Co v Old Republic Ins Co, </em>466 Mich 142, 146; 644 NW2d 715 (2002). Therefore, we must neither read \u201ccare\u201d so broadly as to render nugatory \u201crecovery and rehabilitation\u201d nor construe \u201ccare\u201d so narrowly that the term is mere surplusage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cCare\u201d must have a meaning that is related to, but distinct from, \u201crecovery and rehabilitation.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">As an initial matter, it is important to note that the statute does not require compensation for any item that is reasonably necessary to a person\u2019s care in general. Instead, the statute specifically limits compensation to charges for products or services that are reasonably necessary \u201cfor an <em>injured person\u2019s </em>care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This context suggests that \u201ccare\u201d must be related to the insured\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">This conclusion is supported by the fact that the statute lists \u201ccare\u201d together with \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation.\u201d \u201cRecovery\u201d is defined as \u201crestoration or return to any former and better condition, esp. to health from sickness, injury, addiction, etc.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001). \u201cRehabilitate\u201d is defined as \u201cto restore or bring to a condition of good health, ability to work, or productive activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both terms refer to restoring an injured person to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>condition he was in before sustaining his injuries. Consequently, expenses for \u201crecovery\u201d or \u201crehabilitation\u201d are costs expended in order to bring an insured to a condition of health or ability sufficient to resume his preinjury life. Because \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d are necessary only when an insured has been injured, both terms refer to products, services, and accommodations that are necessary <em>because of </em>injuries sustained through the use of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\">\u201cCare\u201d must have a meaning that is broader than \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d but is not so broad as to render those terms nugatory. As noted above, both \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d refer to an underlying injury; likewise, the statute as a whole applies only to an \u201cinjured person.\u201d It follows that the Legislature intended to limit the scope of the term \u201ccare\u201d to expenses for those products, services, or accommodations whose provision is necessitated by the injury sustained in the motor vehicle accident.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cCare\u201d is broader than \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d because it may encompass expenses for products, services, and accommodations that are necessary because of the accident but that may not restore a person to his preinjury state.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Griffith\u2019s food costs here are not related to his \u201ccare, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d There has been no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>introduced that he now requires different food than he did before sustaining his injuries as part of his treatment plan. While such expenses are no doubt necessary for his <em>survival, </em>they are not necessary for his recovery or rehabilitation from the injuries suffered in the accident, nor are they necessary for his care because of the injuries he sustained in the accident. Unlike prescription medications or nursing care, the food that Griffith consumes is simply an ordinary means of sustenance rather than a treatment for his \u201ccare, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d In fact, if Griffith had never sustained, or were to fully recover from, his injuries, his dietary needs would be no different than they are now. We conclude, therefore, that his food costs are completely unrelated to his \u201ccare, recovery, or rehabilitation\u201d and are not \u201callowable expenses\u201d under MCL 500.3107(l)(a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The parties focus on the distinction between food costs for hospital food and food costs for an insured receiving at-home care. Plaintiff contends that there is no distinction between such costs. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Food costs in an institutional setting are \u201cbenefits for accidental bodily injury\u201d and are \u201creasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d That is, it is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for an insured to consume hospital food during in-patient treatment given the limited dining options available. Although an injured person would need to consume food regardless of his injuries, he would not need to eat <em>that particular food </em>or bear the cost associated with it. Thus, hospital food is analogous to a type of special diet or select diet necessary for an injured person\u2019s recovery. Because an insured in an institutional setting is required to eat \u201chospital food,\u201d such food costs are necessary for an insured\u2019s \u201ccare, recovery, or rehabilitation\u201d while in such a setting. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Once an injured person leaves the institutional setting, however, he may resume eating a normal diet just as he would have had he not suffered any injury and is no longer required to bear the costs of hospital food, which are part of the unqualified unit cost of hospital treatment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">This reasoning can be taken a step further when considering the costs of items such as an injured person\u2019s clothing, toiletries, and even housing costs. Under plaintiffs reasoning, because a hospital provided Grif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>fith with clothing while he was institutionalized, defendant should continue to pay for Griffith\u2019s clothing after he is released. The same can be said of Griffith\u2019s toiletry necessities and housing costs. While Griffith was institutionalized, defendant paid his housing costs. Should defendant therefore be obligated to pay Griffith\u2019s housing payment now that he has been released when Griffith\u2019s housing needs have not been affected by his injuries?</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Under plaintiffs reasoning, nothing would prevent no-fault insurers from being obligated to pay for any expenses that an injured person would otherwise be provided in an institutional setting as long as they are remotely related to the person\u2019s general care. Plaintiffs interpretation of MCL 500.3107(l)(a) stretches the language of the act too far and, incidentally, would largely obliterate cost containment for this mandatory coverage. We have always been cognizant of this potential problem<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> when interpreting the no-fault act, and we are no less so today.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Moreover, in seeking reimbursement for food and other such quotidian expenses, plaintiff is essentially seeking a wage-loss benefit. Reimbursement for the value of lost wages, however, is specifically addressed elsewhere in the no-fault act.

Such expenses are not necessary \u201cfor accidental bodily injury\u201d under MCL 500.3105. In addition, they are not \u201callowable expenses\u201d under MCL 500.3107(1) (a) because food is not necessary for Griffith\u2019s \u201ccare, recovery, or rehabilitation\u201d under that subsection.

Similarly, the cost of such items as a prosthetic leg or special shoes would be recoverable under the term \u201ccare,\u201d even though the person will never recover or be rehabilitated from the injuries, because the cost associated with such products or accommodations stems from the injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b698-6\"> Our dissenting colleagues do not pay sufficient regard to the context in which the word \u201ccare\u201d is used in MCL 500.3107(l)(a).

Our dissenting colleagues\u2019 failure to read the word \u201ccare\u201d in context renders the word devoid of any definitional limit. Let there he no mistake \u2014 the implication of their interpretation is that <em>any expense </em>that is necessary for a person\u2019s general \u201ccare\u201d is recoverable, <em>regardless of whether that expense hears any causal relationship </em>to an \u201caccidental bodily injury arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle ....\u201d MCL 500.3105(1). Because they would allow a plaintiff to recover expenses for normal, everyday food consumed at home that does not differ from what an uninjured person would eat, would they also allow recovery of housing costs and expenses for clothing and toiletries, where those expenses do not hear any causal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>relationship to an accidental bodily injury? Justice Kelly seems to concede that she would require no-fault insurers to pay for an injured person\u2019s \u201cshelter\u201d where that expense bears no causal relation to the injuries. <em>Post </em>at 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">It thus appears that Justice Kelly would essentially invent a new entitlement system by converting our no-fault law into a general welfare scheme. Her new scheme would pay all expenses of everyday life, such as mortgage payments and grocery bills, for anyone who has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, <em>even where those expenses do not arise from injuries sustained in the accident. </em>Justice Kelly does not explain how she would pay for her newly minted entitlement plan, but the effect of her position would be to force Michigan citizens to make these general welfare payments through increased mandatory insurance premiums. Perhaps Justice Kelly sincerely believes that our state\u2019s citizens should bear this new financial burden, but such a policy choice belongs to the legislative branch of our government. In deciding the case before us, we must honor the intent of the Legislature as reflected in the current language of the no-fault act by applying the causation requirement embodied in the provisions at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\"> Our dissenting colleagues opine that the language of the no-fault act does not distinguish between food expenses incurred in a hospital and food expenses at home. As we have explained, however, we believe this distinction arises from the language in MCL 500.3105(1) and MCL 500.3107(l)(a). Food expenses in an institutional setting are \u201cbenefits for accidental bodily injury,\u201d and are \u201creasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation,\u201d given the limited dining options available in hospitals. After all, an injured person is required to eat <em>hospital food </em>precisely because his injuries require treatment in a hospital. By contrast, a person who eats a normal diet at home does not incur food expenses that meet the requirements of MCL 500.3105(1) and MCL 500.3107(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Justice Kelly also asks whether the majority is implying that hospital food expenses would be reimbursable under MCL 500.3107(l)(a), but not under MCL 500.3105(1). We have stated clearly, however, that food costs in an institutional setting are \u201cbenefits for accidental bodily injury\u201d and are \u201creasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d See p 537 of this opinion. In other words, we have quoted the language from <em>both </em>statutory provisions in saying that such expenses are recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Finally, Justice Kelly expresses concerns about allowing recovery for food expenses in a hospital but not at home. It is the prerogative of the Legislature, however, to determine whether the no-fault act should be amended to allow recovery of food costs that are unrelated to an accidental bodily injury, taking into account policy concerns such as those expressed by Justice Kelly and competing considerations such as the increased costs of premiums for this mandatory form of insurance coverage. This Court lacks both the institutional capacity to weigh the competing policy considerations and the constitutional authority to amend the no-fault act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b701-5\"> See, e.g., <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 607-611; 267 NW2d 72 (1978) (\u201cIn choosing to make no-fault insurance compulsory for all motorists, the Legislature has made the registration and operation of a motor vehicle inexorably dependent on whether no-fault insurance is available at fair and equitable rates.\u201d); <em>Cruz v State Farm Mut Automobile Ins Co, </em>466 Mich 588, 597; 648 NW2d 591 (2002) (recognizing that, because no-fault coverage is mandatory, the Legislature has continually sought to make it more affordable); <em>Celina Mut Ins Co v Lake States Ins Co, </em>452 Mich 84, 89; 549 NW2d 834 (1996) (\u201cthe no-fault insurance system... is designed to provide victims with assured, adequate, and prompt reparations <em>at the lowest cost to both the individuals and the no-fault system\u201d </em>[emphasis added]); <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mut Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524, 547; 273 NW2d 829 (1979) (recognizing that the Legislature had provided for setoffs in the no-fault act: \u201cBecause the first-party insurance proposed by the act was to be compulsory, it was important that the premiums to be charged by the insurance companies be maintained as low as possible.

This Court has determined that the Legislature intended the no-fault act to be construed liberally in favor of the insured.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Turner v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>448 Mich 22, 28; 528 NW2d 681 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\">MCL 500.3105(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">In this case, Mr. Griffith was injured in an automobile accident that rendered him unable to care for himself.

The Legislature took pains to define at a different section of the statute what benefits must be paid. MCL 500.3107(l)(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the majority observes, \u00a7 3107(l)(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>is \u201cthe statutory provision at the center of this case.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 527. Because the Legislature defined \u201cbenefits\u201d in \u00a7 3107(l)(a), it seems contradictory that it would have given \u201cbenefits\u201d a different definition in \u00a7 3105(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Yet, the majority reads \u00a7 3105(1) to mean that the only benefits that a no-fault insurer is liable to pay are those \u201ccausally connected to the accidental bodily injury . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 531. It is not Mr. Griffith\u2019s injury, it reasons, that occasioned his need for food. Hence the cost of his food is not a covered expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The majority finds that \u00a7 3105 limits the benefits made available in \u00a7 3107, despite the fact that the courts have never before found such a limitation. The majority defines \u201cfor\u201d in the phrase \u201can insurer is liable to pay benefits <em>for </em>accidental bodily injury\u201d as meaning \u201c \u2018with the object or purpose of,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018intended to belong to or be used in connection with,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018suiting the purposes or needs of.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 531 n 6. (Citation omitted.) From that it concludes that these definitions \u201cimply\u201d that the benefit an injured party seeks must be directly caused by the injury. Not only is the majority\u2019s reading of \u00a7 3105 novel and unprecedented, it flies in the face of our time-honored determination to liberally construe the no-fault act for the benefit of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The word \u201cfor\u201d in the English language has many nuances in its meaning. I feel confident that the Legislature added \u00a7 3107(l)(a) for the purpose of defining \u201cbenefits\u201d in \u00a7 3105. On the basis of that belief, I find that the definition of \u201cfor\u201d in \u00a7 3105 that best accords with the Legislature\u2019s intent is \u201cby reason of.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001). Hence, \u00a7 3105 should be read to mean that benefits are payable \u201cby reason of\u201d accidental bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\">Reading \u00a7 3105 in this way ensures that the only limitations placed on \u201cbenefits\u201d for an insured injured in an auto accident are those clearly stated by the Legislature in \u00a7 3107. My belief is that, if the Legislature intended that the sole benefits payable for an insured\u2019s injury were those directly arising therefrom, it would have said so. Also, it would not have required at \u00a7 3107 payment for so broad a category as \u201call reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Additionally, the majority\u2019s reading of the act is irrational. The majority believes that food provided in the hospital qualifies as a benefit under the act. However, under its reading of \u00a7 3105, food would be excluded: the need for it does not arise from the injury. The majority explains that, in an institution, one has little choice what food is served. But it fails to explain how that fact transforms hospital food into an expense arising from an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">If the Legislature had intended, for example, that ground beef be compensable only if no other entr\u00e9e were offered, it should have written something to make that clear. The majority will search in vain for some indication in the act that food, or any item, can qualify for \u201cbenefits for an accidental bodily injury\u201d if fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>nished in the hospital but not at home. Absolutely nothing in either \u00a7 3105 or \u00a7 3107 allows for that distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The difficulty the majority has in providing a convincing answer to this question illustrates the weakness of its conclusion. Its reading of \u00a7 3105 is, at its foundation, unsound. The majority criticizes my analysis of \u00a7 3105(1) as inadequate and undeveloped. <em>Ante </em>at 532, n 7. It would be inadequate only if I agreed with the majority\u2019s choice to create two requirements where there is only one in \u00a7 3105.1 have taken my own analysis of \u00a7 3105(1) to its logical conclusion. It is not the same analysis as the majority\u2019s, but it is more faithful to the text of the statute. Contrary to Justice CORRIGAN\u2019S belief, I have set forth a principled basis for my analysis. It includes a plain-language reading of \u00a7\u00a7 3105(1) and 3107(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">MCL 500.3107(l)(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The majority finds that Douglas Griffith fails to qualify not only under \u00a7 3105(1) but also under \u00a7 3107(l)(a). In construing \u00a7 3107(l)(a), first it goes to the dictionary to interpret the meaning of \u201ccare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">As is frequently the case, here a dictionary alone does not clarify the Legislature\u2019s intent. \u201cCare\u201d has several definitions. The majority chooses \u201cprotection\u201d or \u201ccharge\u201d as the appropriate one. But the word can also be defined as \u201cthe provision of what is necessary for the welfare and protection of someone or something.\u201d <em>Compact Oxford English Dictionary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">It is clear that, when consulting a dictionary in performance of the interpretative task, one is normally required to make a choice among several definitions. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>is nothing less than a pretense to maintain that, in enforcing a statute \u201cas written,\u201d a court does not make definitional choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\">The language of \u00a7 3107(l)(a) is broad. Yet, the majority ultimately limits the meaning of \u201ccare\u201d to the care needed for recovery and rehabilitation, ascribing to it a restorative meaning. The logical consequence of using this restrictive definition demonstrates that it is poorly chosen. It reads \u201ccare\u201d out of the sentence. Given that \u201crecovery and rehabilitation\u201d are in the sentence with \u201ccare,\u201d the effect of the majority\u2019s choice of definitions turns \u201ccare\u201d into a mere redundancy. This approach violates our obligation when interpreting statutes to try to give every word meaning and treat no word as surplusage. <em>Altman v Meridian Twp, </em>439 Mich 623, 635; 487 NW2d 155 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">My reading of the statute gives independent meaning to the word \u201ccare.\u201d Under the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>the meaning of questionable words may be ascertained by reference to the meaning of other words associated with it. Applying this doctrine, \u201ccare\u201d fits with \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d when \u201ccare\u201d is interpreted broadly to mean \u201cthe provision of what is necessary for the welfare and protection of someone.\u201d The Legislature intended that an injured person\u2019s needs be furnished (\u201ccare\u201d) until \u201crecovery\u201d has been accomplished through \u201crehabilitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In some cases, such as where a motorist is catastrophically injured, recovery and rehabilitation may not be an achievable goal. In these cases, the Legislature requires that the injured individual receive all products and services reasonably necessary for his or her continuing care. The act\u2019s comprehensive language demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s intent to ensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>that benefits are provided in every instance where a motorist suffers injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">THE LEGISLATURE\u2019S INTENTION WITH RESPECT TO FOOD</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">It is difficult to deny that food is a product reasonably necessary for the care of an invalid, however narrowly \u201ccare\u201d is defined. Without nourishment, an injured person could not be restored to health and could not properly be cared for. In fact, without it, a person\u2019s physical well-being would be immediately threatened. A finding that food is necessary for \u201ccare\u201d accords with the purpose of the no-fault act: to provide benefits needed by someone injured in an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">There is a limitation on those benefits in the act: all benefits reasonably necessary. Given the wide variety of circumstances under which injured parties seek no-fault benefits, the act provides for wide latitude in determining what benefits are reasonably necessary in a given situation. Unfortunately, the majority limits the wide latitude provided by the Legislature by restrictively reading the word \u201ccare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">It is noteworthy that the Legislature did not expressly limit the expenses recoverable in no-fault cases to those that the injured person did not require before the injury. It could have included, but did not, a clause such as \u201cbenefits are payable except for those that were reasonably necessary for the care of the person before the injury.\u201d It is the majority, not the Legislature, that writes this limitation into the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">The majority concludes that food is not necessary for the care of Mr. Griffith because he requires food, injured or not. It adds that food has nothing to do with an injured party\u2019s \u201ccare, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>further reasons that food is not an allowable expense when consumed in the home, although it is an allowable expense in an institution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\">This is not a reasonable construction of the statutory language. Nothing in the language of the no-fault act indicates that whether a home-based expense is allowable depends on whether an uninjured person has the same expense. The act\u2019s language mandates that the appropriate question is whether the injured person reasonably incurred the questioned expense as part of his or her care, recovery, or rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">The logic in the majority\u2019s reasoning is, charitably speaking, illusory. If an automobile accident victim is hospitalized, the reasonable cost of his or her food is a covered expense under \u00a7 3107(l)(a). If another automobile accident victim requires the same care, but receives it at home, the reasonable cost of his or her food likewise should be a covered expense under \u00a7 3107(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">I agree with-Justice BOYLE\u2019s partial concurrence in <em>Manley v Detroit Automobile Inter-Ins </em>Exchange,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Reed: </em>no principled distinction justifies a holding that, where a patient is institutionalized, food is a reasonably necessary expense, but if he or she is home receiving the same care, it is not. Moreover, the plain language of the no-fault act makes no such distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The majority claims that its ruling is necessary to keep down the cost of no-fault insurance. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>record contains no evidence to support that claim. There is nothing to indicate that no-fault insurance has become unaffordable because of in-home food expenses that insurers until now have been required to provide to catastrophically injured policyholders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The facts of Mr. Griffith\u2019s case illustrate the complexity of the issue before us and why the Legislature could not have intended the interpretation made by the majority. Mr. Griffith is receiving one hundred percent institutional care, albeit in a home setting. He resides in his own home and is being cared for solely by medical professionals, his wife having been placed in a nursing home.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Thus, family members play no role in cooking for Douglas Griffith or in providing his food. There is no evidence that his meals differ in any respect from those he earlier received in the hospital. Because food in both settings is necessary for his care, both should be compensable under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The only distinction between Mr. Griffith\u2019s hospital care and his in-home care is the location at which he receives it. The language of the no-fault act does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>limit expenses only to those incurred in a hospital setting. This is a new rule created by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\">The majority attempts to buttress its interpretation by asserting that it has discerned the policy choice made by the Legislature. It insists that my reading is my own policy choice that cannot be accurate unless the Legislature amends the no-fault act. This is a logical fallacy that assumes the majority\u2019s conclusion as its premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Also faulty is the majority\u2019s assertion that my reading of the statute \u201cessentially invent[s] a new entitlement system.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 537 n 13. To the contrary, my reading of the statute conforms with the law as interpreted-for at least the past twelve years.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The Court of Appeals made the same application. While the majority\u2019s accusations and appeal to cost concerns create a rhetorical flourish, it is the majority, and not I, that advocates a drastic change in established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Let there be no mistake in this: motorists, required to purchase no-fault insurance in order to drive in Michigan, now have one less resource available to them because of the majority\u2019s restrictive reading of the no-fault act. The majority holds that food, as a matter of law, is never reasonably necessary for one\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation outside a hospital, at least absent a special diet.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">A proper reading of the text belies the majority\u2019s conclusions. There is no need to require the Legislature to amend its decision that all expenses should be covered as long as reasonably necessary to an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, and rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">FURTHER IMPLICATIONS OF THE MAJORITY\u2019S DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The majority forces a harsh dilemma on insured individuals injured in automobile accidents: remain in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>an institution, if insurance coverage is available, or convalesce at home where they or others are burdened with the cost of their food. Unfortunately for impoverished families, the only choice may be to remain in institutional care.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\"><em>Reed </em>has been the rule of law in Michigan for twelve years. There are unacknowledged alarming implications in overruling it. If we apply the majority\u2019s reasoning about in-home food, is shelter at home an allowable expense? An uninjured person requires shelter. The majority incentivizes no-fault insurers to refuse to reimburse these and other expenses in the future, even though they are without dispute reasonably necessary for an injured person\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The majority opines that reimbursement for in-home food is a form of wage-loss benefits. However, it is unable to substantiate that statement with a showing that any legislation equates wage-loss benefits with payment for care of the injured. Wage-loss benefits exist to replace lost income, not as reimbursement for expenses incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Furthermore, the no-fault act limits wage-loss benefits to three years. But the insurer\u2019s obligation to provide for the care of an injured person can extend over the person\u2019s lifetime. Therefore, equating the provision of food with wage loss is inaccurate. The Legislature struck a very definite compromise on the duration of wage-loss' benefits that stands in contrast to the lifetime care to which an injured person is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>The majority<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> finds that \u00a7\u00a7 3105 and 3107 \u201cimpose two separate and distinct requirements\u201d before expenses are compensable under the act. It finds that Mr. Griffith\u2019s expenses for in-home food fail to satisfy the requirements of both sections. They fail to satisfy \u00a7 3107 because they were not necessary for his care. They fail to satisfy \u00a7 3105 because they were not caused by the accidental bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The majority informs us that Mr. Griffith\u2019s food, when provided in the hospital, did satisfy \u00a7 3107. Are we to infer that the hospital food was nonetheless not a reimbursable expense because it did not satisfy \u00a7 3105?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Clearly, the food was not an expense caused by the accidental bodily injury when furnished either in the hospital or at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Finally, the majority makes no provision for those who in the past have incurred ongoing expenses and assumed ongoing burdens in reliance on the availability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>of reimbursements for in-home food. Because its holding is not limited to new cases, many whose caregivers are already receiving reimbursement for in-home food may be forced to return to institutional settings.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The majority\u2019s conclusion is that food is unnecessary to one\u2019s \u201ccare, recovery, or rehabilitation\u201d outside an institution, although necessary inside an institution. It makes a distinction without a difference. Not only is it illogical, no statutory basis exists to distinguish the reimbursability of the cost of institutional food from the reimbursability of the cost of in-home food.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">I would affirm the trial court and the Court of Appeals decisions and leave <em>Reed </em>intact. Regardless of the choice of meanings ascribed to the word \u201ccare,\u201d the Legislature\u2019s intent had to be that food is an allowable expense for injured automobile accident victims convalescing at home.</p>\n<judges id=\"b716-8\">CAVANAGH, J., concurred with KELLY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-10\"> 198 Mich App 443; 499 NW2d 22 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> The majority\u2019s decision today, taking food as it were from the mouth of the injured insured convalescing at home, is anything but a liberal construction in his favor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b705-9\"> In pertinent part, MCL 500.3107 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">[P]ersonal protection insurance benefits are payable for ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>(a) Allowable expenses consisting of all reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary products, services, and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation. .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">(b) Work loss ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">(c) Expenses ... reasonably incurred in obtaining ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those that, if he or she had not been injured, an injured person would have performed....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\"> The majority claims a distinction exists where an injured person is required to eat hospital food because his or her injuries require treatment in a hospital. This ignores the closely related situation presented in this case. A catastrophically injured individual remains injured and continues to require institutional treatment, but does not necessarily require the treatment in a hospital or long-term care facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\"> 425 Mich 140, 168; 388 NW2d 216 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\"> The majority claims that my interpretation of the statute is based on policy considerations. But, in this case, I base my interpretation on the language found in the no-fault act. The Legislature has already made the policy decision. My construction of the statute is in accordance with that decision. Nonetheless, policy considerations are frequently appropriate. Certainly, the decision in this case has numerous policy implications. For example, the majority appears concerned that no-fault costs be kept low. This is a policy concern. In that regard, I fail to see why my interpretation of the law, which has prevailed at least since 1993, would increase current no-fault premiums. One would expect that no-fault providers have been factoring the potential for these costs into their premiums for years. Perhaps this state\u2019s drivers can expect that their premiums will decrease in response to the majority\u2019s opinion today. After all, Michigan drivers will no longer be entitled to the same level of benefits that they have paid for in premiums during the past twelve years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\"> Interestingly, although the majority expresses its concern that costs for insurers be minimized, its decision arguably helps to increase those costs. In the future, the care of patients who remain institutionalized during the period they once might have returned home is likely to be more expensive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b715-6\"> <em>Ante </em>at 530.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\"> After quoting both statutory provisions relevant to the present analysis, the majority concludes that hospital food remains a covered expense. But merely quoting the statutory language does not resolve the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">According to the majority, an injured person\u2019s food is not \u201cfor\u201d an accidental bodily injury because the need for food was not caused by the automobile accident. By the majority\u2019s logic, even one who is hospitalized is not entitled to food expenses because those expenses are as necessary to an uninjured person as to an injured person. This logic is equally applicable regardless of the injured person\u2019s physical location.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, I do not express policy concerns about allowing recovery for food expenses in a hospital, but not for the same costs at home. Rather, my concern is the lack of a logical basis for the distinction the majority seeks to create. Instead of the majority\u2019s artificial distinction, I would apply the clear language of \u00a7 3107(l)(a) and allow recovery for products reasonably necessary to \u201can injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d I would not decide, as the majority does, that as a matter of law at-home food expenses are never reasonably necessary to one\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
