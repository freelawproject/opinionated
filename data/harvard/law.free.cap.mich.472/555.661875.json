MCL 777.1 <em>et </em>seq.; MCL 769.34(2). The language of MCL 769.34(2) is very clear. It lists no exceptions. Thus, the legislative guidelines would apply to defendant\u2019s sentence, even if the sentence follows the imposition and revocation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Further, MCL 771.4 states that if probation is revoked, the court <em>may </em>sentence the probationer to the same penalty as if probation had never been granted, but does not <em>require </em>that the same penalty be imposed. Thus, the sentencing court is not precluded from considering events surrounding the probation violation when sentencing the defendant on the original offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">The Court of Appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> correctly held that the sentencing guidelines apply to sentences imposed after a probation violation and that acts giving rise to the probation violation may constitute substantial and compelling reasons to depart from the guidelines. It incorrectly held that the acts giving rise to the probation violation in this case were already considered in connection with the prior record variables and offense variables. We thus affirm in part and reverse in part the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate the sentence, and remand this case to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">I. UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">On March 20, 2000, defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted first-degree home invasion, MCL 750.92; MCL 750.110a(2). Defendant was sentenced to a five-year term of probation, with the first year to be served in jail. On April 9, 2001, defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of a Molotov cocktail, MCL 750.211a. The trial court again sentenced him to a five-year term of probation, with the first year to be served in jail. On July 23, 2001, defendant was arrested yet again for violating the terms of his probation by possessing a shotgun while walking on a public street.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">On August 23, 2001, the trial court revoked defendant\u2019s two probationary sentences and sentenced him to one to five years of imprisonment for the attempted home invasion and ten to twenty years of imprisonment for possession of a Molotov cocktail. The legislative sentencing guidelines range for the Molotov cocktail conviction was twelve to forty-eight months in prison, thus making defendant\u2019s ten-year minimum sentence a departure if the guidelines applied. The trial court, however, did not believe that the guidelines applied to sentences imposed after probation violation. Accordingly, it did not apply the guidelines in determining defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal. In lieu of granting leave to appeal, we remanded this case to the Court of Appeals for consideration as on leave granted and directed it to consider (1) whether the legislative sentencing guidelines apply to sentences imposed after a probation violation, and (2) if not, whether a sentencing court may consider the principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>of proportionality discussed in <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630; 461 NW2d 1 (1990).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The Court of Appeals held that the legislative sentencing guidelines were indeed applicable to sentences imposed after probation revocation. The panel further noted that in \u201cexceptional cases,\u201d the circumstances causing the probation revocation could constitute a \u201csubstantial and compelling\u201d reason for an upward departure. The Court of Appeals, however, remanded for resentencing, concluding that the reasons articulated by the trial court were not \u201csubstantial and compelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The prosecutor sought leave to appeal, contending that the legislative sentencing guidelines do not apply to sentences imposed after a probation violation. In the alternative, the prosecution argued that if the guidelines were applicable, the conduct constituting the probation violation provided an automatic substantial and compelling reason for departure from the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">We granted the prosecution\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Whether the legislative sentencing guidelines apply to sentences imposed after probation revocation is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>People v </em>Rodriguez, 463 Mich 466, 471; 620 NW2d 13 (2000). Similarly, whether conduct resulting in the revocation of probation may constitute a \u201csubstantial and compelling\u201d reason for an upward departure from the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>tive sentencing guidelines is also a question of law subject to review de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">A. THE LEGISLATIVE SENTENCING GUIDELINES APPLY TO SENTENCES IMPOSED AFTER PROBATION REVOCATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The legislative sentencing guidelines apply to certain enumerated felonies committed on or after January 1, 1999. MCL 777.1 <em>et seq.\\ </em>MCL 769.34(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the guidelines apply to the felonies defendant committed in this case \u2014 possession of a Molotov cocktail and attempted home invasion. It is also undisputed that defendant\u2019s underlying crimes were committed after January 1, 1999. Thus, the legislative sentencing guidelines apply, even if the sentence follows the imposition and revocation of probation, because the language of MCL 769.34(2) is clear and lists no exceptions. We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals that the guidelines apply to all enumerated felonies committed on or after the effective date, whether or not the sentence is imposed after probation revocation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">B. THE ACT GIVING RISE TO THE PROBATION VIOLATION MAY PROVIDE A SUBSTANTIAL AND COMPELLING REASON TO DEPART FROM THE LEGISLATIVE SENTENCING GUIDELINES.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">MCL 771.4, which governs probation and revocation of probation, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>It is the intent of the legislature that the granting of probation is a matter of grace conferring no vested right to its continuance. If during the probation period the sentencing court determines that the probationer is likely again to engage in an offensive or criminal course of conduct or that the public good requires revocation of probation, the court <em>may </em>revoke probation. All probation orders are revocable in any manner the court that imposed probation considers applicable either for a violation or attempted violation of a probation condition or for any other type of antisocial conduct or action on the probationer\u2019s part for which the court determines that revocation is proper in the public interest. Hearings on the revocation shall be summary and informal and not subject to the rules of evidence or of pleadings applicable in criminal trials. In its probation order or by general rule, the court <em>may </em>provide for the apprehension, detention, and confinement of a probationer accused of violating a probation condition or conduct inconsistent with the public good. The method of hearing and presentation of charges are within the court\u2019s discretion, except that the probationer is entitled to a written copy of the charges constituting the claim that he or she violated probation and to a probation revocation hearing. The court may investigate and enter a disposition of the probationer as the court determines best serves the public interest. <em>If a probation order is revoked, the court may sentence the probationer in the same manner and to the same penalty as the court might have done if the probation order had never been made. </em>This section does not apply to a juvenile placed on probation and committed under section 1(3) or (4) of chapter IX to an institution or agency described in the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The sentence at issue in MCL 771.4 is clearly permissive, not mandatory. It states that \u201cif\u201d probation is revoked, the court \u201cmay\u201d sentence the defendant as if probation had never been granted. While the sentencing court <em>may </em>sentence the probationer in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>manner and to the same penalty, nothing in the statute requires it to do so. In fact, the statute places an affirmative obligation on the trial court to take only two actions \u2014 to provide the probationer with a written copy of the charges constituting the probation violation and to conduct a probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Thus, the court may continue, extend, or revoke probation. In the event that the court revokes a defendant\u2019s probation, it <em>may </em>sentence the defendant \u201cin the same manner and to the same penalty as the court might have done if the probation order had never been made.\u201d A judge, however, is not required to sentence the defendant \u201cin the same manner.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Further, the Legislature did not alter our jurisprudence on probation in the statutory codification of sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That is, a probation violation does \u201cnot constitute a separate felony ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482. Rather, \u201crevocation of probation simply clears the way for a resentencing on the original offense.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendant here is thus being sentenced on the original offense\u2014 possession of a Molotov cocktail. Without a mandate to impose a sentence on the probationer in the same manner and to the same penalty that could have been imposed if the probation order had never been made, it is perfectly acceptable to consider postprobation factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>in determining whether substantial and compelling reasons exist to warrant an upward departure from the legislative sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Of course, not every probation violation and revocation warrants an upward departure. A trial court has broad latitude in deciding whether to revoke probation. It has less latitude in imposing a sentence in excess of the guidelines. The sentencing court must always follow the requirements set forth in MCL 769.34, as interpreted in <em>People v Babcock, </em>469 Mich 247; 666 NW2d 231 (2003):</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">MCL 769.34(3) permits a court to \u201cdepart from the appropriate sentence range established under the sentencing guidelines ... if the court has a substantial and compelling reason for that departure and states on the record the reasons for departure.\u201d <em>Babcock </em>defines a \u201csubstantial and compelling\u201d reason as requiring an objective and verifiable reason that \u201ckeenly\u201d or \u201cirresistibly\u201d grabs the court\u2019s attention and is of \u201cconsiderable worth.\u201d Moreover, <em>Babcock </em>requires that the \u201csubstantial and compelling\u201d reasons articulated by the trial court justify that particular departure. The Court of Appeals held that the trial court\u2019s reasons for departing from the sentencing guidelines were not substantial and compelling because they were already considered when scoring the prior record variables and offense variables.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">C. APPLICATION OF <em>BABCOCK </em>TO DEFENDANT\u2019S POSTPROBATION VIOLATION SENTENCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">Although the trial court considered several reasons for its upward departure, it did not sufficiently articu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>late its reasons on the record, because it believed that <em>Babcock </em>did not apply to sentences imposed after revocation of probation. Some of the trial court\u2019s reasons were already considered in scoring the prior record variables and offense variables.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Some of the trial court\u2019s reasons, however, were not considered in connection with the prior record variables and offense variables, such as defendant\u2019s intent to explode the Molotov cocktail in order to harm his sister. Further, the trial court did not consider the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s probation violation-defendant\u2019s possession of a shotgun while walking down the street near his sister\u2019s home-in scoring the variables.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The Court of Appeals erroneously implied that all of defendant\u2019s conduct noted by the trial court was considered in scoring the prior record variables and offense variables. Because of this erroneous conclusion and because the trial court did not apply the legislative sentencing guidelines in imposing defendant\u2019s sentence, we remand this case to the trial court for resentencing. Upon resentencing, the trial court may consider whether the conduct underlying defendant\u2019s probation violation constitutes a substantial and compelling reason to depart from the legislative sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The legislative sentencing guidelines apply to sentences imposed after probation revocation. Thus, defendant is entitled to be resentenced under the legislative sentencing guidelines. Further, a defendant\u2019s conduct while on probation can be considered as a substantial and compelling reason for departure from the legislative sentencing guidelines. Defendant\u2019s sentence is thus vacated and this matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b727-6\">Taylor, C.J., and Cavanagh, Weaver, Kelly, Young, and MARKMAN, JJ., concurred with' CORRIGAN, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-9\"> 261 Mich App 673; 683 NW2d 218 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-10\"> 468 Mich 918 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b721-11\"> 471 Mich 914 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b722-10\"> MCL 769.34(2) provides, in relevant part, that \u201cthe minimum sentence imposed by a court of this state for a felony enumerated in part 2 of chapter XVII committed on or after January 1,1999 shall be within the appropriate sentence range under the version of those sentencing guidelines in effect on the date the crime was committed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b722-11\"> The judicially created sentencing guidelines, however, do not apply to probation revocation cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b724-7\"> MCL 771.7(1), which deals with revocation of probation for a juvenile following certain convictions, specifically requires a trial court to \u201corder the juvenile committed to the department of corrections for a term of years that <em>does not exceed </em>the penalty that could have been imposed for the offense for which the juvenile was originally convicted and placed on probation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

MCL 769.34(3)(b). The trial court did not believe the legislative sentencing guidelines applied to sentences imposed after revocation of probation and, thus, did not deem it necessary to state that the above factors were given inadequate weight. To the extent that the trial court failed to apply the guidelines when imposing defendant\u2019s sentence, it erred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
