Defendant Head Start agency contends that the act does not create a private cause of action to enforce its provisions. We hold that the Head Start Act does not contemplate a private cause of action seeking disclosure of the contested bid documents under \u00a7 9839(a). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and enter judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Defendant, Baraga-Houghton-Keweenaw Child Development Board, Inc., is a private, nonprofit organization that is designated as a Head Start<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> agency under 42 USC 9836(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant operates Head Start programs in Baraga, Houghton, and Keweenaw counties. In January 2001, defendant solicited bids for office supplies and furniture. Plaintiff, a private, for-profit corporation, submitted a bid. Defendant conducted an open meeting at which its building committee reviewed the bids and made a recommendation to its board of directors. Defendant accepted the lowest bid at the open meeting. Rodney Liimatainen, defendant\u2019s executive director, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>notified plaintiffs branch manager, Jack Hamm, that plaintiffs bid had exceededthe lowest bid by $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Hamm, suspicious that the lower bidders had offered lesser-quality merchandise, requested copies of all the bids submitted. Liimatainen informed Hamm that the details of the bids were unavailable for inspection by the public because the other bidders did not want the information disseminated. Liimatainen acknowledged, however, that there might be small discrepancies in quality, manufacturer, and type of product among the bids submitted. In an attempt to compel defendant to disclose copies of the bids, Hamm then submitted written requests to defendant under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant refused the requests on the basis that it was a private corporation that was not subject to the FOIA. Plaintiff also requested copies of the submitted bids from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the federal agency responsible for administering the Head Start Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In April 2001, plaintiff filed an action under the FOIA<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> demanding a complete copy of each bid. Plaintiff later filed an amended complaint alleging that it was additionally entitled to disclosure of the bid information under unspecified \u201cfederal legislation which requires disclosure of information by parties supplying service under the so-called Head Start Program.\u201d In subsequent motion papers, plaintiff indicated that the federal legislation on which it relied was 42 USC 9839(a), which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Each [Head Start] agency shall also provide for reasonable public access to information, including public hearings at the request of appropriate community groups and reasonable public access to books and records of the agency or other agencies engaged in program activities or operations involving the use of authority or funds for which it is responsible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">After the commencement of the litigation, various HHS officials issued memoranda indicating that defendant was not required under the FOIA or the Head Start Act to provide plaintiff with access to the bid information. In a letter to defendant, a program officer in the Chicago regional office of the HHS advised defendant that Head Start grantees are not subject to the FOIA provisions. The program officer further noted that, under \u00a7 9839(a) and its corresponding HHS regulation, 45 CFR 1301.30,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> defendant was not required to disclose specific information regarding the selection of a supplier; rather, it was required only to disclose general information such as copies of its written procurement procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Similarly, in a letter to plaintiffs counsel, the director of the HHS Office of Public Affairs, FOI/Privacy Acts Division, stated that the FOIA did not apply to defendant; however, the director noted that defendant had provided plaintiff with a copy of the policy it followed in conducting its procurement activities and with background documents addressing its source of funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The director also wrote a letter advising defense counsel that defendant was not subject to the requirements of the federal Freedom of Information Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The director further advised counsel that defendant was bound by any provisions incorporated into the grant language regarding its obligations to make information concerning its activities available to the public, but that defendant had already complied with those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Finally, in a letter written to Congressman Bart Stupak, who had apparently come to plaintiffs aid in seeking the bid documents, the director of the HHS Office of Family and Child Development stated that defendant had reasonably complied with the requirements of \u00a7 9839 and 45 CFR 1301.30 by providing plaintiff with a copy of its procurement procedures, and that defendant was under no further obligation to provide documents with specific commercial information it received through the competitive bid process.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Citing these HHS memoranda, defendant moved for summary disposition, arguing that it was not subject to the Michigan FOIA or the federal FOIA and that defendant had exceeded any obligation it had to supply plaintiff with information under 42 USC 9839(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition to the extent that plaintiff sought relief under the Michigan FOIA and the federal FOIA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court, however, sua sponte granted summary disposition in favor of plaintiff under MCR 2.116(I)(2) on the ground that the requested information was subject to disclosure under \u00a7 9839(a). The court, observing that \u00a7 9839(a) required that a Head Start agency grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u201creasonable public access\u201d to its books and records, opined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">[a] demand that information be provided outside of working hours would not be reasonable. A demand that an agency exhaustively search for something that the requesting party cannot properly identify would not be reasonable. As recognized by the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, it would likely not be reasonable to expect an agency to create a record, such as a compilation or summary, when no such record exists. And it may well not be reasonable to demand that an employee\u2019s personnel file or disciplinary record be disclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">In the present situation, a denial by the Plaintiff [sic] of a written request to review specified, existing and readily accessible written bids is certainly not compliant with a requirement of providing reasonable public access. That would be true regardless of who made the request, but the case is even more compelling when the requesting party has a genuine, identifiable reason for the information sought, as did the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">In summary, Defendant\u2019s denial of Plaintiffs request to review and obtain copies of the bids in question was in violation of the Federal requirement that Plaintiff [sic] provide for reasonable public access to information, including reasonable public access to books and records of the agency, involving the use of funds for which the Plaintiff [sic] is responsible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Noting that the state courts shared concurrent jurisdiction to decide a case involving the Head Start Act because the act did not provide for exclusive federal jurisdiction,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the panel rejected the reasoning of federal case law holding that the Head Start Act does not provide a private cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The panel, citing <em>Long v Chelsea Community Hosp, </em>219 Mich App 578; 557 NW2d 157 (1996), and <em>Forster v Delton School Dist, </em>176 Mich App 582, 585; 440 NW2d 421 (1989), held that a private cause of action could be <em>inferred </em>under \u00a7 9839(a) because the statute did not provide adequate means to enforce its provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">The statute in question, 42 USC 9839(a), requires Head Start agencies to provide reasonable public access to their books and records, but it does not provide any means of enforcing this specific provision. Although the Head Start Act requires agencies to open their books and records to the department secretary or the United States Comptroller General for audit and examination, 42 USC 9842, Congress specifically provided for public access to the books and records, not simply to the audits prepared by these other entities. Therefore, we conclude an implied private cause of action exists.<footnotemark>[12]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArQ\">The panel concluded that the trial court did not err in granting summary disposition for plaintiff because defendant had not complied with the \u201creasonable public access\u201d requirement of \u00a7 9839(a). The panel, noting that defendant had failed to suggest why it would be <em>unreasonable </em>to disclose the requested information, held that because the information was readily available and could be produced on short notice, it was covered by the statutory directive to provide \u201creasonable public access.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The panel rejected defendant\u2019s contention that the bidders did not have notice that the bids would be disclosed, stating that the statute itself provided that notice; the panel also rejected defendant\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>that public policy dictated against interpreting the statute to require disclosure of the bids.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Finally, the panel held that it was not required to defer to the interpretation of \u00a7 9839(a) set forth in the letters written by HHS officials, opining that only a ruling from the \u201cupper echelon\u201d of the HHS would be entitled to deference and that, in any event, the officials\u2019 interpretation was clearly wrong.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because we conclude that \u00a7 9839(a) does not provide for a private cause of action, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and enter judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">This case presents issues of statutory construction and other questions of law. Such questions are subject to review de novo by this Court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Similarly, we review a trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition de novo.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AfP\">A. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">The Head Start Act was enacted for the purpose of \u201cpromoting] school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of low-income children through the provision, to low-income children and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>families, of health, educational, nutritional, social, and other services that are determined, based on family needs assessments, to be necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The secretary of the HHS is authorized under 42 USC 9836(a) to designate as a Head Start agency \u201cany local public or private nonprofit or for-profit agency.. . .\u201d The act further authorizes the secretary to provide financial assistance or grants to Head Start agencies for the operation of Head Start programs.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Under 42 USC 9836a, the secretary is directed to establish by regulation standards applicable to Head Start agencies, including performance standards, administrative and financial management standards, and standards relating to the conditions and location of agency facilities. The secretary has promulgated regulations implementing these statutory directives.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The secretary is directed under 42 USC 9836a(c) and (d) to monitor Head Start agencies for compliance with statutory and regulatory standards and to take corrective action if necessary. If an agency does not comply with such standards, the secretary may initiate proceedings to terminate the designation of the agency unless the agency corrects the deficiency.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">At issue in this case is \u00a7 9839(a) of the act, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">Each Head Start agency shall observe standards of organization, management, and administration which will assure, so far as reasonably possible, that all program activities are conducted in a manner consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>purposes of this subchapter [42 USC 9831 <em>et seq.\\ </em>and the objective of providing assistance effectively, efficiently, and free of any taint of partisan political bias or personal or family favoritism. Each such agency shall establish or adopt rules to carry out this section, which shall include rules to assure full staff accountability in matters governed by law, regulations, or agency policy. <em>Each agency shall also provide for reasonable public access to information, including public hearings at the request of appropriate community groups and reasonable public access to books and records of the agency or other agencies engaged in program activities or operations involving the use of authority or funds for which it is responsible. </em>Each such agency shall adopt for itself and other agencies using funds or exercising authority for which it is responsible, rules designed to (1) establish specific standards governing salaries, salary increases, travel and per diem allowances, and other employee benefits; (2) assure that only persons capable of discharging their duties with competence and integrity are employed and that employees are promoted or advanced under impartial procedures calculated to improve agency performance and effectiveness; (3) guard against personal or financial conflicts of interest; and (4) define employee duties in an appropriate manner which will in any case preclude employees from participating, in connection with the performance of their duties, in any form of picketing, protest, or other direct action which is in violation of law. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Similarly, Head Start regulation 45 CFR 1301.30 provides that \u201c[e]ach agency shall also provide reasonable public access to information and to the agency\u2019s records pertaining to the Head Start program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The lower courts concluded that defendant was required under the \u201creasonable public access\u201d provision of \u00a7 9839(a) to disclose copies of all bids it received in connection with its January 2001 solicitation of bids for office supplies and furniture. In considering the propriety of the lower courts\u2019 rulings, we must first determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>whether the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim under \u00a7 9839(a). Next, we must examine whether \u00a7 9839(a) allows for plaintiffs private cause of action to enforce the disclosure provision. Although we conclude that the state courts have jurisdiction over this action, we hold that \u00a7 9839(a) does not provide for a private cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">B. CONCURRENT JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Defendant first argues that the state courts lack jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim under the federal Head Start Act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We disagree and hold that the state courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>courts to entertain plaintiffs action seeking relief under \u00a7 9839(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>It has long been established that, so long as Congress has not provided for exclusive federal-court jurisdiction, state courts may exercise subject-matter jurisdiction over federal-law claims \u201c \u2018whenever, by their own constitution, they are competent to take it.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> State courts possess sovereignty concurrent with that of the federal government, \u201csubject only to limitations imposed by the Supremacy Clause.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, state courts are presumptively competent to assume jurisdiction over a cause of action arising under federal law.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> If concurrent jurisdiction otherwise exists, subject-matter jurisdiction over a federal-law claim is governed by state law.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In determining whether our state courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction over a claim brought under federal law, it is necessary to determine whether Congress intended to limit jurisdiction to the federal courts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\u201cIn considering the propriety of state-court jurisdiction over any particular federal claim, the Court begins with the presumption that state courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction. Congress, however, may confine jurisdiction to the federal courts either explicitly or implicitly. Thus, the presumption of concurrent jurisdiction can be rebutted by an explicit statutory directive, by unmistakable implication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>from legislative history, or by a clear incompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and federal interests.\u201d<footnotemark>[28]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Defendant does not present a coherent argument that the courts of this state lack jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 dispute concerning the disclosure of documents under \u00a7 9839(a). Rather, defendant simply contends that the \u201cexpansive regulatory scheme\u201d of the Head Start Act \u201cevidences Congressional intent that the HHS exercise its sole discretion over its administration of local Head-Start agencies through its regulations.\u201d Defendant has conflated the vesting of discretion in federal agencies with the vesting of jurisdiction in the federal courts: That a particular agency has discretion to administer a federal statute and to implement regulations for the enforcement of the statute does not address whether state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over a dispute arising under that statute. Instead, our inquiry is limited to whether Congress intended to limit to federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over such a dispute and, if not, whether state law allows our courts to exercise subject-matter jurisdiction over the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Defendant concedes that nothing in the Head Start Act explicitly confines jurisdiction to the federal courts, and defendant does not point to any statutory indication that Congress intended that jurisdiction over a dispute under the Head Start Act should lie solely in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>federal courts. We have been unable to locate anything in the legislative history of the act demonstrating an intent to grant exclusive federal-court jurisdiction, and defendant has certainly failed to bring any such information to our attention. Moreover, there is no \u201cclear incompatibility\u201d between state-court jurisdiction and federal interests with respect to application of the Head Start Act, particularly with respect to a straightforward question of statutory construction such as the one presented in this case. Indeed, as noted in <em>Gulf Offshore Co v Mobil Oil Corp, </em>453 US 473, 478 n 4; 101 S Ct 2870; 69 L Ed 2d 784 (1981), \u201c[p]ermitting state courts to entertain federal causes of action facilitates the enforcement of federal rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Congress has done nothing in the exercise of its powers under the Supremacy Clause to \u201caffirmatively divest state courts of their presumptively concurrent jurisdiction\u201d over claims brought under the Head Start Act.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Additionally, it is clear that the courts of this state have subject-matter jurisdiction over the dispute at issue, because our Constitution provides that the circuit courts of this state have original jurisdiction \u201cin all matters not prohibited by law... .\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the courts of this state have properly exercised concurrent jurisdiction over plaintiffs \u00a7 9839(a) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">C. PRIVATE CAUSE OF ACTION TO ENFORCE \u00a7 9839(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Defendant next contends that plaintiffs claim fails because \u00a7 9839(a) does not provide for a private cause of action to enforce the public access requirement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>1. WHETHER A CAUSE OF ACTION EXISTS IS SOLELY A MATTER OF STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">\u201c \u2018[T]he fact that a federal statute has been violated and some person harmed does not automatically give rise to a private cause of action in favor of that person.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Rather, \u201c[l]ike substantive federal law itself, private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Thus, in determining whether plaintiff may bring a private cause of action to enforce the public access requirement of \u00a7 9839(a), we must determine whether Congress intended to create such a cause of action.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Because the Head Start Act does not evidence an intent to create a private remedy for an alleged violation of \u00a7 9839(a), plaintiffs action must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Although the United States Supreme Court in the last century embraced a short-lived willingness to create remedies to enforce private rights,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u201cabandoned\u201d that approach to statutory remedies in <em>Cort v Ash</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and \u201c[has] not returned to it since.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In <em>Cort, </em>the Court set forth a test for determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute that does not expressly provide such a remedy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">First, is the plaintiff \u201cone of the class for whose <em>especial </em>benefit the statute was enacted,\u201d . . . that is, does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? . . . Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff? ... And finally, is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law?<footnotemark>[37]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Post-Cori, the Court has become increasingly reluctant to imply a private cause of action, preferring to focus exclusively on the second <em>Cort </em>element, which requires indicia of congressional intent to create a cause of action. For example, as early as <em>Cannon v Univ of Chicago </em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>although the Court applied each of the <em>Cort </em>factors, it characterized the determination whether a private remedy existed to enforce a statutory right as a matter of \u201cstatutory construction.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In <em>Touche Ross &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Co,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> the Court declined to even address the remaining <em>Cort </em>factors where it was clear that Congress did not intend to create a private cause of action to enforce \u00a7 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934:<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">It is true that in <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>the Court set forth four factors that it considered \u201crelevant\u201d in determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one. But the Court did not decide that each of these factors is entitled to equal weight. The central inquiry remains whether Congress intended to create, either expressly or by implication, a private cause of action. Indeed, the first three factors discussed in <em>Cort </em>\u2014 the language and focus of the statute, its legislative history, and its purpose, see 422 U.S. at 78 \u2014 are ones traditionally relied upon in determining legislative intent. Here, the statute by its terms grants no private rights to any identifiable class and proscribes no conduct as unlawful. And the parties as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>well as the Court of Appeals agree that the legislative history of the 1934 Act simply does not speak to the issue of private remedies under \u00a7 17 (a). At least in such a case as this, the inquiry ends there: The question whether Congress, either expressly or by implication, intended to create a private right of action, has been definitely answered in the negative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Similarly, in <em>California v Sierra </em>Club,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> the Court, noting that \u201cthe focus of the inquiry is on whether Congress intended to create a remedy,\u201d concluded that consideration of the first two <em>Cort </em>factors was dispositive. Because there was no indication that Congress intended to create a private remedy to enforce \u00a7 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> the Court held that it was unnecessary to inquire further into the remaining factors, because \u201c[t]hese factors are only of relevance if the first two factors give indication of congressional intent to create the remedy.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In <em>Alexander, </em>the Court appears to have abandoned the <em>Cort </em>inquiry altogether in favor of a completely textual analysis in determining whether a private remedy exists under a particular statute. Rather than applying the <em>Cort </em>factors, the <em>Alexander </em>Court concluded, solely on the basis of the text of 42 USC 2000d-l, that private individuals could not sue to enforce disparate-impact regulations promulgated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>rejected the plaintiffs argument that dispositive weight could be accorded to context shorn of text, holding that \u201clegal context matters only to the extent it clarifies text.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The <em>Alexander </em>majority additionally rejected the dissent\u2019s claim that the position adopted \u201c \u2018blind[ed] itself to important evidence of congressional intent,\u2019 \u201d noting that the methodology employed in the majority opinion was well established in earlier decisions that explained \u201cthat the interpretive inquiry begins with the text and structure of the statute ... and ends once it has become clear that Congress did not provide a cause of action.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">2. THE HEAD START ACT DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR A PRIVATE CAUSE OF ACTION</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">With the aforementioned principles in mind, we examine the text of the Head Start Act to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>whether it provides for a private cause of action to enforce \u00a7 9839(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">To date, two federal district courts have considered whether causes of action existed under different provisions of the Head Start Act. Although our Court of Appeals cited these cases, it rejected their analyses without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In <em>Hodder, supra, </em>the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York applied the <em>Cort </em>factors and concluded that the plaintiffs, former employees of a Head Start agency, could not bring a cause of action for wrongful discharge under the Head Start Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">Turning to the first <em>[Cort\\ </em>factor, plaintiffs are far-removed from the class for whose special benefit Congress enacted the Head Start Act. The purpose of this Act is to authorize the appropriation of funds for Project Head Start\u2019s \u201ceffective delivery of comprehensive health, educational, nutritional, social and other services to economically disadvantaged children and their families.\u201d 42 USC \u00a7 9831(a). Hence, the class for whose special benefit Congress passed the Head Start Act is the class of economically disadvantaged children and their families who need the specified services, which do not under any reasonable interpretation of the Act include employment services. Indeed, a Head Start agency would likely violate the Act if it employed the parent of [a] Head Start child. See 42 USC \u00a7 9839(a)(3). Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that \u201cemployees of Head Start agencies ... are members of a class which is specially addressed are protected by the Act and regulations\u201d is legally unsupported and legally unsupportable.... Congress plainly did not enact the Head Start Act in order to benefit Head Start employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">As to the second Cort factor, the Court has found no indication that Congress intended the Act or its interpretive regulations to create a private right of action for employees who are terminated from Head Start agencies in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>a manner allegedly inconsistent with those rules. Plaintiffs admit that the Act lacks any explicit indication that Congress intended to create a cause of action for these employees, but argue that \u00a7 9849(b) of the Act \u201cspecifically negates any intent to deny such a cause of action.\u201d . .. Section 9849(b) concerns the application of the Civil Rights Act to any sexual discrimination that may occur in connection with Head Start programs or activities. The last sentence states that the section \u201cshall not be construed as affecting any other legal remedy that a person may have if such person is . .. denied employment in connection with[] any [Head Start] program, project, or activity ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">At best, this sentence reveals a congressional unwillingness to interfere with any of the state and federal remedies that may be available to people who are denied jobs at Head Start agencies; it certainly does not reveal a congressional intent to create a private right of action under the Head Start Act for people who are fired from Head Start agencies. As plaintiffs surely realize, if courts inferred from Congress\u2019 failure to prohibit a private cause of action the congressional intent to create a private cause of action, courts would read into almost every federal statute an implied right of action. In the majority of instances, this curious interpretive method would undermine congressional intent rather than effectuate it. It also runs counter to the Supreme Court\u2019s demonstrated reluctance to infer private causes of action from federal statutes.. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">Plaintiffs fare no better under the third Cort factor because implying a private right of action from the Head Start Act would do little or nothing to further the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">We now come to the fourth Cort factor. Plaintiffs cast their claim as one \u201cbased on employee discharge in violation of federal policies For purposes of determining the existence of subject matter jurisdiction, however, the Court considers the true nature of plaintiffs\u2019 action.. .. Although plaintiffs carefully avoid the phrase in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>complaint, the essence of their claim is breach of an employment contract. Actions of this kind are traditionally relegated to state law. Thus the fourth Cort factor, along with the first three, strongly support the conclusion that the Head Start Act does not contain an implied private right of action for people who are terminated from Head Start agencies.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Similarly, in <em>Johnson, supra, </em>the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had mismanaged a Head Start program in violation of federal regulations. The District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia held that Congress did not intend to provide a private cause of action to enforce the federal regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">In this case, the applicable statutory scheme is set forth pursuant to the Head Start Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9831-9852a. Under the scheme, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services is directed to \u201cestablish by regulation standards applicable to Head Start agencies, programs, and projects under this subchapter,\u201d including \u201cminimum levels of overall accomplishment that a Head Start agency shall achieve.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9836a(a)(l) &amp; (2). The Secretary is also directed under this section to monitor the performance of every Head Start program and to take appropriate corrective action when a program fails to meet the performance standards established by the regulations. Specifically, the Act requires a full review of each grantee at least once during each three-year period, review of new grantees after the completion of the first year, follow up reviews and return visits to grantees that fail to meet the standards, and \u201cother reviews as appropriate.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9836a(c). If the Secretary determines, on the basis of such a review, that a grantee fails to meet the standards described in \u00a7 9836a(a), the Secretary shall, <em>inter alia, </em>institute proceedings to terminate the Head Start grant unless the agency corrects the deficiency. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9836a(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>All but three of the regulations cited in plaintiffs Second Amended Complaint were promulgated pursuant to the Head Start Act. See 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1304.1. There is no provision in the Head Start Act, however, permitting a private citizen to enforce its provisions. Based on the alternative specific remedies mentioned above, Congress\u2019 intent is clear. The remedy for substandard performance by a Head Start program is an enforcement action by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, not by private litigants. For these reasons, the Court dismisses with prejudice plaintiffs claims alleging violations of statutory and regulatory provisions relating to the Head Start Act, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>[48]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">We find <em>Hodder </em>and <em>Johnson </em>to be persuasive and similarly conclude, on the basis of the text and structure of the Head Start Act, that no private cause of action exists to enforce \u00a7 9839(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The act, of course, does not expressly provide for a private cause of action to enforce the disclosure requirement of \u00a7 9839(a). Thus, the question becomes whether the text of the act demonstrates an <em>implicit </em>intent to provide for a private cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Again, the stated purpose of the act is to promote school readiness by providing services to low-income children and their families. 42 USC 9831. The act does not contemplate any benefit to private corporations such as plaintiff; nor does it indicate any intent that such a private corporation may sue to enforce its provisions. Where the intended beneficiaries are specifically identified, we are loath to create a private means of seeking redress under the act for nonbeneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">More important, the act contains a comprehensive mechanism for ensuring agency compliance with its provisions. We agree with the <em>Johnson </em>court that, far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>from demonstrating an intent to allow for a private cause of action, the act indicates that the <em>sole </em>remedy for a violation of \u00a7 9839(a) is an enforcement proceeding by the secretary of the HHS and the possible termination of Head Start agency status. See 42 USC 9836a.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In light of this clear indication of congressional intent, we are precluded from venturing beyond the bounds of the statutory text to divine support for the creation of a private claim to enforce \u00a7 9839(a). To do so would be to substitute our own judgment for that of Congress and thus to usurp legislative authority, something that we of course decline to do.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\"><em>XV. </em>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Because the Head Start Act does not provide for a private cause of action to enforce the disclosure requirement of \u00a7 9839(a), plaintiff has failed to state a cognizable claim. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and enter judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b667-8\">Taylor, C.J., and Corrigan and Markman, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-14\"> 42 USC 9831 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\"> See section 111(A) of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\"> 42 USC 9836(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">The Secretary [of Health and Human Services] is authorized to designate as a Head Start agency any local public or private nonprofit or for-profit agency, within a community, which (1) has the power and authority to carry out the purposes of this subchapter [42 USC 9831 <em>et seq.~\\ </em>and perform the functions set forth in section 642 [42 USC 9837] within a community; and (2) is determined by the Secretary (in consultation with the chief executive officer of the State involved, if such State expends non-Federal funds to carry out Head Start programs) to be capable of planning, conducting, administering, and evaluating, either directly or by other arrangements, a Head Start program.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b645-6\"> MCL 15.231 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\"> Although the trial court treated plaintiff\u2019s complaint as if it contained a claim under the federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC 551 <em>et seq., </em>the parties agree that plaintiffs claim was based solely on the Michigan FOIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\"> 45 CFR 1301.30 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">Head Start agencies and delegate agencies shall conduct the Head Start program in an effective and efficient manner, free of political bias or family favoritism. <em>Each agency shall also provide reasonable public access to information and to the agency\u2019s records pertaining to the Head Start program. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\"> 5 USC 551 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b647-9\"> See note 5.

These concepts are not, in fact, jurisdictional in nature. See, e.g., <em>Northwest Airlines, Inc v Kent Co, Michigan, </em>510 US 355, 365; 114 S Ct 855; 127 L Ed 2d 183 (1994) (\u201cThe question whether a federal statute creates a claim for relief is not jurisdictional.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">In light of our determination that the Head Start Act, in the first instance, does not provide for a private cause of action to enforce the public access requirement of \u00a7 9839(a), it is unnecessary to address defendant\u2019s assertion that primary jurisdiction over this cause of action lies with the HHS, see <em>Travelers Ins Co v Detroit Edison Co, </em>465 Mich 185; 631 NW2d 733 (2001), and its related argument that plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing this state-court action. However, we note that this case presents a straightforward issue of statutory construction involving the meaning of the simple phrase \u201creasonable public access.\u201d The interpretation of this particular statutory language does not require knowledge of sophisticated or technical terms or the exercise of expert judgment or discretion. Because the \u201creasonable public access\u201d provision presents a matter that the judiciary is particularly competent to address, rather than a matter within the \u201cspecialized and expert knowledge\u201d of the HHS, see <em>id. </em>at 198, primary jurisdiction does not lie with that agency. Moreover, there are no \u201cprescribed administrative remedies\u201d that plaintiff has failed to exhaust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>before seeking relief under \u00a7 9839(a) from the courts. <em>McCarthy v Madigan, </em>503 US 140, 144-145; 112 S Ct 1081; 117 L Ed 2d 291 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Defendant\u2019s somewhat cryptic assertion that the state courts are required to give deference to the HHS\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 9839(a) warrants additional comment. Citing the <em>\u201cChevron </em>doctrine,\u201d see <em>Chevron USA Inc v Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc, </em>467 US 837; 104 S Ct 2778; 81 L Ed 2d 694 (1984), defendant argues that the state courts are required to give deference to the determinations of HHS officials regarding the disclosure required under the act and that the state courts therefore lack jurisdiction over this action. Again, defendant is conflating two discrete doctrines. The concept of <em>Chevron </em>deference is not jurisdictional; rather, it is a doctrine that is in the nature of a <em>standard of review, </em>applied by the judiciary in reviewing an agency\u2019s reasonable construction of an ambiguous statute, which recognizes that any necessary policy determinations in interpreting a federal statute are more properly left to the agency responsible for administering the particular statute. See <em>Yellow Transportation, Inc v Michigan, </em>537 US 36, 47-48; 123 S Ct 371; 154 L Ed 2d 377 (2002); <em>United States v Mead Corp, </em>533 US 218, 227-228; 121 S Ct 2164; 150 L Ed 2d 292 (2001), quoting <em>Chevron, supra </em>at 844 (\u201c \u2018considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department\u2019s construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Again, because we have determined that there is no private cause of action to enforce the disclosure requirement of the Head Start Act, we need not address whether the state courts are required, under <em>Chevron </em>and <em>Mead, supra, </em>to accord deference to the letters authored by these HHS officials. However, we note in passing that these letters presumably lack the \u201cforce of law\u201d that is generally required for application of Chevron-type deference.

Similarly, the dissent notes that the <em>Alexander </em>Court found it quite telling that the statute at issue expressly empowered governmental agencies to enforce regulations.

Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one?... Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff? .. . And finally, is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law?<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Unlike <em>Cort\u2019s </em>focus on whether a cause of action can be inferred from a statute, <em>Alexander </em>involved a distinct issue: whether a private cause of action could be inferred from a regulation that forbids conduct beyond that which was forbidden by the statute under which the regulation was promulgated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Because the conduct at issue in <em>Alexander </em>was prohibited by a regulation, but not by the statute pursuant to which the regulation was adopted, <em>Alexander </em>held that a cause of action alleging conduct in violation of the regulation could not be inferred from the statute. Given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>this situation, it was unnecessary for <em>Alexander </em>to delve deeply into the <em>Cort </em>factors to resolve whether a cause of action could be inferred from the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Though the majority may prefer that <em>Cort\u2019s </em>factors be abandoned and a \u201ccompletely textual\u201d approach be adopted, neither logic nor federal precedent supports its preference. First, it is absurd to advocate a \u201ccompletely textual approach\u201d where the need to examine whether a cause of action may be inferred from a statute is engendered by the <em>lack </em>of an expressly stated cause of action in the text of the statute. Further, the majority makes no attempt to explain how its \u201ccompletely textual\u201d approach differs from the <em>Cort </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Second, while the majority correctly notes that not every federal case involving whether a private cause of action may be inferred from a statute has applied all the four <em>Cort </em>factors, it is an overstatement to suggest that the federal courts have \u201cabandoned the <em>Cort </em>inquiry altogether.\u201d Even federal cases relied on by the majority employ a Cori-based analysis. For example in <em>Hodder v Schoharie Co Child Dev Council, Inc, </em>1995 US Dist LEXIS 19049, *10 (ND NY, 1995), the court premised its analysis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">The Court may infer a private right of action from a federal statute that does not expressly create one only if the statute\u2019s language, structure, and legislative history reveal Congress\u2019 intent to create a private right of action. See <em>Thompson v. Thompson, </em>484 U.S. 174, 179, 98 L. Ed. 2d 512, 108 S. Ct. 513 (1988); <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, </em>442 U.S. 560, 61 L. Ed. 2d 82, 99 S. Ct. 2479 (1979); <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 45 L. Ed. 2d 26, 95 S. Ct. 2080 (1975). Courts normally try to divine Congressional intent by applying the four Cort factors: 1) whether plaintiffs belong to the class for whose special benefit Congress passed the statute; 2) whether the indicia of legislative intent reveal a congressional purpose to provide a private cause of action; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>3) whether implying a private cause of action is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme; and 4) whether the plaintiffs cause of action concerns a subject that is traditionally relegated to state law. <em>Merrell Dow [Pharmaceuticals Inc v </em>Thompson], 478 U.S. [804, 810-811; 106 S Ct 3229; 92 L Ed 2d 650 (1986)]; Cort, 422 U.S. at 78.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\"><em>Hodder </em>applied each factor from <em>Cort </em>to the provision of the Head Start Act at issue in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">That the majority misunderstands <em>Alexander\u2019s </em>effect is underscored by a recent United States Supreme Court decision, <em>Jackson v Birmingham Bd of Ed, </em>544 US_,_; 125 S Ct 1497, 1506; 161 L Ed 2d 361, 373 (2005), where the Court emphasized that <em>Alexander\u2019s </em>holding is simply premised on the fact that the regulations at issue in <em>Alexander </em>extended protection beyond the limits of the statute at issue in <em>Alexander. </em>Describing the holding of <em>Alexander, Jackson </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">[In Alexander] we rejected the contention that the private right of action to enforce intentional violations of Title VI encompassed suits to enforce the disparate-impact regulations. We did so because \u201cit is clear... that the disparate-impact regulations do not simply apply \u00a7 601 \u2014 since they indeed forbid conduct that \u00a7 601 permits \u2014 and therefore clear that the private right of action to enforce \u00a7 601 does not include a private right to enforce these regulations.\u201d [Alexander] at 285, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517, 121 S. Ct. 1511. See also <em>Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., </em>511 U.S. 164, 173, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119, 114 S. Ct. 1439 (1994) (A \u201cprivate plaintiff may not bring a [suit based on a regulation] against a defendant for acts not prohibited by the text of [the statute]\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">In this case we must necessarily look beyond the text of the statute at issue to discern whether Congress intended that a private person be able to seek disclosure of documents from a Head Start agency. The text of the statute at issue in this case, 42 USC 9839(a), does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>expressly create a private cause of action to enforce its provision regarding public access to information. Thus, it is necessary to look beyond the text to determine whether Congress intended to create a private cause of action. As recognized in <em>California v Sierra Club, </em>451 US 287, 293; 101 S Ct 1775; 68 L Ed 2d 101 (1981), the four <em>Cort </em>factors</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">present the relevant inquiries to pursue in answering the recurring question of implied causes of action. Cases subsequent to <em>Cort </em>have explained that the ultimate issue is whether Congress intended to create a private right of action ... but the four factors specified in <em>Cort </em>remain the \u201ccriteria through which this intent could be discerned.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Given the task at hand and the federal precedent by which we are bound, it is absurd to suggest that we must employ a \u201ccompletely textual\u201d approach. Any inquiry into whether a private cause of action may be inferred requires consideration of the intent of Congress and <em>Cort </em>is our guide. Regardless of the majority\u2019s apparent discomfort with <em>Cort\u2019s </em>factors and inferred causes of action, we are bound by federal law and five votes have not combined in any one case in the United States Supreme Court to declare <em>Cort </em>a dead letter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-10\"> 532 US 275; 121 S Ct 1511; 149 L Ed 2d 517 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Acx\"> 422 US 66; 95 S Ct 2080; 45 L Ed 2d 26 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[3]\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\">3 <em>Cort, supra </em>at 78.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\"> <em>Alexander </em>involved an interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which provides in \u00a7 601 that no person shall, \u201con the ground of race, color, or national origin, he excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\u201d covered by Title VI. 42 USC 2000d.

I agree with the majority that our state courts have jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim under the federal Head Start Act, 42 USC 9831 <em>et seq. </em>However, I disagree with its conclusion that the act, at 42 USC 9839(a), does not provide a private cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>action. The statutory language, the focus of the legislation, its history, and its purpose imply a congressional intent to allow private actions. Therefore, I would find such a right and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">DEFENDANT\u2019S VARIOUS JURISDICTIONAL CHALLENGES</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Defendant raises a variety of jurisdictional arguments on appeal. It claims that primary jurisdiction must rest with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) because, otherwise, an \u201cimbalance\u201d would be created in the administration of the Head Start Act. This Court explained the doctrine of primary jurisdiction in <em>Travelers Ins Co v Detroit Edison Co, </em>465 Mich 185; 631 NW2d 733 (2001). It is based on the principle of separation of powers and is concerned with the respect appropriately shown to an agency\u2019s decisions made in the performance of regulatory duties. <em>Id. </em>at 196-197.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The primary jurisdiction doctrine underscores the notion that administrative agencies possess specialized and expert knowledge to address the matters they regulate. <em>Id. </em>at 198. The question of primary jurisdiction arises only with respect to matters that Congress has assigned to a governmental agency or administrative body. <em>Attorney General v Diamond Mortgage Co, </em>414 Mich 603, 613; 327 NW2d 805 (1982). This case does not concern such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Moreover, resolution of this case does not require specialized knowledge. Instead, it involves a straightforward question of statutory interpretation. This Court is well equipped to handle such questions because they do not require specialized or expert knowledge outside the scope of our general jurisdiction. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the primary jurisdiction doctrine simply does not apply to this case. <em>Id.) Travelers, supra </em>at 198-199.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Defendant complains that, under the Chevron<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine, the meaning that HHS has given to \u201creasonable public access\u201d in various letters interpreting 42 USC 9839(a) should be definitive. <em>Chevron </em>directs that considerable weight be accorded an agency\u2019s construction of a statutory scheme. <em>Chevron, supra </em>at 844. But this applies only when the decision involves reconciling conflicting policies and requires more than ordinary knowledge of matters that the agency regulates. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">This case does not demand a detailed knowledge of the subject matter of the Head Start Act. Nor does it concern a complicated matter of interagency interaction or policy. It does not require detailed knowledge of the workings of the Head Start Act. Rather, it involves an issue of statutory construction. No special expertise being required, the <em>Chevron </em>doctrine does not apply. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Defendant also argues that we lack jurisdiction because plaintiff failed to exhaust all its administrative remedies. But the United States Supreme Court has ruled that \u201cwhere Congress has not clearly required exhaustion, sound judicial discretion governs.\u201d <em>McCarthy v Madigan, </em>503 US 140, 144; 112 S Ct 1081; 117 L Ed 2d 291 (1992). 42 USC 9839(a) contains no exhaustion requirements and is silent regarding administrative remedies. Therefore, it is within our sound discretion to hear this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Given that none of the theories that defendant relies on to challenge this Court\u2019s jurisdiction applies here, it is appropriate for us to reach the merits of the case. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>it is appropriate for us to decide whether Congress intended a private right of action in 42 USC 9839(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">WHETHER A PRIVATE CAUSE OF ACTION EXISTS REQUIRES A DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Congress can create a private right of action in two ways. It can expressly provide for the right or it can imply it. <em>Cannon v Univ of Chicago, </em>441 US 677, 717; 99 S Ct 1946; 60 L Ed 2d 560 (1979). Frequently, legislation does not clearly express whether a private right was intended. The growing volume of litigation and the complexity of federal legislation increase the need for careful scrutiny to ensure what Congress wanted. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc v Curran, </em>456 US 353, 377; 102 S Ct 1825; 72 L Ed 2d 182 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">To assist us in undertaking that scrutiny, the United States Supreme Court articulated a four-part test thirty years ago in <em>Cort v Ash, </em>422 US 66; 95 S Ct 2080; 45 L Ed 2d 26 (1975). A court makes four inquiries: (1) whether the plaintiff is a member of the class for whose benefit the legislative body enacted the statute, (2) whether there is any indication that the legislative body intended to create or deny such a right of action, (3) whether inferring the right of action is consistent with the underlying scheme of the legislation, and (4) whether the cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state law so that it would be inappropriate to base the determination solely on federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 78. The key to this inquiry is determining the legislative intent in enacting the statute. <em>Merrill Lynch, supra </em>at 377-378.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co v </em>Redington,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court opined that the first three factors of <em>Cort </em>should be given greater weight than the fourth. The opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Indeed, the first three factors discussed in <em>Cort </em>\u2014 the language and focus of the statute, its legislative history, and its purpose, see 422 U.S., at 78 \u2014 are ones traditionally relied upon in determining legislative intent. <em>[Id. </em>at 575-576.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The language of the statute in question in <em>Touche </em>Ross<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not explicitly create a private remedy. Also, the legislative history gave no indication that Congress intended one. The statute neither conferred rights on private parties nor proscribed conduct as unlawful. <em>Touche Ross, supra </em>at 569. It required that brokers keep certain documents for government inspection and focused on governmental rights of inspection. <em>Id. </em>at 569-570. Because the statute did not imply a private right of action, the Court found that none existed. <em>Id. </em>at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The majority contends that, twenty-two years after <em>Touche Ross, </em>the United States Supreme Court abandoned the <em>Cort </em>analysis and switched to a completely textual analysis in <em>Alexander v Sandoval, </em>532 US 275; 121 S Ct 1511; 149 L Ed 2d 517 (2001). I disagree. In <em>Alexander, </em>the Court followed the same reasoning as in <em>Touche Ross </em>and focused on the initial <em>Cort </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">As in <em>Touche Ross, </em>the <em>Alexander </em>Court stated that, to determine legislative intent, it was important to start with the language of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 287-288. In that case, it needed to go no further in its inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at 288. The reason was that, as in <em>Touche Ross, </em>the statute under consideration<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> indicated that Congress intended not to create a private cause of action. <em>Alexander, supra </em>at 288-289.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">That statute neither conferred rights on private parties nor proscribed conduct as unlawful. Instead, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>empowered governmental agencies to enforce regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 289. The Court concluded that, by expressly providing one method of enforcement, Congress signaled that it intended to preclude other methods.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, a full reading of <em>Alexander </em>indicates that the Court did not abandon <em>Cort. </em>Instead, <em>Alexander </em>stated that the analysis in that case need not extend beyond the first two <em>Cort </em>factors because the statute indicated that Congress did not intend a private cause of action. The <em>Cort </em>factors remain a valid and important means of discerning legislative intent. The <em>Alexander </em>decision provides no basis to conclude the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">SPECIFIC ANALYSIS OF 42 USC 9839</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Despite espousing a textualist approach, the majority never deals with the actual language of 42 USC 9839(a). Instead, it focuses on tangentially related federal district court cases and the overall purpose of the Head Start Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Let us review the actual language in question. 42 USC 9839(a) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">Each Head Start agency shall observe standards of organization, management, and administration which will assure, so far as reasonably possible, that all program activities are conducted in a manner consistent with the purposes of this subchapter [42 USC 9831 <em>et seq.] </em>and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>objective of providing assistance effectively, efficiently, and free of any taint of partisan political bias or personal or family favoritism. Each such agency shall establish or adopt rules to carry out this section, which shall include rules to assure full staff accountability in matters governed by law, regulations, or agency policy. <em>Each agency shall also provide for reasonable public access to information, including public hearings at the request of appropriate community groups and reasonable public access to books and records of the agency </em>or other agencies engaged in program activities or operations involving the use of authority or funds for which it is responsible. Each such agency shall adopt for itself and other agencies using funds or exercising authority for which it is responsible, rules designed to... (3) guard against personal or financial conflicts of interest .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">This language indicates the intent of Congress to maintain open accountability in the use of Head Start funds. It explicitly provides a right of public access. After stating that \u201c[e]ach agency shall also provide for reasonable public access to information,\u201d it spells out particulars on how to meet this requirement, including holding public meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The statute specifically confers an individual right on members of the public to conduct inspections of books and records. The opposite situation existed in both <em>Touche Ross </em>and <em>Alexander, </em>where the statutes lacked language creating such a right. They offered neither the general public nor any private individual access to anything. The oversight they called for was by governmental agencies. <em>Alexander, supra </em>at 288-289; <em>Touche Ross, supra </em>at 569-570. The majority simply misses this important distinction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>It relies on two federal district court cases, <em>Johnson v Quin Rivers Agency for Community Action, Inc, </em>128 F Supp 2d 332 (ED Va, 2001), and <em>Hodder v Schoharie Co Child Dev Council, Inc, </em>1995 US Dist LEXIS 19049 (ND NY, 1995). But <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Hodder </em>do not support the conclusion that no private cause of action exists and they are inapplicable to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Neither dealt with 42 USC 9839(a). <em>Johnson </em>concerned claims of discrimination and substandard enforcement of Head Start regulations. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 335. The Head Start provisions in question were 42 USC 9836a(a)(l) and (2). <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 336-337.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\"><em>Hodder </em>concerned claims of employees terminated from Head Start agencies. <em>Hodder, supra </em>at *16. It dealt with 42 USC 9849(b). <em>Hodder, supra </em>at *12. 42 USC 9839(a) was mentioned only in passing.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The only thing <em>Hodder </em>and <em>Johnson </em>have in common with this case is that both involve provisions of the Head Start Act. But the statutory language scrutinized in <em>Hodder </em>and <em>Johnson </em>makes no mention of public access as 42 USC 9839(a) does. Given that <em>Hodder </em>and <em>Johnson </em>do not deal with 42 USC 9839(a), they are of no assistance in our resolution of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The majority also bases its decision on the general purpose of the Head Start Act. It assumes that the only purpose worth considering is the act\u2019s overarching goal of providing services to low-income children and their families. It ignores the congressional intent specifically written into 42 USC 9839(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>42 USC 9839(a) specifies Congress\u2019s goal of maintaining open accountability in the use of public funds and effectuates it by providing a right of public access to books and records. By ignoring these specific provisions, the majority has effectively substituted its judgment for that of Congress. In reducing public oversight, it frustrates the paramount goals of the Head Start Act by facilitating the misuse of federal funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">APPLICATION OF THE <em>CORT </em>FACTORS TO 42 USC 9839(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Given that the language of the statute does not contradict the existence of a private cause of action, it is appropriate to apply all the <em>Cort </em>factors. The first question is whether plaintiff is in the class for whose benefit Congress enacted 42 USC 9839(a). The statute indicates that Congress intended to grant access to the public at large. Plaintiff is a member of the public. Therefore, plaintiff is within the appropriate class. <em>Cort, supra </em>at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The second question, whether there is any indication that Congress intended to create or to deny a private right of action, has already been discussed. The language of 42 USC 9839(a) indicates a specific intent to create such an action. There is no legislative history or other material, contradicting this intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The third question is whether it is consistent with the underlying legislative scheme to infer a private right of action. <em>Cort, supra </em>at 78. As the majority states, the overall purpose of the Head Start Act is to promote school readiness. 42 USC 9831. As part of its plan to reach this goal, Congress expressed an intent to maintain open accountability in the use of public funds in 42 USC 9839(a). In the same section, to effectuate this intent, Congress provided the public with a right of access to books and records. Inferring a right of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>to implement this right enforces that intent. Therefore, inferring a right of action is consistent with the legislative scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Finally, there is no indication that this is a cause of action traditionally relegated to state law. And defendant makes no such argument. To the contrary, an action pursuant to 42 USC 9839(a) is the only means by which plaintiff could obtain the information it seeks. Therefore, the analysis of this factor, as with the other <em>Cort </em>factors, points to the need to recognize a private right of action under 42 USC 9839(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">WHERE A LEGAL RIGHT EXISTS, SO DOES A LEGAL REMEDY</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\u201cThe very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws. . . .\u201d <em>Marbury v Madison, </em>5 US (1 Cranch) 137, 163; 2 L Ed 60 (1803). One of the fundamental tenets of the American legal system is that, where there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy. <em>Id. </em>After it is determined that Congress intended a right of action, courts presume the availability of all appropriate remedies unless Congress has expressly indicated otherwise. <em>Franklin v Gwinnett Co Pub Schools, </em>503 US 60, 66; 112 S Ct 1028; 117 L Ed 2d 208 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">In this case, a private right of action exists under 42 USC 9839(a). Plaintiff sought the appropriate remedy of viewing the records of the bids submitted for office supplies and furniture. Defendant makes no persuasive argument that viewing this information would be unreasonable. This proposed remedy is specifically consistent with the language of 42 USC 9839(a), which allows for reasonable inspections of books and records. Therefore, Congress has not expressly indicated that this remedy is inappropriate. And the trial court did not err in granting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"AEWZ\">CAVANAGH, J., concurred with KELLY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-9\"> <em>Chevron USA Inc v Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc, </em>467 US 837; 104 S Ct 2778; 81 L Ed 2d 694 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\"> 442 US 560; 99 S Ct 2479; 61 L Ed 2d 82 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b676-9\"> 15 USC 78q(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b676-10\"> 42 USC 2000d-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b677-10\"> The majority points out that 42 USC 9839(a) contains language like the statutory language that the Supreme Court analyzed in <em>Alexander. Ante </em>at 500 n 46. But the majority again misses the point. Unlike 42 USC 2000d-l, it contains a directive that does not concern the mere internal creation of rules. 42 USC 9839(a) contains language that is absent in 42 USC 2000d-l (the statutory language analyzed in <em>Alexander). </em>42 USC 9839(a) specifically mentions the \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cappropriate community groups ....\u201d It allows the public and these groups to request public hearings and to seek access to books and records. 42 USC 9839(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\"> The majority states that it \u201cwholly disagree[s]\u201d with the conclusion that 42 USC 9839(a) confers an individual right on a member of the public. It contends that 42 USC 9839(a) merely creates a disclosure requirement. <em>Ante </em>at 505 n 49. Again, the majority fails to analyze the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>actual language of the statute. 42 USC 9839(a) mandates public access, such as public hearings, at the request of \u201cappropriate community groups Only by allowing enforcement of this public inspection and access requirement can we effectuate Congress\u2019s specific goal of maintaining open accountability in the use of public funds. The majority simply ignores this clear congressional intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
