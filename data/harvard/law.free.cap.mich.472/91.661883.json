This declaratory judgment action concerns obligations under the no-fault act, MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>500.3101 <em>et seq., </em>to pay medical expenses. Plaintiffs are individual medical providers, two guardians of catastrophically injured victims of automobile accidents, and an organization of health-care providers and patients that principally seeks to protect the legal rights of both groups. Defendants are either no-fault insurance companies that have issued policies to Michigan motorists or the review companies employed by one or more of those insurers to review medical bills arising from automobile accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">MCL 500.3107(l)(a) requires that an insurer pay \u201call reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d MCL 500.3157 provides that a medical provider \u201cmay charge a reasonable amount for the products, services and accommodations rendered. The charge shall not exceed the amount the person or institution customarily charges for like products, services and accommodations in cases not involving insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">After a hearing on the parties\u2019 respective motions for summary disposition, the trial court ruled that defendants were entitled to review any medical charges and pay only those determined to be reasonable. The trial court further ruled that even though a medical provider\u2019s charge does not exceed the amount that provider customarily charges in cases not involving insurance, that fact alone does not establish that the charge is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The Court of Appeals affirmed. 257 Mich App 365; 670 NW2d 569 (2003). It ruled that it is for the trier of fact to determine whether a medical charge, albeit \u201ccustomary,\u201d is also reasonable. 257 Mich App 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Because we agree with the Court of Appeals resolution of this issue, and the others presented to it, we affirm. MCL 7.302(G)(1).</p>\n<judges id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Taylor, C.J., and Corrigan and Markman, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b258-4\">CAVANAGH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmJ\">(concurring). At oral argument it became very clear that defendants\u2019 methodologies in determining reasonableness were never at issue at the trial court level, which accounts for the dearth of evidence regarding those methodologies. Counsel for plaintiff admitted that the reason discovery was not more directed toward illuminating the methodologies was because no one asked plaintiffs before this Court\u2019s leave order to discuss how reasonableness should be assessed. Although I agree with the Court of Appeals conclusion that \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201ccustomary\u201d are two separate inquiries, I view its reference to the 80th percentile test, given this record, as dicta. Given that the question of reasonableness was not before the lower courts, and, consequently, discovery did not center on the question, I would be apprehensive about sanctioning any method without knowing its full details. I agree also with the Court of Appeals concurrence that urged our Legislature to address this issue and implement some guidelines in this area, as other no-fault states have done.</p>\n<judges id=\"b258-5\">KELLY, J., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b258-6\">WEAVER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYv\">(concurring). I join fully in Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s concurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">I write separately because this case is further evidence that this Court needs to address and open for public comment the specific procedures to be followed when a justice decides whether or not to participate in a case, and whether Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 6 requires justices to give written reasons for their decisions whether or not to participate in a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>When this Court entered its order granting leave to appeal on June 25, 2004, Justice YOUNG was shown as not participating; he is also shown as not participating in this memorandum opinion. No public or written explanation for Justice Young\u2019s decision not to participate in the case has been given to the Court, the parties, or the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">A justice\u2019s nonparticipation in a case may arise in one of two ways. A justice may decide, on his own initiative, not to participate in a case, and be shown as not participating. Alternatively, a party may request the recusal of a justice from a case. Recusal is defined as \u201c[t]he process by which a judge is disqualified on objection of either party (or disqualifies himself or herself) from hearing a lawsuit because of self interest, bias or prejudice.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">It is now clear to me that there is a right and an expectation of the people of Michigan that a justice will participate in every case unless there is a valid publicly known reason why the justice should not participate in a particular case. Traditionally, in this Court a justice\u2019s decision on whether to participate or not participate in a case has been a secret matter, and justices have not made public the reasons for that decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>justice\u2019s decision whether to participate or not participate in a case and the reasons for that decision should not be governed by tradition and secrecy; they should be governed by the law, the Constitution, and the Michigan Court Rules made in conformance with the Constitution; and they should be made publicly and in writing for the record. This Court should set the highest standards for clear, fair, orderly, and public procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The question whether a justice should participate or not participate in a case arises with regularity. Since May 2003, when I proposed opening an administrative file on the recusal procedure in <em>In re JK, </em>468 Mich 1239 (2003), a justice has been shown as not participating, with no reason given, in at least 31 cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The questions raised in this and any other case in which a justice\u2019s participation or nonparticipation arises are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">1) Are individual justices bound by the requirements of art 6, \u00a7 6 of the 1963 Michigan Constitution that states, \u201cDecisions of the supreme court. . . shall be in writing and shall contain a concise statement of the facts and reasons for each decision . . .\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">2) Do the procedures regarding the disqualification of judges set forth in Michigan Court Rule 2.003 apply to Supreme Court justices?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 6, which states that \u201cDecisions of the supreme court. . . shall be in writing and shall contain a concise statement of the facts and reasons for each decision\u201d requires that justices give written reasons for each decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is no more fundamental purpose for the requirement that the decisions of the Court be in writing than for the decisions to be accessible to the citizens of the state. Because a justice\u2019s decision to not participate in a case can, itself, change the outcome of a case, the decision is a matter of public significance and public access and understanding regarding a justice\u2019s participation or nonparticipation is vital to the public\u2019s ability to assess the performance of the Court and the performance of the Court\u2019s individual justices. Thus, the highest and best reading of art 6, \u00a7 6 requires that a justice\u2019s self-initiated decision not to participate, or a challenged justice\u2019s decision to participate or not participate, should be in writing and accessible to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Further, Michigan Court Rule 2.003, which regulates the procedures for the disqualification of judges, applies to Michigan Supreme Court justices.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Michigan Court Rule 2.001 provides that the rules in chapter 2, which includes MCR 2.003, apply to all courts established by the Constitution and laws of the state of Michigan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Michigan Supreme Court is a court established by the Michigan Constitution. Thus, a plain reading of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>court rule shows that MCR 2.003 governs the procedures for the disqualification of Michigan Supreme Court justices.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Almost two years ago, in May 2003, this Court\u2019s longstanding failure to follow and apply MCR 2.003 to itself became apparent to me.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a result, I proposed an amendment of MCR 2.003 that would clarify the applicability of MCR 2.003 and bring MCR 2.003 into conformance with the requirements of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 6. The amendment I proposed requires a justice to publish in the record of the case the reason(s) for the justice\u2019s decision whether to participate or not participate in a case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In response to my recommendation that the Court open an administrative file and take public comments on such a rule, the Court opened an administrative file, ADM 2003-26, on May 20, 2003. But almost two years later, the Court has not yet placed the proposed amendment or the issue on any of the public hearing agendas on administrative matters held during that time. There have been five such public hearings since May 2003: September 23, 2003, January 29, 2004, May 27, 2004, September 15, 2004, and most recently January 27, 2005. Nor has the Court taken any other action regarding a clear, fair, orderly, and public procedure for the participation or nonparticipation of justices of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>A justice\u2019s decision whether to participate or not participate in a case and the reasons for that decision should not be governed by tradition and secrecy; they should be governed by the law, the Constitution, and the Michigan Court Rules made in conformance with the Constitution; and they should be made publicly and in writing for the record. This Court should set the highest standards for clear, fair, orderly, and public procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">I continue to urge the Court to recognize, open for public comment, and address this ongoing need to have clear, fair, orderly, and public procedures concerning the participation or nonparticipation of justices.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Chief Justice TAYLOR was shown as not participating in two cases. <em>Booker v Detroit, </em>469 Mich 892 (2003), and <em>Neal v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>471 Mich 928 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Justice CAVANAGH was shown as not participating in two cases. <em>Konieczka v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>468 Mich 912 (2003), and <em>Herwig-Tucker v Detroit Entertainment, LLC, </em>471 Mich 873 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Justice KELLY was shown as not participating in seven cases. <em>Boyle v Gen Motors Corp, </em>468 Mich 1249 (2003) , <em>Woodman v Miesel Sysco Food Service Co, </em>469 Mich 855 (2003), <em>Grievance Administrator v Raaflaub, </em>668 NW2d 146 (Mich, 2003), <em>People v Wright, </em>469 Mich 880 (2003), <em>People v White, </em>469 Mich 877 (2003), <em>Sonsynath v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>668 NW2d 153 (Mich, 2003), and <em>People v Herbert, </em>470 Mich 857 (2004) .</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Justice CORRIGAN was shown as not participating in one case. <em>Shaya v Universal Standard Medical Laboratories, Inc, </em>469 Mich 994 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Justice YOUNG was shown as not participating in eight cases. <em>Bomarko, Inc v Mercy Health Services No 2, </em>468 Mich 915 (2003), <em>Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n v Juncaj, </em>468 Mich 923 (2003), <em>Brooks v State Farm Mut Automobile Ins Co, </em>469 Mich 874 (2003), <em>Blamer v Guiang, </em>469 Mich 899 (2003), <em>People v Shook, </em>469 Mich 911 (2003), <em>Fournier v Mercy Community Health Care System-Port Huron, </em>469 Mich 921 (2003), <em>Warber v Trinity Health Corp, </em>469 Mich 1001 (2004), and <em>Lawrence v Battle Creek Health Systems, </em>469 Mich 1051 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Justice MARKMAN was shown as not participating in eleven cases. <em>People v Nevers, </em>469 Mich 881 (2003), <em>People v Bahoda, </em>469 Mich 945 (2003), <em>Shacket Developments, Inc v Labana, </em>469 Mich 909 (2003), <em>Shaya v Universal Standard Medical Laboratories, Inc, </em>469 Mich 994 (2004), <em>Hughes v Hall, </em>469 Mich 1016 (2004), <em>People v Harwell, </em>469 Mich 1017 (2004), <em>Grievance Administrator v Zipser, </em>469 Mich 1307 (2004), <em>People v Zakar, </em>470 Mich 854 (2004), <em>Landes v Equity Resource Environmental, </em>470 Mich 864 (2004), <em>People v Nevers, </em>683 NW2d 674 (Mich, 2004), and <em>American Bumper and Mfg Co v Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins Co of Pittsburgh, </em>471 Mich 948 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">APPENDIX B</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">MCR 2.003, Disqualification of Judge, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">(A) Who May Raise.

In almost all these cases, I did not participate because I had been on the Court of Appeals panels that earlier decided the cases and I was informed that justices \u201ctraditionally\u201d did not participate in such cases.

(See <em>In re JK, </em>468 Mich 1239 [2003]; <em>Gilbert v DaimlerChrysler Corp, </em>469 Mich 889 [2003].)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>All the members of this Court serve with the knowledge that \u201c[t]he Due Process Clause requires an unbiased and impartial decisionmaker.\u201d <em>Cain v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>451 Mich 470, 497; 548 NW2d 210 (1996). It is therefore standard practice for each justice of this Court to voluntarily recuse himself or herself when the justice cannot participate impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">In her concurring statement, Justice WEAVER correctly points out that a justice may choose whether to publish his or her reasons for recusal. There is nothing secretive or sinister in this tradition. Indeed, Justice WEAVER acknowledges that over an eight-year period she herself declined to publish reasons for her nonparticipation in approximately 251 cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Like justices of the Michigan Supreme Court, the justices of the United States Supreme Court sometimes do and sometimes do not state their reasons for determining whether to participate in a decision. See, e.g., <em>Cheney v United States Dist Court for the Dist of Columbia, </em>541 US 913; 124 S Ct 1391; 158 L Ed 2d 225 (2004); <em>Intel Corp v Advanced Micro Devices, Inc, </em>542 US 241; 124 S Ct 2466; 159 L Ed 2d 355 (2004); <em>United States v Hatter, </em>532 US 557; 121 S Ct 1782; 149 L Ed 2d 820 (2001); <em>Fed Election Comm v NRA Political Victory Fund, </em>513 US 88; 115 S Ct 537; 130 L Ed 2d 439 (1994); <em>Arizona v United States Dist Court for the Dist of Arizona, </em>459 US 1191; 103 S Ct 1173; 75 L Ed 2d 425 (1983); <em>Laird v Tatum, </em>409 US 824; 93 S Ct 7; 34 L Ed 2d 50 (1972). Several of our sister states follow a similar recusal procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Like Justice WEAVER\u2019S 251 pre-2003 recusal decisions without explanation, the thirty-one recusal decisions by the remaining six members of the Court over the past two years comport with our Constitution<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Michigan Court Rules. Justice WEAVER is, of course, entitled to now disagree with our traditional recusal procedures, and as she notes, ADM 2003-26 was opened on May 20, 2003, in response to her concerns. That file is being considered by this Court. The same is true for its predecessor, ADM 2003-24, which this Court opened on April 30, 2003, to consider the disqualification rule when a justice participated in a case at the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In addition, in now-closed administrative files, this Court has already considered local judicial disqualification rules, justices\u2019 participation in cases, and amending or interpreting MCR 2.003. See ADM 2002-41 (opened October 1, 2002, and closed April 2, 2003); ADM 1999-60 (opened November 30, 1999, and closed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>October 6, 2000); ADM 1999-28 (opened April 30,1999, and closed January 4, 2001; reopened May 1, 2001, and closed April 18, 2002); ADM 1992-18 (discussed June 4, 1992, and closed September 1994); ADM 1991-22 (reported November 7, 1991, and closed September 1, 1995). In short, like Justice WEAVER, the rest of this Court is cognizant of the \u201cneed to have clear, fair, orderly, and public procedures\u201d in place with respect to the administration of justice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b269-4\">YOUNG, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-6\"> <em>Ante </em>at 97.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> Much like Michigan, many states have adopted judicial canons informed by the Model Code of Judicial Conduct. See Colorado Code of Judicial Conduct, Ch 24, Canon 3(C) and (E); Iowa Code of Judicial Conduct, Ch 51, Canon 3(C) and (D); Fla Stat Ann Code of Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Conduct, Canon 3(E) and (F); New York Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(E) and (F); Ohio Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(G) and (H).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b268-9\"> The recusal standards that Justice Weaver advances rest on her interpretation of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 6. Justice Weaver\u2019s own prior positions are inconsistent in this regard. For instance, in <em>Gilbert v DaimlerChrysler Corp, </em>469 Mich 883 (2003), she chose to not participate with respect to other justices on motions for disqualification because she felt it appropriate to decide only whether she herself should participate, and not whether other justices should do so. Such a posture can <em>only </em>be understood as characterizing a denial of a motion for disqualification as an individualized determination made by each justice, and not as a \u201c[d]ecision[] of the supreme court\u201d for purposes of art 6, \u00a7 6. Interestingly, in a number of what are <em>indisputably </em>\u201c[djecisions of the supreme court,\u201d Justice Weaver chose to offer no reasons or explanation for her own positions. See, e.g., <em>Taylor v Gate Pharmaceuticals, </em>468 Mich 1, 19; 658 NW2d 127 (2003) (WEAVER, J., \u201cconcurred in the result only\u201d); <em>People v Yost, </em>468 Mich 122, 134; 659 NW2d 604 (2003) (\u201cconcurred in the result only\u201d); <em>Nemeth v Abonmarche Dev, Inc, </em>457 Mich 16, 44; 576 NW2d 641 (1998) (\u201cconcurred only in the result\u201d); <em>People v Jendrzejewski, </em>455 Mich 495, 521; 566 NW2d 530 (1997) (\u201cconcurred only in the result\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b269-5\"> <em>Ante </em>at 101.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
