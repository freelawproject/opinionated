MCL 418.901 <em>et seq. </em>The act makes an employer initially liable to pay disability benefits to a certified vocationally disabled employee who is injured on the job. It imposes on the employer only fifty-two weeks of liability for compensation, medical care, and last illness and burial expenses. MCL 418.921. Thereafter, the Second Injury Fund becomes liable. In the event of an employment-related injury to a certified vocationally disabled employee, the employer\u2019s worker\u2019s disability insurance carrier has an obligation to give notice to the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The issue here is whether a carrier that fails to notify the fund is solely liable for a vocationally disabled person\u2019s disability benefits after fifty-two weeks. MCL 418.925(1). Related issues are whether the fund is liable after the fifty-second week if it receives late notice, and whether the employer can be liable after fifty-two weeks under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">We hold that the employer has no liability for benefits after the fifty-second week, even if the fund receives late notice. Also, the carrier must continue to pay benefits after fifty-two weeks. Finally, the fund is not released from liability to reimburse the carrier for its payments made after fifty-two weeks even if it receives late notice. An exception exists if the employee loses eligibility before late notice is given. If the employee is found ineligible for payments made before late notice was given, the fund need not reimburse the carrier for the benefits paid. We overrule the Court of Appeals decisions in <em>Valencic v </em>TPM, Inc<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>Robinson v Gen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number><em>Motors </em>Corp<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the extent that they are inconsistent with today\u2019s opinion. We reverse in part the Court of Appeals decision in this case and remand the case to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission (WCAC).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">THE PROVISIONS FOR VOCATIONALLY DISABLED EMPLOYEES</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">A vocationally disabled employee is an employee who suffers from one of several statutorily enumerated medical conditions and whose impairment is a substantial obstacle to employment. MCL 418.901(a). The liability to pay benefits for such an employee, when injured on the job, is allocated among the employer, the employer\u2019s carrier, and the Second Injury Fund. The disability act restricts the employer\u2019s liability to the first fifty-two weeks. MCL 418.921.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">After that, the employer\u2019s carrier must continue to pay benefits to the employee. But the fund must reimburse the carrier for the amount the carrier pays after the fifty-second week following the injury. MCL 418.925(2). By allocating liability in this fashion, the act reduces an employer\u2019s normal worker\u2019s compensation liability, encouraging employment of the vocationally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The act provides that a vocationally disabled employee will receive benefits in the same manner and to the same extent as other employees. MCL 418.921. To qualify under this chapter, the employee must apply to the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation of the Department of Education for certification as vocationally disabled. MCL 418.901(b), 418.905.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The employer and the disability insurance carrier must also fulfill certain obligations. When hiring a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>disabled employee, the employer must submit required information to the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. MCL 418.911. If a certified vocationally disabled employee is injured on the job, the carrier must notify the fund within a certain time after the injury. MCL 418.925(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">In this case, defendant Oakwood Hospital was both the employer and the carrier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff was its vocationally disabled employee. After plaintiff was injured at work, defendant Oakwood failed to timely notify the defendant fund under the act\u2019s notice provision. In controversy is which defendant, if either, is liable for benefits to plaintiff after the fifty-second week.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The basic facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff, an employee of Oakwood, was certified as vocationally disabled from a previous injury. She became afflicted with debilitating bilateral cumulative trauma disorder in her hands, known as carpal tunnel syndrome, as a consequence of her work as a medical transcriptionist. Her condition rendered her unable to work after September 21, 1994. Over the next several months, she received noninvasive treatment then underwent carpal tunnel release surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Oakwood voluntarily paid disability benefits to plaintiff until March 20, 1998. At that time, Oakwood asserted that plaintiff was able to return to work. Plaintiff applied for a hearing before a worker\u2019s compensation magistrate pursuant to MCL 418.931, seeking the reinstatement of her benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>PROCEEDINGS IN THE WCAC AND THE COURT OF APPEALS</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">Oakwood failed to notify the Second Injury Fund within the period established in MCL 418.925(1) that the fund might be liable to pay plaintiffs compensation and medical care benefits. On November 12, 1998, Oakwood filed a petition with the worker\u2019s compensation bureau seeking reimbursement from the fund for its overpayment to plaintiff pursuant to MCL 418.931(1). Oakwood included a copy of plaintiffs vocationally handicapped certificate with its petition. It argued that it should be liable for payment of no more than fifty-two weeks of benefits under MCL 418.921 and that the fund owed the rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The fund sought to dismiss Oakwood\u2019s petition on the basis that Oakwood had failed to give it timely notice under MCL 418.925(1). A magistrate granted the motion and dismissed the petition. On appeal to the WCAC, the commission granted Oakwood\u2019s interlocutory appeal, reversed, and remanded the case to the magistrate. <em>Bailey v Oakwood Hosp &amp; Med Ctr, </em>2000 Mich ACO 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Soon after that action, the Court of Appeals decided <em>Robinson, supra. </em>It held that the failure of a carrier to timely notify the fund under MCL 418.925(1) resulted in dismissal of the fund\u2019s liability and continued the liability of the carrier. <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 334-335.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">On remand, the magistrate again dismissed Oak-wood\u2019s claim against the fund. He relied on <em>Robinson. </em>In addition, he found that plaintiff was not avoiding work as Oakwood claimed and granted plaintiff an open award of benefits to be paid by Oakwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Again on appeal to the WCAC, the commission concluded that neither Oakwood nor the fund was liable for additional benefits. It found that the <em>Robinson </em>decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>shielded the fund from liability, and that the act protected Oakwood from payments beyond fifty-two weeks. MCL 418.921. It ruled that, under the act, a carrier\u2019s liability must be limited to benefits accruing during the first fifty-two weeks after the injury. MCL 418.921. On the basis of the <em>Robinson </em>decision and the mandatory language of the statute, the WCAC terminated plaintiffs benefits. <em>Bailey v Oakwood Hosp &amp; Med Ctr, </em>2002 Mich ACO 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Plaintiff sought leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals. The director of the worker\u2019s compensation bureau intervened on plaintiffs behalf as provided for in MCL 418.841(1). The Court of Appeals reversed the WCAC decision, citing both <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Valencic.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>259 Mich App 298; 674 NW2d 160 (2003). The Court held that Oakwood\u2019s failure to provide the fund with timely notice precluded it from taking advantage of the fifty-two-week limitation of liability contained in MCL 418.921. Absent timely notice, Oakwood would remain liable for the duration of plaintiffs work-related disability. 259 Mich App at 305-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The Court remanded the case to the WCAC to review Oakwood\u2019s claim that plaintiff was avoiding work. See MCL 418.861a(3). Oakwood sought, and we granted, leave to appeal. 470 Mich 892 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">THE STANDARD ON APPELLATE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Because this case presents an issue of statutory construction, we review it de novo. <em>Cardinal Mooney High School v Michigan High School Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>437 Mich 75, 80; 467 NW2d 21 (1991). If possible, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>give effect to the Legislature\u2019s purpose and intent according to the common and ordinary meaning of the language it used. When ascertaining intent, we read differing statutory provisions to produce an harmonious whole. MCL 8.3a; <em>Farrington v Total Petroleum, Inc, </em>442 Mich 201, 208-209, 212; 501 NW2d 76 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The following are the relevant statutory provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\"><em>A person certified as vocationally disabled who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment and resulting in death or disability, shall be paid compensation in the manner and to the extent provided in this act, </em>or in case of his death resulting from such injury, the compensation shall be paid to his dependents. <em>The liability of the employer </em>for payment of compensation, for furnishing medical care or for payment of expenses of the employee\u2019s last illness and burial as provided in this act <em>shall be limited to those benefits accruing during the period of 52 weeks after the date of injury. Thereafter, all compensation and the cost of all medical care and expenses of the employee\u2019s last sickness and burial shall be the liability of the fund. </em>The fund shall be liable, from the date of injury, for those vocational rehabilitation benefits provided in section 319. [MCL 418.921 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The notification provision, \u00a7 925(1), reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-8\">When a vocationally disabled person receives a personal injury, the procedure and practice provided in this act applies to all proceedings under this chapter, except where specifically otherwise provided herein. <em>Not less than 90 nor more than 150 days before the expiration of 52 weeks after the date of injury, the carrier shall notify the fund whether it is likely that compensation may be payable beyond a period of 52 weeks after the date of injury. The fund, thereafter, may review, at reasonable times, such information as the carrier has regarding the accident, and the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><em>nature and extent of the injury and disability. </em>[MCL 418.925(1) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">PREVIOUS INTERPRETATIONS OF THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE AT ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\"><em>Robinson </em>was the first reported case to consider the consequences of a carrier\u2019s failure to notify the fund.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There, the Court of Appeals noted that the word \u201cshall\u201d in \u00a7 925(1) created a mandatory duty to notify It reasoned that the Legislature must have intended that there be an adverse consequence for failing to give notice, or carriers could violate the provision with impunity. <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 335. The appropriate sanction, it reasoned, was complete dismissal of the fund\u2019s liability. This not only effectuated the Legislature\u2019s intent, <em>Robinson </em>observed, it protected the fund from prejudice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">In <em>Valencic, </em>the Court of Appeals followed the reasoning of <em>Robinson, </em>as it was required to do. MCR 7.215(J)(1). It concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-8\">compliance with the notice provisions of [MCL] 418.925(1) is \u201cmandatory,\u201d and in the case at bar, it is undisputed that notice was not given within the period set forth in that subsection. In light of <em>Robinson </em>. . ., we conclude that the WCAC\u2019s decision [not to dismiss the fund] amounted to an error of law. <em>[Valencic, supra </em>at 608.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">As in <em>Robinson, </em>the Court dismissed the fund from the lawsuit and imposed full liability on the carrier for payments beyond the first fifty-two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>THE INVALIDITY OF <em>ROBINSON </em>AND <em>VALENCIC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\">The flaws in <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Valencic </em>become painfully apparent when their holdings are applied to this case. The Legislature enacted the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act to provide a reliable source of benefits to employees injured on the job regardless of tort liability. <em>McAvoy v H B Sherman Co, </em>401 Mich 419, 437; 258 NW2d 414 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">In applying <em>Robinson, Valencic, </em>and MCL 418.925(1) to this case, the Court of Appeals and the WCAC were trapped in a Catch-22. They had to release the employer-carrier and the fund from liability, leaving no one to pay plaintiffs benefits. This directly contradicted the express language of MCL 418.921 that \u201can employee . . . shall be entitled to compensation\u201d for a disability caused by employment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that a certified vocationally disabled employee \u201cshall be. . . compensat[ed] in the manner and to the extent provided in this act....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">We interpret the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall\u201d to mandate the payment of benefits to an employee who qualifies for them. <em>Scarsella v Pollak, </em>461 Mich 547, 549; 607 NW2d 711 (2000); <em>Oakland Co v Michigan, </em>456 Mich 144, 154; 566 NW2d 616 (1997). The question becomes who is liable for the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">It is apparent from the language of \u00a7 921 that an employer\u2019s liability must end after the employee receives the benefits that accrued during the fifty-two weeks following the injury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Also, the fund must assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>liability for benefits, if any are due and paid by the carrier beyond that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Section 925 describes the procedure for transferring liability from the carrier to the fund. It also provides that, after notification, the fund \u201cmay review, at reasonable times, such information as the carrier has regarding the accident, and the nature and extent of the injury and disability.\u201d MCL 418.925(1). The notice provision and accompanying deadlines afford the fund an opportunity to review claims to verify their validity. This avoids unwarranted costs to the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Although the statute shifts liability, it does not alleviate the disability insurance carrier\u2019s responsibility to pay benefits to the employee. \u201cLiability\u201d means \u201cthe state or quality of being liable,\u201d and \u201cliable\u201d means \u201clegally responsible.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001 ed), p 765. It is different than the responsibility to pay, although the two often overlap.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The act requires that the employee be compensated <em>\u201cin the manner </em>... provided in this act....\u201d MCL 418.921 (emphasis added). It requires carriers to pay benefits directly to injured employees. MCL 418.801. Thus \u00a7 921 requires carriers to continue to make payments to certified vocationally disabled employees after fifty-two weeks just as they would to other disabled employees who are not certified as vocationally disabled. These provisions ensure that the injured em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>ployee is not left uncompensated during a dispute between a carrier and the fund over who is liable for payments after week fifty-two.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">The act also requires that the fund reimburse the carrier for all compensation rightfully paid on its behalf. MCL 418.925(2). In effect, the act requires the carrier to advance benefits on behalf of the fund. By shifting the liability but not the obligation to pay, and by providing for parallel responsibility for payment, the Legislature ensured that an injured employee would not be left without benefits. The provision in \u00a7 925(3)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> allowing the fund to pay the employee directly is consistent with the above provisions. The fund may pay an employee directly if a carrier fails to meet its obligation to the employee for any reason, such as insolvency. This furnishes additional assurance that the employee will receive the benefits envisioned in the act. MCL 418.921.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">THE CONSEQUENCES CONTEMPLATED BY THE ACT FOR FAILURE OF NOTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">When the act is read in context to give effect to all its provisions, it becomes apparent that the Legislature intended several consequences for failure to give notice under \u00a7 925(1). Carriers have a built-in incentive to give timely notice. If a carrier fails to notify the fund, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>consequence is that it loses the temporary use of the money that the fund would have reimbursed to it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> MCL 418.925(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Once the fund has notice, it may review any information the carrier has about the claim. MCL 418.925(1). It may dispute an employee\u2019s eligibility for payment under MCL 418.925(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-7\">[A]t any time subsequent to 52 weeks after the date of injury, the fund may notify the carrier of a dispute as to the payment of compensation. The liability of the fund to reimburse the carrier shall be suspended 30 days thereafter until such controversy is determined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">These provisions allow the fund, once it has notice, to ensure that it is required to reimburse only legitimate claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Another consequence would occur if the employee became ineligible for benefits after fifty-two weeks. If the employee is not eligible, there is no liability to pay benefits under MCL 418.921.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">The fund argues that the Court should create an additional consequence: it should relieve it from all obligations to reimburse the carrier after fifty-two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>weeks if notice is not timely even if the employee is eligible for benefits. It argues that its assets derive from contributions or assessments of self-insured employers and worker\u2019s compensation insurance carriers. Therefore, it says, it must be able to rely on the notification process to determine its budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">However, notification is merely a prediction of a future event: that benefits may become payable. In order for the fund to use notifications that are only predictions to forecast its budget, it must build in a component to allow for changes in the condition of injured employees. Hence, the fund cannot budget for the future on the basis of predictions alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Moreover, compliance with the notice requirement may be impossible under some circumstances. Section 925(1) could directly conflict with the act\u2019s general statute of limitations in MCL 418.381.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For example, a certified vocationally disabled employee could suffer what appears to be a minor injury at work. Because the injury does not initially appear serious, the employee might continue to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Although the employee might work every day, the symptoms attributable to the injury might worsen. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>the conclusion of fifty-two weeks, the symptoms could be so severe that the employee must stop working. If the employee filed a claim for worker\u2019s compensation at the beginning of week fifty-three, it would be well within the two-year limitation on claims found in \u00a7 381. It is possible that only when the claim is filed would the employer and its carrier become aware of a potentially compensable claim. However, because fifty-two weeks would have already elapsed since the date of injury, the carrier would have lost its ability to comply with the notice provision of \u00a7 925(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Should this situation occur, the carrier would be unable to satisfy the notice provision because of no fault of its own. Under <em>Robinson, </em>despite the language of \u00a7 921 that limits carrier liability \u201cto those benefits accruing during the period of 52 weeks after the date of injury,\u201d the carrier would remain liable. This would occur because the carrier had been unaware of the possible compensable claim until after the fifty-two-week period.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">THE LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE INSERTED THE PENALTY CLAUSE SOUGHT BY THE FUND</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The Legislature knows how to create a penalty when it intends one. As we have pointed out, consequences for noncompliance with notification provisions are inherent in the act. This suggests that the Legislature did not intend to impose the penalty for noncompliance with the notification provision of \u00a7 925(1) that the fund seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">The act requires the employer to timely notify the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation at the Michigan Department of Education<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> when it hires a certified vocationally disabled employee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Upon commencement of employment of a certified vocationally disabled person the employer shall submit to the certifying agency, on forms furnished by the agency all pertinent information requested by the agency. The certifying agency shall acknowledge receipt of the information. <em>Failure to file the required information with the certifying agency within 60 days after the first day of the vocationally disabled person\u2019s employment precludes the employer from the protection and benefits of this chapter unless such information is filed before an injury for which benefits are payable under this act. </em>[MCL 418.911 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">Under this section, failure to notify the agency within the specified time or before an injury for which benefits are payable bars the employer from shifting liability to the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The Legislature enacted this provision simultaneously with \u00a7\u00a7 921 and 925. It furnishes a model for penalties in the event of noncompliance. However, the Legislature did not follow it when creating the notification requirement of \u00a7 925(1). It seems unlikely that the Legislature intended a penalty that it did not build into the act, especially given that it did specify penalties elsewhere in the act. <em>Farrington, supra </em>at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Justice Markman\u2019s construction would impose on a carrier a penalty that is not in the act. He proposes an alternative version of the act, one that limits the employer\u2019s liability</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-7\">provided that the carrier complies with the notice requirement of \u00a7 925(1). Where the carrier fails to notify the fund of the possibility that benefits will remain payable under this chapter, the employer\u2019s liability continues until such time as ninety days have passed from when the fund receives notification. [Post at 709.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">The Legislature did not write this limitation into the act. The limitation conflicts with the text of the statute that requires notice be provided 90 to 150 days before a date fifty-two weeks \u201cafter the date of injury.\u201d MCL 418.925(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>THE ACT DOES NOT PENALIZE THE INJURED EMPLOYEE FOR A CARRIER\u2019S MISFEASANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The act allows an employee to enforce his or her award in circuit court. MCL 418.863. The employee\u2019s claim may be brought directly against the directors and officers of a self-insured employer or carrier as well as against the corporate entity. MCL 418.647(2). These provisions establish recourse for an employee if a carrier does not meet its obligations and ceases making payments in violation of an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Also, the self-insured status of an employer, like Oakwood, that repeatedly or unreasonably fails to meet its obligations may be revoked. If this occurs, the employer will be required to obtain liability insurance. MCL 418.631(2).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the act penalizes a self-insured employer or carrier that fails to pay its obligations to disabled employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\"><em>Valencic </em>and <em>Robinson </em>failed to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. They precluded the magistrate from awarding benefits to a certified vocationally disabled employee to the same extent and in the same manner as other employees. They created a penalty for the carrier\u2019s failure to notify the fund of its liability where none was written into the act. Accordingly, <em>Valencic </em>and <em>Robinson </em>are overruled to the extent that they are inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">THE CARRIER IS ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE FUND</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">The act explicitly states that the obligation of the carrier to continue to pay benefits after fifty-two weeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>\u201cdoes not impose an independent liability on the carrier.\u201d MCL 418.925(3). The act provides for reimbursement to the carrier once the carrier has established having made an overpayment of accrued benefits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\">The fund must make prompt reimbursement to the carrier. <em>Id. </em>The act does not include a provision releasing the fund from this obligation if the carrier delays in reporting to it a payment to an employee. It would contravene the intent of the Legislature for the Court to read into the act words extinguishing the carrier\u2019s right to reimbursement. Hence, in this case, the fund must reimburse Oakwood for any eligible benefits it paid on the fund\u2019s behalf after the fifty-two-week period following the date of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">The fund argues that its assets are in the nature of a trust and that it is the trustee. It claims that it is precluded from disbursing the trust\u2019s assets unless the terms of the trust are followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">We find unconvincing the argument that it is a violation of the terms of the fund\u2019s trust to disburse benefits when the mandatory notice provision has not been satisfied. To the contrary, the trust by its terms is required to reimburse carriers for benefits paid to disabled employees after fifty-two weeks following an injury. MCL 418.925(3). Notification by a carrier is not a condition precedent to the fund\u2019s obligation. The trustee is not absolved of its responsibility by a settlor\u2019s failure to notify the trustee of a possible obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The record contains no showing that the fund\u2019s payment of claims for which it received delayed notice from carriers has caused it an actuarial crisis. We believe that the fund is not prejudiced by untimely delays and, in fact, that it enjoys the time value of the money it holds until receiving delayed notification of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>claim. Any monies that the fund pays out are recouped through assessments on employers and carriers pursuant to MCL 418.551(1) and passed along to consumers. <em>McAvoy, supra </em>at 436, quoting 1 Larson, Workman\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 2.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">An employer is liable for payment of compensation, for furnishing medical care, and for payment of the last illness expenses of a certified vocationally disabled employee. This liability exists for fifty-two weeks after the employee suffers a second disabling injury or is killed at work. After that, the employer has no further liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The Second Injury Fund is liable after the fifty-second week and must reimburse a carrier for eligible benefits it pays the employee on the fund\u2019s behalf. MCL 418.921 and 418.925(3). The Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act provides inherent consequences for a carrier that fails to timely notify the fund of the fund\u2019s potential obligation. For instance, the carrier loses the temporary use of the money that the fund would have reimbursed to it. It risks that the fund will dispute the employee\u2019s eligibility, precluding the carrier from being reimbursed if the employee is found ineligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">In this case, Oakwood\u2019s liability as an employer ended at the conclusion of fifty-two weeks after the date of plaintiffs injury. However, as the carrier, it remained obligated to pay her benefits thereafter and could rely on reimbursement from the fund unless plaintiff was shown to be avoiding work. The Court of Appeals holding to the contrary is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">The fund will be liable for plaintiffs continuing benefits retroactive to fifty-two weeks after her injury provided that it is determined on remand that plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>was not avoiding work. We remand the case to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission for consideration of this issue. <em>Valencic </em>and <em>Robinson </em>are overruled to the extent that they are inconsistent with this opinion.

Extending Oakwood\u2019s liability beyond the statutory fifty-two-week period, as the dissent suggests, imposes a penalty on the same party that failed to comply with \u00a7 925. However, if the carrier and the employer are separate entities, the dissent would extend the <em>employer\u2019s </em>liability because of the <em>carrier\u2019s </em>failure to comply with its statutory duty.

But the fund can scarcely be expected to dispute payments of which it has no knowledge. Hence, the relevant inquiry is this: what consequence does the act contemplate for the time that the carrier fails to give notice to the fund? For any period during which the fund has no notice and the employee was ineligible for benefits, the fund has no liability. The consequence to the carrier that fails to give notice and pays benefits to an ineligible employee after the fifty-second week is that it will not receive reimbursement from the fund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\"> MCL 418.381 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-8\">A proceeding for compensation for an injury under this act shall not be maintained unless a claim for compensation for the injury, which claim may be either oral or in writing, has been made to the employer or a written claim has been made to the bureau on forms prescribed by the director, within 2 years after the occurrence of the injury.

The majority concludes that the Second Injury Fund (the fund) is automatically liable for a certified vocationally disabled employee\u2019s disability benefits after fifty-two weeks, notwithstanding the fact that the employer\u2019s carrier has failed to comply with the notice provisions of MCL 418.925(1). I respectfully disagree. Because \u00a7 925(1) provides that a carrier \u201cshall notify\u201d the fund at least ninety days before the normal expiration of the carrier\u2019s liability, I do not agree with the majority that the fund\u2019s liability is automatic at the expiration of fifty-two weeks from the date of the injury, without regard to the compliance of the carrier with its statutory obligation. Instead, I conclude that the better reading of the vocational disability chapter of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act requires that the carrier must notify the fund at least ninety days before the liability limitation set forth in MCL 418.921 can become effective. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and hold that the fund\u2019s liability was not triggered in this case until ninety days after it received statutory notice from the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">When plaintiff began working for defendant Oak-wood Hospital and Medical Center (Oakwood) in 1989, she was certified as vocationally disabled because of a prior back injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She developed bilateral carpal tunnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>syndrome in 1993; after surgery failed to provide relief from the pain, she left her employment on September 21, 1994. Oakwood paid worker\u2019s compensation benefits until March 1998, when it stopped payment on the basis of plaintiffs alleged work avoidance. Plaintiff applied for a hearing in May 1998. Shortly thereafter, Oakwood found plaintiffs vocationally handicapped worker\u2019s certificate and filed a claim against defendant fund for reimbursement of the benefits it paid plaintiff beyond the fifty-two-week period set by \u00a7 921. The magistrate granted the fund\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of Oakwood\u2019s failure to provide timely notice under \u00a7 925. The Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission (WCAC) reversed, remanding with an instruction to make the fund a party. On remand, the magistrate again dismissed the fund, citing <em>Robinson v Gen Motors Corp, </em>242 Mich App 331; 619 NW2d 411 (2000), which had been released in the interim. The magistrate then rejected Oakwood\u2019s work avoidance claim, granting plaintiff an open award of benefits. The WCAC reversed, concluding that neither Oakwood nor the fund was liable for additional benefits. The Court of Appeals then reversed the WCAC, holding that Oak-wood\u2019s failure to timely provide notice meant that it remained liable as long as plaintiff had a work-related disability. 259 Mich App 298; 674 NW2d 160 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">We review issues of statutory construction de novo. <em>Burton v Reed City Hosp Corp, </em>471 Mich 745, 757; 691 NW2d 424 (2005). We recently noted \u201cthe fundamental rule\u201d of statutory construction that \u201cevery word of a statute should be given meaning and no word should be treated as surplusage or rendered nugatory if at all possible.\u201d <em>Pittsfield Charter Twp v Washtenaw Co, </em>468 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Mich 702, 714; 664 NW2d 193 (2003). The word \u201cshall\u201d is \u201cunambiguous and denote[s] a mandatory, rather than discretionary action.\u201d <em>Roberts v Mecosta Co Gen Hosp, </em>466 Mich 57, 65; 642 NW2d 663 (2002). The provisions of a statute must be read in the context of the entire statute in the interest of producing an harmonious whole. <em>Burton, supra </em>at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">As a result of her certification as a vocationally disabled person, plaintiffs subsequent work-related injury triggered \u00a7 921 of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (WDCA). That section (MCL 418.921) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-5\">A person certified as vocationally disabled who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment and resulting in death or disability, shall be paid compensation in the manner and to the extent provided in this act, or in case of his death resulting from such injury, the compensation shall be paid to his dependents. The liability of the employer for payment of compensation, for furnishing medical care or for payment of expenses of the employee\u2019s last illness and burial as provided in this act shall be limited to those benefits accruing during the period of 52 weeks after the date of injury. Thereafter, all compensation and the cost of all medical care and expenses of the employee\u2019s last sickness and burial shall be the liability of the fund. The fund shall be liable, from the date of injury, for those vocational rehabilitation benefits provided in section 319.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">However, \u00a7 921 does not exist in a vacuum. Section 925(1) of the WDCA (MCL 418.925[1]) further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-7\">When a vocationally disabled person receives a personal injury, the procedure and practice provided in this act applies to all proceedings under this chapter, except where specifically otherwise provided herein. Not less than 90 nor more than 150 days before the expiration of 52 weeks after the date of injury, the carrier shall notify the fund whether it is likely that compensation may be payable beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>period of 52 weeks after the date of injury. The fund, thereafter, may review, at reasonable times, such information as the carrier has regarding the accident, and the nature and extent of the injury and disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">While these statutes normally coexist harmoniously, a conflict arises where, as here, the carrier<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has failed to timely notify the fund of a situation where \u201cit is likely that compensation may be payable beyond a period of 52 weeks after the date of injury.\u201d In such a case, the carrier has violated the mandate of \u00a7 925(1) that it \u201cshall notify\u201d the fund, yet the consequences of such violation are not readily apparent because \u00a7 921 mandates that the employer\u2019s liability \u201cshall be limited to... 52 weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">The majority correctly concludes that the interpretation of the Court of Appeals, based upon <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Valencic v TPM, Inc, </em>248 Mich App 601; 639 NW2d 846 (2001), cannot stand. In concluding that the carrier\u2019s failure to timely notify the fund served as a permanent and complete bar to the fund\u2019s liability, <em>Robinson </em>and its progeny ignored the instruction in \u00a7 921 that \u201cliability of the employer ... shall be limited to those benefits accruing during the period of 52 weeks after the date of injury.\u201d <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>sanction of complete dismissal of the fund creates a clear conflict with the text of \u00a7 921.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>However, despite recognizing that the <em>Robinson </em>line of cases completely ignores one statutory mandate at the expense of another, the rule the majority adopts today has exactly the same effect. Section 925(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-4\">Not less than 90 nor more than 150 days before the expiration of 52 weeks after the date of injury, the carrier <em>shall notify </em>the fund whether it is likely that compensation may be payable beyond a period of 52 weeks after the date of injury. [MCL 418.925(1) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Applying basic principles of statutory construction, the Legislature\u2019s use of the words \u201cshall notify\u201d makes clear that notification to the fund is mandatory. However, far from giving meaning to every word of the statute, the majority effectively reads this mandatory notification language out of the statute. I do not believe that the Legislature intended to make such notice requirement \u201cmandatory,\u201d yet intended no remedy or means of enforcement for such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">In my judgment, the most harmonious and natural reading of the vocational disability chapter as a whole would limit the employer\u2019s liability to a period of fifty-two weeks under \u00a7 921, <em>provided that </em>the carrier complies with the notice requirement of \u00a7 925(1). Where the carrier fails to notify the fund of the possibility that benefits will remain payable under this chapter, the employer\u2019s liability continues until such time as ninety days have passed from when the fund receives notification. See \u00a7 925(1). This approach is sounder, I believe, than that of the majority by giving meaning to <em>both </em>the limitation on the employer\u2019s liability in \u00a7 921 and the requirement that notice be given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>the fund in \u00a7 925(1), thereby giving effect to <em>all </em>the relevant language of the law. At the same time, as long as the carrier supplied notice to the fund at some point, this approach would avoid permanently placing responsibility for the payment of benefits upon the employer, as would be effected by <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Valencic.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Moreover, because an injury to any other, non-\u201cvocationally disabled,\u201d employee would result in indefinite liability to the employer, the limited penalty suffered by the employer who fails to comply with the notice requirement does not seem unreasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the employer essentially derives a benefit under the WDCA by hiring the vocationally disabled employee, in that its liability ordinarily ceases after fifty-two weeks in the face of a second injury, it does not seem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>unreasonable to require the employer to comply with the act in order to receive such benefit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">I am not oblivious to the argument that the interpretation in this dissent accords inadequate consideration to the \u201cshall be limited to those benefits accruing during the period of 52 weeks after the date of injury\u201d language in \u00a7 921. There is simply no perfect interpretation of this confusing statute, merely a less imperfect and a more imperfect interpretation. I believe that the interpretation here accords at least some meaning to the \u201cshall\u201d language in <em>both </em>\u00a7 921 and \u00a7 925(1), while the majority\u2019s interpretation effectively ignores the \u201cshall\u201d language in \u00a7 925(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the dismissal of the fund from the suit, and hold that the fund became liable for plaintiffs benefits ninety days after Oakwood provided the notice required under \u00a7 925(1).

Notwithstanding that the carrier had no knowledge of the injury until long after the notice provision of \u00a7 925(1) had expired, the fund was dismissed from the suit because the carrier had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>not provided timely notice.

Rather, as has been made clear, the employer\u2019s liability would continue beyond fifty-two weeks only until such time as the carrier has complied with the notice requirements of \u00a7 925. The fund would then become hable ninety days after the carrier has provided the notice required by the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b872-9\"> The majority asserts that this interpretation would be neither \u201creasonable\u201d nor \u201cequitable\u201d in situations in which the carrier and the employer were not the same party, because in such situations the failure of the carrier to provide timely notice would result in hability to the employer. <em>Ante </em>at 696 n 7. By this observation, the majority treats the employers of this state as essentially passive participants in the marketplace, incapable of protecting their own economic interests without the strained interpretations of this Court. Employers are perfectly capable of contracting with their own carriers, as well as utilizing the legal process where necessary, to ensure that the risks of liability in cases such as this one fall upon the party whose failure to comply with its statutory duty caused liability. Further, unlike what occurred in this case, there is nothing to prevent an employer from simply monitoring its carrier with regard to the typically few injured, vocationally disabled employees employed by an employer to ensure that the carrier carries out the required notification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b873-6\"> The majority implies that the fund will not be prejudiced by a delay in notification, because under MCL 418.925(2), the fund \u201cmay dispute an employee\u2019s eligibility for payment\u201d at any time. <em>Ante </em>at 698. However, the majority fails to consider that one of the purposes of the notice requirement is to allow the fund to timely investigate the validity of such claims. While it may be true that the fund may dispute an employee\u2019s eligibility for payments at any time, evidentiary concerns too obvious to state suggest that the fund is in a better position to dispute such eligibility if the investigation comes sooner rather than later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b873-7\"> The majority struggles to accord some modicum of meaning to \u00a7 925(1). It suggests that the \u201cLegislature intended several consequences for failure to give notice under \u00a7 925(1).\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 697. First, it suggests that the loss of the temporary use of the carrier\u2019s money serves as an adequate sanction. <em>Ante </em>at 697-698. If the majority is correct that the Legislature intended as a sanction the loss of interest on certain benefits paid out, then the majority has discerned a sanction that is most noticeable by its absence from the language of the statute, and which sanction is a notably ineffectual one to boot.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Second, the majority suggests that another sanction exists in cases in which an employee becomes ineligible for benefits after fifty-two weeks, because \u201c[i]f the employee is not eligible, there is no liability to pay benefits under MCL 418.921.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 698. However, in characterizing the Legislature\u2019s unremarkable decision that fraudulent claims should not be reimbursed as a \u201cconsequence\u201d of untimely notification, the majority'misapprehends the statutory scheme.
