First, we must address whether a single detachment petition and a single vote on that petition, pursuant to the terms of the Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>et seq., </em>may encompass territory to be detached from one city and added to more than one township.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, if a single detachment petition and a single vote may encompass territory to be added to more than one township, we must determine whether a writ of mandamus compels the Secretary of State to issue a notice directing an election on the change of boundaries sought by plaintiffs in each case. Because we conclude that the Home Rule City Act does not allow a single detachment petition and a single vote on detachment for adding territory to multiple townships, mandamus is not proper in these cases. Accordingly, the decisions of the Court of Appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">I. STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"A0ik\">\n<em>CASCO TWP v SECRETARY OF STATE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Plaintiffs in this case are two adjacent townships\u2014 Casco Township and Columbus Township \u2014 and residents of those townships who seek to detach territory from defendant city of Richmond. The territory sought to be detached is territory that was previously annexed to the city of Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Plaintiffs seek to present the ballot issue covering both townships in a single petition. This would result in a single vote about whether to detach territory from the city of Richmond and add the territory to Casco Township and Columbus Township. The residents of one township would be voting on the return of property to their township, as well as the return of property to a township in which they do not reside. The Secretary of State refused to approve an election on plaintiffs\u2019 petition because an election on the petition would allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>residents of one township to vote on, and possibly determine, a change in the boundaries of another township in which they do not reside.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Plaintiffs filed a complaint for mandamus and declaratory relief. The circuit court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for mandamus to compel the Secretary of State to act because it was not clear that a single petition seeking detachment from a city and addition of the territory to two townships was permitted by the Home Rule City Act. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit court. <em>Casco Twp v Secretary of State, </em>261 Mich App 386; 682 NW2d 546 (2004). We granted plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal and ordered that the case be argued and submitted with <em>Fillmore Twp v Secretary of State, </em>471 Mich 890 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">\n<em>FILLMORE TWP v SECRETARY OF STATE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Plaintiffs are Fillmore Township and electors from four townships \u2014 Fillmore Township, Holland Charter Township, Park Township, and Laketown Township\u2014 and the city of Holland who want to detach territory from the city of Holland and add the territory to the four townships. Plaintiffs filed a joint detachment petition with the Secretary of State, asking that the petition be certified and that a single election be held regarding the territory that was proposed to be detached from the city of Holland. The Secretary of State refused to certify the petition because the petition involved an effort to detach territory for addition to more than one township.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Plaintiffs filed a complaint for mandamus in the Court of Appeals, and the complaint was held in abeyance pending the decision in the <em>Casco Twp </em>case. Unpublished order, entered May 19, 2003 (Docket No. 245640). Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was subsequently denied by the Court of Appeals on the basis of the <em>Casco Twp </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>decision. Unpublished order, entered May 6, 2004 (Docket No. 245640). We granted plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal and ordered that the case be argued and submitted with the <em>Casco Twp </em>case. 471 Mich 890 (2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">H. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The proper interpretation of a statutory provision is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Lincoln v Gen Motors Corp, </em>461 Mich 483, 489-490; 607 NW2d 73 (2000). A trial court\u2019s decision regarding a writ of mandamus is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re MCI Telecom Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396, 443; 596 NW2d 164 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">These cases involve an issue of statutory interpretation. The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Id. </em>at 411. The first step is to review the language of the statute. If the statutory language is unambiguous, the Legislature is presumed to have intended the meaning expressed in the statute and judicial construction is not permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">The Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 <em>et seq., </em>addresses four processes \u2014 incorporation, consolidation, annexation, and detachment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The issue before this Court pertains only to the process of detachment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Detachment means that territory is taken from an existing city and added to an existing township.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Section 6 of the Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.6, provides that a detachment be initiated by \u201cproceedings originating by petition therefor signed by <em>qualified electors </em>who are freeholders residing within the cities, villages, or townships to be affected thereby . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Notably, MCL 117.8 and MCL 117.11 delineate the procedure for submitting a petition for a change of boundaries. MCL 117.8(1) provides in relevant part that \u201cthe board shall, by resolution, provide that the question of making the proposed incorporation, consolidation, or change of boundaries be submitted to the <em>qualified electors </em>of the district to be affected at the next general election or at a special election before the next general election.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Likewise, MCL 117.11(2) provides that \u201cthe question of making the incorporation, consolidation, or change of boundaries petitioned for shall be submitted to the <em>electors </em>of the district to be affected.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Michigan election law defines a qualified elector as \u201cany person who possesses the qualifications of an elector as prescribed in section 1 of article 2 of the state constitution and who has resided in the city or township 30 days.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> MCL 168.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Because Casco Township voters do not reside in Columbus Township, they are not \u201cqualified electors\u201d of Columbus Township who can sign a petition and vote on the detachment of territory from the city of Richmond for addition of the territory to Columbus Township. Likewise, because Columbus Township voters do not reside in Casco Township, they are not . \u201cqualified electors\u201d of Casco Township who can sign a petition and vote on the detachment of territory from the city of Richmond for addition of the territory to Casco Township. Therefore, a single petition and a single vote on multiple detachments violate the statutory language of the Home Rule City Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Additional support for this position is found in the statutory language used in other parts of the Home Rule City Act. MCL 117.9(1) defines the \u201cdistrict to be affected\u201d as the following: \u201cThe district to be affected by every such proposed incorporation, consolidation, or <em>change </em>of boundaries shall be deemed to include the whole of each city, village, or township from which <em>territory </em>is to be taken or to which <em>territory </em>is to be annexed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">A <em>change </em>of boundaries for the district to be affected encompasses only one city and one township because a township\u2019s voters can be qualified electors only in relation to their own township\u2019s proposed change of boundaries and are <em>affected </em>only by their own township\u2019s proposed change of boundaries. Therefore, it is only plausible that the \u201cdistrict to be affected\u201d encompasses one city and one township. Accordingly, a single detachment petition and a single vote may only encompass territory to be added to one township.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Language in MCL 117.13, which sets forth the procedure following an election, further supports the principle that each township is considered a separate entity and there must be separate votes with respect to the territory to be detached from one city and added to each township. MCL 117.13 states, \u201cTerritory detached from any city shall thereupon become a part of the township or village from which it was originally taken ... .\u201d This indicates that the \u201cdistrict to be affected\u201d is limited to the city in which the territory is located and the single township that seeks the return of the territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Further, interpreting the \u201cdistrict to be affected\u201d in detachment proceedings as the city from which the territory is to be detached and the township to which the territory is to be added recognizes that the consequences of detachment may be quite different for each township that seeks to gain property. For example, property rights and liabilities must be adjusted between the city and the township when there is a detachment. MCL 123.1. Debts must be apportioned and land may need to be sold. MCL 123.2; MCL 123.3. The potential for dramatically different consequences of detachment is clearly indicated in the <em>Fillmore Twp </em>case. Four townships seek to detach land from the city of Holland. The Fillmore Township parcel is 1,054 acres, the Holland Charter Township parcel is 3.33 acres, the Park Township parcel is 1.27 acres, and the Laketown Township parcel is 0.77 acres. It is reasonable to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>that the effect of detachment will be quite different when one parcel is 1,054 acres and one parcel is a mere 0.77 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Moreover, allowing a single petition and a single vote on detachment from one city for the addition of territory to multiple townships does not allow voters to render a vote in support of the addition of territory to only one township. MCL 168.643a requires, in relevant part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">A question submitted to the electors of this state or the electors of a subdivision of this state shall, to the extent that it will not confuse the electorate, be worded so that a \u201cyes\u201d vote will be a vote in favor of the subject matter of the proposal or issue and a \u201cno\u201d vote will be a vote against the subject matter of the proposal or issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">However, a single vote on detaching territory from one city and adding the territory to multiple townships does not allow a voter who may only favor one of the multiple additions of territory to cast a \u201cyes\u201d vote. As stated by this Court in <em>Muskegon Pub Schools v Vander Loan, </em>211 Mich 85, 87; 178 NW 424 (1920), \u201cSeparate subjects, separate purposes, or independent propositions should not be combined so that one may gather votes for the other.\u201d In <em>Yonder Laan, </em>this Court noted that the erection of three new school buildings showed a common purpose and were part of a comprehensive plan to meet the educational needs of the city. In contrast, we find that detaching territory from one city and adding the territory to multiple townships does not indicate a common purpose because the needs and consequences of the additions to various townships may differ remarkably. Combining multiple additions of territory in a single detachment petition so that there is only a single vote indeed combines independent propositions \u201cso that one may gather votes for the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>When put into context, the text of the Home Rule City Act is unambiguous \u2014 a petition and a vote about detachment must involve only one city and one township. A contrary reading of the statutory language belies the fact that there will <em>always </em>be two parties to a detachment \u2014 the city and the township. Justice YQUNG\u2019s focus on the word \u201ceach\u201d in the statute ignores that the provisions must be read in context. Interpreting the word \u201ceach\u201d to mean that a detachment petition can encompass more than one township is contrary to the statutory language that relates to qualified electors and ignores the fact that the Home Rule City Act encompasses four distinct procedures-incorporation, consolidation, annexation, and detachment. Language in the statute that at first may appear to indicate that multiple townships may be involved in a single detachment petition and a single vote must be read in context and in consideration of the statutory language regarding qualified electors. Significantly, residents of one township are not qualified electors in a detachment proceeding when it comes to determining a change of boundaries for another township, and the statute cannot properly be interpreted in this manner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Further, Justice YOUNG\u2019s reliance on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Walsh v Secretary of State, </em>355 Mich 570, 574; 95 NW2d 511 (1959), is misplaced. <em>Walsh </em>dealt with annexation, not detachment. Notably, in the multiple-township annexation at issue in <em>Walsh, </em>the votes of each territory were considered separately. In essence, a single township could \u201cveto\u201d the annexation fromtaking place, no matter how many voters approved of the annexation in other townships. In contrast, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>detachment procedure at issue in these cases, the voters in a township have no \u201cveto\u201d power. The wishes of an entire township could effectively be ignored because voters in other townships believe that a detachment would be in their best interests. The \u201cpackage\u201d proposal in <em>Walsh </em>is hardly analogous to the detachment proceedings at issue in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Our conclusion that a single detachment petition and a single vote on that petition may only encompass territory to be added to one township is in accord with the unambiguous statutory language. Thus, the Legislature is presumed to have intended the meaning expressed in the statute and judicial construction is not permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Finally, a writ of mandamus could be properly issued in these cases only if plaintiffs proved that (1) they had a clear legal right to the performance of the specific duty that they sought to be compelled, and (2) the Secretary of State had a clear legal duty to perform the act. <em>In re MCI, supra </em>at 442-443. Because the Home Rule City Act does not allow a single detachment petition and a single vote on that petition to encompass territory to be detached from one city and added to more than one township, there was no clear legal right to have the Secretary of State authorize each petition for a single vote. Therefore, there was no clear legal duty that required the Secretary of State to act, and the writs of mandamus were properly denied in both cases before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 <em>et seq., </em>does not allow a single petition and a single vote to encompass detachment of territory from a city for the addition of that territory to multiple townships; thus, the Secre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>tary of State did not have a clear legal duty to act. Therefore, mandamus was not an appropriate remedy. Accordingly, the decisions of the Court of Appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b740-5\">Taylor, C.J., and Weaver, Kelly, Corrigan, and Mark-man, JJ., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> While the Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 <em>et seq., </em>addresses various processes, the issue before this Court pertains solely to the process of detachment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b733-10\"> Justice Young states that the majority \u201cfails to convey adequately the true character of the boundary disputes at issue.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 579. Yet the relevant facts are conveyed, and it is of no import if the history of these cases was contentious or of a calculated nature. The statutory analysis is the same whether the parties were friends, foes, or something in between.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b733-11\"> Recent amendments to the act do not affect the issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b734-6\"> Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 1 provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">Every citizen of the United States who has attained the age of 21 years, who has resided in this state six months, and who meets the requirements of local residence provided by law, shall be an elector and qualified to vote in any election except as otherwise provided in this constitution.

See, e.g., <em>City of Lake Wales v Florida Citrus Canners Coop, </em>191 So 2d 453, 457 (Fla App, 1966) (A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>qualified elector in area 1 cannot vote for the annexation in area 2 because the area 1 voter is not within the territory affected.); <em>People ex rel Smith v City of San Jose, </em>100 Cal App 2d 57, 60; 222 P2d 947 (1950) (An annexation election was improperly held because voters had to vote for the annexation of two parcels and could not vote separately for the annexation of each parcel.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b738-5\"> This is consistent with principles espoused in past cases from this Court. See, e.g., <em>Robertson v Baxter, </em>57 Mich 127, 129; 23 NW 711 (1885) (\u201cNo person not hying in the township has any voice in its affairs.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b740-6\">YOUNG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afi\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>We granted leave to appeal in these consolidated cases to determine whether (1) the Home Rule City Act (HRCA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permits the use of a single detachment petition and election when the territory to be detached from a city is to be transferred to more than one township and, (2) if such a procedure is allowed under the HRCA, whether plaintiffs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are entitled to mandamus relief. I agree with the majority that plaintiffs are not entitled to writs of mandamus because I believe that any request for mandamus relief is premature at this time. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the HRCA does not permit the use of a single detachment petition and vote thereon when transferring land to multiple townships.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The Legislature was well aware of the political gamesmanship that occurs between municipalities in the context of boundary disputes. Indeed, our Constitution was changed to free the Legislature from this political quagmire.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By enacting the HRCA, the Legislature established a standardized procedure to effectuate such changes in a manner that it viewed as fair and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>reasonable. A plain reading of <em>all </em>relevant language in the HRCA demonstrates that the use of a single detachment petition when transferring land to multiple townships is permitted. The Court of Appeals focused only-on select text in the HRCA and thereby gave the statute a particular meaning that is insupportable when one considers <em>all </em>the language used by the Legislature in the HRCA. Its exercise in selective statutory interpretation not only undermines the Legislature\u2019s intent in passing the HRCA, but also injects the judiciary\u2014 armed only with ill-defined notions of \u201cfairness\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d \u2014 as a referee in the inherently political, contentious, and tactical process of altering municipal boundaries. The majority opinion, while avoiding explicit reliance on extra-textual policy justifications, does not, in my view, give full meaning to all the relevant words in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that a single detachment petition involving multiple townships is not permitted under the HRCA. In <em>Casco Twp, </em>I would grant the plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory relief and deny their claim for a writ of mandamus. In <em>Fillmore Twp, </em>because the plaintiffs only sought a writ of mandamus, I would deny entirely their request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The majority fails to convey adequately the true character of the boundary disputes at issue. By glossing over much of the relevant history, the majority understates the inherently political and calculated nature of the disputes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>A. <em>CASCO TWP v SECRETARY OF STATE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The land at issue in this case has a long, contentious history. In July 1996, intervening defendants, Walter and Patricia Winkle, filed a petition with the State Boundary Commission (SBC) seeking to annex to the city of Richmond approximately 157 acres of land that they and other residents owned in Casco Township and Columbus Township. The Winkles hoped to develop their land for commercial, use, but believed that commercial development could not occur unless their property was connected to the water and sewer lines offered by the city of Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Before the Winkles\u2019 July 1996 petition, however, Columbus Township and neighboring Lenox Township had entered into an agreement pursuant to 1984 PA 425 to transfer land from Columbus Township to Lenox Township.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A similar 425 agreement was reached between Casco Township and Lenox Township. These 425 agreements were designed to prevent future annexations, such as the one initiated by the Winkles in July 1996. In November 1997, the SBC determined that the 425 agreements were invalid and decided instead to approve the annexation petition filed by the Winkles.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After protracted litigation, the SBC\u2019s decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>eventually upheld by the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals found that the 425 agreements between the townships of Columbus, Casco, and Lenox were \u201csham[s]\u201d and \u201cessentially an attempt to avoid annexation,\u201d and upheld the SBC\u2019s decision approving the annexation initiated by the Winkles.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In July 2001, this Court denied leave to appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">In December 2001, plaintiffs filed a single detachment petition with the Secretary of State, seeking to transfer from the city of Richmond to Casco Township and Columbus Township the same land that was involved in the prior annexation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The disputed territory consisted of approximately eighty-seven acres in Casco Township and seventy acres in Columbus Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Unsure whether the HRCA permitted the use of a single detachment petition to transfer land to multiple townships, the Secretary of State requested an official opinion from the Attorney General interpreting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>HRCA. Citing a pending lawsuit in Eaton County, Michigan, involving a factually similar dispute,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the Attorney General\u2019s policy of declining to issue opinions that might affect ongoing litigation, the Attorney General refused to issue a formal opinion construing the HRCA. However, in a May 2002 memorandum to the Department of State, Bureau of Elections, the Attorney General\u2019s Office provided \u201cinformal advice\u201d regarding the use of a single detachment petition. Recognizing that there were \u201cno cases directly on point that specifically address the issue,\u201d the memorandum informed the Department of State that it was \u201creasonable to refuse to certify\u201d the petition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Secretary of State subsequently notified the plaintiffs that she would not certify the detachment petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The following month, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Ingham Circuit Court, seeking declaratory and mandamus relief against the defendants. After holding a hearing, the circuit court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for mandamus relief, ruling that the HRCA was not \u201cpatently clear\u201d regarding whether a single detachment petition may be used to transfer land to more than one township. The circuit court then dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit without having addressed their request for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals, claiming that the circuit court erred in denying their request for mandamus relief and in dismissing their lawsuit without deciding their request for declaratory relief. In divided opinions, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals majority held that the HRCA was ambiguous as to whether a single detachment petition was permitted. Given the ambiguity, the majority decided that it \u201cmust consider the object of the statute and apply a reasonable construction that is logical and best accomplishes the HRCA\u2019s purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Acknowledging that there was \u201cno case law that directly addresse[d] the current situation,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the majority concluded that it was \u201cclearly unfair\u201d to allow the use of a single detachment petition when transferring land to multiple townships.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court of Appeals denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for mandamus relief. The Court of Appeals further held that the circuit court had \u201cimplicitly\u201d denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory relief and affirmed the circuit court\u2019s ruling denying declaratory relief.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The dissent disagreed with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the HRCA was ambiguous and noted that the plain text of the HRCA permitted the use of a single detachment petition to transfer land to multiple townships. We granted leave to appeal and consolidated the case with <em>Fillmore Twp v Secretary of State.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>B. <em>FILLMORE TWP v SECRETARY OF STATE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">As with the territory involved in the companion case of <em>Casco Twp v Secretary of State, </em>the disputed territory in this case also has a complex history. In 1997, Fillmore Township and the city of Holland entered into a 425 agreement through which land in Fillmore Township was to be transferred to Holland. Pursuant to the referendum provision in 1984 PA 425, qualified electors in Fillmore Township filed a petition calling for a referendum on the 425 agreement with the city of Holland. The voters ultimately defeated the 425 agreement in the referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Several months after the 425 agreement was defeated, in late 1998, landowners in Fillmore Township filed petitions with the SBC to annex approximately 1.100 acres to the city of Holland. The SBC approved the annexation, thereby transferring approximately 1.100 acres from Fillmore Township to Holland. Seeking to reverse the annexation effected by the SBC\u2019s decision, in February 2000, electors in Fillmore Township filed a petition with the Secretary of State to detach the land that was previously annexed. In August 2000, voters in Fillmore and Holland defeated the detachment proposal by a vote of 3,917 to 2,614.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">In October 2002, the plaintiffs submitted a single detachment petition to the Secretary of State,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> again hoping to detach from the city of Holland the territory that was previously annexed from Fillmore Township. In addition to the Fillmore Township-city of Holland detachment, however, the petition also included three smaller detachments by which land would be detached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>from the city of Holland and added to Laketown Township, Park Township, and Holland Charter Township. Because the HRCA provides that \u201cthe <em>whole </em>of each city, village, or township\u201d to be affected by the detachment is entitled to vote,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> by adding the additional three townships to the single detachment petition, the voting base for the detachment election was greatly expanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The following table summarizes the acreage to be transferred by the detachment and the number of voters that would be added to the voting base by including each additional township in the single detachment petition:<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b747-25\">Thus, by including the three additional townships and detaching only an extra 5.37 acres, the voting base of the district to be affected would be expanded by an additional 31,376 voters over what the voting base would be if only Fillmore Township and the city of Holland were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-26\">In November 2002, the Secretary of State refused to certify the detachment petition, relying on the September 2002 decision by the circuit court disallowing the use of a single detachment petition in <em>Casco Twp. </em>In response to the Secretary of State\u2019s refusal to certify the petition, the plaintiffs filed an original mandamus action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>in the Court of Appeals seeking to have the Court order the Secretary of State to certify the petition and schedule an election. The Court of Appeals ordered that the plaintiffs\u2019 case be held in abeyance pending its resolution of <em>Casco Twp. </em>In March 2004, the Court of Appeals issued its opinion in <em>Casco Twp, </em>affirming the circuit court\u2019s decision disallowing the use of a single detachment petition. Citing its opinion in <em>Casco Twp, </em>the Court of Appeals then denied the plaintiffs mandamus relief by order in May 2004.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We granted leave to appeal and consolidated the case with <em>Casco Twp v Secretary of State.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Whether the HRCA permits the use of a single detachment petition to transfer land to multiple townships is a matter of statutory interpretation, which is a question of law that is reviewed by this Court de novo.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The constitutionality of the HRCA\u2019s detachment procedure is also a question of law that is subject to review de novo.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This Court reviews a lower court\u2019s decision regarding a request for mandamus relief for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>A. THE HECA AND THE SINGLE DETACHMENT PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"As1\">1. HISTORY OF THE HRCA</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The HRCA, enacted in 1909, is an intricate statute that has been amended in piecemeal fashion numerous times over the past century. Before the enactment of the HRCA, the Legislature directly enacted municipal boundary changes on a case-by-case basis through special legislation. Delegates to the 1907-1908 constitutional convention recognized the substantial burden this process imposed, as well as the confusion that resulted from hundreds of pieces of such special legislation. The convention\u2019s Address to the People stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">One of the greatest evils brought to the attention of the Convention was the abuse practiced under local and special legislation. The number of local and special bills passed by the last legislature was <em>four hundred fourteen, </em>not including joint and concurrent resolutions. The time devoted to the consideration of these measures and the time required in their passage through , the two houses imposed a serious burden upon the state. This section [prohibiting the enactment of special acts when a general act can be made applicable], taken in connection with the increased powers of local self-government granted to cities and villages in the revision, seeks to effectively remedy such condition. . . . The evils of local and special legislation have grown to be almost intolerable, introducing uncertainty and confusion into the laws, and consuming the time and energy of the legislature which should be devoted to the consideration of measures of a general character. By eliminating this mass of legislation, the work of the legislature will be greatly simplified and improved.<footnotemark>[27]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Based on this overwhelming dissatisfaction with special legislation as a means to adjust municipal boundaries, delegates to the 1907-1908 constitutional convention debated whether to direct the Legislature to enact a general municipal boundary statute that would provide a framework for all future municipal boundary changes. The delegates proposed, and the people of Michigan eventually ratified, Const 1908, art 8, \u00a7 20, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\">The legislature shall provide by a general law for the incorporation of cities, and by a general law for the incorporation of villages....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">With art 8, \u00a7 20 as a constitutional mandate, the Legislature enacted the HRCA the following year in order to establish a comprehensive, standardized procedure for initiating and approving all changes to municipal boundaries, including incorporations, annexations, detachments, and consolidations.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">2. RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE HRCA</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">As the majority correctly notes, three provisions of the HRCA are directly relevant in the present case. The detachment process is specifically authorized by \u00a7 6 of the HRCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Cities may be incorporated <em>or territory detached therefrom. </em>or added thereto, or consolidation made of 2 or more cities or villages into 1 city, or of a city and 1 or more villages into 1 city, or of 1 or more cities or villages together with additional territory not included within any incorporated city or village into 1 city, by proceedings originating by petition therefor signed by qualified electors who are freeholders residing within the cities, villages, or townships to be affected thereby... <footnotemark>[29]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">However, because both the city of Richmond and the city of Holland are located in more than one county, rather than filing their detachment petitions with the county under \u00a7 6, plaintiffs in both cases were required to file their petitions with the Secretary of State pursuant to \u00a7 11 of the HRCA. At the time of the present lawsuits, \u00a7 11 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">When the territory to be affected by any proposed incorporation, consolidation, or change is situated in more than 1 county the petition hereinbefore provided shall be addressed and presented to the secretary of state, with 1 or more affidavits attached thereto sworn to by 1 or more of the signers of said petition, showing that the statements contained in said petition are true, that each signature affixed thereto is the genuine signature of a qualified elector residing in a city, village, or township to be affected by the carrying out of the purposes of the petition and that not less than 25 of such signers reside in each city, village or township to be affected thereby. The secretary of state shall examine such petition and the affidavit or affidavits annexed, and if he shall find that the same conforms to the provisions of this act he shall so certify, and transmit a certified copy of said petition and the accompanying affidavit or affidavits to the clerk of <em>each </em>city, village or township to be affected by the carrying out of the purposes of such petition, together with his certificate as above provided, and a notice directing that at the next general election occurring not less than 40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>days thereafter the question of making the incorporation, consolidation or change of boundaries petitioned for shall be submitted to the electors of <em>the district to he affected, </em>and if no general election is to be held within 90 days the resolution may fix a date preceding the next general election for a special election on the question. If he shall find that said petition and the affidavit or affidavits annexed thereto do not conform to the provisions of this act he shall certify to that fact, and return said petition and affidavits to the person from whom they were received, together with such certificate. The <em>several </em>city, village and township clerks who shall receive from the secretary of state the copies and certificates above provided for shall give notice of the election to be held on the question of making the proposed incorporation, consolidation or change of boundaries as provided for in section 10 of this act.<footnotemark>[30]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Lastly, the phrase \u201cdistrict to be affected,\u201d as used in \u00a7 11, is defined by \u00a7 9 of the HRCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">The district to be affected by the proposed incorporation, consolidation, or change of boundaries is considered to include the whole of <em>each </em>city, village, or township from which territory is to be taken or to which territory is to be annexed.<footnotemark>[31]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">3. PRINCIPLES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">When interpreting a statute, a court\u2019s duty is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature based on the actual words used in the statute.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, no further con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>struction is necessary or permitted.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The statute is enforced as written.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It is the duty of the judiciary to interpret, not write, the law.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In <em>Lansing Mayor v Pub Service Comm, </em>this Court repudiated prior case law that held that a statute is ambiguous if it is susceptible to more than one meaning or if \u201creasonable minds can differ\u201d regarding the statute\u2019s meaning.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Instead, as this Court stated in <em>Lansing Mayor, </em>a statutory provision is ambiguous only if it \u201c \u2018irreconcilably conflict^]\u2019 with another provision, or when it is <em>equally </em>susceptible to more than a single meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In ascertaining whether an ambiguity exists, therefore, a court must employ conventional rules of construction and \u201cgive effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a statute.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">4. THE PLAIN TEXT OF THE HRCA PERMITS THE USE OF A SINGLE DETACHMENT PETITION TO TRANSFER LAND TO MULTIPLE TOWNSHIPS</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">At its core, the Court of Appeals opinion in <em>Casco Twp </em>represents a deliberate decision to subordinate the actual text of the HRCA in favor of the Court of Appeals\u2019 own abstract notions of fairness and justice. By choosing to give meaning to only <em>some </em>of the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>in the HRCA and ignoring others, the Court of Appeals substituted its conception of \u201cfairness\u201d for the policy determination made by the Legislature in writing the HRCA.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> While this \u00e1 la carte method of statutory interpretation that focuses only on certain words in a statute is extraordinarily effective at allowing a court to reach a conclusion that it views as \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cjust,\u201d it is an affront to the separation of powers principle. As this Court has stated numerous times, it is the duty of the judiciary to effectuate the intent of the Legislature by giving effect to <em>every </em>\u201cword, phrase, and clause in a statute.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">A close analysis of the text of the HRCA demonstrates that the statute is not ambiguous and that a single detachment petition may be used to detach land from a city and add it to multiple townships. Although the majority focuses extensively on \u00a7 9 of the HRCA,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> the majority notably fails to give full effect to the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201ceach\u201d in \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The section of the HRCA under which plaintiffs filed their petitions, \u00a7 11, provides that \u201cthe question of making the incorporation, consolidation or change of boundaries petitioned for, shall be submitted to the electors of <em>the district to be affected . . </em>. .\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 9, the HRCA defines \u201cthe district to be affected\u201d as \u201cinclud[ing] the whole of <em>each </em>city, village, or township from which territory is to be taken or to which territory is to be annexed.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> By defining \u201cthe district to be affected\u201d as including the whole of \u201ceach\u201d city, village, or township, the Legislature contemplated that \u201cthe district to be affected\u201d could include <em>multiple </em>townships in a detachment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The word \u201ceach\u201d is not defined in the HRCA. Pursuant to MCL 8.3a, undefined statutory terms are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning, unless, of course, the undefined word is a term of art.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Because \u201ceach\u201d is not a term of art, this Court must therefore give the word its plain meaning. As this Court stated in <em>Horace v City of Pontiac,</em><footnotemark><em>45</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c[w]hen considering a nonlegal word or phrase that is not defined within a statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>resort to a layman\u2019s dictionary... is appropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Moreover, it is appropriate to use a dictionary from the period contemporaneous to the statute\u2019s enactment in order to give full effect to the intent of the Legislature that enacted the statute.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Although the HRCA has been amended frequently over the past century, the relevant provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 11 have remained unchanged in the HRCA since 1909, the year the HRCA was originally enacted. The word \u201ceach\u201d is defined by <em>The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary </em>as <em>\u201cevery </em>one of a number considered separately, all.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> <em>The Century Dictionary </em>defines \u201ceach\u201d as \u201cBeing either or any unit of a numerical aggregate consisting of two or <em>more, </em>indefinitely.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> <em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language </em>defines \u201ceach\u201d as \u201cBeing one of two <em>or more . . . Every </em>one of any number or aggregation. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>It is clear, therefore, that the word \u201ceach,\u201d as used in 1909, means \u201call\u201d and \u201cevery,\u201d and plainly encompasses <em>multiple </em>entities. Indeed, by using \u201ceach\u201d in \u00a7 9, the Legislature effectively said, as a definitional matter, that \u201cthe district to be affected\u201d is to be comprised of \u201call\u201d or \u201cevery\u201d city, village, or township affected by the boundary change. The \u201cdistrict\u201d is not limited to a predetermined number, but rather includes <em>every </em>municipal entity from which territory is to be taken or to which territory is to be added. Thus, while \u201cthe district to be affected\u201d can certainly contain just two municipal entities, it can also include <em>more than </em>two entities.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Defendants argue that the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201ceach\u201d is not determinative because, by using \u201ceach,\u201d the Legislature was simply referring to the two municipal entities that necessarily must be involved in any detachment proceeding: the city that will lose the land and the township that will gain the land.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 argument is unpersuasive. Had the Legislature intended \u201ceach\u201d to refer only to the two sides involved in a typical detachment proceeding \u2014 the donor city and the recipient township \u2014 and not to multiple recipient townships, the Legislature would have used the word \u201cboth,\u201d not \u201ceach.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The Legislature, however, did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>limit \u201cthe district to be affected\u201d to only two municipal entities by using the word \u201cboth.\u201d Instead, it deliberately used the distributive adjective \u201ceach,\u201d thereby referring to <em>every </em>municipality affected. It is only by assuming that \u201ceach\u201d refers exclusively to the donor and recipient municipalities in a <em>conventional </em>detachment proceeding that the majority position may be sustained. There is no textual basis for making this assumption or otherwise limiting the customary meaning of \u201ceach.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>This construction of the HRCA is bolstered by the fact that, throughout \u00a7 11, the words \u201cpetition\u201d and \u201celection\u201d are used in the singular even though the words \u201ceach\u201d and \u201cseveral\u201d are used in the same sentences when modifying \u201ccity, village or township.\u201d For example, \u00a7 11 states that the Secretary of State must transmit \u201ca certified copy of said <em>petition </em>... to the clerk of <em>each </em>city, village or township to be affected by the carrying out of the purposes of such <em>petition </em>. .. ,\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Section 11 further provides that \u201c[t]he <em>several </em>city, village and township clerks ... shall give notice of <em>the election </em>to be held . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> While it is true that MCL 8.3b states that, in construing statutes, \u201c[e]very word importing the singular number only may extend to and embrace the plural number,\u201d it is important to remember that MCL 8.3b is <em>permissive, </em>not mandatory. MCL 8.3b states only that the singular \u201cmay\u201d extend to the plural.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">This Court addressed MCL 8.3b in <em>Robinson, </em>in which we construed the phrase <em>\u201cthe </em>proximate cause\u201d within the context of the governmental immunity statute.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> As we noted in <em>Robinson, </em>MCL 8.3b \u201conly states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>that a word importing the singular number \u2018may extend\u2019 to the plural. The statute does not say that such an automatic understanding is required.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> We went on to hold that MCL 8.3 \u201cprovides that the rule stated in \u00a7 3b shall be observed \u2018unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> This Court concluded that because the Legislature chose to use the definite article \u201cthe\u201d within the phrase \u201cthe proximate cause,\u201d it \u201cclearly evince[d] an intent to focus on <em>one </em>cause.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The same is true in the present case. In \u00a7 11, the Legislature consistently referred to \u201cpetition\u201d in the singular and used the phrase <em>\u201cthe </em>election.\u201d There is no principled basis by which to say that \u201cthe\u201d means \u201cone\u201d in <em>Robinson, </em>but \u201cthe\u201d does not mean \u201cone\u201d when referring to <em>\u201cthe </em>election\u201d mandated by \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Taken together, all of these textual clues demonstrate that the HRCA permits the use of a <em>single </em>detachment petition and election when transferring land to more than one township. Unlike the majority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>which focuses only on select words in the HRCA, I believe that this Court is obligated to give effect to <em>every </em>word the Legislature used in writing the HRCA. I would hold, therefore, that the Court of Appeals erred in finding that the HRCA is ambiguous. No provision of the HRCA conflicts, irreconcilably or otherwise, with any other provision of the HRCA. Nor is the HRCA <em>equally </em>susceptible to more than a single meaning. A plain reading of \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 11 demonstrates that the procedure used by plaintiffs in the present cases is permissible under the HRCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">The majority casually dismisses this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Walsh v Secretary of State,</em><footnotemark><em>61</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which explicitly recognized and permitted a single petition for a multiple-municipality annexation under the HRCA. In <em>Walsh, </em>we examined \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 11 of the HRCA. The case involved an annexation by the city of Lansing in which it sought to acquire four parcels of land from Lansing Township and one parcel situated in both Lansing Township and Delta Township. A <em>single </em>petition was filed with the Secretary of State for this multiple-township annexation. Although voters in the city of Lansing and Lansing Township approved the annexation, voters in Delta Township did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The plaintiffs in <em>Walsh </em>argued that the annexation attempt was divisible and that we should approve the annexation of the parcels in Lansing Township, given that the Lansing Township voters approved the annexation. This Court disagreed. We held that the annexation was a \u201cpackage proposition\u201d and that, under the vote tabulation provisions of \u00a7 9 in effect at the time, if any one of the \u201cvoting units\u201d voted against the proposal, the whole proposal failed.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>While it is true that <em>Walsh </em>involved an analogous annexation rather than a detachment, and that the primary focus in <em>Walsh </em>was on the vote tabulation provisions of the HRCA, not the definition of \u201cdistrict to be affected,\u201d this Court accepted the use of a single \u201cpackage\u201d petition even though the land that was to be annexed consisted of five distinct parcels in two separate townships. Accordingly, the single petition procedure used by plaintiffs in the present cases is not \u201cnovel\u201d as defendants contend. Indeed, as <em>Walsh </em>demonstrates, this Court\u2019s own case law has countenanced the use of such a procedure under the HRCA in the closely analogous annexation context.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">5. THE MAJORITY\u2019S RELIANCE ON THE HRCA\u2019S \u201cQUALIFIED ELECTOR\u201d REQUIREMENT AND THE ELEGTION CODE IS MISPLACED</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The majority bases its holding primarily on the \u201cqualified elector\u201d requirement in \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 11 of the HRCA.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Section 6 provides that detachment proceedings must be initiated by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">proceedings originating by petition therefor signed by <em>qualified electors </em>who are freeholders residing within the cities, villages, or townships to be affected thereby . .. <footnotemark>[64]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Section 11 requires affidavits showing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">each signature affixed [to the petition] is the genuine signature of a <em>qualified elector </em>residing in <em>a </em>city, village or township <em>to be affected </em>by the carrying out of the purposes of the petition and that not less than 25 of such signers reside in <em>each </em>city, village or township to be affected thereby!<footnotemark>[65]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The majority concludes that any multiple-township petition always violates the \u201cqualified elector\u201d rule because a signatory who is a qualified elector of township A is obviously not a qualified elector of township B, in that the signatory is not a resident of the territory \u201cto be affected\u201d in township B.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">The majority\u2019s analysis is flawed. The \u201cqualified elector\u201d provision of \u00a7 11 merely requires that each signatory be a qualified elector of \u201ca\u201d city, village, or township affected by the detachment and that there be at least twenty-five signatures from \u201ceach\u201d municipality affected. It is uncontested in the present cases that at least twenty-five qualified electors from <em>each </em>city and township involved signed the petitions.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> What the majority\u2019s argument is actually advancing is the unstated predicate point that the \u201cdistrict to be affected\u201d cannot encompass more than one township. However, because the Legislature has permitted the \u201cdistrict to be affected\u201d to include multiple townships, as the textual analysis above and the <em>Walsh </em>case demonstrate, then every township that is bundled into the single petition is necessarily \u201caffected\u201d within the meaning of the \u201cqualified voter\u201d provision in \u00a7 ll.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The majority\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 643a in the Michigan Election Law, MCL 168.643a, is also misplaced.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>While it is true that \u00a7 643a requires electoral questions to be submitted to voters in a \u201cyes or no\u201d format, there is no reason why a single detachment petition and referendum involving multiple townships violates this requirement. Indeed, that was the exact situation in <em>Walsh, </em>which held that the multiple-township annexation was a \u201cpackage\u201d proposition and not divisible.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">In fact, the precise case that the majority cites for its \u00a7 643a rationale-Muskegon <em>Pub Schools v Vander </em>Laan<footnotemark>69</footnotemark>-involved a multiple-issue proposal that was put to the voters in a single \u201cyes or no\u201d format and <em>upheld </em>by this Court. In <em>Vander Laan, </em>a school district bundled bonding proposals for three separate school buildings into a single question to be submitted to the voters. This Court <em>unanimously </em>approved the use of the multiple-issue proposal.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Although the <em>Vander Laan </em>Court acknowledged the rule established in other jurisdictions that \u201c[sjeparate subjects, separate purposes, or independent propositions should not be combined [in a single electoral question] so that one may gather votes for the other,\u201d it noted that there was no statutory basis for the rule in Michigan.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the <em>Vander Laan </em>Court still imposed a \u201cseparate subjects\u201d rule and ultimately <em>upheld </em>the multiple-issue proposal because it \u201cwas characterized by one common purpose ... .\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">I question the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Vander Laan </em>when the <em>Vander Laan </em>Court itself noted that there was no statutory basis for the \u201cseparate subjects\u201d electoral rule that it recognized. Rather than rely on a judicially created rule that was premised on policy concerns in an unrelated area, I prefer to base my analysis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>multiple-township detachment procedure on the actual text of the HRCA. However, to the extent that <em>Vander Laan </em>\u2014 a case that did not even involve the HRCA \u2014 is controlling in the present cases, I believe that the multiple-township detachments are in accord with its holding because the detachments are united by a \u201ccommon purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">6. DEFENDANTS\u2019 REMAINING ARGUMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Defendants argue that to construe the HRCA so as to permit a single, multiple-township petition would lead to \u201cabsurd results.\u201d However, in <em>People v </em>Mclntire,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> this Court rejected the absurd results \u201crule\u201d of construction, noting that its invocation is usually \u201c \u2018an invitation to judicial lawmaking.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> It is not the role of this Court to rewrite the law so that its resulting policy is more \u201clogical,\u201d or perhaps palatable, to a particular party or the Court. It is our constitutional role to give effect to the intent of the Legislature by enforcing the statute <em>as written.</em><footnotemark><em>75</em></footnotemark><em> </em>What defendants in these cases (or any other case) may view as \u201cabsurd\u201d reflects an actual policy choice adopted by a majority of the Legislature and approved by the Governor. If defendants prefer an alternative policy choice, the proper forum is the Legislature, not this Court. After all, the Legislature has shown little reluctance in amending the HRCA over the past century.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The defendants in <em>Fillmore Twp </em>also argue that if the detachment of 1.27 acres from the city of Holland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>for addition to Park Township is permitted, it would violate the \u201ccontiguity\u201d rule articulated by this Court in <em>Genesee Twp v Genesee Co,</em><footnotemark><em>76</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a case involving an annexation of land from Genesee Township to the city of Mt. Morris. In <em>Genesee Twp, </em>this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">\u201cSo, as to territorial extent, the idea of a city is one of unity, not of plurality; of compactness or contiguity, not separation or segregation. Contiguity is generally required even in the absence of statutory requirement to that effect, and where the annexation is left in the discretion of a judicial tribunal, contiguity will be required as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>[77]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Recognizing that the requirement of contiguity was not \u201ccovered by any specific provision of the [HRCA],\u201d the Court in <em>Genesee Twp </em>instead based its holding on non-textual policy grounds: \u201cthe purpose sought to be served [by the HRCA] and the practical aspects of annexation____\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">However, this Court revisited the contiguity rule eight years later in <em>Owosso Twp v City of Owosso.</em><footnotemark><em>79</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We specifically stated in <em>Owosso </em>that \u201cthe judicial requirement of \u2018contiguity\u2019 \u201d articulated in <em>Genesee Twp </em>had been \u201csuperseded\u201d when the Legislature amended \u00a7 9 of the HRCA in 1970.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> We found that the \u201csubstantive standards\u201d established by the \u25a0 Legislature when it amended \u00a7 9 clearly displaced the court-made contiguity rule.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Defendants in the present cases would appar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>ently have this Court ignore the legislative intent of \u00a7 9 and resuscitate the judicially created contiguity rule in the HRCA context. I would decline the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">7. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE HRCA</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Because I believe that the HRCA permits the use of a single detachment petition involving multiple townships, it is necessary to determine whether the HRCA\u2019s authorization of such a procedure is constitutional. Defendants, particularly those in <em>Fillmore Twp, </em>contend that bundling numerous townships into a single petition and referendum unconstitutionally dilutes the vote of city residents.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Defendants argue that such vote dilution is prohibited under the Equal Protection Clause of US Const, Am XIV<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Given the facts surrounding defendants\u2019 vote dilution claim, it is easy to understand their argument. As discussed in part 1(B) of this opinion, it is obvious, for example, that the plaintiffs in <em>Fillmore Twp </em>deliberately included the three additional townships\u2014 Laketown, Holland Charter, and Park \u2014 as a means to equalize the voting disparity between the city of Holland and Fillmore Township. In the initial August 2000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>detachment vote that included only the city of Holland and Fillmore Township, voters rejected the detachment by a vote of 3,917 to 2,614 (approximately sixty percent against, forty percent in favor). Recognizing that the number of voters in the city of Holland exceeded the number of voters in Fillmore Township by 19,771 to 1,854, almost a 10.7 to 1 margin, the plaintiffs bundled the three additional townships into the petition by seeking to detach an additional 5.37 acres (0.77 acres for Laketown Township, 3.33 acres for Holland Charter Township, and 1.27 acres for Park Township). By doing so, the plaintiffs were able to add an additional 31,376 township voters to the voting base of the \u201cdistrict to be affected\u201d and thereby exceed the voting base of the city of Holland. In order to evaluate defendants\u2019 claims of unconstitutional vote dilution \u2014 an issue on which Michigan courts have been relatively silent \u2014 it is necessary to explore briefly the history of federal vote dilution law under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">The idea of \u201cvote dilution\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> as a cognizable constitutional harm originated in the context of congressional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>and state legislative apportionment cases. Initially, courts refused to get involved in claims regarding vote dilution. The issue was viewed as best left for the political process and considered nonjusticiable. The leading case establishing this view was the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Colegrove v </em>Green,<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> in which voters challenged the Illinois congressional districting scheme because several of the districts were comprised of larger populations than others. Stating that the harm was one to \u201cIllinois as a polity\u201d and not a private wrong, the Court refused to intervene.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> In rejecting the notion that the Court should get involved in what it viewed as a political question, Justice Frankfurter wrote that \u201c[cjourts ought not to enter this political thicket.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> He went on to note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-4\">The remedy for unfairness in districting is to secure State legislatures that will apportion properly, or to invoke the-ample powers of Congress.. .. The Constitution has left the performance of many duties in our governmental scheme to depend on the fidelity of the executive and legislative action and, ultimately, on the vigilance of the people in exercising their political rights.<footnotemark>[89]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">However, approximately fifteen years after <em>Colegrove, </em>the Supreme Court reversed course in the landmark case of <em>Baker v Carr.</em><footnotemark><em>90</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Baker, </em>the Court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>presented with a constitutional challenge to the apportionment of the Tennessee General Assembly. Despite significant demographic shifts that occurred within Tennessee, the state had not reapportioned its legislative districts in over sixty years. Voters filed suit and claimed that, in light of the drastic change in population, the state\u2019s failure to reapportion the General Assembly amounted to a violation of their equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The Court rejected the \u201cpolitical question\u201d rationale used in <em>Colegrove </em>and held that the issue presented by the voters was justiciable. Justice Brennan, writing for the Court, stated that \u201cthe mere fact that the suit seeks protection of a political right does not mean it presents a political question.\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> The Court went on to hold that the Equal Protection Clause provided a proper vehicle by which to challenge the Tennessee apportionment system.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> In its sweeping holding, the Court did not</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>provide any guidelines regarding how the Equal Protection Clause should be applied to voting rights cases nor establish any standards by which to implement the new role for the judiciary in such cases. Instead, the Court simply stated, \u201cNor need the [voters challenging the apportionment], in order to succeed in this action, ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations for which judicially manageable standards are lacking. Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well developed and familiar . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>With <em>Baker </em>creating the opening, courts soon began to wade head-high into the thicket of vote dilution claims. Two years after <em>Baker, </em>the Supreme Court decided <em>Wesberry v </em>Sanders<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> and <em>Reynolds v Sims,</em><footnotemark><em>95</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which established, as a fundamental tenet of equal protection jurisprudence, the \u201cone-person, one-vote\u201d standard for congressional districts and state legislative districts, respectively. In <em>Reynolds, </em>the Court stated that \u201cthe overriding objective must be substantial equality of population among the various districts, so that the vote of any citizen is approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen in the State.\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The Court later made the one-person, one-vote standard applicable to local governments in <em>Avery v Midland Co </em><footnotemark><em>97</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Avery, </em>the Court invalidated the apportionment system for the Commissioners Court of Midland County, Texas, because it consisted of \u201csingle-member districts of substantially unequal population,\u201d which favored rural voters over city voters.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> The Court reasoned that, because the Commissioners Court exercised \u201cgeneral governmental powers\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> and its actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>had a \u201cbroad range of impacts on all the citizens of the county,\u201d<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> the one-person, one vote standard should apply.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">As <em>Wesberry, Reynolds, Avery, </em>and their progeny demonstrate, the one-person, one-vote standard has become a well-established principle in equal protection jurisprudence. At the same time, two notable exceptions to the one-person, one-vote rule are just as firmly entrenched in equal protection analysis. The first involves so-called \u201cspecial purpose districts.\u201d Under this exception, electoral districts that serve a specialized purpose, such as a water storage district, are exempt from strict scrutiny and the rigid one-person, one-vote standard because they perform functions that \u201c \u2018so disproportionately affect different groups that a popular election\u2019 \u201d is not warranted.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The second, and more relevant, exception to the one-person, one-vote standard involves changes to municipal boundaries. Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized the unique nature of boundary changes as early as 1907 in the seminal case of <em>Hunter v </em>Pittsburgh,<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> nearly sixty years before the one-person, one-vote standard was established. In <em>Hunter, </em>the city of Allegheny was annexed to the city of Pittsburgh. Under state law, the votes in both cities on the annexation were aggregated. Voters in Allegheny, who were greatly outnumbered by voters in Pittsburgh, claimed that their votes were unconstitutionally diluted. The Supreme Court rejected the dilution claim and held that states have complete control over municipalities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-5\">The State, therefore, at its pleasure may modify or withdraw all such powers, may take without compensation such property, hold it itself, or vest it in other agencies, expand or contract the territorial area, unite the whole or a part of it with another municipality, repeal the charter and destroy the corporation. All this may be done, conditionally or unconditionally, with or without the consent of the citizens, or even against their protest. In all these respects the State is supreme, and its legislative body, conforming its action to the state constitution, may do as it will, unrestrained by any provision of the Constitution of the United States. Although the inhabitants and property owners may by such changes suffer inconvenience, and their property may be lessened in value by the burden of increased taxation, or for any other reason, they have no right by contract or otherwise in the unaltered or continued existence of the corporation or its powers, and there is nothing in the Federal Constitution which protects them from these injurious consequences. The power is in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>State and those who legislate for the State are alone responsible for any unjust or oppressive exercise of it.<footnotemark>[104]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">This Court fully embraced the rationale of <em>Hunter </em>in <em>Midland Twp v State Boundary Comm.</em><footnotemark><em>105</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The case involved an equal protection challenge to provisions of the HRCA that provided for a referendum if the area to be affected included more than one hundred persons, but excluded the possibility of a referendum when one hundred or fewer persons were affected. In rejecting the equal protection argument, Justice LEVIN, writing for the Court, directly relied on <em>Hunter </em>and held, \u201cNo city, village, township <em>or person </em>has any vested right or legally protected interest in the boundaries of such governmental units.\u201d<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Although <em>Hunter </em>preceded the establishment of the one-person, one-vote standard by half a century, its holding has endured throughout modern equal protection jurisprudence.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Indeed, municipal boundary changes have traditionally been exempted from the one-person, one-vote rule and strict scrutiny review.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>This issue was addressed in detail by the Supreme Court in the leading case of <em>Town ofLockport v Citizens for Community Action at the Local Level, Inc,</em><footnotemark><em>109</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which involved a claim by city voters that their votes were unconstitutionally diluted by rural voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">In <em>Lockport, </em>Niagara County, New York, sought to amend its charter in order to provide for a strong form of county government headed by a county executive. New York law provided that such an amendment could only become effective upon approval by separate majorities of the voters who lived in the cities within the county and of the voters who lived outside the cities. The amendment to the charter failed both times that it was put to a vote. Although a majority of the city voters and a majority of the overall votes cast were in favor of the amendment, a separate majority of non-city voters in favor of the amendment was never achieved in either election. Residents of the cities filed suit, claiming that the concurrent-majority voting scheme unconstitutionally diluted their voting strength because it gave a small number of rural voters disproportionate voting strength.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>The Supreme Court <em>unanimously </em>rejected the equal protection challenge.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> In upholding the New York voting scheme, the Court focused on two points. First, it found that the <em>Reynolds </em>line of cases dealing with one-person, one vote in the context of legislative <em>representation </em>were of \u201climited relevance\u201d in analyzing the \u201csingle-shot\u201d type of referendum facing the voters in Niagara County because the \u201cexpression of voter will is direct\u201d in a referendum.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> Second, the Court found significant the fact that the voters within the cities and those outside the cities would be affected differently if the county were to adopt a county executive model of government.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> The Court directly compared the situation at hand to one involving an annexation of land by municipalities and the distinct interests that would exist in such a context.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> Applying rational basis review, the Court went on to hold that the statute\u2019s concurrent-majority voting provision merely recognized \u201csubstantially differing electoral interests\u201d and that it did not amount to a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\"><em>Lockport </em>is particularly instructive in resolving defendants\u2019 equal protection claims. Similar to the Niagara County referendum in <em>Lockport, </em>the detachment elections in the present cases are also \u201csingle-shot\u201d referenda, thus marginalizing much of the rationale surrounding the <em>Reynolds </em>line of cases pertaining to legislative <em>representation. </em>The expressed will of the voters in the detachment elections will be direct and unfiltered.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Like the Supreme Court in <em>Lockport, </em>I also find significant the existence of disparate electoral interests between city and township residents. In the present cases, it is undisputed that the voters in the townships and those in the cities have \u201csubstantially differing electoral interests.\u201d If the detachments are approved, one municipality will lose land and others will gain land, thereby impheating divergent interests in the city and the townships on a wide range of issues, including police and fire protection, school districts, taxes, sewer systems, road construction, commercial development, garbage collection, etc.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> Indeed, the majority itself recognizes this fact by noting the \u201cpotential for dramatically different consequences\u201d among municipalities if the detachments are permitted.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Given these differing electoral interests, I believe it is rational for the Legislature to permit the use of a single detachment petition to transfer land to multiple townships and that such a procedure does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. As the parties noted in their briefs and at oral argument, boundary disputes between townships and cities are nothing new. Indeed, such gamesmanship is not only commonplace, but to be expected given the inherently valuable nature of land in our society. For example, cities often craft annexation proposals with surgical precision so that the territory to be acquired from a township contains one hundred or fewer inhabitants and is thus exempt from a public referendum.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> By repeating this process numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>times, a city may be able to acquire large amounts of land without ever seeking approval from voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">In light of such tactical territorial disputes between cities and townships, it is not irrational for the Legislature to permit several townships to amplify their voting strength by combining several different parcels into a single detachment petition. In fact, with the significant population disparities that exist between large cities and small townships, such a bundled petition may be the only way that certain detachments could ever be effectuated. By permitting several townships to combine efforts in a single petition, the Legislature has simply recognized that differing electoral interests exist and that, occasionally, similar entities will need to combine forces in order to have any meaningful opportunity at advancing their interests and achieving the various boundary changes authorized under the HRCA.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> I believe that siich a view by the Legislature is entirely reasonable.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number><em>Lockport </em>and <em>Hunter </em>demonstrate that the one-person, one-vote standard does not apply in cases involving municipal boundary changes as it does, for example, in the context of legislative representation.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> Instead, states maintain broad discretion over municipal boundary changes \u2014 discretion that is subject to rational basis review.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> The fact that the state has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>chosen to exercise this power partially through mechanisms provided under the HRCA, which includes public referenda on privately initiated boundary changes, in no way diminishes the state\u2019s plenary control over municipal boundaries. Therefore, considering the differing electoral interests that undoubtedly exist between municipalities in a detachment proceeding and the gross disparities in population that arise, I believe that the Legislature acted rationally in permitting, under the HRCA, the use of a single detachment petition when transferring land to more than one municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">While the wisdom of such a policy choice by the Legislature might be debated, this Court is not the proper forum for such an undertaking. Our role is limited to determining whether the HRCA conforms to the Constitution. For the foregoing reasons, I believe that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">B. MANDAMUS RELIEF</p>\n<p id=\"AHu\">1. NATURE OF THE REMEDY</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy used to enforce duties mandated by law.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> It is entirely discretionary in nature.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> Before seeking mandamus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>relief, a plaintiff must complete all conditions precedent to the act that the plaintiff seeks to compel,<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> including a demand of performance made on the official charged with performing the act.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> Once this threshold is met, the plaintiff, bearing the burden of proof,<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> must demonstrate: (1) a clear legal right to the act sought to be compelled; (2) a clear legal duty by the defendant to perform the act; (3) that the act is ministerial, leaving nothing to the judgment or discretion of the defendant; and (4) that no other adequate remedy exists.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">2. PLAINTIFFS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO MANDAMUS RELIEF</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">While I agree with the majority that plaintiffs are not entitled to mandamus relief, I disagree with the majority\u2019s rationale. The majority concludes that mandamus relief is improper because the HRCA does not permit the use of a single detachment petition involving multiple townships and, therefore, plaintiffs have no \u201cclear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>legal right\u201d to the relief they seek.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> For the reasons stated, I disagree with that conclusion. However, I believe that plaintiffs are not entitled to writs of mandamus because a request for such relief is premature at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">As already discussed, before a writ of mandamus will be issued, a plaintiff must complete <em>all </em>conditions precedent to the act that the plaintiff seeks to compel.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> While it is possible that plaintiffs may have already satisfied all requirements imposed by the HRCA, the Secretary of State has yet to make such a determination. The Secretary of State deferred her examination of the petitions until the antecedent question of whether the HRCA permits the use of a single petition involving multiple townships was resolved. The Secretary of State has not yet examined the petitions to determine whether they comply with all the <em>other </em>requirements of the HRCA. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 requests for mandamus relief are premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The HRCA is not ambiguous. A plain reading of \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 11 demonstrates that the use of a single detachment petition is permitted when seeking to transfer land to multiple townships. Moreover, such a procedure comports with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs are not entitled to mandamus relief, however, because the Secretary of State has yet to examine the petitions to determine whether all the conditions mandated by the HRCA have been satisfied. Accordingly, in <em>Casco Twp, </em>I would reverse the decisions of the Court of, Appeals and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>trial court and grant declaratory relief. Because the plaintiffs in <em>Fillmore Twp </em>did not seek declaratory relief, I would affirm the dismissal of their mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\"> MCL 117.1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-9\"> Unless otherwise indicated, \u201cplaintiffs\u201d will be used to refer collectively to the plaintiffs in both of the cases that were consolidated.
