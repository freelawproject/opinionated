(employer), contends the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) erred in awarding medical and temporary total benefits to Berle Shepherd (claimant). The sole issue on appeal is whether credible evidence supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of his employment. We affirm the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On February 12, 2001, while claimant was assembling a building for employer, he injured his back descending from a scaffold on \u201cladder-type\u201d steps. The photographs admitted into evidence establish the scaffolding to be approximately ten feet high and accessed only by the ladder-type steps. He carried a remote control device either over his shoulder or in his hand. Claimant described the steps as grated metal and approximately two feet in width. Claimant stated, \u201cI was bringing a wall off the wall rack and was coming down the steps and slipped and caught myself and hurt my back.\u201d He said he did not fall, but slipped down one step. He said he \u201chad the [crane] control over my right ... arm.\u201d Claimant reported the injury to his supervisor and sought medical treatment the same day. Claimant did not state directly that a \u201ccondition of the workplace caused his injury.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Claimant treated with Dr. J. Bryston Winegar and was diagnosed with acute muscoligamentous lumbar strain. He underwent a CT scan which showed a bulging disc at L-5, S-l with no encroachment on the thecal sac or nerve root. He was treated conservatively with medication and rest. Physical therapy was prescribed but never completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Claimant filed a claim for benefits. The deputy commissioner denied the claim because although the \u201cclaimant suffered an injury by accident that occurred during the course of employment, ... we [sic] cannot find that his accident and injury arose out of the employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Claimant appealed, and the commission reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision. The commission found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>[h]ere, the evidence does not indicate that the claimant\u2019s activity at the time of his injury was particularly strenuous or awkward, but he was required to descend from an industrial scaffold on a steep attached ladder with a cable-attached remote on his shoulder and/or in his hand. This was a sufficiently work-related condition or exertion to fit within the standard established in <em>Grove </em>[v. <em>Allied Signal, Inc., </em>15 Va.App. 17, 421 S.E.2d 32 (1992)], and was certainly not a \u201chazard to which the employee would have been equally exposed apart from his employment.\u201d <em>United Parcel Service v. Fetterman, </em>230 Va. 257, 258-59, 336 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1985). Accordingly, we find that the claimant offered sufficient proof that a condition of his work or work-related exertion caused his injury by accident....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">Employer appealed that decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Employer contends that no credible evidence' supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of his employment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">\u201cOn appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the claimant, who prevailed before the commission.\u201d <em>Allen &amp; Rocks, Inc. v. Briggs, </em>28 Va.App. 662, 672, 508 S.E.2d 335, 340 (1998) (citations omitted). \u201c \u2018Decisions of the commission as to questions of fact, if supported by credible evidence, are conclusive and binding on this Court.\u2019\u201d <em>WLR Foods v. Cardosa, </em>26 Va.App. 220, 230, 494 S.E.2d 147, 152 (1997) (quoting <em>Manassas Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Farrar, </em>13 Va.App. 227, 229, 409 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1991)). \u201cWhere reasonable inferences may be drawn from the evidence in support of the commission\u2019s factual findings, they will not be disturbed by this Court on appeal.\u201d <em>Hawks v. Henrico County School Board, </em>7 Va.App. 398, 404, 374 S.E.2d 695, 698 (1988). \u201c[The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] has always required the claimant to carry the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, ... an \u2018injury by accident\u2019 ... arising out of and ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>in the course of, the employment.\u201d <em>Morris v. Morris, </em>238 Va. 578, 584, 385 S.E.2d 858, 862 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u201cWe have held that in order for a fall on stairs to be compensable there must either be a defect in the stairs or claimant must have fallen as a result of a condition of employment.\u201d <em>Buchanan School Board v. Horton, </em>35 Va.App. 26, 29, 542 S.E.2d 783, 785 (2001) (citing <em>Southside Virginia Training Center v. Shell, </em>20 Va.App. 199, 203, 455 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Employer contends that claimant failed to establish that his fall and injury were sufficiently work related to trigger coverage because he did not, in his testimony, directly link the injury to a condition of his employment. We disagree. The commission, like any other fact finder, may consider both direct and circumstantial evidence in its disposition of a claim. Thus, the commission may properly consider all factual evidence, from whatever source, in its decision whether or not a condition of the workplace caused the injury. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Van Geuder v. Med. Coll. of Va., </em>192 Va. 548, 65 S.E.2d 565 (1951), this criteria is met when the \u201ccircumstantial evidence ... take[s] the question beyond surmise or conjecture....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557, 65 S.E.2d at 571, <em>cited with approval in Marriott Int\u2019l v. Carter, </em>34 Va.App. 209, 539 S.E.2d 738 (2001). \u201c[Claimant\u2019s] evidence [must] demonstrate to the rational mind that [claimant\u2019s injury] is fairly ... traced to [his or] her employment as the proximate cause. That may be accomplished by circumstantial evidence____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">In the instant case, the evidence established that claimant was not traversing \u201cordinary steps.\u201d He was descending from a scaffolding approximately ten feet in height on steep, ladder-type steps. Additionally, the steps were \u201cstraight down and he carried a remote control cable over his arm.\u201d We agree with the commission that the analysis pertaining to ordinary steps and stairways is inapplicable to ladders or scaffolding because of the increased risks. <em>See Mangum v. Mecklenburg Correctional Center, </em>VWC 192-69-05 (June 29, 1999), and <em>Hepp v. Phillip Morris USA, </em>VWC 187-72-11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>(January 11, 1999). Credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that the evidence established that his fall was caused by a risk or hazard of the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-10\">. Both parties stipulated that no evidence proved the steps were defective. Thus, the issue to be determined is whether claimant\u2019s injury was caused by a \"condition of employment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
