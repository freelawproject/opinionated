We affirm the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the TRB lacked authority to modify the USBC\u2019s use group classifications. Further, we hold, as a matter of law, that Avalon\u2019s facility constituted an I-2 use. Finally, we conclude that any modifications to the provisions of the USBC covering the manner of construction or materials to be used in the alteration of Avalon\u2019s facility to comply with the 1-2 use group standards must be the functional equivalent of those expressly required by the USBC. Thus, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the circuit court with instructions to remand to the TRB to determine whether the alterations it approved were, in fact, the functional equivalent of those required by the USBC for a facility housing an 1-2 use group.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">This appeal stems from a request by Avalon for classification of its facility under the USBC as a residential use group rather than an institutional use group in order to avoid having to meet certain USBC fire safety standards which Avalon alleged were cost-prohibitive. Avalon proposed adding certain lesser protections, which included central station monitoring and a sprinkler system in all compartments except the attic, in exchange for the requested modification of its USBC use group classification. The local building code official (the local official), Zofia A. Zager, after consulting with her advisory committee, denied the request. The local official wrote, \u201cThis denial is based on the fact that your proposal for an R-4 use does not provide the occupants the same level of protection as that which is required by the [USBC] for an 1-2 use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Avalon appealed to the local board of budding code appeals (the local appeals board). After hearing statements from representatives of Avalon and the local official, the local appeals board granted the modification request. It concluded the additional safeguards Avalon proposed, coupled with added safeguards including the installation of heat rise detectors in the attic space and \u201csmoke tight\u201d doors and partitions separating the corridor from the sleeping rooms, \u201c[were] sufficient to balance the omission of the fire protection requirements of structural components otherwise required by the [USBC].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The local official appealed to the TRB, which affirmed the decision of the local appeals board. The TRB, in making its decision, had before it the record of the proceedings from the local appeals board. It also swore witnesses and heard additional evidence. The record included evidence of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">In a single-family residence in McLean, Virginia, Avalon operates an adult care residence (ACR), <em>see </em>22 Va. Admin. Reg. 40-71-10, which is licensed by the Department of Social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Services (DSS) to house up to eight residents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Avalon provides care primarily for elderly women suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the mental and physical ailments which accompany it. The 2,700-square-foot residence has been converted to house a maximum of eight patients and two full-time staff people.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The purpose of Avalon\u2019s McLean ACR is to provide Alzheimer\u2019s patients with continuity of care, allowing them to \u201cstay there through until the end, and sometimes have hospice come in when people are at the end-stages of their illness.\u201d Avalon\u2019s residents are usually \u201cambulatory from the standpoint that they can walk,\u201d although some are wheelchair bound and require physical assistance. However, because the residents are cognitively confused, in the event of an emergency, some of the residents who can walk nevertheless may need to be led out by the hand. Also, due to the fact that Alzheimer\u2019s patients \u201cgo through ... peaks and valleys,\u201d the number of residents able to respond with help could vary from day to day. In the event of an emergency requiring evacuation, any patients physically incapable of walking would be carried out on their bed sheets. The facility conducts monthly fire drills, and \u201cusually the longest it takes ... is five, six minutes to get all eight people out,\u201d provided none of the occupants are bedridden.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Although Avalon was licensed by DSS for up to eight residents at a time, local officials had interpreted the USBC to allow operation of the ACR under the requirements for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>residential use group as long as no more than five of those eight residents were non-ambulatory, i.e., needed assistance to evacuate. Avalon was concerned that this restriction had the potential to force relocation of a resident if her condition deteriorated such that she became the sixth non-ambulatory resident at the ACR. Avalon represented that it would limit to five the number of residents who were bedridden or otherwise <em>physically </em>unable to evacuate. It sought a USBC waiver so that it could have up to eight residents unable to evacuate independently due to <em>psychological </em>limitations, such as those residents who were physically able to evacuate if led by the hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Avalon hired Mark P. Dempsey, a fire protection engineer, to investigate upgrading the ACR to meet the 1-2 use group requirements but concluded such upgrades would be cost-prohibitive. Avalon then proposed to add certain lesser safety protections in exchange for being allowed to continue to be classified as a residential rather than institutional use even with more than five non-ambulatory residents. Those protections included (1) installation of (a) an automatic sprinkler system for all areas of the residence except the attic, (b) smoke detectors and (c) a manual fire alarm system connected to both the sprinkler system and an approved central station for monitoring; and (2) placement of any non-ambulatory residents in bedrooms located on the grade level. Ordinarily, an ACR with a residential use group classification is required to have only single station smoke detectors. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 36-99.5:1. Dempsey concluded that the additional fire protections he outlined were \u201cat least equivalent in protection to those required by the 1-2 standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Representatives of the local official noted their \u201cgroup unanimously ... came to the conclusion that the differences [between the fire safety requirements for a structure housing an 1-2 use group and the protections which Avalon proposed adding] were far too great\u201d and that \u201c[i]t was beyond [the local official\u2019s] authority to grant this modification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The local official continued to object on the ground that Avalon\u2019s plan included no \u201cpassive fire protection whatsoever.\u201d She emphasized that Avalon\u2019s facility is Type 5-B construction, which \u201chas zero fire ratings on ... its structural components.\u201d An 1-2 use group must be Type 5-A construction, which \u201crequires a minimum of one-hour fire rating on major structural components to make sure that the building does not collapse\u201d during the time it takes the fire department to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">After considering the evidence and argument, the TRB granted Avalon\u2019s modification request. In doing so, however, it noted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">two areas of concern in the wording of the USBC and its application to ACR\u2019s. First, the inclusion of group homes licensed by [DSS] in the exception to \u00a7 308.2 should not include the statement that such facilities house mentally ill, mentally retarded or developmentally disabled persons!,] as ACR\u2019s by statutory and regulatory definition are for persons who are aged, infirm or disabled. Notwithstanding the incorrect language, the [TRB] determines the intent of the USBC is for the exception to apply to ACR\u2019s. Secondly, the determination that \u00a7 308.2 and its exception permit up to five residents [out of eight] at any given time to be unable to exit the residence without personal assistance from staff does not match the explicit language of the code. Recognizing however that this has been a long-standing application of the code and is supported by an interpretation issued by the BOCA Code Interpretations Committee, the [TRB] agrees \u00a7 308.2 and its exception may be applied as stated in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The TRB expressly recommended the Housing Board amend the USBC to address these inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">In support of its decision to grant Avalon\u2019s requested modification, the TRB relied on four findings. First, it found that allowing Avalon to house eight residents of varying degrees of awareness after equipping its facility with the proposed safety features was an improvement over the situation permitted by the code, which could involve housing five residents totally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>incapable of exiting in a building with no fire protections whatsoever. Second, it observed that other facilities with the same number and type of residents with equivalent fire safety construction and features presumably are being approved in other states, under the Life Safety Code, another nationally recognized safety standard. Third, it noted that the USBC use group definitions do not distinguish between licensed and unlicensed facilities and the terms of Avalon\u2019s DSS license provide additional safeguards and restrictions on Avalon\u2019s use of its ACR, including the restriction that it shall not admit or retain individuals requiring continuous licensed nursing care. Finally, it found that Avalon\u2019s facility is not \u201can exact match\u201d for Use Group 1-2, \u201cshares most of the characteristics of a Use Group 1-1 facility,\u201d and \u201cnearly qualifies for the residential exception to the Use Group 1-1 classification without any added safety features.\u201d As a result, it concluded that the requested modification preserved the spirit and intent of the USBC and assured the public health, welfare and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The TRB did not expressly address the meaning of the 1-1 requirement that the residents be \u201cphysically capable of responding to an emergency situation without personal assistance.\u201d However, the conclusion that this phrase includes those physically but not cognitively able to exit on their own appears to be implicit in its determination that Avalon \u201cshares most of the characteristics of a Use Group 1-1 facility\u201d and \u201cnearly qualifies\u201d for the residential exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The local official appealed the decision of the TRB to the Fairfax County Circuit Court under the APA. The circuit court observed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">[M]y concern about the TRB is not in their determination that this fire safety provision is substantially equivalent to that which is required in the 1-2 category.... [I]n my view, that\u2019s what the TRB is there to do, make those technical construction type determinations____ My concern is that they\u2019re now making the determination that given the adequacy of this system, well, it makes sense to allow three more patients there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>[G]iving all due deference to the correctness of administrative decisions, today I conclude the [TRB] must be reversed and Avalon\u2019s request denied----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">Now, I think the difference between the 1-1 and 1-2 use groups, as set out in the BOCA Code, is clearly that in the 1-1 category the residents must not require personal assistance to be evacuated. And I refer at least in part in that determination on looking at the definition in [Code \u00a7] 63.1-174.1, and I think with ... the aid of that statute, the construction in the BOCA Code is clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">Now, the [TRB] has the authority to determine whether a facility is in the 1-1 category or in the 1-2 category, and it also has the authority to determine whether the technical requirements of those categories had been met, but the review board does not have the authority, under the guise of making a modification to BOCA Code, to create what was essentially a new use group or an exception to the substantive requirements of one or another use group, and I think that\u2019s what the TRB has done here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">By the TRB\u2019s own wording, they said, well, Avalon is mostly an I \u2014 1, but kind of an 1-2, and the TRB has declined to put the facility in one category or the other. And what the TRB has clearly done is created another category and tried to call it a modification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">Now, the TRB has determined that the facility is compliant with the I \u2014 1, R-4 category, but that simply is belied by the record, because the record clearly establishes that there are persons in the facility who need personal assistance to be evacuated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">And what the TRB has tried to do is to create the same kind of exception to the 1-2 category that the Housing and Community Development Department created in the 1-1 category, and this is an act that the TRB simply has no authority to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">And I think the TRB has really recognized that itself, that it\u2019s waded into the legislative waters under the guise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>[a modification] in this case, because the TRB has recognized that what its correct role is, I think in this case, is to recommend to the Housing and Community Development Department that some legislative change be made to these use groups. And the TRB is probably absolutely right that some legislative change ought to be made to these use groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">I think the TRB made a very practical decision, I understand why they did what they did; I just don\u2019t think they have the legal authority to do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"AIr\">The legislature has created the Board of Housing and Community Development (the Housing Board) and directed it to adopt a Uniform Statewide Building Code (USBC). Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-98, 36-131, 36-135. As described by the legislature,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0I\">The provisions [of the USBC] shall be such as to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of this Commonwealth, provided that buildings and structures should be permitted to be constructed at the least possible cost consistent with recognized standards of health, safety, energy conservation and water conservation and barrier-free provisions for the physically handicapped and aged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Code \u00a7 36-99(A). The legislature also has directed that, \u201c[i]n formulating the [USBC] provisions, the [Housing] Board shall have due regard for generally accepted standards as recommended by nationally recognized organizations, including ... the Building Officials Conference of America [BOCA]____\u201d Code \u00a7 36-99(B). Finally, the legislature has provided that \u201c[t]he [Housing] Board may modify, amend or repeal any [USBC] provisions from time to time as the public interest requires, after notice and hearing,\u201d Code \u00a7 36-102, and \u201cin accordance with the Administrative Process Act [(APA)],\u201d Code \u00a7 36-100.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">The legislature has delegated responsibility for \u201c[e]nforcement of the [USBC] [to] ... the local building department,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Code \u00a7 36-105, which is defined as \u201cthe agency or agencies of any local governing body charged with the administration, supervision or enforcement of the [USBC] and regulations,\u201d Code \u00a7 36-97. Within each local building department, \u201c[tjhere shall be established ... a local board of Budding Code Appeals\u201d or other designated body (the local appeals board). Code \u00a7 36-105. The legislature has provided that a party not satisfied with the local department\u2019s decision \u201cconcerning application of the [USBC] or [the local department\u2019s] refusal to grant a modification to the provisions of the [USBC] covering the manner of construction or materials to be used in the erection, alteration or repair of a building or structure\u201d may appeal to the local appeals board. <em>Id. </em>A party dissatisfied with the decision of the local appeals board may appeal to the TRB under the provisions of the APA. Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-105, 36-114.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The Housing Board, pursuant to the legislature\u2019s delegation of authority, has promulgated a USBC.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In doing so, the Board incorporated by reference the majority of the BOCA National Building Code of 1996 (BNBC).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> USBC \u00a7 104.1, 13 Va. Admin. Code 5-61-25(A). The USBC provides that the local \u201cbuilding code official [ (the local official)] shall enforce the provisions of the USBC as provided herein, and as interpreted by the [TRB].\u201d USBC \u00a7 107.1, 13 Va. Admin. Code 5-61-41. The USBC also purports to give the local official the authority to \u201cgrant modification to <em>any </em>of the provisions of the USBC, provided the spirit and intent of the USBC are observed and public health, welfare and safety are assured.\u201d USBC \u00a7 107.2,13 Va. Admin. Code 5-61-41 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The USBC classifies all structures \u201cin one or more ... use groups\u201d with respect to the number of occupants and manner of occupancy. BNBC \u00a7 302.1. Among the ten use groups are four categories of residential use groups (groups R-l to R-4) and three categories of institutional use groups (groups 1-1 to 1-3). <em>Id. </em>The USBC provides that \u201c[a]ll structures shall be classified with respect to occupancy in one or more of the [listed] use groups\u201d and that \u201c[w]here a structure is proposed for a purpose which is not specifically provided for in this code, such structure shall be classified in the use group which the occupancy most nearly resembles.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">A structure\u2019s use group classification determines which set of USBC safety standards that structure must meet. For example, fire safety standards for structures occupied by residential use groups are more lenient than those for structures occupied by institutional use groups. <em>See generally </em>BNBC, chs. 6, 7, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The USBC defines institutional use groups as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajz\">\n<em>Section 308.0 INSTITUTIONAL USE GROUPS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\"><em>308.1 General: </em>All structures in which people suffering from physical limitations because of health or age are harbored for medical or other care or treatment, or in which people are detained for penal or correction purposes, or in which the liberty of the inmates is restricted, shall be classified as Use Group I \u2014 1, 1-2 or 1-3. the term \u201cUse Group 1\u201d shall include Use Groups I \u2014 1,1-2 and 1-3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\"><em>308.2 Use Group 1-1: </em>This use group shall include buildings and structures which house six or more individuals who, because of age, mental disability or other reasons, must live in a supervised environment but who are <em>physically capable of responding to an emergency situation without personal assistance. </em>Where accommodating persons of the above description, the following types of facilities shall be classified as 1-1 facilities: board and care facilities, half-way houses, group homes, social rehabilitation facilities, alcohol and drug centers and convalescent facilities.

Admin. Code 5-61-41 (emphasis added); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-105, 36-114. The BNBC, by contrast, originally limited the local official to modifications of the \u201cstructural or. mechanical provisions of [the BNBC].\u201d BNBC \u00a7 107.1 (1987 ed.); <em>see also </em>BNBC \u00a7 107.1 (1996 ed.)

We assume without deciding that the Housing Board, in deviating from the language of the BNBC, intended to permit modification of <em>any </em>of the USBC\u2019s provisions, not just its structural or mechanical provision. Nevertheless, the authority of the Housing Board to permit modification is limited to that granted by the General Assembly in the enabling legislation, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 36-105, which implicitly allows modifications only to USBC provisions governing \u201cthe manner of construction or materials.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Brown v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>34 Va.App. 273, 276, 540 S.E.2d 521, 522 (2001) (noting legislative enactment which delegates to agency authority to adopt rules and regulations for carrying out enactment does not permit adoption of inconsistent rules or regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The related statutory scheme does not expressly grant any power to the local official to modify the USBC\u2019s provisions. It expressly grants such power only to the Housing Board, which \u201cmay modify, amend or repeal any [USBC] provisions ... after notice and hearing\u201d and \u201cin accordance with the [APA].\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-100, 36-102. However, the legislature expressed its intent in Code \u00a7 36-105, which provides that a party not satisfied with the local official\u2019s decision \u201cconcerning application of the [USBC] or [the local official\u2019s] refusal to grant a modification to the provisions of the [USBC] covering the manner of construction or materials to be used in the erection, alteration or repair of a building or structure\u201d may appeal to the local appeals board. In the absence of other statutory language permitting the local official to grant a modification of the USBC, we hold the legislature contemplated the local official would have authority \u201cto grant a modification\u201d only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u201cthe provisions of the [USBC] covering the manner of construction or materials to be used in the erection, alteration or repair of a building or structure,\u201d as listed in Code \u00a7 86-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">To the extent the Housing Board purported to authorize the local official \u2014 and the local appeals board and TRB via the appeals process \u2014 to grant modification to <em>any </em>of the provisions of the USBC, that regulation exceeds the Housing Board\u2019s statutory authority and constitutes a clear abuse of delegated discretion. The only modifications permitted are those involving \u201cthe manner of construction or materials to be used in the erection, alteration or repair of a building or structure.\u201d Code \u00a7 36-105. Thus, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s ruling that the TRB lacked authority to create a new use group or to classify Avalon in a use group the definition of which it did not meet because those modifications do not directly involve \u201cthe manner of construction or materials to be used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">PROPER CLASSIFICATION OF AVALON UNDER EXISTING USBC USE GROUP DEFINITIONS</p>\n<p id=\"A61\">We also affirm the circuit court\u2019s ruling that Avalon\u2019s facility constitutes an 1-2 use. This classification requires an interpretation of regulations which fall \u201cwithin the specialized competence\u201d of the local official and local appeals board. Although the TRB has the authority on appeal to classify a particular structure in its proper use group, the TRB hears appeals from decisions arising under the USBC, the Fire Prevention Code and various other state construction safety laws. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 36-114. As the circuit court observed, the TRB\u2019s job is to make \u201ctechnical construction type determinations,\u201d such as whether the fire safety features proposed by Avalon would be \u201csubstantially equivalent to that which is required\u201d by a facility in Avalon\u2019s use group. The TRB\u2019s specialized competence does not extend to interpreting the USBC\u2019s various use group definitions, and we need not defer to the TRB in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Both the local official and the local appeals board concluded that Avalon\u2019s facility constituted an 1-2 use. Relying in part on rules applicable to the construction of statutes, we agree. \u201cIn construing statutes, courts are charged with ascertaining and giving effect to the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp. v. Hill, </em>254 Va. 88, 91, 488 S.E.2d 345, 346 (1997). \u201cThat intention is initially found in the words of the statute itself, and if those words are clear and unambiguous, we do not rely on rules of statutory construction or parol evidence, unless a literal application would produce a meaningless or absurd result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We must \u201cavoid interpreting each word [in a statute] in a way that makes it repetitious of another.\u201d <em>Germek v. Germek, </em>34 Va.App. 1, 8, 537 S.E.2d 596, 600 (2000). Further, statutes on the same subject matter, i.e., those standing <em>in pari materia, </em>must be considered together and harmonized if possible. <em>Lambert v. Barrett, </em>115 Va. 136, 141, 78 S.E. 586, 587 (1913). We see no reason not to apply these same rules to the interpretation of regulations adopted by an administrative agency pursuant to statutory authority granted it by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Applying these principles, we hold that Avalon must be classified as an 1-2 facility rather than an 1-1 facility or a residential facility pursuant to Virginia\u2019s 1-1 exception. In order to be eligible for classification under the 1-1 use group designation or its residential exception, a facility must house individuals \u201cwho are physically capable of responding to an emergency situation without personal assistance.\u201d BNBC \u00a7 308.2. Avalon urges us to interpret the subject language, \u201cphysically capable of responding to an emergency situation without personal assistance,\u201d as distinguishing a resident\u2019s <em>physical </em>ability to evacuate from her <em>cognitive or psychological </em>ability to do so. Under the principles of construction above, however, we conclude this interpretation would lead to an absurd result. The interpretation to be given the phrase, \u201cphysically capable of responding,\u201d manifestly must be governed by the subsequent phrase, \u201cwithout personal assistance.\u201d A resident who is physically capable of moving her body without assistance but who is cognitively unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>recognize the need to do so when warned by an external source such as a fire alarm or a verbal instruction in an emergency situation is not \u201cphysically capable of responding to an emergency situation <em>without personal assistance.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The correctness of this interpretation is further illustrated by the language defining Use Group 1-2. All Institutional Use Groups 1-1 and 1-2 house \u201cpeople suffering from physical limitations because of health or age [who are] harbored for medical care or other treatment.\u201d Use Group 1-2 specifically includes those who are \u201cnot capable of self-preservation,\u201d whereas the 1-1 definition covers those \u201cphysically capable of responding to an emergency situation without personal assistance.\u201d Considering these two use group definitions together, the logical conclusion is that the Housing Board intended to cover all levels of ability within these two definitions. Use Group 1-2 residents are those expressly \u201cnot capable of self-preservation,\u201d whereas 1-1 residents, by inference, are those who <em>are </em>capable of self-preservation. Thus, \u201cphysically capable of responding to an emergency situation without personal assistance\u201d means \u201ccapable of self-preservation,\u201d and Use Group 1-1 residents must be both physically and mentally capable of evacuating, if necessary, \u201cwithout personal assistance.\u201d The 1-1 Use Group definition specifically provides that it includes \u201cboard and care facilities,\u201d \u201cgroup homes\u201d and other listed facilities <em>only </em>where those facilities \u201caccommodat[e] persons of the above description\u201d \u2014 those \u201cphysically capable of responding to an emergency situation without personal assistance.\u201d Thus, Avalon is not an 1-1 facility simply because it is a group home; rather, how it is classified depends on the abilities of its residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The language in Code \u00a7 63.1-174.1,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which pertains to DSS\u2019s licensure of homes for \u201c[a]ged, [i]nfirm or [disabled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>[a]dults,\u201d does not require a different result. Code \u00a7 63.1-174.1 does not constitute a legislative requirement that the Housing Board conform its regulations to the statutory definitions or regulations of DSS. Rather, it requires buildings licensed by DSS \u201cfor ambulatory or nonambulatory residents,\u201d as those terms are defined in the statute, to \u201cmeet the specifications for the proper [USBC] Use Group.\u201d Although the legislature lists both \u201cphysical and mental impairment\u201d in Code \u00a7 63.1-174.1 in referring to whether an individual is \u201ccapable of self-preservation,\u201d it does so only in the context of defining who is ambulatory and who is not. In fact, the legislature\u2019s definitions of ambulatory and nonambulatory are roughly co-extensive with the interpretations of the 1-1 and I-2 Use Group definitions we adopt herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">It is true that the 1987 edition of the USBC deviated from the 1987 BNBC and defined Use Group 1-1 in reference to an earlier definition of \u201cambulatory\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 63.1-174.1. However, with one exception not relevant here,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the 1990 edition of the USBC adopted the 1990 BNBC definition of Use Group 1-1 as written, which provided that 1-1 residents must be \u201cphysically capable of responding to an emergency situation without personal assistance\u201d and contained no additional requirement that the residents be \u201cambulatory.\u201d The Housing Board has adopted that same definition in each subsequent edition of the USBC.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Prior to the Housing Board\u2019s adoption of the BNBC definition in 1990, the BOCA Interpretations Committee issued a code interpretation indicating that both physical and mental limitations must be considered in determining whether an occupant of an institutional facility is \u201cphysically capable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>responding to an emergency situation without personal assistance.\u201d BOCA Code Interp. No. 11/306/84 (Apr. 4, 1984). When the Housing Board adopted the BNBC\u2019s 1-1 Use Group definition in 1990, it was charged with knowledge of BOCA\u2019s interpretation of its own uniform code and implicitly accepted it. <em>Cf. Weathers v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 803, 805, 553 S.E.2d 729, 730 (2001) (\u201cWhen the General Assembly acts in an area in which one of its appellate courts already has spoken, it is presumed to know the law as the court has stated it and to acquiesce therein, and if the legislature intends to countermand such appellate decision it must do so explicitly.\u201d); <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Robbins, </em>261 Va. 12, 18-19, 541 S.E.2d 289, 292-93 (2001) (applying same principle to legislature\u2019s knowledge of Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of statutes). Thus, this BOCA code interpretation provides further support for the conclusion that the Housing Board intended to include both physical and mental limitations in the determination of whether residents are \u201cphysically capable, of responding to an emergency situation without personal assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Even if we were to construe this phrase as Avalon urges, holding that residents with only cognitive limitations <em>are </em>\u201cphysically capable of responding to an emergency situation without personal assistance,\u201d Avalon would be ineligible for the 1-1 residential use exception for the two reasons identified by the TRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">First, Virginia\u2019s residential exception to Use Group I-1 specifically states that it applies to \u201cGroup homes licensed by ... [DSS] which house no more than eight mentally ill, mentally retarded or developmentally disabled persons.\u201d Avalon is an ACR, and ACRs \u201cby statutory and regulatory definition are for persons who are aged, infirm or disabled\u201d rather than for people who are \u201cmentally ill, mentally retarded or developmentally disabled\u201d as required for the residential exception. Thus, Avalon\u2019s McLean ACR does not meet this criterion of the 1-1 residential exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Second, Avalon admitted that, as a facility housing Alzheimer\u2019s patients in various stages of physical and mental decline, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>most of its residents would become bedridden before dying, and it sought to be classified as a residential use under the 1-1 exception while still housing up to five residents who were bedridden or otherwise physically unable to evacuate. As the TRB expressly noted, \u201cthe determination that [Use Group 1-1] and its exception permit up to five residents [out of eight] at any given time to be unable to exit the residence without personal assistance from staff does not match the explicit language of the [USBC].\u201d Use Group 1-1 expressly applies to facilities with six or more occupants and requires that <em>all </em>occupants must be \u201cphysically capable of responding to an emergency situation without personal assistance.\u201d A facility which meets Use Group I-l\u2019s substantive criteria but has five or fewer residents remains residential. The residential exception to the 1-1 Use Group permits certain group homes which meet the substantive criteria for 1-1 classification to house up to eight people, rather than five, while retaining a residential classification. For a facility to be eligible for the residential exception, all eight occupants must be \u201cphysically capable of responding to an emergency situation without personal assistance.\u201d Thus, even under the alternate definition of the phrase, if Avalon had even one resident with significant physical limitations due to the natural progression of Alzheimer\u2019s, Avalon would be ineligible for the 1-1 residential exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">STANDARD FOR MODIFYING USBC\u2019S STRUCTURAL AND MECHANICAL PROVISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In light of our conclusion that Avalon\u2019s facility was an 1-2 use, we next consider the circumstances under which the TRB had the authority to permit Avalon to deviate from the provisions of the USBC covering \u201cthe manner of construction or materials to be used in the ... alteration or repair of a building or structure\u201d housing an 1-2 use group. We hold that the USBC provision permitting modification where \u201cthe spirit and intent of the USBC are observed and public health, welfare and safety are assured\u201d requires a finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>alternate material or manner of construction is the functional equivalent of the USBC\u2019s express requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">When the legislature delegates authority to an administrative agency to promulgate regulations, those regulations must neither exceed the scope of the authority delegated nor be inconsistent with it. <em>See, e.g., Brown, </em>34 Va.App. at 276, 540 S.E.2d at 522. Furthermore, \u201cdelegations of legislative power are valid only if they establish specific policies and fix definite standards to guide the official, agency, or board in the exercise of the power. Delegations of legislative power which lack such policies and standards are unconstitutional and void.\u201d <em>Ames v. Town of Painter, </em>239 Va. 343, 349, 389 S.E.2d 702, 705 (1990). For example, language in an enabling statute which provides merely \u201cthat the regulations be designed to protect and promote the safety and health of employees\u201d is insufficient. <em>Bell v. Dorey Elec. Co., </em>248 Va. 378, 381, 448 S.E.2d 622, 624 (1994). \u201c[T]he General Assembly cannot delegate its legislative power accompanied only by such a broad statement of general policy____[Delegations of authority are adequately limited [only] where the terms or phrases employed have a well understood meaning and prescribe sufficient standards to guide the administrator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381-82, 448 S.E.2d at 624 (citations omitted). We hold, correspondingly, that the related regulations must also contain \u201cdefinite standards to guide ... the exercise of the power.\u201d Ames, 239 Va. at 349, 389 S.E.2d at 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Avalon contends the USBC permits two kinds of modifications. The type of modification permitted under USBC \u00a7 112.1 expressly requires equivalency to the terms being modified. That section provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">Where practical, [as required by] \u00a7 36-99 of the Code of Virginia, provisions of the USBC have been stated in terms of required level of performance, to facilitate the prompt acceptance of new building materials and methods. The provisions of the USBC are not intended to prohibit the use of any material or method of construction not specifically prescribed by the USBC, provided any such alternative has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>been approved. <em>An alternative material or method of construction </em>shall be approved when the code official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the provisions of the USBC, and that the material, method or work offered is, for the purpose intended, <em>at least the equivalent </em>of that prescribed by the USBC in quality, strength, effectiveness, fireresistance, durability and safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">USBC \u00a7 112.1,13 Va. Admin. Code 5-61-65 (emphasis added). Avalon contends that USBC \u00a7 107.2, by contrast, requires a finding that the modification preserves \u201cthe spirit and intent of the USBC\u201d and that the \u201cpublic health, welfare and safety are assured\u201d without regard to whether the modification achieves functional equivalency. <em>See </em>13 Va. Admin. Code 5-61-41; <em>see also </em>USBC \u00a7 107.2.1, 13 Va. Admin. Code 5-61-41 (providing 'that code official considering modification under USBC \u00a7 107.2 <em>\u201cmay </em>require and consider a statement from a professional engineer, architect or other competent person as to the equivalency of the proposed modification\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Once again, based on the language of the enabling statutes, we disagree and hold that, regardless of the intent of the Housing Board, the legislative delegation of authority permits only modifications which are the functional equivalent of what the USBC requires. The legislature expressly stated that the provisions of the USBC</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">A. ... shall be such as to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of this Commonwealth, provided that buildings and structures should be permitted to be constructed at the least possible cost consistent with recognized standards of health [and] safety____Such regulations shall be reasonable and appropriate to the objectives of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">B.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">C. Where practical, the [USBC] provisions shall be stated in terms of required level of performance, so as to facilitate the prompt acceptance of new building <em>materials and methods. </em>When generally recognized standards of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>performance are not available, such provisions shall provide for acceptance of <em>materials and methods </em>whose performance has been found by the Board, on the basis of reliable test and evaluation data, presented by the proponent, to be <em>substantially equal in safety </em>to those specified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Code \u00a7 36-99 (emphases added). In delineating the process for appealing decisions made under the USBC, the legislature specifically listed only two categories of appeals, (1) those involving \u201capplication of the [USBC]\u201d and (2) those involving the refusal of the local official to \u201cgrant a modification to the provisions of the [USBC] covering the <em>manner of construction or materials </em>to be used in the erection, alteration or repair of a building or structure.\u201d Code \u00a7 36-105 (emphasis added). Thus, the legislative scheme authorizes the Housing Board, in promulgating the USBC, to set out the <em>minimum </em>standards for construction methods and materials, and it authorizes the Board to permit individual modifications to the USBC\u2019s provisions \u201ccovering the <em>manner of construction or materials </em>to be used in the erection, alteration or repair of a building or structure\u201d only when the alternative <em>\u201cmaterials and </em>methods\u201d are <em>\u201csubstantially equal in safety </em>to those specified.\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-99, 36-105 (emphases added). In order to construe USBC \u00a7 107.2 to be consistent with the authority delegated by the enabling legislation and to contain sufficiently definite standards to guide the administrator, <em>see Bell, </em>248 Va. at 381-82, 448 S.E.2d at 624; <em>Brown, </em>34 Va.App. at 276, 540 S.E.2d at 522, we interpret its language permitting modifications which preserve \u201cthe spirit and intent of the USBC\u201d and \u201cassure[ ]\u201d the \u201cpublic health, welfare and safety\u201d to require that any modifications approved thereunder are functionally equivalent to the USBC standards from which deviation is sought. Any modifications which are not functionally equivalent to these standards are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Finally, we remand to the circuit court with instructions to remand to the TRB to determine whether the modifications approved by the local appeals board, which included those proposed by Avalon as well as the additional modifications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>listed by the local appeals board, were the functional equivalent of what the USBC would otherwise provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">For these reasons, we hold the TRB lacked authority to modify the USBC\u2019s use group classifications. Further, we hold, as a matter of law, that Avalon\u2019s facility constituted an I-2 use. Finally, we conclude that any modifications to the provisions of the USBC covering the manner of construction or materials to be used in the alteration of Avalon\u2019s facility had to be the functional equivalent of those expressly required by the USBC. Thus, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the circuit court with instructions to remand to the TRB to determine whether the proposed modifications were, in fact, the functional equivalent of those required by the USBC for an 1-2 use.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\">. Although these appeals have been assigned separate case numbers, they arise out of the same proceedings and involve similar assignments of error. Thus, we consolidate them for purposes of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-6\">.
