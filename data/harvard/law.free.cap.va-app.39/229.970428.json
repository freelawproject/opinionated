Because the record does not contain a proffer of the witness\u2019 expected testimony, we cannot determine whether the judge erred in sustaining the objection to the testimony. In addition, we hold the trial judge made a premature credibility finding on the issue of juror misconduct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>We, therefore, reverse the trial judge\u2019s decision on the motion and remand for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The evidence at trial proved that in the Fall of 2000, Evans met a woman, named Williams, at the barber shop where he worked and where she received hair cuts. After Evans and Williams developed a friendship, they had meals together, watched movies and television together, and smoked marijuana together. On three occasions, Evans spent the night on a sofa in Williams\u2019s apartment. Williams, however, denies ever having consensual sex or using cocaine with Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Williams testified that on December 27, 2000, Evans came to her home unannounced after 10:00 p.m. Although Williams had already retired for the evening and initially ignored the knocking at her door, she eventually admitted Evans to her apartment. While they sat on the sofa and talked, Williams noticed that Evans had been drinking alcohol and told him to leave. When Evans was reluctant, Williams opened the door and insisted that he leave. Evans then grabbed her by the throat, closed the door, wrestled her, and hit her. Williams testified that she screamed and knocked over things in the room, hoping someone would hear her. The person who lives in the apartment below Williams testified that she heard noises indicating a fight was occurring in Williams\u2019s apartment between 11:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">When Williams realized she was getting nowhere by struggling, she begged Evans to stop the assault and said, \u201cyou can do anything you want to do to me, just don\u2019t hit me [any] more.\u201d Williams testified that Evans raped her on the sofa and then forced her into the bedroom, where he sodomized her and raped her again. She testified that the assault stopped only when Evans became sick. After Evans vomited and fell asleep, Williams left her apartment wearing only a shirt and asked the apartment\u2019s attendant to call the police. The police arrived at 4:30 a.m. and found Evans sleeping on Williams\u2019s bed and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Evans had a different account of the events. He testified that he and Williams had consensual intercourse that night. He said fighting occurred only after Williams refused to pay him for cocaine he earlier had obtained for her. Evans testified that he became angry and threatened to take Williams\u2019s car. When Williams fought him for the car keys, she suffered injuries and items in her apartment were broken during this struggle.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the jury convicted Evans for rape, forcible sodomy, abduction with intent to defile, and assault and battery. After the trial judge dismissed the jurors at the end of the trial, Evans\u2019s counsel asked for a bench conference. Following the conference, the trial judge questioned a juror and asked if he \u201coverheard or discussed anything with anybody during the trial.\u201d The juror said he had \u201c[njever discussed the case with anyone.\u201d He recalled that a man said he was there for a trial and that he asked the man which trial. The juror said he immediately walked away when the man said the Evans trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Weeks later, but before the sentencing hearing, Evans\u2019s counsel filed a motion for a new trial, alleging juror misconduct. Attached to the motion is a document, which is styled \u201caffidavit\u201d and which recites, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">1. On the second day of the trial, June 26, 2001, I was in front of the Courthouse during the lunch recess. I was approached by a well-dressed, bald, African-American man who began to speak to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">2. I do not remember the exact words he said, but the substance of his statements were as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">A. He was there to watch the trial of his nephew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">B. He hoped they gave his nephew forty years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">C. His nephew \u201cthinks he\u2019s slick.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-12\">D. He was only coming to the trial to support his sister-in-law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-13\">E. His nephew was always in trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-14\">F. His nephew had been in this kind of trouble before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>3. I asked the man which trial he was talking about and he said \u201cRoland Evans.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">4. When I realized he was talking about Roland Evans, I ended the conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">5. I did not realize he was speaking about Roland Evans until he specifically mentioned that he was speaking about Roland Evans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">6. I did not ask him any questions or continue speaking with him once I realized he had been speaking about Roland Evans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The juror\u2019s signature is below the words, \u201cI swear or affirm that the above statements are true to the best of my recollection.\u201d An investigator for the Public Defender\u2019s Office, C.E. Nelson, signed the document next to the words \u201cwitnessed by.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The prosecutor filed a response to the motion and attached to it a document from the same juror. This document is also styled, \u201caffidavit,\u201d and recites, in pertinent part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">1. After the trial, on two occasions, a man named Clarence Nelson came to see me. From what he said to me, I assumed he was with the Commonwealth Attorney\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">2. I told him about the man who talked to me outside of the Courthouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">3. That man told me that someone related to him was on trial, but I don\u2019t remember the exact relation. I seem to recall that it was his nephew or cousin, or a similar relation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-13\">4. That man told me that he was there to support his wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-14\">5. When the man told me that he was there about the Evans case, I walked away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-15\">6. That man did not say anything about the relative being in trouble before. He also did not say anything about him being in that kind of trouble before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-16\">7. I did not notice those statements on the paper Clarence Nelson had, or I would not have signed it. I did not read his paper carefully. I did not tell him what to put in that paper, he had it written before he came to see me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>8. I did not receive any information that could have or that did affect my opinion about the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The juror\u2019s signature follows the words, \u201cI swear the above statements are true.\u201d A detective signed next to the words, \u201cwitnessed by.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The trial judge denied Evans\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing and heard arguments on the motion for a new trial. Referring to the juror\u2019s oral statement at the conclusion of trial and the juror\u2019s statement attached to the Commonwealth\u2019s response, the trial judge said the juror\u2019s \u201cfirst statement and his last statement were correct.\u201d The trial judge then said he \u201cwould accept those and find as a fact that there was no other conversation between [the juror and Evans\u2019s uncle].\u201d Referring to the juror\u2019s statement which accompanied Evans\u2019s motion, the trial judge said even if \u201cthese facts are correct,\u201d he would find them insufficient to grant the motion for a new trial. The trial judge also accepted as a proffer of evidence a sworn, three-page affidavit from Nelson, which detailed the events surrounding the securing of the juror\u2019s statement that accompanied Evans\u2019s motion for a new trial. That affidavit contradicted in significant part two of the juror\u2019s other statements. The trial judge denied Evans\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Evans contends the trial judge erred in sustaining the Commonwealth\u2019s objection to Jill Brown\u2019s testimony at trial. The Commonwealth contends that Evans cannot challenge the trial judge\u2019s ruling because his counsel failed to make a proper proffer of the testimony excluded. We agree that the necessary proffer was not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Evans testified at trial that, a day and a half before the struggle in Williams\u2019s apartment, he and Brown were on a highway near Williams\u2019s apartment. As he approached an exit near the apartment, he asked for Brown\u2019s cellular phone to place a call because he had to \u201cstop and get some money from somebody.\u201d He did not testify that he identified that person to Brown. Later, on direct examination, Brown testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>fled that Evans had made a statement to her in the car as they neared that highway exit. When Evans\u2019s counsel asked Brown what Evans said, the prosecutor objected on the ground that Evans\u2019s statement was an inadmissible prior consistent statement. Evans\u2019s counsel responded that Brown\u2019s recitation of Evans\u2019s statement was admissible under the state of mind exception. The trial judge sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u201c[W]hen testimony is rejected before it is delivered, an appellate court has no basis for adjudication unless the record reflects a proper proffer.\u201d <em>Whittaker v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 966, 968, 234 S.E.2d 79, 81 (1977). A proper proffer may consist of \u201ca unilateral avowal of counsel, if unchallenged, or a mutual stipulation of the testimony expected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 969, 234 S.E.2d at 81. The purpose for the proffer \u201cis to assure that the record will be complete.\u201d <em>Lowery v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 304, 308, 387 S.E.2d 508, 510 (1990). In the absence of an acquiescence or stipulation, we have held, in circumstances such as in this case, that we will not consider the error assigned to the rejection of the testimony unless it has been given in the absence of the jury and made a part of the record. <em>Whittaker, </em>217 Va. at 969, 234 S.E.2d at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Evans argues that we can expect Brown\u2019s testimony to mirror Evans\u2019s testimony. That, however, is a matter we cannot assume and is precisely why a proffer is required. Clearly, Evans\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement to the trial judge that \u201c[Brown\u2019s testimony] goes to the state of mind\u201d is not sufficient to proffer the substance of Brown\u2019s testimony; that statement was given in response to the adequacy of the Commonwealth\u2019s objection and was not an avowal of the substance of Brown\u2019s testimony. We hold, therefore, the record is insufficient to determine whether the trial judge erred in sustaining the prosecutor\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The rule is now well established that \u201cprivate communications, possibly prejudicial, between jurors and third parties, are forbidden and invalidate the verdict unless their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>harmlessness is made to appear.\u201d <em>Dozier v. Morrisette, </em>198 Va. 37, 40, 92 S.E.2d 366, 368 (1956). \u201cIn considering a motion to set aside when juror misconduct is alleged, the trial court has the affirmative duty \u2018to investigate the charges and to ascertain whether or not, as a matter of fact, the jury was guilty of such misconduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Moorefield, </em>231 Va. 260, 265, 343 S.E.2d 329, 332 (1986) (quoting <em>Kearns v. Hall, </em>197 Va. 736, 743, 91 S.E.2d 648, 653 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Although the Supreme Court has held that \u201chearsay affidavits are not admissible in support of a motion for a new trial,\u201d <em>Moorefield, </em>231 Va. at 265, 343 S.E.2d at 333, the Court also has noted that, \u201c[nevertheless, such an affidavit may be sufficient to require the trial court to investigate the matters recited in the document.\u201d See <em>also Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 188, 207, 361 S.E.2d 436, 447 (1987). In conducting such an investigation, the trial judge may summon jurors and persons knowledgeable of the events to be \u201csworn in open court and duly examined by the court and counsel as to what had transpired.\u201d <em>Dozier, </em>198 Va. at 40, 92 S.E.2d at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In deciding whether to order a new trial, the judge must be mindful of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">A juror may not properly receive any information about a case he is hearing except in open court and in the manner provided by law. The reception of any evidence by the jury, especially in a criminal case, in addition to that produced at trial is ground for setting aside the verdict whenever there is sufficient ground to believe that ... an accused in a criminal case, has been prejudiced by receipt of the information. And the test in a criminal case \u201cis not whether the jurors were actually prejudiced by the extraneous matter, but whether they might have been so prejudiced. If they might have been prejudiced, then the purity of the verdict is open to serious doubt and the verdict should be set aside and a new trial awarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\"><em>Brittle v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 518, 522, 281 S.E.2d 889, 890 (1981) (citations omitted). Although \u201ca motion for a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>trial on the ground of juror misconduct is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge,\u201d <em>Moorefield, </em>231 Va. at 265, 343 S.E.2d at 332, the Supreme Court long ago held that this principle must be applied \u201cwith the added caution that only-slight evidence of influence or prejudice as a result of such misconduct of a juror should be required to warrant the granting of a new trial.\u201d <em>Hickerson v. Burner, </em>186 Va. 66, 72, 41 S.E.2d 451, 454 (1947). Against the background of these principles, we must determine whether, as Evans contends, the trial judge erred in denying his motion for an evidentiary hearing to enable him to prove juror misconduct that would merit a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In denying Evans\u2019s motion, the trial judge relied upon three pieces of evidence: the juror\u2019s unsworn oral statement at the end of the trial concerning the event, the juror\u2019s written statement to Evans\u2019s investigator that suggests the occurrence of improper communication, and the juror\u2019s further written statement to the detective that contradicts in part his previous written statement. We note that neither of the two written statements from the juror was an \u201caffidavit,\u201d as that term is commonly used. An affidavit is a declaration in writing made by a person under oath and administered before a person authorized by law. <em>Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hammer, </em>83 F.Supp. 383, 385 (W.D.Va.), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Farm Bureau Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Hammer, </em>177 F.2d 793 (4th Cir.1949). <em>See also Huff v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 710, 711-12, 194 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1973); <em>Hawkins v. Gibson, </em>28 Va. (1 Leigh) 476, 480 (1829); Code \u00a7 49-4 and \u00a7 49-5; Black\u2019s <em>Law Dictionary </em>58 (7th ed.1999). Furthermore, the record indicates that Nelson\u2019s three-page affidavit was proffered as an exhibit, was sworn, and contains a detailed narrative of his meeting with the juror, which contradicts parts of the statement the juror gave the detective. After hearing oral argument by counsel, the trial judge ruled that \u201cthe statements submitted by [Evans\u2019s counsel] were incorrect.\u201d The trial judge also ruled, however, that even if Evans\u2019s allegation of misconduct was correct, he would still find the conduct insufficient as to require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Initially, we hold that the case decisions are contrary to the trial judge\u2019s alternative ruling that, even if the events occurred as Evans alleged, those facts provide an insufficient basis for a new trial. A juror may not properly receive any information about a case he is hearing except in open court and in the manner provided by law. <em>Brittle, </em>222 Va. at 522, 281 S.E.2d at 890. When a juror, \u201cespecially in a criminal case,\u201d receives extraneous evidence, that circumstance \u201cis ground for setting aside the verdict whenever there is sufficient ground to believe that ... an accused in a criminal case has been prejudiced by receipt of the information.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Both of the juror\u2019s written statements revealed more facts than disclosed by the juror at the close of trial. One of the juror\u2019s statements indicates that Evans\u2019s uncle revealed to him inappropriate information about Evans. Specifically, that statement indicates the uncle said that Evans thinks he\u2019s slick, that Evans was always in trouble, that Evans has been in this kind of trouble before, and that he hoped the jury gave Evans forty years. If the juror\u2019s statement is correct, then the juror received information about matters not evidence in the trial and not properly introduced in an open court. This information is highly prejudicial to Evans because it suggests that Evans is someone capable of committing the crimes charged, that he has the propensity to commit these types of crimes, and that Evans\u2019s own uncle thought he was guilty. At the very least, a verdict under these circumstances is open to doubts. <em>See Thompson v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 704, 715, 70 S.E.2d 284, 290 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We further hold that the trial judge failed to satisfy his affirmative duty to adequately investigate the juror misconduct allegation when he denied Evans\u2019s motion for a new trial without first conducting an evidentiary hearing. When the trial judge questioned the juror at the end of the trial, he asked the juror whether the juror \u201coverheard anything or discussed anything with anybody.\u201d The juror\u2019s response was a brief denial of any contact of substance with the man. When the juror\u2019s written statements were later presented to the trial judge, the nature of the contact, however, was disclosed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>different. Because the two written statements conflict with each other and also with the juror\u2019s oral statement, the trial judge was no longer investigating a naked allegation of juror misconduct. He had a basis to believe several conflicting sets of facts eminated from this juror, one of which supported the misconduct allegation. In addition, the trial judge had a proffer in the form of an affidavit from an investigator attesting to the circumstances surrounding the statement the juror gave him and contradicting, in part, one of the juror\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We do not know from competent evidence in the record what actually transpired. But the trial judge should not have dismissed Evans\u2019s motion without first conducting an adequate investigation upon evidence properly presented at a hearing. The juror\u2019s statements and Nelson\u2019s affidavit were sufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing. Therefore, we reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing and for a determination on proper evidence whether sufficient misconduct occurred to warrant the setting aside of the jury verdict \u201cand for such proceedings thereafter as may be necessary and proper.\u201d <em>Kearns, </em>197 Va. at 745, 91 S.E.2d at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
