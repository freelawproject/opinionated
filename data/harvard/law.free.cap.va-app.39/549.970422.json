Ferguson contends that the circuit court erred in incorporating the J &amp; DR court\u2019s order into its order disposing of Ferguson\u2019s appeal, because the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court\u2019s order contained inappropriate language concerning the continued appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem. </em>For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Ferguson and Christine Aylor Grubb were never married, but produced two children during their relationship. On February 28, 2000, the circuit court entered an order granting Grubb sole custody of the children, subject to certain specified visitation periods reserved for Ferguson. During the proceedings upon which the custody order was based, J. Michael Sharman represented the children as their court-appointed guardian <em>ad litem. </em>The custody order released Sharman as the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>but transferred \u201call matters pertaining to the custody, visitation, [and] support\u201d of the children back to the J &amp; DR court for purposes of \u201cfuture enforcement of the decree or for modification [of the] provisions thereof as the circumstances may require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">In April of 2001, a complaint was filed with the Orange County Department of Social Services, alleging that Ferguson had failed to properly supervise the boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Because of the complaint, Grubb denied Ferguson visitation with the boys on Easter weekend of that year, as well as for two weekends in April 2001, two weekends in May 2001, and one weekend in June 2001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, Ferguson commenced an enforcement action in the J &amp; DR court, obtaining three show cause summonses against Grubb, directing her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>show cause why she should not be held in contempt of the February 28, 2000 custody and visitation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">A hearing on these matters was scheduled for June 14, 2001. Prior to the hearing, Ferguson and Grubb informed the J &amp; DR court that they had reached an agreement concerning the visitation issue. In response, the court re-appointed Sharman as guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the children so that he could represent their interests as they pertained to any such agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">On October 28, 2001, the matter remained unresolved and the J &amp; DR court entered an order addressing the matter of the rules to show cause, as well as \u201ctwo petitions to modify visitation filed by plaintiff.\u201d The court stated, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\n<em>Decree</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\"><em>% </em>sj\u00ed ^ sjc H\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">The Circuit Court order of February 28, 2000 is modified only as stated herein, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">IT IS THEREFORE, ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">1. This case is to be considered a foster care prevention case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-12\">2. Father is to receive, as compensation for the visitation time lost, two (2) consecutive weeks of visitation beginning June 15, 2001 at 5:00 p.m., and continuing to June 29th, 2001 at 5:00 p.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-13\"># # # # &gt;ji sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-14\">In addition to the those [sic] items above that were agreed upon there were certain issues that the parties disagreed upon when the draft of the Order was presented. On September 20, 2001, the Court heard argument as to those issues with all parties present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-15\">Whereupon it is further ordered by the Court as follows: 10. The appointment of the guardian <em>ad litem </em>is continued in this court, and the guardian <em>ad litem </em>and his staff shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>have access to both parents\u2019 homes on an announced or unannounced basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">11. Between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., no party shall allow a person with whom he/she has a romantic relationship or a person of the opposite sex, who is over the age of 18 and is unrelated by blood or marriage, to be in the residential unit (including but not limited to tent, camper, hotel room, condominium or house/apartment) where any of the children are located. This shall not apply to a person of the opposite sex who is accompanied by his/her spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">12. Between the hours of 10 p.m. [sic] and 6:30 a.m., no party shall allow a person in whom one of the children has a romantic interest or a person that one of the children is dating to be in the residential unit where any of the children are located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\"># $ s}: ifc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">Nothing further having come before the Court, This [sic] matter is ended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Ferguson signed the order, but noted his objections to \u201c[provisions 10, 11 &amp; 12,\u201d \u201cas being beyond the authority of the Court.\u201d Ferguson subsequently noted his appeal to the circuit court, and additionally requested compensatory custodial relief and counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">On December 17, 2001, the circuit court held a conference and scheduled the hearing on the appeal for February 25, 2002. The court also \u201creconfirmed\u201d Sharman as guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the children. Subsequently, Ferguson filed a motion to vacate the appointment of Sharman as guardian <em>ad litem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">On February 25, 2002, the circuit court first considered Ferguson\u2019s motion to vacate Sharman\u2019s appointment. After hearing evidence on the motion, the court denied the motion holding that the evidence did not support Ferguson\u2019s claim that Sharman had acted inappropriately in his role as guardian <em>ad litem </em>and that Sharman\u2019s services were necessary in this particular case because of his institutional knowledge of the parties and their various court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The court then considered Ferguson\u2019s appeal and request for compensatory visitation. After hearing evidence and argument, the court denied Ferguson\u2019s request for additional visitation, finding that Grubb had not willfully disobeyed the custody order. The court also found that a continued appointment of the guardian <em>ad litem </em>in this matter was warranted under the circumstances of this case and that such intervention was necessary because the \u201cchildren [were] in some jeopardy, and [as such,] foster care prevention [was] appropriate.\u201d In addition, the court found that there was no legal bar to the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>use of \u201cstaff to make investigations at the home,\u201d holding that such use of staff was \u201can implied power that the [g]uardian [a]d [l]item has.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the circuit court issued its written order on March 27, 2002 declaring, in addition to the above, that \u201c[a]ll of the numbered and lettered portions that appeared] in the decretal portion of the lower court\u2019s October 23, 2001 order, except for Provision 11[] and 12[] on Page 5 thereof and except as are otherwise provided for herein, are hereby incorporated into and made a part of this order.\u201d The order further remanded \u201c[t]his matter and all future matters regarding enforcement ... to the Culpeper [JD &amp; R] court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">On appeal to this Court, Ferguson raises only two issues. Ferguson first argues that the circuit court erred in incorporating paragraph 10 of the J &amp; DR court\u2019s order into its decree, because he argues the court lacks the authority to order the continued appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>where no legal proceedings remain before the court. Under the circumstances of this case, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s decision, when based upon an <em>ore terms </em>hearing, is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>it.\u201d <em>Venable v. Venable, </em>2 Va.App. 178, 186, 342 S.E.2d 646, 651 (1986). Indeed, \u201con review the \u2018decision of the trial judge is peculiarly entitled to respect for he saw the parties, heard the witnesses testify and was in closer touch with the situation than the [appellate] Court, which is limited to a review of the written record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sutherland v. Sutherland, </em>14 Va.App. 42, 44, 414 S.E.2d 617, 618 (1992) (quoting <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>218 Va. 196, 200, 237 S.E.2d 89, 92 (1977)). Matters of custody and determinations pertaining to the best interests of the children at issue, \u201care left largely to the discretion of the trial court whose judgments will not be reversed in the absence of a showing that the discretion given has been abused.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-266, pertaining to the appointment of guardians <em>ad litem </em>in matters involving children, provides as follows, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">A. Prior to the hearing by the court of any case involving a child who is alleged to be abused or neglected or who is the subject of an entrustment agreement or a petition seeking termination of residual parental rights or who is otherwise before the court pursuant to subdivision A 4 of \u00a7 16.1-241 or \u00a7 63.1-219.37, the court shall appoint a discreet and competent attorney-at-law as guardian <em>ad litem </em>to represent the child pursuant to \u00a7 16.1-266.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">He H\u00ab H\u00ab H* H* H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">D. In all other cases which in the discretion of the court require counsel or a guardian <em>ad litem </em>to represent the interests of the child or children or the parent or guardian, a discreet and competent attorney-at-law may be appointed by the court. However, in cases where the custody of a child or children is the subject of controversy or requires determination and each of the parents or other persons claiming a right to custody is represented by counsel, the court shall not appoint counsel or a guardian <em>ad litem </em>to represent the interests of the child or children unless the court finds, at any stage in the proceedings in a specific case, that the interests of the child or children are not otherwise adequately represented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Ferguson contends that, subsequent to the disposition of his appeal to the circuit court, there was no \u201ccase\u201d before the court to warrant the court\u2019s continued appointment of the guardian <em>ad litem. </em>Therefore, he contends the court\u2019s order directing the continued appointment was erroneous as the court lacked the statutory authority to order such an appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We first, and most importantly, note that \u201c\u2018[i]n Virginia, we have established the rule that the welfare of the infant is the primary, paramount, and controlling consideration of the court in all controversies between parents over the custody of their minor children. All other matters are subordinate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Verrocchio v. Verrocchio, </em>16 Va.App. 314, 318, 429 S.E.2d 482, 484 (1993) (quoting <em>Mullen v. Mullen, </em>188 Va. 259, 269, 49 S.E.2d 349, 354 (1948)). Accordingly, \u201c[i]n matters of a child\u2019s welfare, trial courts are vested with broad discretion in making the decisions necessary to guard and to foster a child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 328, 387 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">An example of this broad authority granted to courts in such matters appears in Code \u00a7 20-124.2, concerning court-ordered custody and visitation arrangements. That section provides that once a court enters an order concerning matters of custody and visitation, \u201c[the] court shall have the continuing authority and jurisdiction to make any additional orders necessary to effectuate and enforce [that] order____\u201d Code \u00a7 20-124.2. Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">[o]nce a court has ruled on matters relating to the custody and care of minor children, and visitation rights of the noncustodial parent, the court retains jurisdiction throughout the minority status of the child involved. The court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, may alter or change custody or the terms of visitation when subsequent events render such action appropriate for the child\u2019s welfare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-9\"><em>Eichelberger v. Eichelberger, </em>2 Va.App. 409, 412, 345 S.E.2d 10, 11 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Therefore, because relief under the child custody statute remains within the court\u2019s jurisdiction throughout the infancy of the child involved, it is clear that both the J &amp; DR court and the circuit court here retained jurisdiction over the custody matters of the children, sufficient to empower them with the authority to order the continued appointment of the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>until the children reached the age of majority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Moreover, we have held that \u201c \u2018the rules and statutes that presently express the [circuit] court\u2019s authority to appoint guardians <em>ad litem </em>are not exclusive sources of that power. Rather they are non-exclusive codifications of an equitable power and responsibility dating back to chancery days.\u2019 \u201d <em>Verrocchio, </em>16 Va.App. at 318-19, 429 S.E.2d at 485 (quoting <em>Stewart v. Superior Court, </em>163 Ariz. 227, 787 P.2d 126, 129 (1989)). The Court based this determination upon the common law doctrine of <em>parens patriae, </em>which is \u201cdefined as that power of the Commonwealth to watch over the interests of those who are incapable of protecting themselves.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In <em>Verrocchio, </em>we recognized that \u201c[i]n child custody cases, the equitable nature of this doctrine focuses the power of the court on the best interests of the child,\u201d <em>id., </em>noting that \u201c[t]his protective power, which is unique to those cases dealing with the rights and interests of children, includes the long established practice of appointing a guardian <em>ad litem </em>to protect the best interests of a child upon the chancellor\u2019s determination that such appointment is necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 429 S.E.2d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">\u201cWe are mindful, however, that despite the great need for a circuit court to have the power to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>in an appropriate case, \u2018[a] trial court must have a cognizable basis for granting equitable relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317-18, 429 S.E.2d at 484 (quoting <em>Tiller v. Owen, </em>243 Va. 176, 179, 413 S.E.2d 51, 53 (1992)). Furthermore, it must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>remembered that a guardian\u2019s duties are judicial, rather than caretaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Thus, \u201c[t]he obligation to comply with the statutory scheme that has been designed by the legislature to protect parents and children cannot be abandoned by a judge under the guise of seeking \u2018to promote the best interests of a child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Willis v. Gamez, </em>20 Va.App. 75, 82, 455 S.E.2d 274, 278 (1995). Instead, \u201cthe established practice is that a guardian <em>ad litem </em>may be appointed after a trial judge makes a preliminary finding that the best interests of the child require such appointment.\u201d <em>Verrocchio, </em>16 Va.App. at 317, 429 S.E.2d at 484. Such interests may require affirmative judicial action on the part of the guardian <em>ad litem </em>in properly fulfilling his or her duties. <em>See Stanley v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Serv., </em>242 Va. 60, 62, 405 S.E.2d 621, 622 (1991) (\u201c[A] guardian <em>ad litem </em>may file affirmative pleadings necessary to protect the ward\u2019s interest.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Here, the court made the appropriate factual determination. Indeed, both the J <em>&amp; </em>DR and circuit courts specifically found that this was a \u201cfoster care prevention case,\u201d requiring the continued intervention of the court, through the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>to protect the best interests of the children at issue. Under these circumstances, we find no error in the court\u2019s order directing the continued appointment of the guardian <em>ad litem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Ferguson next contends that the court lacked the authority to allow the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>by way of its order, to utilize staff members to carry out his duties. Once again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Code \u00a7 16.1-266.1 states the minimum criteria for attorneys appointed as guardians <em>ad litem </em>as \u201c(i) [a] license or permission to practice law in Virginia, (ii) current training in the roles, responsibilities and duties of guardian ad litem representation, (in) familiarity with the court system and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>general background in juvenile law, and (iv) demonstrated proficiency in this area of the law.\u201d Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">[t]he nature of the duties of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>was addressed by this Court in <em>Norfolk Division of Social Services v. Unknown Father, </em>2 Va.App. 420, 345 S.E.2d 533 (1986), where we emphasized that [a] guardian <em>ad litem </em>is required to represent vigorously the infant or other person under a disability, fully protecting that individual\u2019s interests and welfare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\"><em>Stanley v. Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>10 Va.App. 596, 603, 395 S.E.2d 199, 202-03 (1990), <em>aff'd by Stanley v. Fairfax County Dept. of Social Services, </em>242 Va. 60, 405 S.E.2d 621 (1991); <em>see also </em>Rule 8:6. \u201cTo discharge this responsibility properly, a guardian is expected to \u2018investigate thoroughly and \u2018carefully examine [] the facts surrounding the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe v. Doe, </em>15 Va.App. 242, 245, 421 S.E.2d 913, 915 (1992) (quoting <em>Ruffin v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 488, 495, 393 S.E.2d 425, 429 (1990)) (omission in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Ferguson has offered no authority, nor can we find any, standing for the proposition that a guardian <em>ad litem </em>is barred, in an appropriate case, from utilizing court-approved or designated staff, in assisting with fulfilling his or her obligations in that role. It is the guardian <em>ad litem </em>who retains the ultimate responsibility and accountability to the court in carrying out his or her role in the manner required by the court, as well as the applicable statutory and judicial mandates. Accordingly, on the facts presented in this case where the staff member at issue possessed special expertise, we find no error in the court\u2019s order directing Ferguson and Grubb to permit the guardian <em>ad litem </em>and a member of his staff to visit their homes on an unannounced or announced basis, for the purposes stated in the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-10\">. Apparently, on May 22, 2001, the J &amp; DR court ordered no further visitation until the matter was resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-8\">. However, the court struck paragraphs 11 and 12 of the J &amp; DR court\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">. This fact remains true, despite the J &amp; DR court\u2019s, perhaps, inartful wording in the October 23, 2001 order stating, \"This matter is ended.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
