The trial judge instructed the jury on the mandatory two-year minimum sentence prescribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), and the jury fixed Mouberry\u2019s punishment at two years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Mouberry contends that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury on the mandatory minimum penalty provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). Instead, Mouberry argues, the court should have instructed the jury on the general sentencing options for a Class 6 felony as set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 10(f). Mouberry further insists that the trial court erred by imposing the jury\u2019s recommended sentence and by not reducing it below the mandatory minimum term dictated by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). Finding Mouberry\u2019s arguments meritless, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">On September 10, 2000, a sheriffs deputy stopped Mouberry on a routine traffic investigation and noticed a .22 caliber rifle behind the seat of the vehicle he was operating. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>checking Mouberry\u2019s license, the deputy learned that he had a prior non-violent felony conviction. Mouberry was charged with the illegal possession of a firearm by a felon. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">During the sentencing phase of the trial, the trial court instructed the jury to \u201cfix the defendant\u2019s punishment at: (1) A specific term of imprisonment, but not less than two (2) years nor more than five (5) years.\u201d This instruction took into account the statutory two-year mandatory minimum sentence required by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). The relevant portion of the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">It shall be unlawful for (i) any person who has been convicted of a felony ... to knowingly and intentionally possess or transport any firearm---- Any person who violates this section shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. However, any person who violates this section by knowingly and intentionally possessing or transporting any firearm and who was previously convicted of a violent felony as defined in \u00a7 17.1-805 shall not be eligible for probation, and shall be sentenced to a minimum, mandatory term of imprisonment of five years. Any person who violates this section by knowingly and intentionally possessing or transporting any firearm and who was previously convicted of any other felony shall not be eligible for probation, and shall be sentenced to a minimum, mandatory term of imprisonment of two years. The minimum, mandatory terms of imprisonment prescribed for violations of this section shall not be suspended in whole or in part and shall be served consecutively with any other sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). Mouberry objected to the sentencing instruction, arguing that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) defines this offense as a Class 6 felony and thus the instruction should give the jury the option to recommend incarceration at any level less than five years \u2014 the range prescribed for Class 6 felonies by Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 10(f).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>After reviewing Code \u00a7 18.2-S08.2(A), the trial court refused Mouberry\u2019s instruction and overruled his objections to the Commonwealth\u2019s instruction. The trial judge stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASP\">although the offense is generally identified as a Class Six felony, the language of the statute clearly indicates the intention of the legislature that in cases of this nature ... the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment two years would have to take precedence over any other type of punishment provided for in the general provision of Class Six felonies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">After receiving the Commonwealth\u2019s instruction authorizing an incarceration term between two to five years, the jury fixed punishment at two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge reiterated that \u201cthe discretion of the court is either nonexistent or limited severely\u201d given the mandatory minimum term. \u201cThe law is such that the legislature has determined that a mandatory minimum of two years is the appropriate minimum punishment for a sentence for an offense of this type and the jury, in effect, has evaluated it on that basis.\u201d Disagreeing with the trial court\u2019s interpretation, Mouberry appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">When reviewing jury instructions, an appellate court must ensure that the law has been \u201cclearly stated\u201d and that the \u201cinstructions cover all issues\u201d fairly raised by the evidence. <em>Tice v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 332, 339, 563 S.E.2d 412, 416 (2002) (citation omitted); <em>see also Arnold v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>wealth, </em>37 Va.App. 781, 787, 560 S.E.2d 915, 917 (2002); <em>Hudspith v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 136, 137, 435 S.E.2d 588, 589 (1993). A trial court should instruct the jury, when requested to do so, \u201c \u2018on all principles of law applicable to the pleadings and the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dowdy v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 114, 116, 255 S.E.2d 506, 508 (1979) (quoting <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 587, 592, 43 S.E.2d 906, 909 (1947)). An instruction that provides \u201ca correct statement of the law is one of the \u2018essentials of a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hucks v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 168, 174, 531 S.E.2d 658, 661 (2000) (quoting <em>Dowdy, </em>220 Va. at 116, 255 S.E.2d at 508). No instruction should be given that \u201cincorrectly states the applicable law or which would be confusing or misleading to the jury.\u201d <em>Bruce v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 298, 300, 387 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Mouberry argues that he was \u201centitled to have the jury instructed on the full range of punishment for a Class 6 felony and to have the sentencing court consider the same range of punishment.\u201d This conclusion follows, Mouberry asserts, from the fact that \u201cthe General Assembly did not remove language which specified the class of the offense, when it amended \u00a7 18.2-308.2 in 1999.\u201d Put another way, Mouberry contends that the language defining the offense as a Class 6 felony generates an ambiguity in the language of the statute, which, in turn, creates a conflict between Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10(f) and 18.2-308.2(A). From there, Mouberry invites us to resolve the ambiguity by invalidating the conflicting portions of \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) and by ruling that the general sentencing provisions of \u00a7 18.2-10(f) control.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Absent an ambiguity in the statutory language, \u201cthere is no room for interpretation.\u201d <em>Chesapeake Hosp. Auth. v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 551, 562, 554 S.E.2d 55, 60 (2001) (citing <em>Brown v. Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An ambiguity exists only \u201cwhen the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>is difficult to comprehend, is of doubtful import, or lacks clearness and definiteness.\u201d <em>Brown v. Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985). In other words, statutory-language \u201c \u2018is ambiguous if it admits of being understood in more than one way or refers to two or more things simultaneously.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gen. Trading v. Motor Vehicle Dealer Bd., </em>28 Va.App. 264, 269, 503 S.E.2d 809, 812 (1998) (quoting <em>Brown, </em>229 Va. at 321, 330 S.E.2d at 87).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">When the General Assembly uses \u201cwords of a plain and definite import, courts cannot assign to them a construction that would be tantamount to holding that the General Assembly intended something other than that which it actually expressed.\u201d <em>Mozley v. Prestwould Bd. of Dirs., </em>264 Va. 549, 554, 570 S.E.2d 817, 820 (2002) (citations omitted); <em>Lee County v. Town of St. Charles, </em>264 Va. 344, 348, 568 S.E.2d 680, 682 (2002). The words of a statute should be given \u201ctheir common, ordinary and accepted meaning\u201d absent a contrary intent by the legislature. <em>Germek v. Germek, </em>34 Va.App. 1, 8, 537 S.E.2d 596, 600 (2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In our view, Mouberry finds an ambiguity in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) where none exists. After generally classifying the offense as a \u201cClass 6 felony,\u201d the very next word in the statute is \u201cHowever.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It could have just as easily been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>\u201cprovided that\u201d or \u201cbut\u201d or \u201cin any event.\u201d A general proposition has been stated and on its heels comes a specific exception. Here, the exception mandates two tiers of minimum, mandatory sentences: a two-year term for prior non-violent felonies, and a five-year term for prior violent felonies. Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), therefore, does not contradict Code \u00a7 18.2-10(f). In complete harmony, the former simply qualifies the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Indeed, in 1999, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) to ensure that no legitimate confusion could exist on this subject. <em>See </em>1999 Va. Acts, ch. 829. Prior to the 1999 -amendment, the third sentence of subsection (A) provided that a \u201cviolation of this section shall be <em>punishable </em>as Class 6 felony.\u201d (Emphasis added). The 1999 amendment changed the text of this sentence to state that any \u201cperson who violates this section shall be <em>guilty </em>of a Class 6 felony.\u201d (Emphasis added). In the remainder of the statute, the 1999 amendment made clear that the offense would nonetheless be punishable pursuant to one of two mandatory minimum terms. <em>Id.; see also Askew v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 718, 725-26, 568 S.E.2d 403, 407 (2002) (similar analysis governs Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4\u2019s mandatory minimum terms).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">By urging us to find \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) ambiguous or in conflict with other statutes, Mouberry invites us to render substantial portions of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) meaningless. To be sure, if followed through to its conclusion, the argument would mandate that we nullify the mandatory sentence requirement. An extraordinary request by any measure, Mouberry\u2019s argument presupposes a power in the judiciary that simply does not exist. \u201cAny such change to the statute must be a legislative, rather than a judicial, undertaking.\u201d <em>Vaughn, Inc. v. Beck, </em>262 Va. 673, 679, 554 S.E.2d 88, 91 (2001) (citation omitted). \u201cInterpretations that \u2018rewrite statutes\u2019 are not permitted.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 634, 640, 561 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2002) (quoting <em>Frias v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 193, 199, 538 S.E.2d 374, 376 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Mouberry also argues that \u00a7 18.2-14 conflicts with the trial court\u2019s construction of the punishment provisions of \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). Section 18.2-14 provides that offenses \u201cfor which punishment is prescribed without specification as to the class of the offense, shall be punished according to the punishment prescribed in the section or sections thus defining the offense.\u201d Because \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) is an offense for which punishment is prescribed with specification as to the class of the offense, Mouberry argues, \u00a7 18.2-14 requires that it not be punished according to the punishment prescribed in the section defining the offense. For two reasons, we disagree. First, Code \u00a7 18.2-14 applies only to those statutes not containing a specific offense class. Second, in any event, Code \u00a7 18.2-14 does not address situations where, as here, a statute includes both an offense class and a prescribed punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The plain meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) also undermines Mouberry\u2019s second argument, that the trial court erred at the sentencing hearing by imposing the mandatory minimum term rather than considering lesser options available under Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 10(f). The trial court correctly held that its discretion to impose a sentence below Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A)\u2019s mandatory two-year term was \u201cnonexistent.\u201d <em>See generally In re: Commonwealth of Virginia, </em>229 <em>Va. </em>159, 163, 326 S.E.2d 695, 697 (1985) (\u201cClearly, therefore, by prescribing a mandatory sentence, the General Assembly has divested trial judges of all discretion respecting punishment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">We acknowledge that \u201cmany question the wisdom of mandatory minimum sentencing.\u201d <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, -, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2420, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). Concerns about the \u201c \u2018propriety, wisdom, necessity and expediency<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201d of legislation, however, can only be resolved by the legislative branch of government. <em>Willis v. Mullett, </em>263 Va. 653, 658, 561 S.E.2d 705, 709 (2002) (quoting <em>City of Richmond v. Fary, </em>210 Va. 338, 346, 171 S.E.2d 257, 263 (1969)). \u201cThis Court\u2019s function is not to pass on the wisdom of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>legislation.\u201d <em>Dale v. City of Newport News, </em>18 Va.App. 800, 802, 447 S.E.2d 878, 879 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In sum, the trial court properly instructed the jury to recommend a sentence no lower than the two-year mandatory minimum term required by Code \u00a7 18.2-808.2(A). The trial court also did not err in imposing the two-year sentence recommended by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-10\">.
