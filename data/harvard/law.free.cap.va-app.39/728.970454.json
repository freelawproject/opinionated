STEVEN AGEE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Ralph Steve Mullins, s/k/a Ralph Steven Mullins (\u201cMullins\u201d), a patient at the Southwest Virginia Mental Health Institute (\u201cSWVMHI\u201d), appeals an August 2, 2002 order of the Circuit Court of Smyth County requiring him to undergo medical treatment pursuant to Code \u00a7 87.1-134.21. Mullins contends on appeal that: (1) the evidence was insufficient for the. trial court to find that he was \u201cincapable of making an informed decision on his own behalf,\u201d and (2) the ordered treatment is contrary to his basic values and the trial court thus failed to make the required finding that the treatment \u201cis necessary to prevent death or a serious irreversible condition.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">Mullins was involuntarily committed to the SWVMHI in 1995 and has resided there until the present time. In June 2002, Mullins was diagnosed with serum protein electrophoresis M-Spike abnormality and heme positive stool. He also has difficulty eating solid food.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">Due to these indications and because Mullins suffers from schizophrenia, Dr. James Vesce, a medical doctor and psychiatrist treating Mullins at SWVMHI, sought judicial authorization to perform diagnostic tests, including a bone marrow biopsy, colonoscopy, and esophagogastrodudenoscopy. Vesce and other physicians opined Mullins\u2019 symptoms were indicative of cancer and diagnostic procedures were required in order to provide sufficient information to safeguard his health. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>The General District Court of Smyth County conducted a hearing on June 24, 2002, and ordered implementation of the diagnostic tests. Muffins appealed this order to the Circuit Court of Smyth County.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21, the circuit court heard the case <em>de novo </em>on July 10, 2002. The court heard testimony by Dr. Vesce and ordered Muffins to undergo the diagnostic tests under \u201cconscious sedation.\u201d However, when Mullins arrived at Smyth County Community Hospital on August 1, 2002, it was discovered that a fourth test, a broncoscopy, would be needed and that the tests would require full anesthesia. The attending physicians deferred treatment until a revised and comprehensive treatment order could be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">On August 1, 2002, the general district court, with all parties and counsel present, conducted a hearing in Muffins\u2019 hospital room. The court modified its original order to include the additional test and full anesthesia. Muffins again appealed to the circuit court, which also conducted a <em>de novo </em>hearing in Muffins\u2019 room that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The circuit court heard testimony from Dr. Vesce, Dr. Ampucha, a surgeon, and Dr. Harmon, an anesthesiologist, about Mullins\u2019 capacity and medical condition. The circuit court then entered its August 2, 2002 order which made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Ralph Steve Muffins is mentally ill and that there is no other person who can give consent for the proposed treatment, that the treatment outlined in the August 1, 2002 order is appropriate and in the best interests of the patient, and that the patient is incapable of giving knowing consent to the proposed treatment, it is ORDERED pursuant to Virginia Code Section 37.1-134.21 that the patient be treated under the terms of the August 1, 2002 Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">The circuit court\u2019s order also reflected that Muffins noted his appeal to this Court and that the circuit court\u2019s order was stayed pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21(A) authorizes a circuit court to order</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4G\">[t]he provision, withholding or withdrawal of a specific treatment or course of treatment for a mental or physical disorder, if it finds upon clear and convincing evidence that (i) the person is either incapable of making an informed decision on his own behalf or is incapable of communicating such a decision due to a physical or mental disorder and (ii) the proposed action is in the best interest of the person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAU\">The Smyth County Circuit Court\u2019s August 2, 2002 order was made citing this grant of statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21(K) authorizes appeal to this Court from such an order authorizing involuntary medical treatment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In reviewing that order, \u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21(H) requires the trial court to make certain findings as a condition precedent to entry of a treatment order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mullins contends the trial court\u2019s order was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>error requiring reversal because certain of its findings were deficient. Specifically, he contends that (1) the evidence was generally insufficient to support a finding that he was not capable of making an informed decision regarding his medical treatment, and (2) the court failed to make a finding that the proposed treatment was necessary to prevent death or a serious irreversible condition as required by Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21(H)(4) when the treatment is contrary to the person\u2019s basic values. Mullins raises no other issue as to the necessity or adequacy of the court\u2019s findings under subsection H or otherwise. On appeal, we consider only the issues raised.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Mullins asserts the evidence was insufficient for the trial court to find that he was incapable of making an informed decision on his own behalf, but cites no evidence in the record in support of his argument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record contains a sparse \u201cWritten Statement of Facts in Lieu of Transcript,\u201d which indicates the trial court heard the testimony of the three doctors treating Mullins before making its findings of fact. The written statement does not give the testimony of the physicians, or even a summary of their evidence. Neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>does the written statement identify whether Mullins testified at the hearing, or what, if anything, he placed in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Mullins has failed to provide an adequate record on appeal that would allow us to consider his argument on the sufficiency of the evidence. \u201cIf an insufficient record is furnished, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed.\u201d <em>White v. Morano, </em>249 Va. 27, 30, 452 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1995). As Mullins provides us no basis in the record upon which to consider his allegation of error, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">B. Consideration of Basic Values</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Mullins does not dispute the trial court\u2019s finding under Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21(H)(4) that the proposed treatment is in his best interests. He nonetheless assigns error under subsection (H)(4), by contending the trial court failed to take account of his basic values which \u201cinclude his belief that he has a right to decide for himself regarding any medical treatment or diagnostic medical tests that should be performed on his body.\u201d Mullins further argues that as his basic values contradict the proposed treatment, the trial court was required by subsection (H)(4) to make an affirmative finding that \u201csuch treatment is necessary to prevent death or a serious irreversible condition.\u201d As the trial court failed to make such a finding, Mullins asserts its order was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Although Mullins alleges on appeal that the proposed medical treatment is contrary to his basic values, the record does not reflect this issue was ever raised to the trial court. Nothing in the record indicates any evidence on this issue was ever introduced or any argument made to the trial court that Mullins\u2019 basic values opposed the proposed treatment. Under the plain language of the statute, a finding that treatment is necessary to prevent death or a serious irreversible condition is required only when a preponderance of the evidence proves the treatment is contrary to the person\u2019s basic values. As no issue of Mullins\u2019 basic values was raised and no evidence of basic values appears in the record, the trial court was under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>no statutory duty to make an independent <em>sua sponte </em>finding that the treatment was necessary to prevent death or a serious irreversible condition. Our consideration of this issue is barred by Rule 5A:18. \u201cThe Court of Appeals will not consider an argument on appeal which was not presented to the trial court.\u201d <em>Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 489 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Mullins failed to provide an adequate record on appeal that permits an appellate court to consider his argument on the insufficiency of the evidence as to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact. Further, Rule 5A:18 bars this Court from considering whether the proposed medical treatment contradicts his basic values. Finding no error by the circuit court, we affirm its order of August 2, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-8\">. Any such appeal must be filed within ten days. Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21(K).

The court shall take into consideration the right of the person to rely on nonmedical, remedial treatment in the practice of religion in lieu of medical treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21(H).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b775-9\">. The Gen\u00e9ral Assembly provided for involuntary medical treatment in very limited circumstances, where such treatment is determined to be in the best interests of a person who is unable to give an informed consent to treatment.
