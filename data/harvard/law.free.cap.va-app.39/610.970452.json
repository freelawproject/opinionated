On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in concluding it lacked jurisdiction under Rule 1:1 to modify his sentence, as requested, more than twenty-one days after entry of the sentencing order. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The relevant facts and procedural posture of this case are not in dispute. Patterson pled guilty in the court below to indictments for possession of cocaine and possession of psilocyn (illegal mushrooms). Both offenses occurred on February 20, 1990, when Patterson was nineteen years old and a freshman at Randolph-Macon College. On May 21, 1990, the trial court accepted Patterson\u2019s pleas of guilty and convicted him on both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">By sentencing order entered July 16, 1990, the trial court dismissed the possession of cocaine conviction and sentenced Patterson, who had no prior criminal history, to ten years in the penitentiary on the possession of psilocyn conviction. The trial court suspended that sentence for twenty years on the condition that Patterson \u201ckeep the peace, be of good behavior, violate no laws of the Commonwealth or any other jurisdiction, and that he receive drug testing under the direction of the Probation Officer of the court under whose supervision he is placed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">On May 13, 1991, upon receipt of a letter from Patterson\u2019s probation officer representing that Patterson was \u201ca suitable person to be released from further supervision,\u201d the trial court entered an order releasing Patterson from further supervision by his probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">On March 9, 2001, Patterson petitioned the trial court to vacate its July 16, 1990 sentencing order pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-303. Seeking termination of \u201cthe period of suspension of [his] sentence,\u201d Patterson represented that the twenty-year period of suspension hindered him in obtaining \u201cgainful employment commensurate with his education and training\u201d and that it would prevent him from having his civil rights restored until he was forty-six years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">At the hearing on Patterson\u2019s petition on May 16, 2001, the Commonwealth conceded Patterson had to that point complied with the terms and conditions of the suspension of his sentence. It argued, however, that, pursuant to the proscriptions of Rule 1:1, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to modify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Patterson\u2019s sentence because Patterson\u2019s petition was filed more than twenty-one days after entry of the sentencing order. Patterson maintained the trial court had jurisdiction to modify his sentence under Code \u00a7 19.2-803 because he was never transferred to the Department of Corrections. He further maintained, in the alternative, that the trial court had jurisdiction to modify his sentence because the twenty-year suspension was so unreasonable in relation to the gravity of the offense that the sentence was void or unlawful. Citing Rule 1:1, the trial court concluded it did not have jurisdiction to make the requested modification and denied Patterson\u2019s petition accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Under Rule 1:1, \u201c[a]ll final judgments, orders, and decrees, irrespective of terms of court, shall remain under the control of the trial court and subject to be modified, vacated, or suspended for twenty-one days after the date of entry, and no longer.\u201d Thus, once the twenty-one-day time period following the entry of a final sentencing order has run without modification, vacation, or suspension of that order, the trial court loses jurisdiction to disturb the order, unless an exception to Rule 1:1 applies. <em>See In re Dept. of Corrections, </em>222 Va. 454, 463-64, 281 S.E.2d 857, 862 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Here, the trial court entered its sentencing order, a final order, on July 16, 1990. The trial court did not modify, vacate, or suspend that order within twenty-one days of its entry. Therefore, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 1:1, the trial court retained jurisdiction over Patterson\u2019s sentence only until August 6, 1990. Patterson did not petition the trial court to vacate the sentencing order until March 9, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Patterson, however, points on appeal, as he did below, to two exceptions to Rule 1:1 that he argues authorized the trial court to modify his sentence although more than twenty-one days had passed since the entry of the trial court\u2019s 1990 sentencing order. The first, Patterson asserts, is Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>\u00a7 19.2-303 and the second is the principle that the \u201ctrial court may correct a void or unlawful sentence at any time.\u201d <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 327, 340, 28 S.E.2d 687, 692 (1944). We will address the applicability of each asserted exception separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">A. Code \u00a7 19.2-303</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-303 provides an exception to Rule 1:1 under certain limited circumstances, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">If a person has been sentenced for a felony to the Department of Corrections but has not actually been transferred to a receiving unit of the Department, the court which heard the case, if it appears compatible with the public interest and there are circumstances in mitigation of the offense, may, at any time before the person is transferred to the Department, suspend or otherwise modify the unserved portion of such a sentence. The court may place the person on probation for such time as the court shall determine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\"><em>See Russnak v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 317, 324, 392 S.E.2d 491, 495 (1990) (\u201cAn exception to [Rule 1:1] is found in Code \u00a7 19.2-303....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Patterson contends the exception to Rule 1:1 offered in Code \u00a7 19.2-303 applies to him because he had \u201cbeen sentenced for a felony to the Department of Corrections but ha[d] not actually been transferred\u201d to the Department of Corrections when he petitioned the trial court to vacate its July 16, 1990 sentencing order. Thus, he argues, the trial court retained jurisdiction to terminate the remaining, \u201cunserved portion\u201d of the period of suspension of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">The Commonwealth concedes that Patterson was sentenced for a felony to the Department of Corrections and that he had not been transferred to the Department when he petitioned the trial court to vacate its July 16, 1990 sentencing order. The Commonwealth contends, however, that Code \u00a7 19.2-303 does not apply to Patterson because the entire period of incarceration in the penitentiary imposed on him had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>suspended and he was not, therefore, \u201cgoing to be transferred to the Department of Corrections at any point in time after sentencing.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-303, the Commonwealth argues, was intended to apply to only those convicted felons who are \u201ctemporarily in a local correctional facility already serving their sentence awaiting transfer to the Department of Corrections.\u201d The legislature\u2019s use in the statute of the words \u201cbefore the person is transferred to the Department\u201d and \u201cunserved portion of ... a sentence\u201d mandates this interpretation, the Commonwealth maintains.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The dispositive question now before us is whether the trial court retained jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 19.2-303 to shorten the period of suspension of Patterson\u2019s sentence in consideration of \u201ccircumstances in mitigation of the offense\u201d more than twenty-one days following the entry of the final sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In resolving that question, we must look to the language of the pertinent part of the statute to determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent. <em>See HCA Health Servs. of Virginia, Inc. v. Levin, </em>260 Va. 215, 220, 530 S.E.2d 417, 420 (2000) (\u201cCourts must give effect to legislative intent, which must be gathered from the words used, unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity.\u201d). As \u201c[t]he purposes of Code \u00a7 19.2-303 are rehabilitative in nature,\u201d <em>Esparza v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 600, 607, 513 S.E.2d 885, 888 (1999) , the statute should be construed liberally. <em>See Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 148, 151, 526 S.E.2d 784, 786 (2000) (stating that statutes should be liberally construed in keeping with their rehabilitative purpose); <em>see also Dyke v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 478, 484, 69 S.E.2d 483, 486 (1952) (noting that courts should liberally construe Code \u00a7 53-272, Code \u00a7 19.2-303\u2019s predecessor, in order to \u201cafford to trial courts a valuable means of bringing about the rehabilitation of offenders against the criminal laws\u201d). This does not mean, however, that Patterson is entitled to an interpretation of Code \u00a7 19.2-303 that is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s plain language. <em>See Cartwright v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 368, 372, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>288 S.E.2d 491, 493 (1982) (noting that a statute may be interpreted in accord with its purpose only to the extent that such purpose \u201c \u2018may be accomplished without doing harm to [the statute\u2019s] language\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Gough v. Shaner, Adm\u2019r, </em>197 Va. 572, 575, 90 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1955))). \u201cThe manifest intention of the legislature, clearly disclosed by its language, must be applied.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 560, 566, 29 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">By its express <em>terms, </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-303 permits the trial court, in cases where the defendant \u201chas been sentenced for a felony to the Department of Corrections but has not actually been transferred to ... the Department,\u201d to retain jurisdiction beyond the twenty-one-day limit of Rule 1:1 to \u201csuspend or otherwise modify the unserved portion of such a sentence.\u201d Patterson argues that, because a portion of his sentence\u2014 specifically, the balance of the period of suspension of sentence \u2014 remained to be served when he petitioned the court to vacate its sentencing order, the trial court retained jurisdiction to \u201cotherwise modify\u201d that \u201cunserved portion\u201d of his sentence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">At issue in this case is whether the term \u201csuch a sentence,\u201d which is not specifically defined in the statute, was intended by the legislature to refer strictly to the period of incarceration in the penitentiary previously imposed by the trial court or, as Patterson contends, to also encompass the period of suspension of sentence previously fixed by the trial court. \u201cWhen, as here, a statute contains no express definition of a term, the general rule of statutory construction is to infer the legislature\u2019s intent from the plain meaning of the language used.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Henrico Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>255 Va. 335, 340, 497 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1998). \u201cAn undefined term must be given its ordinary meaning, considered in the context in which the term is used. The context of the term includes the other language used in the particular statute ... at issue.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Norfolk Cmty. Servs. Bd., </em>260 Va. 334, 339-40, 533 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Here, the syntactic context of the term \u201csuch a sentence\u201d is straightforward and determinative of the issue at hand. The antecedent of \u201csuch a sentence\u201d is that sentence imposed by the trial court when a convicted felon is \u201csentenced ... to the Department of Corrections.\u201d Read plainly, the words \u201csentenced ... to the Department of Corrections\u201d clearly contemplate the imposition of a period of incarceration in the penitentiary on the felon. As written, however, they do not appear to contemplate, either explicitly or connotatively, the suspension of the imposed incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Moreover, in the phrase \u201csuspend or otherwise modify the unserved portion of such a sentence,\u201d the words \u201csuspend\u201d and \u201cotherwise modify\u201d are used as parallel terms describing the alternative actions the trial court may take with regard to \u201cthe unserved portion of such a sentence.\u201d Grammatically, they both are intended to refer and, hence, apply to the same \u201cunserved portion.\u201d Clearly, a trial court can either \u201csuspend\u201d or \u201cotherwise modify\u201d the unserved portion of an imposed period of incarceration. It is not logically possible, however, to \u201csuspend\u201d a portion of a sentence that has already been suspended. Thus, having been used as parallel terms, the words \u201csuspend or otherwise modify\u201d cannot reasonably be interpreted as applying to the period of suspension of sentence. <em>See Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>142 Va. 620, 624, 128 S.E. 578, 579 (1925) (stating that \u201cproper grammatical effect will [generally] be given to the arrangement of words in a sentence of a statute\u201d); <em>Frere v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 460, 464, 452 S.E.2d 682, 685 (1995) (noting that a presumption exists that \u201cthe legislature understood the basic rules of grammar\u201d when drafting a statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Robertson v. Superintendent of Wise Correctional Unit, </em>248 Va. 232, 445 S.E.2d 116 (1994), relied upon by both parties, does not require a different result. <em>Robertson </em>involved two simultaneously imposed penitentiary sentences, one that was suspended on condition of good behavior for a period of six years and a second that was suspended on condition that Robertson serve twelve months in the local jail and be of good behavior for two years. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>233-34, 445 S.E.2d at 116-17. The original order was silent regarding whether the sentences were to run consecutively or concurrently, making the sentences consecutive by operation of law. <em>Id. </em>at 234, 235, 445 S.E.2d at 117, 118. While Robertson remained in the local jail pursuant to the original sentencing order but more than twenty-one days following its entry, the trial court entered a second order in which it provided that the sentences were to run concurrently. <em>Id. </em>at 234, 445 S.E.2d at 117. Robertson was released from jail after serving his sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">When Robertson was convicted for a third offense while still on probation for the first two offenses, the trial court revoked the sentences previously suspended and entered an order purporting to make the sentences for the first two offenses consecutive rather than concurrent. <em>Id. </em>Robertson challenged the court\u2019s authority to enter the third order.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The Supreme Court, citing Code \u00a7 19.2-303, noted that, \u201c[a]t the time the second order was entered, Robertson had not been transferred to the Department [of Corrections] and the trial judge had authority to \u2018suspend or otherwise modify the unserved portion\u2019 of the sentences imposed by the first order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235, 445 S.E.2d at 117 (quoting Code \u00a7 19.2-303). It noted further that, \u201c[w]hile the trial court still retained power under Code \u00a7 19.2-306 to revoke the suspension of those sentences and the power under Code \u00a7 19.2-303 to modify the sentences in consideration of \u2018circumstances in mitigation of the offense,\u2019 the court had no authority to lengthen the period of incarceration [by ordering that the sentences would run consecutively rather than concurrently].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236, 445 S.E.2d at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Thus, in <em>Robertson, </em>the Supreme Court' held the trial court retained jurisdiction, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-303, to make concurrent Robertson\u2019s simultaneously imposed consecutive sentences where one of those sentences involved active jail time under which Robertson remained incarcerated at the time of entry of the order. It also held the court lacked authority to lengthen the period of incarceration. It did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>hold the trial court retained jurisdiction to shorten or eliminate the remaining suspended portion of the sentence after Robertson had finished serving the active period of incarceration. Consequently, <em>Robertson </em>is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the term \u201csuch a sentence,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 19.2-303, was intended by the legislature to refer strictly to the period of incarceration in the penitentiary imposed on a convicted felon without regard to the period of suspension of that incarceration. Accordingly, we hold that, while Code \u00a7 19.2-303 permits the trial court to retain jurisdiction beyond the twenty-one-day limit of Rule 1:1 to shorten the previously imposed period of incarceration while the defendant remains incarcerated \u201cbut has not actually been transferred to a receiving unit of the Department [of Corrections],\u201d it does not authorize the court to retain jurisdiction to modify the previously imposed period of suspension of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Under this construction, the trial court correctly ruled it did not have jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 19.2-303 to terminate the period of suspension of Patterson\u2019s sentence more than twenty-one days after entry of the court\u2019s July 16, 1990 final sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">B. Void or Unlawful Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Patterson also argues on appeal, as he did before the trial court, that the trial court had jurisdiction to terminate the period of suspension of his sentence because the twenty-year suspension of his sentence was so unreasonable, in relation to the gravity of the offense of which he was convicted, as to render the sentence void or unlawful. The trial court, in concluding it lacked jurisdiction to make the requested change, rejected Patterson\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-303.1 provides that the trial court, in suspending \u201cthe imposition or execution of a sentence, ... may fix the period of suspension for a reasonable time, having due regard to the gravity of the offense, without regard to the maximum period for which the defendant might have been sentenced.\u201d The statute grants the trial court broad discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>tion in fixing the period of suspension of sentence for the remedial purpose of rehabilitating criminals. <em>See Wright, </em>32 Va.App. at 151, 526 S.E.2d at 786. Indeed, the only statutory limitation placed on the trial court\u2019s discretion in fixing the period of suspension of sentence is that the duration of the suspension period must be \u201creasonable ..., having due regard to the gravity of the offense.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-303.1. Thus, while \u201cthe court\u2019s authority to suspend execution is not absolute,\u201d the sentencing court \u201cmust consider that the facts surrounding a particular offense may well authorize, even require, a longer suspension than would be reasonable under less egregious circumstances.\u201d <em>Simmers v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 375, 378, 398 S.E.2d 693, 694 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In this case, Patterson pled guilty to charges of possession of cocaine and possession of psilocyn. At the time of the offenses, Patterson was nineteen years old and had no prior criminal history. However, information presented at the sentencing hearing showed Patterson had compiled an extensive history of illegal drug usage prior to his conviction and sentencing for possession of psilocyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Patterson began using alcohol at the age of sixteen and frequently used marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms for several years prior to his conviction. He also used LSD on numerous occasions and experimented with cocaine, nitrous oxide, and valium. Several months before his arrest and conviction, Patterson was hospitalized for repeated hallucinatory flashbacks, including visions of the crucifixion of Christ and voices telling him to kill himself. Patterson rejected the recommended substance abuse treatment offered by the hospital, saying he knew more about the subject than those involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">At sentencing, the prosecutor, after reviewing the instant offense and Patterson\u2019s past drug usage, advised the trial court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">[Patterson\u2019s attorney] and I have talked at great length, Your Honor. I don\u2019t understand candidly what the answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>is for Mr. Patterson. I think the answer will have to come from Mr. Patterson____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">The Commonwealth would recommend this morning he be released on time served, be given a ten year suspended penitentiary sentence, on supervised probation. Such sentence should run for a period of twenty years.... Mr. Patterson is old enough, though a young man, to accept the consequences of his conduct. He has not done that in the past. He is going to have to do it ... henceforth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">Patterson\u2019s attorney responded as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">Your Honor, if I may briefly, of course, <em>we would concur in the Commonwealth\u2019s recommendation. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">Your Honor, I concur with [the prosecutor\u2019s] observations. Quite candidly, on behalf of my client, I would suggest that it was not until his arrest and prosecution on <em>these most serious charges </em>that will indeed follow him for the rest of his days that he, so to speak, got the point____ [H]e is of the personal opinion that it\u2019s up to the individual to make a decision internally, if you will, whether or not to get control of the situation and maintain control____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">In light of these statements and Patterson\u2019s extensive drug usage prior to his conviction, it is clear that the twenty-year period of suspension of Patterson\u2019s sentence was intended to benefit both the Commonwealth and Patterson. The Commonwealth received the benefit of a compelling deterrence that would serve to motivate Patterson to reform his conduct and be of good behavior for a considerable period of time. Patterson gained his freedom and the opportunity to \u201cget control of the situation and maintain control\u201d for a considerable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">We cannot say, therefore, upon consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the offense, that the trial court abused its discretionary authority in fixing, for the remedial purpose of rehabilitating Patterson, the period of suspension of Patterson\u2019s sentence at twenty years. We conclude, therefore that the twenty-year suspension of Patterson\u2019s sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>was reasonable under Code \u00a7 19.2-303.1 and that the trial court did not err in finding it so.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Furthermore, because the trial court at sentencing \u201chad jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties[,] ... the court\u2019s judgment was not void.\u201d <em>Simmers, </em>11 Va.App. at 379, 398 S.E.2d at 695. \u201cSince the judgment of the trial court was not void, [Patterson] may not sustain a collateral attack at this time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court properly ruled it lacked jurisdiction under Rule 1:1 to modify Patterson\u2019s sentence, as requested, more than twenty-one days after entry of the sentencing order. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
