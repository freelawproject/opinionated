For the reasons that follow, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the employer, who prevailed below. <em>See Westmoreland Coal v. Russell, </em>31 Va.App. 16, 20, 520 S.E.2d 839, 841 (1999). The commission\u2019s factual findings are conclusive and binding on this Court when those findings are based on credible evidence. <em>See James v. Capitol Steel Constr. Co., </em>8 Va.App. 512, 515, 382 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1989); Code \u00a7 65.2-706.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The evidence established that employer\u2019s team offices and home ice rink were located in Huntington, West Virginia. Employer maintained no office in Virginia, and no employees lived in Virginia. In October, 1999, claimant signed his employment contract at the team\u2019s offices in West Virginia. Pursuant to the terms .of the contract, employer paid claimant\u2019s salary, rent for his apartment in West Virginia and utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The 1999-2000 regular hockey season began in October and ended in early April with three playoff games scheduled later in April. There were seventy-one regular season games played over the course of one hundred eighty-three days. Of those seventy-one regular season games, fourteen games were against Virginia teams and nine of those fourteen games were played at locations in Virginia. The other games were played in Ohio, New Jersey, West Virginia, Illinois, Florida, Arkansas, and North Carolina. All three playoff games were played in Virginia. Employer brought approximately 23 employees to Virginia for each game played. The team typically arrived at least one day before the game and left immediately after the regular season games. During the playoffs, the team left the day after the game.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">On April 12, 2000, claimant injured his left leg during a playoff game against the Hampton Roads Admirals in Virginia. He tore his medial collateral ligament and had surgery in May 2000. He completed the appropriate rehabilitation and played for another hockey team during the 2000-2001 season. Claimant\u2019s former coach, Roy Edwards, testified that the Huntington Blizzard\u2019s team is dormant and that the franchise has no daily operations. He also testified,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">[w]e paid everything for [claimant]. We paid for his surgery, we paid for his rehab, we paid for his flight to come back and be checked up [sic], we paid his \u2014 we paid a portion of his salary, ... up until he was cleared to play again. Financially, we looked after everything for him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Employer never appeared at the hearing or submitted on brief at any stage of the proceedings. No evidence showed employer maintained workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>monwealth, thus the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund was a party to the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The deputy commissioner found Virginia had no jurisdiction to consider the claim because \u201c[a]lthough the team made scheduled trips to Virginia to play teams located in this state, it is not found that these trips constitute the regular service contemplated by \u00a7 65.2-101.\u201d Thus, the deputy commissioner denied claimant\u2019s request for temporary total disability benefits for the period of April 12 to August 23, 2000 and unspecified permanent partial disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision and found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">The claimant was not, and apparently never was, a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia. His contract was executed in West Virginia. The employer was a company based exclusively in West Virginia that maintained no employees or facilities of any kind within the bounds of the Commonwealth. The only contacts between the employer, the claimant and the Commonwealth of Virginia, were a few isolated bus trips by the employer\u2019s team from West Virginia to three locations in Virginia during the 1999-2000 hockey season. For the remainder of the year, the employer and its team operated exclusively outside the Commonwealth of Virginia, playing most of its games in West Virginia, and the seven or eight other states where games were scheduled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">We find that these limited contacts by the employer and its employees do not rise to the level of being \u201cregularly in service ... within this Commonwealth,\u201d as contemplated by the Act. Therefore, jurisdiction is lacking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\u2756 * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">While it is true that the accident occurred in Virginia, we fail to see ... why Virginia employer\u2019s [sic] and insurers should be responsible \u2014 through the UEF \u2014 for the West Virginia employer\u2019s unfortunate failure to insure its liability to a resident of that state. The claimant and employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>activities in this state are simply too tenuous to rise to the level of regularity contemplated by the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">Claimant appealed that decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Claimant contends that the commission erred in finding his injury was not covered by the Act. The precise issue to be determined in the instant case is whether the term \u201cregularly in service ... within this Commonwealth\u201d applies only to the number of employees required for coverage under the Act or whether it also applies to the amount of contact necessary to trigger coverage. We agree with the commission that \u201cregularly in service ... within this Commonwealth\u201d applies both to the number of employees required and the character of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Code \u00a7 65.2-101 provides in pertinent part, that \u201c <em>\u2018[ejmployee </em>\u2019 means ... [e]very person, including aliens and minors, in the service of another under any contract of hire or apprenticeship, written or implied, whether lawfully or unlawfully employed.\u201d It further provides, however, that <em>\u201c[ejmployee </em>\u2018 shall not mean ... [ejmployees of any person, firm or private corporation ... that has regularly in service less than three employees in the same business within this Commonwealth ....\u2019\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101. Under this statute \u201conce an employee proves that his or her injury occurred while employed in Virginia, an employer has the burden of producing sufficient evidence upon which the commission can find that the employer employed less than three employees regularly in service in Virginia.\u201d <em>Craddock Moving &amp; Storage Co. v. Settles, </em>16 Va.App. 1, 2, 427 S.E.2d 428, 429 (1993), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>247 Va. 165, 440 S.E.2d 613 (1994). \u2018Whether a person is an \u2018employee\u2019 and whether an employer has three or more employees \u2018regularly in service\u2019 are pivotal determinations in deciding if an employer is subject to the Act.\u201d <em>Cotman v. Green, 4 </em>Va.App. 256, 258, 356 S.E.2d 447, 448 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u201cThe commission\u2019s construction of the Act is entitled to great weight on appeal.\u201d <em>Cross v. Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., </em>21 Va.App. 530, 533, 465 S.E.2d 598, 599 (1996) (citing <em>City of Waynesboro v. Harter, </em>1 Va.App. 265, 269, 337 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1985)). \u201cWhile we generally give great weight and deference, on appeal, to the commission\u2019s construction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u201cwe are not bound by the commission\u2019s legal analysis in this or prior cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peacock v. Browning Ferris, Inc., </em>38 Va.App. 241, 248, 563 S.E.2d 368, 372 (2002) (quoting <em>USAir, Inc. v. Joyce, </em>27 Va.App. 184, 189 n. 1, 497 S.E.2d 904, 906 n. 1 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In the instant case and several others, the commission has interpreted the term \u201cregularly in service ... within the Commonwealth\u201d to apply not only to the number of employees engaged in performing the employer\u2019s established mode of work, but also, to require that the character of the business\u2019 \u201ccontacts and activities\u201d within the Commonwealth be more than \u201cirregular or merely occasional\u201d to allow jurisdiction over the claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Johnson v. M.S. Carriers, </em>VWC File No. 170-96-38 (March 24, 1998), <em>aff'd, Johnson v. M.S. Carriers, </em>Record No. 0907-98-3, 1999 WL 8275 (Va.Ct.App. January 12, 1999); <em>Whitley v. Cardinal Freight Carriers, Inc., </em>VWC File No. 166-03-27 (November 9, 1994). For example, in <em>Johnson, </em>claimant was an over-the-road truck driver who was dispatched from employer\u2019s headquarters in Tennessee. Employer maintained two drop yards in Virginia, and claimant used the yards approximately two times per month. On these facts the commission found that \u201cregularly in service implies more than occasional pick-ups and drop-offs or merely driving through Virginia.\u201d We agree with the commission\u2019s analysis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>The statutory language does not limit \u201cregularly in service\u201d only to the number of workers involved but it also uses that term to modify the phrase \u201cwithin this Commonwealth.\u201d Thus, the plain statutory requirement of at least three employees working with some degree of regularity within the Commonwealth is the triggering mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Claimant\u2019s reliance on our holding in <em>Cotman </em>to define \u201cregularly in service\u201d is misplaced. In <em>Cotman, </em>we stated, \u201c[I]n determining whether an employer has three or more employees regularly in service, the focus shifts to the character of the business and away from the character of the employment relationship.\u201d <em>Cotman, </em>4 Va.App. at 259, 356 S.E.2d at 448. In <em>Cotman, </em>the business as well as the employees, whether they were full time, part time or temporary, were located within the Commonwealth. The employer argued the temporary and part-time employees were not \u201cregularly in service\u201d because of the nature of part-time and temporary work and, therefore, were not covered by the Act. The facts in <em>Cotman </em>did not require us to address the regularity of the employer\u2019s contacts within the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Additionally, we note that <em>Craddock </em>implicitly discussed the issue of the necessity for certain \u201cminimum contacts\u201d to establish jurisdiction under the Act. In <em>Craddock, </em>we held that credible evidence supported the commission\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction because the evidence established the sufficient number of employees and the requisite minimum contacts. 16 Va.App. at 4, 427 S.E.2d at 431. Unlike the instant case, the employees were hired in Virginia and the totality of their work for employer was completed in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">In the instant case, it is uncontested that employer had more than three full-time employees. However, the character of employer\u2019s business within the Commonwealth was limited to twelve to fifteen days during the season and was not regular or ongoing. Thus, the character of this business was such that its contacts with Virginia were occasional and irregular. Therefore, credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that the contacts were insufficient to meet the \u201cregu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>larly in service ... within this Commonwealth\u201d requirement of Code \u00a7 65.2-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\">. We note that most of the cases analyzing Code \u00a7 65.2-101 have discussed the term \"regularly in service\u201d in relation to the number of employees necessary for coverage because that was the factual basis for disputing coverage. <em>See Smith v. Hylton, </em>14 Va.App. 354, 416 S.E.2d 712 (1992); <em>Cotman, </em>4 Va.App. 256, 356 S.E.2d 447; <em>Pineda v. Brothers, </em>VWC File No. 186-95-81 (January 11, 1999); <em>Bills v.
