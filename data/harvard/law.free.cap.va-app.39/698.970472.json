For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">Virginia State Police Trooper Mike Bradley was dispatched to the scene of a car accident at approximately 2:10 a.m. on June 3, 2001. When he arrived, emergency personnel were already present and treating two individuals on the ground. Bradley observed Wright standing nearby, in the company of two deputies. Trooper Bradley approached Wright and asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>him what he knew about the accident. Wright stated, \u201cI\u2019m f \u2014 ing drunk, okay? I was chiving. Run off the f \u2014 ing road. I\u2019m f \u2014 ing drunk.\u201d Bradley asked Wright how much he had had to drink, and Wright responded \u201cI don\u2019t f \u2014 ing know. A lot.\u201d He then asked Wright how fast he had been driving. Wright stated, \u201cDon\u2019t know. Too f \u2014 ing fast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">As emergency personnel attempted to treat Wright\u2019s injuries, Trooper Bradley observed that Wright cursed and spat at them. Wright\u2019s demeanor fluctuated from \u201cone extreme to the other,\u201d as he was calm one moment and then \u201cyelling, cursing and screaming,\u201d the next. Wright was eventually restrained by medical personnel and transported to the hospital. Trooper Bradley then obtained a search warrant for a sample of Wright\u2019s blood. The analysis showed that Wright had a blood alcohol content of 0.09%. Wright was arrested on charges of driving while intoxicated, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 and maiming, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">At trial, Trooper Bradley testified that, when he arrived at the scene, he observed emergency personnel performing CPR on Matthew Switzer, a passenger in Wright\u2019s car. He further stated that, according to Wright, the accident occurred when he was travelling south on Route 640 and approached a sharp right curve in the road. Instead of making the turn, Wright continued straight and drove off the left side of the road, over an embankment, crashing into a tree. The \u201ctotal distance off the left side of the road to the impact was one hundred forty-seven feet.\u201d The skid marks measured sixty-four feet. Trooper Bradley testified that there was no posted speed limit on that road, so the speed limit was \u201cfifty-five\u201d miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Switzer testified that he was a passenger in Wright\u2019s car when the accident occurred. Switzer stated that Wright picked him up that evening at about 5:00 or 6:00 p.m. and that they went riding around with another passenger named \u201cShaney.\u201d Switzer stated that at some point, they stopped and obtained over a dozen Xanax pills. He stated that everyone in the car took the pills. He personally took three-and-a-half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>pills. They later obtained some beer and drank while they continued to drive around. Switzer did not recall the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The doctor who treated Switzer testified that Switzer presented to the emergency room with \u201ca lot of superficial lacerations,\u201d and a severely fractured jaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">At the close of the evidence, Wright moved to strike, contending that the Commonwealth had failed to establish that he drove in a manner so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life. The trial court denied the motion finding that although the evidence may not have proven that Wright was driving \u201cin excess of the speed limit,\u201d \u201chis speed was clearly too fast for the conditions and clearly too fast for him to be able to maintain proper control.\u201d The court then found Wright guilty of the charge and sentenced him to five years in prison, with four years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">On appeal, Wright contends the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient, as a matter of law, to support his conviction. Specifically, Wright contends Code \u00a7 18.2-51.4 mandates \u201cthree elements of proof: 1) The person must drive while intoxicated; 2) The manner of driving while intoxicated must be so \u2018gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life\u2019; and 3) The driving while intoxicated in the requisite manner must cause serious injury resulting in permanent physical impairment.\u201d Thus, Wright argues the element of driving while intoxicated is separate and distinct from the element of driving in a \u201cgross, wanton and culpable\u201d manner and that driving while intoxicated cannot serve as evidence to support the requisite manner of driving. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">We first note that the standard for appellate review of criminal convictions is well established. \u201cWhen a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, we are required to review the evidence \u2018in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collins v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 177, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>179, 409 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1991) (quoting <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975)). \u201cThe conviction will not be reversed unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-51.4 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">[a]ny person who, as a result of driving while intoxicated ... in a manner so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life, unintentionally causes the serious bodily injury of another person resulting in permanent and significant physical impairment shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">While no Virginia appellate court has issued a decision interpreting this particular statute, the common law definition of criminal negligence, as stated in the statute, is well settled. Indeed, in <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>170 Va. 597, 611, 195 S.E. 675, 681 (1938), the Supreme Court of Virginia</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">defined criminal negligence in terms of \u201cgross negligence,\u201d stating that conduct \u201cis culpable or criminal when accompanied by acts of commission or omission of a wanton or wil[l]ful nature, showing a reckless or indifferent disregard of the rights of others, under circumstances reasonably calculated to produce injury, or which make it not improbable that injury will be occasioned, and the offender knows, or is charged with the knowledge of, the probable result of his acts.\u201d 170 Va. at 611-12, 195 S.E. at 681.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-9\"><em>Ellis v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 548, 557, 513 S.E.2d 453, 457-58 (1999). Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">[w]hile willful misconduct requires an intentional or purposeful act or failure to act, gross or criminal negligence involves [an act or] a failure to act under circumstances that indicate a passive and indifferent attitude toward the welfare of others. Moreover, the defendant must be proved indifferent in the face of knowledge that injury or illegality will be the probable result or, in the alternative, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>circumstances exist under which the defendant may be chargeable with such knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has further held that in determining the degree of a defendant\u2019s negligence, intoxication is relevant as an aggravating factor, increasing with the level of intoxication. <em>Essex v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 273, 283, 322 S.E.2d 216, 221-22 (1984); <em>see also Huffman v. Love, </em>245 Va. 311, 315, 427 S.E.2d 357, 360 (1993). Nevertheless, although the Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">has been consistent in stating that \u201c \u2018[o]ne who knowingly drives [an] automobile on the highway under the influence of intoxicants, in violation of statute, is, of course, negligente,]\u2019 \u201d <em>[Essex, </em>228 Va. at 282, 322 S.E.2d at 221] (quoting <em>Baker v. Marcus, </em>201 Va. 905, 910, 114 S.E.2d 617, 621 (1960))[,] [t]he Supreme Court [of Virginia] also has observed that \u201cno case ... holds that one driving under the influence of an intoxicant must necessarily be driving recklessly.\u201d <em>Spickard v. City of Lynchburg, </em>174 Va. 502, 505, 6 S.E.2d 610, 611 (1940). Thus, while evidence of intoxication is a factor that might bear upon proof of dangerous or reckless driving in a given case, it does not, of itself, prove reckless driving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-8\"><em>Bishop v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 206, 210, 455 S.E.2d 765, 766-67 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Here, Wright conceded to Trooper Bradley that he was driving \u201ctoo fast.\u201d Wright\u2019s conduct of driving his car in a manner that was too fast for him to control it properly, was necessarily rendered more culpable because Wright was driving while his intellectual and motor functions were substantially impaired by his voluntary consumption of alcohol and drugs. Indeed, immediately after the accident, Wright admitted he was drunk and despite only slight injury, was behaving in a considerably irrational manner. Accordingly, there was ample evidence on this record to justify the trial court\u2019s determination that Wright was guilty of such a callous indifference or disregard for \u201cthe rules of law and safety, and of the rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>others, as was incompatible with a proper regard for human life, and amounted to gross, wanton and culpable misconduct.\u201d <em>Bell, </em>170 Va. at 613, 195 S.E. at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Furthermore, we reject Wright\u2019s argument that <em>Jenkins v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 104, 255 S.E.2d 504 (1979), and <em>Tubman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 267, 348 S.E.2d 871 (1986), compel a different result. The facts presented in those cases are distinguishable from those presented here. In <em>Jenkins, </em>the Court held that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate recklessness when it demonstrated merely that Jenkins struck a pedestrian while driving \u201cdown the center of a narrow, unlighted, unmarked, rural, secondary road in the early morning hours at a time when he was unlikely to encounter other traffic or pedestrians.\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>220 Va. at 107, 255 S.E.2d at 506. Indeed, the Court noted that the evidence proved \u201cJenkins was driving at a speed well within the posted speed limit,\u201d and had not been drinking, or reckless in the operation of his truck. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Tubman, </em>there was also no evidence that the defendant had been drinking, and we found that the evidence merely proved simple negligence where Tubman failed to come to a \u201ccomplete stop before entering Route 3,\u201d causing him to fail to see a motorcycle, \u201cwhich was admittedly partially obstructed by [a] hedge.\u201d <em>Tubman, </em>3 Va.App. at 275, 348 S.E.2d at 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Accordingly, because we find that the trial court\u2019s determination that Wright\u2019s conduct amounted to criminal negligence, as provided for in Code \u00a7 18.2-51.4, was not \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it,\u201d we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-13\">. Wright was also convicted, after his plea of no contest, of driving while intoxicated. However, Wright raises no issue as to this conviction on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
