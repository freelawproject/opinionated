On appeal, he contends the statute proscribes only the theft of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>\u201cwares offered for sale\u201d and does not include items not offered for sale, such as items used by a merchant to advertise or display those wares. We hold the statute is broad enough to include items belonging to a merchant that are not offered for sale. Thus, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">On May 25, 2001, employees of a Henrico County video store called the police after observing appellant acting suspiciously while inside the store. An officer responded to the scene and asked appellant whether he \u201chad any property of the store.\u201d Appellant admitted he had some \u201ccover boxes\u201d but said he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel they were of any value.\u201d Appellant removed the cover boxes from his jacket and gave them to the officer, who returned them to store personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The evidence established a cover box is a movie or video box used to advertise videos that the video store offers for rent. A cover box comprises either a video box inside a clear plastic case or a shrink-wrapped video box \"with a piece of styrofoam inside instead of a video tape. The box itself bears the name of the movie and related pictures. It summarizes the movie\u2019s plot and lists the cast and any awards the movie may have won. The cover box is placed \u201con the shelf in front of the actual videos [the store is] trying to rent.\u201d A video box, while in use as a cover box, is an advertising aid only. It bears no price tag or bar code, has no price in the store\u2019s computer, and is not offered for sale or rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Although a cover box is used only for advertising and is not available for rent with the videotape it advertises, the video store always receives as many cover boxes for a movie as it does videotapes of that movie. On some occasions, the store receives the video box in cover box form with styrofoam and shrink wrap. On other occasions, the store receives the videotape inside the video box and has to remove the videotape and use its own supplies to convert the video box into a cover box.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>When a movie has \u201cbeen on the wall for a while and it no longer rents as well,\u201d the store may decide to sell it as a previously viewed product. Under these circumstances, an employee \u201cput[s] the rental product video[ ] ... back in [its] cover box[ ] and ... sell[s]\u201d the box and video together. On other occasions, the video store is required to reunite the video with the box and return both to \u201cthe actual studio that sen[t] ... the movies.\u201d Under some circumstances, the video store might give away a video box \u201cafter it ha[s] served its useful purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The investigating officer issued appellant a summons charging him with concealment of merchandise with a value of $5.00. The officer testified that the boxes bore no price tags and that the figure on the warrant was \u201c[a] replacement cost ... suggested to him\u201d when he \u201cinvestigatefd] through another party not in the store.\u201d Appellant elicited this testimony from the investigating officer on cross-examination and did not object to the officer\u2019s testimony about replacement cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Appellant argued at trial that the cover boxes he concealed did not qualify as goods or merchandise at the time of concealment because they were not offered for sale. He conceded that they had some value when used as cover boxes and that some cover boxes eventually become \u201cgoods or merchandise\u201d when reunited with a videotape and offered for sale, but he argued that the cover boxes at issue were not goods or merchandise when he concealed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The trial court gave counsel an opportunity to submit legal memoranda on the issue. After receiving those memoranda, the trial court ruled the legislature intended \u201cgoods\u201d as used in the concealment statute to encompass \u201ctangible or moveable personal property\u201d other than merchandise. Thus, it found appellant\u2019s behavior constituted concealment under Code \u00a7 18.2-108, and it convicted him of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Appellant was convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-103, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\n<em>\u00a7 18.2-103. Concealing or taking possession of merchandise; altering price tags; transferring goods from one container to another, counseling, etc., another in performance of such acts.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">Whoever, without authority, with the intention of converting <em>goods or merchandise </em>to his own or another\u2019s use without having paid the full purchase price thereof, or of defrauding the owner of the value of the <em>goods or merchandise, </em>(i) willfully conceals or takes possession of the <em>goods or merchandise </em>of any store or other mercantile establishment, or (ii) alters the price tag or other price marking on such <em>goods or merchandise, </em>or transfers the <em>goods </em>from one container to another, or (iii) counsels, assists, aids or abets another in the performance of any of the above acts, when the value of the <em>goods or merchandise </em>involved in the offense is less than $200, shall be guilty of petit larceny and, when the value of the <em>goods or merchandise </em>involved in the offense is $200 or more, shall be guilty of grand larceny. The willful concealment of <em>goods or merchandise </em>of any store or other mercantile establishment, while still on the premises thereof, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to convert and defraud the owner thereof out of the value of the <em>goods or merchandise.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">(Emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Appellant contends that the language in the statute shows the legislature\u2019s intent to equate \u201cgoods\u201d with \u201cmerchandise,\u201d proscribing concealment only of wares offered for sale by a merchant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Under accepted principles of statutory construction, \u201cwords and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994). In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">Proper construction seeks to harmonize the provisions of a statute both internally and in relation to other statutes.... [Legislative purpose can best be \u201c \u2018ascertained from the act itself when read in light of other statutes relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>same subject matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 190, 197, 480 S.E.2d 792, 796 (1997) (citation omitted). The doctrine of <em>pari materia </em>teaches that \u201c \u2018statutes are not to be considered as isolated fragments of law, but as a whole, or as parts of a great, connected homogenous system, or a simple and complete statutory arrangement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 480 S.E.2d at 796 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\"><em>DMV v. Wallace, </em>29 Va.App. 228, 233-34, 511 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1999) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In order to ascertain the intent of the legislature, we turn first to the dictionary definitions of \u201cgoods\u201d and \u201cmerchandise.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines \u201c[g]oods\u201d as \u201c[tjangible or movable personal property other than money; esp., articles of trade or items of merchandise.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>701 (7th ed.1999). \u201cMerchandise\u201d is defined as \u201c[g]oods that are bought and sold in business; commercial wares.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1000. Thus, although \u201cgoods\u201d may be synonymous with \u201cmerchandise,\u201d the dictionary recognizes a definition of \u201cgoods\u201d which is broader than the definition of \u201cmerchandise.\u201d Under the broader of these definitions, the term \u201cgoods\u201d includes not only merchandise offered for sale but also any other items of tangible personal property belonging to the merchant, including advertising materials, display racks, mirrors and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\u201cAlthough any ambiguity or reasonable doubt as to the proper construction of a penal statute must be resolved in favor of the accused, a defendant is not entitled to benefit from an \u2018 unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute.\u2019\u201d <em>O\u2019Banion v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 47, 57, 531 S.E.2d 599, 604 (2000) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>Holloman v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 196, 198, 269 S.E.2d 356, 357 (1980) (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979))).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">It would be absurd to conclude that the legislature would say the same thing twice in one statutory provision____The rules of statutory interpretation argue against reading any legislative enactment in a manner that will make a portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>of it useless, repetitious, or absurd. On the contrary, it is well established that every act of the legislature should be read so as to give reasonable effect to every word and to promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"><em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 673, 683, 472 S.E.2d 663, 667-68 (1996), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>24 Va.App. 253, 481 S.E.2d 495 (1997). These principles support the conclusion that the legislature intended to use the broader definition of goods so as to encompass more than just merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In addition, in Code \u00a7 18.2-103, the legislature employed the disputed terms in the disjunctive, as \u201cgoods <em>or </em>merchandise,\u201d which reinforces the conclusion that the legislature intended the terms would not be synonymous. Code \u00a7 18.2-103 (emphasis added). Further, the legislature could reasonably have feared that, if it had used only the term \u201cgoods,\u201d the statute would be misconstrued to apply only to the narrower definition of \u201cgoods,\u201d i.e., \u201carticles of trade or items of merchandise.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s, supra, </em>at 701. Finally, although appellant points out that the statute proscribes concealment \u201cwith the intention of converting goods or merchandise ... without having paid the full <em>purchase price </em>thereof,\u201d it also proscribes concealment \u201cwith the intention ... of defrauding the owner of the <em>value </em>of the goods or merchandise,\u201d which makes clear that the item concealed need not have a purchase price as long as it has some value. Code \u00a7 18.2-103 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The legislature\u2019s use of only the word \u201cgoods\u201d in proscribing \u201ctransfers [of] goods from one container to another\u201d does not require a different result.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute also covers the trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>fer of \u201cmerchandise\u201d from one container to another because, under the above definitions, items which are merchandise also are goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Appellant argues the concealment statute was intended to combat shoplifting and cites the definition of \u201cshoplift\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 8.01-44.4(F), which governs civil actions brought by merchants to recover losses from shoplifting and employee theft.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant argues this definition supports his position that \u201cgoods\u201d and \u201cmerchandise\u201d are synonymous under the concealment statute. We reach the opposite conclusion. Code \u00a7 8.01-44.4(F) refers only to the theft of \u201cmer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>chandise\u201d; it does not mention the theft of \u201cgoods.\u201d Thus, the doctrine of <em>pari materia </em>supports the conclusion that the legislature meant to prescribe more than the theft of merchandise under Code \u00a7 18.2-103. If it had intended to proscribe only the theft of merchandise, it would have used only the term \u201cmerchandise\u201d as it did in Code \u00a7 8.01-44.4(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention that such an interpretation turns Code \u00a7 18.2-103 into a general larceny statute misses the point. Code \u00a7 18.2-103 <em>is </em>a larceny statute and provides that the behavior prescribed therein constitutes grand larceny or petit larceny depending on the value of the item or items involved in the offense. The statute\u2019s express language indicates the legislature\u2019s intent merely to make larcenous intent easier to prove in cases involving the theft of articles from merchants, who necessarily allow the general public largely unrestricted access to both the merchandise they offer for sale and to other goods also on their premises.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This interpretation of Code \u00a7 18.2-103 effects the intent of the legislature and does no harm to the larger legislative scheme of which it is a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">For these reasons, we conclude the legislature, in enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-103, intended to proscribe the concealment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>both merchandise offered for sale and other types of goods not offered for sale. Thus, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\">. Despite appellant's claims to the contrary, how the terms \"goods\" and \"merchandise\u201d are used in the title of the statute or various judicial opinions is of little importance to our resolution of this issue for two reasons. First, with limited exceptions not applicable here, the body of a statute rather than its title determines its application. <em>See Cavalier Vending Corp. v. State Bd. of Pharmacy, </em>195 Va. 626, 629-30, 79 S.E.2d 636, 638-39 (1954) (holding Virginia\u2019s constitutional provision that \u201c '[n]o law shall embrace more than one object which shall be expressed in its title\u2019 \u201d is intended to \"prevent the members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>legislature and the people from being misled\u201d as to the character of the legislation but does not \"require that the caption of an act state its full purpose as completely as the act itself\u201d); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 1-13.9 (\"The headlines of the several sections of this Code printed in black-face type are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the sections and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part thereof, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the headlines, are amended or reenacted.\u201d) (made applicable to \"the construction of this Code and of all statutes\u201d by Code \u00a7 1-13); <em>Thurston Metals &amp; Supply Co. v. Taylor, </em>230 Va. 475, 484, 339 S.E.2d 538, 543-44 (1986) (recognizing that headline of statute in black-face type is \u201ccodifier\u2019s headline\u201d as opposed to \"legislative title\"). Second, as appellant concedes, none of the judicial decisions he cites directly addressed the meaning of the phrase, \"goods or merchandise,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">. Code \u00a7 8.01-44.4 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">F. For purposes of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">s\u00a1s s\u00a1s sj;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">\"Shoplift\u201d means any one or more of the following acts committed by a person without the consent of the merchant and with the purpose or intent of appropriating merchandise to that person\u2019s own use without payment, obtaining merchandise at less than its stated sales price, or otherwise depriving a merchant of all or any part of the value or use of merchandise: (i) removing any merchandise from the premises of the merchant\u2019s establishment; (ii) concealing any merchandise; (iii) substituting, altering, removing, or disfiguring any label or price tag; (iv) transferring any merchandise from a container in which that merchandise is displayed or packaged to any other container; (v) disarming any alarm tag attached to any merchandise; or (vi) obtaining or attempting to obtain possession of any merchandise by charging that merchandise to another person without the authority of that person or by charging that merchandise to a fictitious person.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b651-7\">. We decline appellant\u2019s invitation to consider newspaper and journal articles written contemporaneously with the passage of the concealment statute as an appropriate source of \"legislative history.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Mitchell v. Rayl, </em>8 Kan.App.2d 690, 665 P.2d 1117, 1119 (Kan.Ct.App. 1983) (rejecting newspaper article as conclusive proof of legislative intent); 2A Norman J. Singer, <em>Sutherland's Statutes &amp; Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 48.11, at 461 (6th ed., 2000 rev.). Furthermore, even if we were to consider the content of those articles, they do not compel the conclusion appellant advances. Those articles indicate that, under the law in effect at that time, a merchant had no legal recourse against a shopper who concealed an item belonging to the store in his clothing or other possessions until the shopper took the stolen item off the premises. The stated intent of the concealment statute was \"to protect a storekeeper against crooks.\u201d Thus, the intent of the concealment statute \u2014 to permit apprehension and prosecution of individuals who conceal the property of a store without leaving the premises \u2014 could be applied just as appropriately to items offered for sale to the public as to other items of tangible personal property which were not offered for sale at the time of their theft.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
