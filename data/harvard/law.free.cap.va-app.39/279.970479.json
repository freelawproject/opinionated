The employer contends that the commission erred in finding that Cornett sustained an injury by accident from her employment and provided credible evidence of her account of the accident. We affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">On appeal, \u201c[decisions of the commission as to questions of fact, if supported by credible evidence, are conclusive and binding on this Court.\u201d <em>Manassas Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Farrar, </em>13 Va.App. 227, 229, 409 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1991). However, \u201c[t]his Court is not bound by the legal determinations made by the commission.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Salvation Army, </em>20 Va.App. 570, 572, 459 S.E.2d 103, 104 (1995). \u201cThe fact that contrary evidence may be found in the record is of no consequence if credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Manassas Ice, </em>13 Va.App. at 229, 409 S.E.2d at 826. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>Creedle Sales Co. v. Edmonds, </em>24 Va.App. 24, 26, 480 S.E.2d 123, 124 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">A. <em>THE INJURIES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Doris Cornett was employed by the Grayson County School Board as a bus driver. She had been employed in this capacity since 1990. On the afternoon of July 26, 1999, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Cornett finished her bus route and parked the school bus in her yard, as was standard practice. She gathered her belongings and began to exit the bus. As she descended the second step, she slipped, fell, and landed outside the bus with her leg underneath her.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Upon impact, Cornett heard a pop and \u201cknew [her ankle] was broke[n].\u201d She was able to move her leg from underneath her, but was unable to get up. As a result, Cornett remained on the ground for approximately twenty minutes, until her husband arrived home and found her. When her husband arrived home, he assisted her into the car and drove her to Dr. Edward Dannelly\u2019s office. En route to the doctor\u2019s office, Cornett spotted her supervisor, flagged him down, and informed him of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">At Dr. Dannelly\u2019s office, Cornett was examined. The initial patient history was brief. It stated, \u201cThis is a 35 year old who stepped off a school bus after she got home. She drives a school bus at work. Turned her ankle. Had severe pain and a pop.\u201d Cornett also complained of knee pain. Dr. Dannelly diagnosed a \u201cGrade II \u2014 III lateral ligament injury, lateral ligament sprain left ankle.\u201d Cornett began physical therapy, but continually complained about having pain in her ankle and knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">On August 27, 1999, Cornett was diagnosed with a mid-calf popliteal tibialis clot in her left leg, for which she was hospitalized. She subsequently began treatment with Dr. Handy as well. On September 7, 1999, Dr. Handy examined Cornett. He noted that \u201c[s]he was stepping off a school bus and she twisted her left ankle and had a Grade IV sprain in her left ankle.\u201d He also noted the deep vein thrombophlebitis (\u201cDVT\u201d) from the clot that was diagnosed on August 27, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">On October 4, 1999, a bone scan of the left ankle revealed a fracture of the medial talus. At no time subsequent to her accident did Cornett\u2019s employer offer her a panel of physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>B. <em>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">On October 12,1999, Cornett filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission seeking temporary total disability benefits for injuries she sustained on July 26, 1999. On June 14, 2000, the employer deposed Cornett regarding the accident. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">Q [Employer\u2019s attorney]: What time of the day was [the accident]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">A [Cornett]: Right around four o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">Q: Where were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">A: I was in the bus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">Q: What were you doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">A: I was getting ready to get off. Is that what you mean? I was in my yard where I always back. I was in my parking area where I always park at home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">Q: Had you parked the bus?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-12\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-13\">Q: Tell me what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-14\">A: I parked the bus and went and gathered up my stuff, went to go out, you know, go down the steps and made it down the first one fine, went to step down the second one, I just fell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-15\">Q: There are only two steps?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-16\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-17\">Q: How many are there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-18\">A: Four, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-19\">Q: How long had you been driving this particular bus?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-20\">A: A little less than six weeks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-21\">Q: Was there anything different about this bus than the bus you were used to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-22\">A: Yes, the steps on it are different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Q: How are they different?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">A: They are angled and they were just different than the one I was used to. The height I think was different. They are not like normal steps on the bus. The school bus steps are different than like say our home steps or standardized steps. They are just different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">Q: Okay, are you saying this bus had steps that were different style?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">A: They were styled different than any regular bus that I normally drove</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">Hi \u2756 H&lt; H* H\u00ed H\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">Q: Was there anything wet on the steps?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">A: Not that I remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">Q: Do you remember whether you stepped on anything at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-11\">A: I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-12\">Q: To the best of your understanding how do you think that it happened that you fell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-13\">A: I don\u2019t know. I just fell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-14\">Q: I am not trying to make this difficult for you. I am just trying to get an understanding of what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-15\">A: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I was just going down the steps and I just fell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-16\">On July 18, 2000, a hearing was held before Deputy Commissioner John Costa. At the hearing, Cornett testified that the difference in the configuration of the steps in the bus she was driving on the date of her injury and her usual bus was the cause of her accident. A lengthy discussion then ensued between the deputy commissioner and Cornett regarding the disparity between her deposition testimony and her account at the hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-17\">Q [Deputy Commissioner Costa]: Okay. Well, so are you just guessing as to why you fell or do you really know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-18\">A [Cornett]: I really think it was the steps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Q: Well then when the lawyer asked you that question during the deposition why didn\u2019t you tell him about the steps being the cause of the fall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">A: Well, I thought I\u2019d already told him, you know, that the steps was [sic] different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">Q: Right. You did. You had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">A: And I thought that was all the same, you know. It ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN7\">Q: Well, when he asked you how do you think it happened that you fell, why couldn\u2019t you have said I fell because the steps were different?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">A: Well, I thought I\u2019d already told him once. I didn\u2019t know...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">Q: Okay. You did tell him the steps were different. But that\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">Q: That\u2019s something separate from saying the steps were the cause of your fall. Can you appreciate that distinction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajy\">A: Well, I \u2014 I do now. But at ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">Q: Okay. Okay. Well, explain to me then how \u201cThe steps were the cause of my fall.\u201d Equates with \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just fell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">\u00edk s\u00a1{ ^ ?!&lt; *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">A: I\u2019m trying to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-14\">Q: Okay. Okay. If \u2014 Are you telling me that at the time of the deposition you had already concluded that the configuration of the steps was the cause of your fall? You knew that in your own mind at the time of the deposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-15\">A: I think because they were different is why I fell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-16\">Q: And did you think that at the time of the deposition a month ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-17\">A: Yes. But I \u2014 you know \u2014 When I answered him the first time about the steps being different, I didn\u2019t know, you know \u2014 when he asked me the other question I thought, you know, I done [sic] answered the other one that the steps was [sic] different. And then like I said, I just fell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>By opinion dated July 19,2000, the deputy commissioner found Cornett\u2019s accident did not arise out of her employment and denied her claim. He found Cornett\u2019s testimony not credible based on the substance of her testimony, not her appearance and demeanor. The deputy commissioner stated her testimony was \u201ccontrary to everything else in the record ... most glaringly, the deposition testimony she gave only a month ago.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Cornett appealed to the full commission. On June 29, 2001, the full commission reversed the deputy commissioner and remanded the case to the deputy commissioner for determination on the remaining issues and entry of an appropriate award. The parties subsequently stipulated to the remaining issues and preserved the employer\u2019s challenge to the compensability of Cornett\u2019s injuries. The employer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">II. <em>ANALYSIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The employer contends on appeal that Cornett did not sustain an injury by accident arising from her employment and that she provided no credible evidence to support her. claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u201cA claimant\u2019s injury arises out of the employment if the manner in which the employer requires the work to be performed is causally related to the resulting injury.\u201d <em>South-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>side Virginia Training Ctr. v. Ellis, </em>33 Va.App. 824, 828, 537 S.E.2d 35, 37 (2000).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">[A]n injury is not compensable merely because it occurred during the performance of some employment duty if the act performed by the employee is not a causative hazard of the employment. Simple acts of walking, bending, or turning, without any other contributing environmental factors, are not risks of employment ... [these are risks] to which the general public is equally exposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 829-30, 537 S.E.2d at 37. It is well established that a fall down stairs does not arise out of the employment without evidence of a defect in the stairs or evidence that a condition of the employment caused the fall. <em>Southside Virginia Training Ctr. v. Shell, </em>20 Va.App. 199, 203, 455 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1995). However, an injury sustained as a result of a step of abnormal height or condition is compensable. <em>See Reserve Life Ins. Co. v. Hosey, </em>208 Va. 568, 159 S.E.2d 633 (1968) (rock steps that were higher than a normal step).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In <em>Boyette v. Prince George County School Board, </em>69 OIC 110 (1990), the commission awarded benefits to a school bus driver who fell down as she descended the bus steps.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">This record reveals that the employee was finishing her day\u2019s work as a school bus driver when she started to descend the metal steps of the bus and fell to the bottom of the stairwell and sustained injury to her left foot. The testimony is uncontroverted that the bus steps are deeper than ordinary steps____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">We find that the bus steps are unusual and not in conformity with normal stair steps and we take notice that a different degree of attention and exertion is required to negotiate them. Under these circumstances, the steps in the employer\u2019s bus present a particular risk not encountered in ordinary use of entries, exits, and walkways and that the risk involved caused the employee\u2019s fall and injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Like the steps in <em>Boyette, </em>Cornett consistently testified that the steps on her bus were unusual. In her deposition she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>stated that the steps were angled, different in height, and different from normal bus steps. Also, as in <em>Boyette, </em>the steps of the bus were \u201cdifferent than like say our home steps or standardized steps.\u201d Likewise, at the hearing before the deputy commissioner, she stated that they varied in height, depth, and shape. They turned as they rose, were wider than regular steps, angled differently, and were further apart. At the hearing before the deputy commissioner, Cornett opined that the various differences in the bus steps were the cause of her fall and injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The medical evidence supports that conclusion. On July 26, 1999, Dr. Dannelly reported that Cornett stepped off her school bus and turned her ankle. He diagnosed a Grade II-III lateral ligament injury and sprain to her left ankle. On August 27, 1999, a mid-calf popliteal tibialis clot was discovered and Cornett was hospitalized. On September 7, 1999, Dr. Handy evaluated her and noted that Cornett \u201cwas stepping off a school bus and twisted her left ankle and had a Grade IV sprain of the left ankle.\u201d He diagnosed DVT of the left lower extremity, secondary to the fall. On April 5, 2000, Dr. Dannelly, in an Attending Physicians Report, attributed Cornett\u2019s fractured left ankle and DVT to her fall from the school bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The record provides sufficient credible evidence for the full commission to infer that the oddity of the step construction made the stairs a condition of the workplace that contributed to her fall and to conclude that Cornett sustained an injury by accident arising out of her employment. \u201cDecisions of the commission as to questions of fact, if supported by credible evidence, are conclusive and binding on this Court.\u201d <em>Manassas Ice, </em>13 Va.App. at 229, 409 S.E.2d at 826. \u201cThe fact that contrary evidence may be found in the record is of no consequence if credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The decision of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-23\">. Cornett drove three different buses during the course of her employment. The first two were Thomas bodystyle buses. She was driving the new Bluebird bodystyle bus when her accident occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b328-8\">. Commissioner Tarr, in his dissenting opinion, states that the full commission's majority decision was inconsistent with its well established rule of deferring to a deputy commissioner\u2019s credibility finding. The rule, however, is that while deference is generally given to the deputy commissioner\u2019s credibility finding, the full commission has authority to assess the credibility of a witness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">When the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding of credibility is based, in whole or in part, upon the claimant\u2019s appearance and demeanor at the hearing, the commission may have difficulty reversing that finding without recalling the witness. On the other hand, if the deputy commissioner\u2019s determination of credibility is based on the substance of the testimony and not upon the witness\u2019 demeanor and appearance, such a finding is as determinable by the full commission as by the deputy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-10\"><em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.
