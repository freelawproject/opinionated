FRANK, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b795-15\">Martin Levette Hines (appellant) was convicted in a bench trial of five counts of forging a public record, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-168. On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in convicting him of five counts of the offense when only one offense was committed. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b795-17\">The facts are not in controversy. On March 11, 2000, after observing a car force other vehicles off the road, Virginia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Beach Police Officer Eric Livingston activated his emergency equipment and pursued the offending car. Committing additional traffic offenses, the car accelerated and then drove down a dead end street. At this point, the driver jumped out and attempted to flee. The officers caught the driver and escorted him back to their police car.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Appellant, the driver, did not have any identification. Officer Livingston asked for his name. Appellant said he was \u201cAntoine Fernando Hines,\u201d in actuality, the name of his brother. Appellant also gave his brother\u2019s birthday and social security number. Livingston checked the name, birth date, and social security number. He discovered \u201cAntoine Fernando Hines\u201d had only a learner\u2019s permit for driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Based on this information and his observations of appellant\u2019s driving, Officer Livingston prepared five separate summonses for failure to have the vehicle\u2019s registration, driving down the center line of the road, driving on the shoulder, disregarding a red light, and driving with a learner\u2019s permit without a licensed driver. The officer took appellant to the magistrate, where appellant falsely signed each summons with \u201cAntoine Hines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Appellant testified his true name was Martin Levette Hines, and his birthday was actually January 31, 1971. He knew outstanding arrest warrants under the name of Martin Hines were on file at the time the police attempted to stop him. He acknowledged he had a brother named Antoine Fernando Hines, but denied providing the officer with Antoine\u2019s birthday and social security number. Appellant admitted signing each summons with his brother\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">In his closing argument, appellant argued only one crime occurred with only one intent: to avoid the outstanding warrants. Appellant asked the trial court to strike all but one charge of forging a public record. The trial court declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">Appellant asserts the trial court erred in convicting him of five counts of forging public documents. He maintains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-168 should be interpreted to allow only one conviction under the facts of this case. In support of this argument, appellant asks us to extend the underlying rationale of the \u201csingle larceny doctrine\u201d to non-larceny offenses. He contends that, in signing the five summonses, he acted pursuant to a \u201csingle impulse and in execution of a general fraudulent scheme,\u201d citing <em>Richardson v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 491, 496, 489 S.E.2d 697, 700 (1997) <em>(en banc). </em>While appellant correctly states the \u201csingle larceny doctrine,\u201d that doctrine has no applicability to non-larceny cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Although appellant contends \u201cVirginia case law is replete with cases extending the single larceny doctrine to other than larceny-based offenses,\u201d we find no such cases, and he cites none. Recently, the Supreme Court of Virginia was invited to extend the \u201csingle larceny doctrine\u201d to multiple counts of shooting at an occupied vehicle and discharging a firearm while in a motor vehicle. In <em>Stephens v. Commonwealth, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">In <em>Holly\u2019s Case, </em>[113 Va. 769, 75 S.E. 88 (1912),] we stated the following rule: \u201cThe theft of several articles at one and the same time constitutes an indivisible offense, and a conviction or acquittal of any one or more of them is a bar to a subsequent prosecution for the larceny of the others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 772, 75 S.E. at 89. This rule is not applicable here because it \u201capplies only to a case involving multiple larceny prosecutions predicated upon the theft of multiple articles stolen contemporaneously.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 757, 761, 240 S.E.2d 658, 661, <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 892 [99 S.Ct. 249, 58 L.Ed.2d 238] (1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">263 Va. 58, 63, 557 S.E.2d 227, 230 (2002). We do not find the \u201csingle larceny doctrine\u201d has been broadly applied in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Appellant asks us to consider a federal appellate opinion, <em>Thomas v. Kerby, </em>44 F.3d 884 (10th Cir.1995), which applied New Mexico\u2019s single larceny doctrine to multiple convictions for forgery and uttering. \u201cSignificantly,\u201d however, the New Mexico courts had applied this doctrine more broadly than the Virginia courts have. <em>See id. </em>at 887-88. The federal court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>also noted a \u201cbasic similarity between larceny ... and the taking of funds by transfer of a forged or worthless instrument\u201d when it extended New Mexico\u2019s single larceny rule. <em>Id. </em>at 888 n. 3. Forgery of a public document and larceny, however, do not exhibit the same similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Larceny involves the loss of property. <em>See Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 295, 300-01, 349 S.E.2d 414, 417-18 (1986) (explaining the gravamen of the crime of larceny is the taking of property from its owner). <em>See, e.g., Quidley v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 963, 966, 275 S.E.2d 622, 624-25 (1981) (noting the gravamen of theft by fraud \u201cis the obtainment of ownership of property,\u201d although ultimate loss \u201cis immaterial\u201d). In contrast, the Supreme Court of Virginia concluded, after an extensive review of the history of the common law offenses of forging a public document and forging private papers, that actual prejudice to the public\u2019s ownership rights is not a necessary element of the crime of forging a public document. <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 174, 179-82, 431 S.E.2d 648, 651-53 (1993). The Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aay\">\u201cAt Common Law the Counterfeiting a Matter of Record is Forgery; for since the Law gives the highest Credit to all Records, it cannot but be of the utmost ill Consequence to the Publik to have them either forged or falsified.\u201d 2 Matthew Bacon, <em>Abridgment </em>*568 (1786). The common-law crime of forgery of public records, a capital offense in England, was augmented by statutes punishing the lesser offense of forgery of certain private documents. <em>See, e.g., </em>An Act Concerning Counterfeit Letters or Privy Tokens to Receive Money or Goods in Others Men\u2019s Names, 1541-42, 33 Hen. VIII, ch. 1 (Eng.). Unlike the crime of forgery of public records in which \u201cill Consequence to the Publik\u201d was conclusively presumed, and unlike the common-law crime of forgery of private papers in which proof of <em>potential </em>harm or prejudice to another Ayas required, conviction of the several statutory offenses generally required proof of <em>actual </em>harm or prejudice to the rights of another person. <em>See </em>1 Hawkins at 263 n. 1; 2 Bacon at *568.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 179-80, 431 S.E.2d at 651 (emphasis in original). The Court further reviewed the legislative history and the scheme of the Virginia forgery statutes and concluded \u201cthat harm or prejudice to the right of another person has never been and is not now an element of the crime of forgery of public records in this Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184, 431 S.E.2d at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">As the crime of forgery of a public document does not require personal loss of ownership, appellant\u2019s comparison to larceny is inapposite. Therefore, we will not extend the single larceny doctrine to cases involving Code \u00a7 18.2-168.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Additionally, the language and structure of the Code prove the legislature intended to allow multiple forgery convictions in situations such as the one before us. Code \u00a7 18.2-168 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">If any person forge <em>a public record, </em>or certif\u00edcate, return, or attestation, of any public officer or public employee, in relation to any matter wherein such certificate, return, or attestation may be received as legal proof, or utter, or attempt to employ as true, such forged record, certificate, return, or attestation, knowing the same to be forged, he shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">(Emphasis added.) While criminal statutes must be construed strictly against the Commonwealth and in favor of the accused, <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 815, 819, 180 S.E.2d 661, 664 (1971), when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, a court will give the statute its plain meaning, <em>Tross v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 362, 377-78, 464 S.E.2d 523, 530 (1995). We also note, \u201cThe legislature in its discretion may determine the appropriate \u2018unit of prosecution\u2019 and set the penalty for separate violations.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 590, 594, 347 S.E.2d 152, 154 (1986). An analysis of the concept of \u201ca public record\u201d and a summons <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> proves the legislature intended to allow multiple prosecutions for contemporaneous forgeries of such documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>At common law, a public record was \u201ca written memorial, intended to serve as evidence of something written, said or done, made by a public officer authorized to make it.\u201d <em>Reid v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 468, 470, 431 S.E.2d 63, 64 (1993) (citing <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 865, 881-82 (1874)). Under the Virginia Public Records Act, a public record is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">recorded information that documents a transaction or activity by or with any public officer, agency or employee of the state government or its political subdivisions. Regardless of physical form or characteristic, the recorded information is a public record if it is produced, collected, received or retained in pursuance of law or in connection with the transaction of public business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Code \u00a7 42.1-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">A summons is one type of public record. An officer takes the name and address of a person who has committed a crime and \u201cissue[s] a summons ... to appear at a time and place to be specified in such summons.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-74(A)(1), (2). <em>See also </em>Rule 7C:3(d) (defining a summons). The person then gives \u201chis written promise to appear at such time and place\u201d before the officer releases him from custody. Code \u00a7 19.2-74(A)(1), (2). \u201cAny person refusing to give such written promise to appear under the provisions of [Code \u00a7 19.2-74] shall be taken immediately by the arresting or other police officer before a magistrate or other issuing authority having jurisdiction----\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-74(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">A summons becomes the charging document on which a general district court tries an accused. Code \u00a7 16.1-129. If the accused \u201cwillfully violates his written promise to appear\u201d in court, given when he signed the summons, he can be convicted for failure to appear under Code \u00a7 19.2-128, \u201cregardless of the disposition of, and in addition to, the charge upon which he was originally arrested.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-74(A)(3). <em>See also </em>Rule 7C:3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Given this statutory scheme, each signed summons clearly can constitute a separate offense under Code \u00a7 18.2-168. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>this case, each summons related to a different violation of the traffic code. Each summons was a promise by appellant to appear in court on one of the infractions. Each failure to appear on any summons is a separate offense. Code \u00a7 19.2-74(A)(3). Each infraction listed on the separate summonses could have been tried separately. Rule 7C:4(c). Fees are collected on each conviction from each summons. Code \u00a7 17.1-275(A)(11). The clerk of the general district court must send an abstract of the record for each infraction to the Division of Motor Vehicles. Code \u00a7 46.2-383.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The Code does not treat five summonses, issued at the same time, as one \u201cpublic document.\u201d Each summons has a separate existence with separate consequences and effects. Additionally, Code \u00a7 18.2-168 plainly states a person is guilty if he forges <em>\u201ca </em>public record,\u201d not public records generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">We conclude the trial court did not err in convicting appellant of five separate counts of forging a public record. Each summons constituted a separate public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\">. Appellant does not argue a summons is not a public record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
