On appeal, Jackson challenges only the trial court\u2019s denial of his pretrial suppression motion. We affirm the trial court on this issue, finding no error in either its analysis or conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">On appeal from a denial of a suppression motion, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences. <em>Bass v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 470, 475, 525 S.E.2d 921, 924 (2000); <em>Sabo v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 63, 69, 561 S.E.2d 761, 764 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">At 2:10 a.m. on June 17, 2001, the Newport News Police Department dispatched Officer M.A. Cook to a street corner next to a \u201csmall bar\u201d to investigate an anonymous complaint. The caller reported (and the dispatcher advised the responding officers) that \u201cthree black males\u201d were acting disorderly and \u201cat least one of them had a firearm and was brandishing it.\u201d The caller also stated that the three \u201cwere getting into a car and leaving.\u201d The caller described the vehicle as a \u201cwhite Honda.\u201d Sending backup, the police interpreted the report as \u201ca high risk situation with a gun possibly involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Three to five minutes later, Cook and other officers arrived at the scene and observed a white Honda leaving the area. They saw no other white vehicles of any type. The white Honda \u201cpulled out right in front\u201d of Cook, permitting the headlights of his police cruiser to shine directly into the vehicle. Cook clearly saw three black males in the white Honda. On the basis of the brandishing tip, the officers followed the vehicle and stopped it several blocks away.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Cook approached the car and explained the reason for the stop. Sergeant James Hogan went to the passenger side of the vehicle and shined a light into the car. Jackson sat in the front passenger seat with his arms folded across his stomach. Hogan noted an unusual bulge underneath Jackson\u2019s shirt, which the officer suspected to be a firearm. The bulge, Hogan concluded, \u201cobviously was not part of his body\u201d and was \u201ctoo big\u201d to be anything other than a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Hogan asked Jackson if he had a gun on him. Jackson said no. Hogan then said, \u201cCould you pull your shirt up so that I can be comfortable with us talking, because I believe you have a firearm?\u201d In response, Jackson pulled his shirt \u201ca couple inches and put it back\u201d and then \u201ccrossed his arms back across his stomach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Fearing for his safety, Hogan unholstered his sidearm and ordered Jackson out of the car. After Jackson got out of the vehicle, Officer B.D. Bartley immediately conducted a weapons search and removed a dock, .40 caliber, semiautomatic handgun from Jackson in the exact area of the previously noticed bulge. The officers then handcuffed Jackson and placed him under arrest. In a search incident to his arrest, the officers also found crack cocaine in Jackson\u2019s pants pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">At trial, Jackson moved to suppress the evidence, claiming that the police officers (i) lacked a sufficient basis to stop the white Honda and to question its occupants, and (ii) had equally insubstantial grounds for searching him for weapons or drugs. Both events, Jackson contended, violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>search and seizure principles protected by Virginia law and the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The trial court denied the motion, stating that the officers had \u201can obligation to protect the citizens of this community\u201d and would have been \u201cderelict in their duty\u201d had they not acted as they did. The procedures they followed, the trial judge concluded, were \u201cstrictly by the book.\u201d For the following reasons, we agree with the trial court and affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Though the ultimate question whether the officers violated the Fourth Amendment triggers <em>de novo </em>scrutiny, we defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of \u201chistorical fact\u201d and give \u201cdue weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 421, 429, 559 S.E.2d 374, 378 (2002) (citing <em>Neal v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 233, 237, 498 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1998)). Viewing the case through this evidentiary prism, we examine the trial court\u2019s factual findings to determine if they are plainly wrong or devoid of supporting evidence. <em>See Mier v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 827, 828, 407 S.E.2d 342, 343 (1991). The appellant must shoulder the \u201cburden\u201d of showing that the trial court\u2019s decision \u201cconstituted reversible error.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc) </em>(citations omitted); <em>see also Davis, </em>37 Va.App. at 429-30, 559 S.E.2d at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"> The Fourth Amendment \u201cdoes not proscribe all seizures, only those that are \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hodnett v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 684, 690, 530 S.E.2d 433, 436 (2000) (quoting <em>Welshman v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 20, 30, 502 S.E.2d 122, 126-27 (1998) <em>(en bane)); Hamlin v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 494, 499, 534 S.E.2d 363, 365 (2000) (citation omitted). The Constitution simply \u201cdoes not proscribe reasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 556, 564, 559 S.E.2d 890, 893 (2002). The text of the Fourth Amendment draws the line there; so too must the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">In this context, reasonableness depends on the extent of the individual\u2019s loss of freedom caused by the seizure and the objective reason for it. A full custodial arrest requires a showing of probable cause. When police officers merely stop an automobile, however, they need only have a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the driver is unlicensed, the automobile unregistered, or the \u201cperson stopped may be involved in criminal activity.\u201d <em>Bass, </em>259 Va. at 474-75, 525 S.E.2d at 923-24 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Actual proof that \u201ccriminal activity is afoot is not necessary,\u201d only that it \u201cmay be afoot.\u201d <em>Harmon v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 440, 444, 425 S.E.2d 77, 79 (1992); <em>see also United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002); <em>Hamlin, </em>33 Va.App. at 501, 534 S.E.2d at 366. Though an officer\u2019s reliance on a mere hunch cannot justify a stop, \u201cthe likelihood of criminal activity need not rise to the level required for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>probable cause, and it falls considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard.\u201d <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 274, 122 S.Ct. at 751.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Under equally settled principles, \u201canonymous information that has been sufficiently corroborated may furnish reasonable suspicion justifying an investigative stop.\u201d <em>Bulatko v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 135, 137, 428 S.E.2d 306, 307 (1993) (citing <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 331, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2416, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990)). \u201cAn informant\u2019s tip can provide the justification for a <em>Terry </em>stop even if the informant\u2019s reliability is unknown and certainly can do so if, as here, the information is corroborated.\u201d <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 5, 11, 509 S.E.2d 512, 515 (1999) (en banc) (citation omitted). \u201cAnonymous information sufficiently corroborated may give reasonable suspicion for an investigative stop although the unverified tip by itself would not justify a forcible stop.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>29 Va.App. at 12, 509 S.E.2d at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Described as \u201cthe classic case on the value of corroborative efforts of police officials,\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 242, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2334, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983), the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Draper v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959), involved a known informant who reported that the suspect would be arriving on a particular train, wearing certain kinds of clothes, carrying particular pieces of luggage, would walk briskly, and \u201cwould be carrying a quantity of heroin.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 242, 103 S.Ct. at 2334. The informant \u201cgave no indication of the basis for his information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The police verified all of these details <em>except </em>the allegation that the suspect had \u201cheroin on his person or in his bag.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 243, 103 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>2334. By itself, however, this omission did not invalidate the reliability of the tip. As the Supreme Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-C\">with every other bit of [the informant\u2019s] information being thus personally verified, [the officer] had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe that the remaining unverified bit of [the informant\u2019s] information \u2014 that [the suspect] would have the heroin with him \u2014 was likewise true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Draper, </em>358 U.S. at 313, 79 S.Ct. at 333); <em>see also Boyd v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 179, 189, 402 S.E.2d 914, 920 (1991) (\u201cThe verification of the personal information becomes, then, but another circumstance the [officer] may consider in determining whether the informer is to be believed. It is a factor which reduced the chances that [the informer\u2019s report was] a reckless or prevaricating tale.\u201d (citing <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 244-45, 103 S.Ct. at 2335) (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The Fourth Amendment has never required that the same inflexible rule of reliability be applied to all cases involving informants. \u201cRigid legal rules are ill-suited to an area of such diversity. \u2018One simple rule will not cover every situation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 232, 103 S.Ct. at 2329 (quoting <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 147, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1924, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972)). Even the reasonable suspicion standard itself, a \u201csomewhat abstract\u201d and \u201celusive concept,\u201d cannot be reduced to a \u201cneat set of legal rules.\u201d <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 274, 122 S.Ct. at 751 (quoting <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 695-96, 116 S.Ct. at 1661, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996), and <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 232, 103 S.Ct. at 2329 (additional citation omitted)). Given the flexibility inherent in the concept of reasonableness, the level of corroboration required by the Fourth Amendment depends on commonsense principles. In this case, three such principles stand out.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">First, citizens who witness a crime in progress are presumed personally reliable, and thus, courts do not \u201cnot apply to citizen informers the same standard of reliability as is applicable when police act on tips from professional informers or those who seek immunity for themselves....\u201d <em>Guzewicz v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 730, 735-36, 187 S.E.2d 144, 148 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>(1972). Information from a \u201cdisinterested citizen\u201d who claims to be an eyewitness of a crime may be given more weight than \u201cinformation from a \u2018criminal\u2019 informer, whose motives are less likely to be pure.\u201d <em>Reed v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 260, 267-68, 549 S.E.2d 616, 619-20 (2001); <em>see also McCreary v. Sigler, </em>406 F.2d 1264, 1269 (8th Cir.1969) (\u201cProbable cause for an arrest may exist where an unknown citizen makes complaints, as a victim or eyewitness to a crime, where the underlying circumstances demonstrate his first-hand personal knowledge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Put another way, a call from a concerned citizen who witnesses a crime requires not so much \u201cpersonal reliability\u201d of the observer, but \u201cobservational reliability\u201d of his observations. <em>State v. Walshire, </em>634 N.W.2d 625, 629 (Iowa 2001); <em>see also State v. Williams, </em>241 Wis.2d 631, 623 N.W.2d 106, <em>115, cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 949, 122 S.Ct. 343, 151 L.Ed.2d 259 (2001). Observational reliability exists where the police can corroborate significant details, the corroboration takes place soon after the alleged observation, and the eyewitness report is something that could have been seen had it happened as described.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we said in <em>Beckner v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 533, 537, 425 S.E.2d 530, 533 (1993), albeit in <em>dicta, </em>an anonymous report that a suspect is \u201cdisplaying a gun\u201d implies a \u201cpersonal basis of knowledge\u201d upon which reasonable officers may rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Second, the Fourth Amendment requirement of corroboration also takes into account whether the alleged illegality involves a concealed crime or an open and obvious crime. It matters a great deal if the illegality alleged in the tip \u201c \u2018did not involve a concealed crime \u2014 a possessory offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>ed States v. Wheat, </em>278 F.3d 722, 734 (8th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>State v. Boyea, </em>171 Vt. 401, 765 A.2d 862, 875 (2000) (Skoglund, J., concurring)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 123 S.Ct. 194, 154 L.Ed.2d 81 (2002). If what was \u201cdescribed in the police dispatch to the arresting officer was a crime in progress, carried out in public, identifiable and observable by-anyone,\u201d the anonymous tip may not need the same species of corroboration required for reports of concealed crimes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">In other words, what may be reasonable corroboration for tips alleging an open and obvious crime (particularly from a caller claiming to be an eyewitness) may be unsatisfactory for those asserting a concealed crime. For concealed crimes, the tip may need some insider information capable of predicting the suspect\u2019s actions. This conclusion stems from the truism, noted in <em>White, </em>496 U.S. at 332, 110 S.Ct. at 2417, that when a tipster has knowledge of information about the suspect which the \u201cgeneral public would have no way of knowing,\u201d then it can be reasonably inferred that the tipster \u201cis likely to also have access to reliable information about that individual\u2019s illegal activities.\u201d In such cases, the tip becomes more reliable to the extent it reveals \u201cinside information\u201d demonstrating a \u201cspecial familiarity\u201d with the suspect\u2019s affairs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">When an anonymous caller reports an open and obvious crime (like when a suspect brandishes a weapon or, for that matter, shoots someone), the Fourth Amendment may require no showing that the caller have inside information about the suspect capable of predicting his future conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A \u201ccareful reading\u201d of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s eases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>shows that the \u201cemphasis on the predictive aspects of an anonymous tip may be less applicable to tips purporting to describe contemporaneous, readily observable criminal actions____\u201d <em>Wheat, </em>278 F.3d at 734. In such cases, the duty to corroborate focuses mainly on whether the tipster has accurately identified the suspect and described the illegality. \u201cAlmost always, it comes from his eyewitness observations, and there is no need to verify that he possesses inside information.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Third, the reasonable corroboration standard also takes into account the seriousness of the danger posed by the alleged illegality. On several occasions \u201cwe have recognized a fine of cases where courts have found reasonable suspicion for an investigatory stop when the public is in imminent danger, despite the fact that the stop is based on information provided by an anonymous informant who has not provided any basis of knowledge.\u201d <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 725, 728, 460 S.E.2d 610, 612 (1995) (citations omitted); <em>see also Ramey v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 624, 633, 547 S.E.2d 519, 524 (2001) (\u201cWe have applied an imminent danger standard in reviewing the sufficiency of an anonymous tip where there is a contemporaneous description of dangerous criminal activity such as brandishing a firearm in a public place.\u201d). In such cases, the \u201cimminent public danger\u201d may provide ample justification for an \u201cimmediate investigation.\u201d <em>Beckner, </em>15 Va.App. at 538, 425 S.E.2d at 534; <em>cf. Giles v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 519, 524-25, 529 S.E.2d 327, 330 (2000) (considering the \u201cimminence of serious and perhaps lethal danger\u201d as a factor in <em>Terry </em>stop analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">In light of these principles, we reject Jackson\u2019s argument that the police had no authority to stop the white Honda and to question its occupants. The officers received a dispatch stating that three black males in a white Honda had been observed acting disorderly and one had been seen \u201cbrandishing\u201d a firearm. On its face, the report alleged open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>and obvious criminal behavior. Brandishing a firearm means using it \u201cin such manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another or holding a firearm in a public place in such a manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another of being shot or injured.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-282(A). The ordinary meaning of the word tracks its statutory definition. Brandishing a firearm means to \u201cwave, shake, or exhibit in a menacing, challenging, or exultant way.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>170 (3d college ed.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">That leaves only one issue: Did the officers sufficiently corroborate the information in the call? The trial court correctly found that they did. The caller reported six significant details: the make of the vehicle (Honda), its color (white), its location (leaving the bar), the number of the occupants in the car (three), the race of each of the occupants (black), and the gender of each of the occupants (males). Having corroborated each of these details, within minutes of the original report, the police had an objectively reasonable belief that the remaining portion of the tip \u2014 that one of the suspects had brandished a firearm only moments before \u2014 was likewise true. It is hardly unreasonable to believe that \u201c \u2018because an informant is right about some things, he is more probably right about other facts\u2019 ... including the claim regarding the [the suspect\u2019s] illegal activity.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 244, 103 S.Ct. at 2335 (quoting <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 427, 89 S.Ct. 584, 594, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969) (White, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Although the information came from a concerned citizen making an anonymous call to the police, this fact strengthens, not weakens, the reliability of the tip. No information suggests the unknown caller was a paid informant or a known criminal tipster. More important, the caller claimed he observed one of the disorderly suspects \u201cbrandishing\u201d the weapon and then \u201cgetting into a car and leaving.\u201d The caller described the events in the first person, reporting his personal observations about events then occurring. The tip in our case, moreover, involved an open and obvious illegality. By definition, brandishing must be visible. Thus, anyone outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>bar (or inside the bar looking out the window) could have seen it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Jackson\u2019s argument to the contrary fails to calibrate his disagreement at the relevant level of persuasion. For a mere investigatory detention, the Fourth Amendment does not require a showing that the suspicion of illegality be more likely true than not. <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273-74, 122 S.Ct. 744. Nor, for that matter, need there be even the lesser showing that probable cause exists for such a belief. <em>Id. </em>There simply must be a reasonable suspicion, not one based on a mere guess or instinctual hunch. The sufficiency of the corroboration, therefore, need only be great enough to elevate the suspicion from an unfounded supposition to a reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Jackson contends our reasoning has been undermined by <em>Florida v. J.L., 529 </em>U.S. 266, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000). We disagree. The only \u201cquestion presented\u201d in that case \u2014 according to the United States Supreme Court \u2014 was \u201cwhether an anonymous tip that a person is carrying a gun is, <em>without more, </em>sufficient to justify a police officer\u2019s stop and frisk of that person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268, 120 S.Ct. at 1377 (emphasis added); <em>see also Commonwealth v. Hill, </em>264 Va. 541, 545, 570 S.E.2d 805, 807 (2002). The anonymous call reported only \u201cthat a young black male standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt was carrying a gun.\u201d <em>J.L., </em>529 U.S. at 268, 120 S.Ct. at 1377. As J.L. correctly put it, the \u201ctipster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>did not even allege that a crime was being committed.\u201d Brief of Respondent, <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>1998 U.S. Briefs Lexis 1993 at *4 (Jan. 25, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In other words, the tip in <em>J.L. </em>did not contain \u201ca specific description of dangerous criminal conduct either under way or likely to occur.\u201d <em>Ramey, </em>35 Va.App. at 633, 547 S.E.2d at 524 (describing the deficiency in the <em>J.L. </em>tip). Reasonable suspicion \u201crequires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality,\u201d not just in its ability to identify a particular suspect. <em>Hill, </em>264 Va. at 545, 570 S.E.2d at 807 (quoting <em>J.L., </em>529 U.S. at 272, 120 S.Ct. at 1379). The holding of <em>J.L. </em>turns on this very point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">An accurate description of a subject\u2019s readily observable location and appearance is of course reliable in this limited sense: It will help the police correctly identify the person whom the tipster means to accuse. Such a tip, however, does not show that the tipster has <em>knowledge of concealed criminal activity. </em>The reasonable suspicion here at issue requires that a tip be reliable in its <em>assertion of illegality, </em>not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqB\"><em>J.L., </em>529 U.S. at 272, 120 S.Ct. at 1379 (emphasis added). <em>J.L. </em>cited with approval a leading text that distinguishes \u201creliability as to identification, which is often important in other criminal law contexts, from reliability as to the likelihood of criminal activity, which is central in anonymous-tip cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(summarizing 4 W. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 9.4(h), at 213 (3d ed.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">This fact alone distinguishes <em>J.L. </em>from our case. Absent some disqualifying status (being a felon, juvenile, or drug possessor) or situs (being in a place where weapons are forbidden), it is not a crime to possess a weapon. The tipster in <em>J.L., </em>therefore, made no reliable assertion of illegality.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>the other hand, no matter one\u2019s status or situs, it is a crime to brandish a firearm in a public place. And that is exactly what the tipster in our case asserted in a contemporaneous, eyewitness report. We thus see a substantial difference between the tip in <em>J.L. </em>(a man is carrying a gun) and the tip in our case (a man is pointing a gun at people).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The \u201ccarrying a gun\u201d shorthand expression in <em>J.L., </em>moreover, should not be mistakenly interpreted as \u201cbrandishing\u201d a gun. The Florida Supreme Court, affirmed by the United States Supreme Court, made clear that the officers \u201creceived an anonymous tip that a young man was carrying a <em>concealed </em>weapon.\u201d <em>J.L. v. Florida, </em>727 So.2d 204, 207 (Fla.1998) (emphasis added). The Florida Court of Appeals also confirmed that the \u201cpolice received an anonymous complaint that a <em>concealed </em>weapon violation was taking place.\u201d <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>689 So.2d 1116, 1117 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1997) (emphasis added). The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari on a single question presented, whether a tip alleging \u201ca person is carrying a <em>concealed </em>firearm\u201d passed the reliability test. Brief of Petitioner, <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>1998 U.S. Briefs Lexis 1993 at *i (Dec. 23, 1999) (emphasis added). Not one time in any of the judicial opinions or legal briefs accompanying <em>J.L. </em>to the United States Supreme Court did anyone assert that the tip in <em>J.L. </em>involved a complaint of brandishing.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>In addition to alleging a specific illegality, the brandishing tip in our case has another characteristic that distinguishes it from <em>J.L. </em>Even if the <em>J.L. </em>tip had alleged a specific illegality (like, for example, if the tip had said the suspect had both a weapon and illegal drugs on him at that bus stop),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the illegality would have been concealed. In contrast, the tip in our case involved an open and obvious illegality. Anyone watching the suspect could have seen him brandishing the firearm. It matters not that the anonymous caller did not have predictive information about the suspect. He was simply reporting what he saw. The United States Supreme Court in <em>White </em>\u201cdid not create a rule requiring that a tip predict future action, and neither did <em>J.L.\u201d Wheat, </em>278 F.3d at 734 (citation omitted). Nor do we. The consequences of such an inflexible rule would be unwise at best and dangerous at worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">If we were to adopt such a rule, it would preclude an officer from stopping a shooting suspect while fleeing the scene of an alleged crime simply because the anonymous tip (reported by an alleged eyewitness providing a near-contemporaneous description of the suspect and the offense) did not recite any predictive information about the shooter. In such a case, what would matter to any reasonable officer (and, under the law, what should matter to any reasonable court) is whether the caller actually saw the shooter and the shooting, not whether the caller knows some intimate details of the shooter\u2019s personal life. To reject this commonsense distinction between a concealed crime (which may require some showing of predictive quality to the tip) and an open and obvious crime (which focuses only on observational reliability), as Jackson urges us to do, would hardly be in keeping with the rale of reason animating the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">An equally dispositive distinction between the <em>J.L. </em>tip and the tip in our case is that the brandishing tip in our case came from a caller making a contemporaneous report of observable events as an eyewitness. The tipster in <em>J.L. </em>did not state that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>he observed J.L. with the firearm. The fact is, the tip did not express or imply any first-person, present-tense observation of the reported facts. Like the officers in <em>J.L., </em>we are left to wonder whether the tipster saw anything himself or whether he simply made a wild (albeit accurate) guess that J.L. was carrying a gun.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Finally, we find the corroboration sufficient in light of the imminent danger to the public raised by the anonymous brandishing tip. In <em>Scott, </em>20 Va.App. at 727, 460 S.E.2d at 611, an anonymous caller reported that he saw a man \u201cbrandishing a gun\u201d in a laundromat. The caller gave a specific description of the man\u2019s appearance. The police found the man a block away and took a firearm from him during a pat-down search. We held that the \u201cimminent danger\u201d posed by a suspect brandishing a firearm in a public place warranted the stop because of the enormous risk that, if the tip were true, innocent lives might be placed in immediate peril. <em>Scott, </em>20 Va.App. at 728-29, 460 S.E.2d at 612-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The same conclusion reached in <em>Scott </em>must be reached here, a case where police officers received information from a concerned citizen about a suspect brandishing a firearm outside a bar at about 2:00 a.m. For the police not to act in such circumstances, the trial judge correctly observed, would have been a dereliction of duty. Whatever the appropriate level of Fourth Amendment scrutiny, it should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>permit (much less encourage) a law enforcement officer \u201c \u2018to simply shrug his shoulders and allow a crime to occur or a criminal to escape.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 4</em>73 U.S. 531, 544, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 3312, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985) (quoting <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. at 145, 92 S.Ct. at 1923); <em>see also Simmons v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 552, 554, 231 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1977); <em>Christian v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 704, 713, 536 S.E.2d 477, 482 (2000) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">For the same reasons we find unpersuasive the analogy between <em>J.L. </em>and the present case, we find it equally unconvincing as a basis for overruling <em>Scott. </em>Unlike <em>Scott, </em>the tip in <em>J.L. </em>did not involve a contemporaneous, eyewitness account, but rather a vague report providing absolutely no basis for the officers to discern the possible source of the caller\u2019s information or its timeliness. Also unlike <em>Scott, </em>the tip in <em>J.L. </em>did not describe an open and obvious crime involving an imminent danger to public safety, but rather a concealed one (assuming any alleged illegality at all) implicating no immediate peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In sum, we find the brandishing tip in our case \u201creliable in its assertion of illegality,\u201d <em>J.L., </em>529 U.S. at 272, 120 S.Ct. 1375, because this tip \u2014 unlike the \u201ccarrying a gun\u201d tip in J.L.\u2014 provided information permitting the officers reasonably to infer that it (i) came from a concerned citizen making a contemporaneous, eyewitness report, (ii) involved an open and obvious crime rather than mere concealed illegality, and (iii) described criminality posing an imminent danger to the public. After corroborating a half-dozen specific details within minutes of the tip, the officers correctly concluded the totality of the circumstances raised a \u201creasonable suspicion to believe that criminal activity \u2018may be afoot.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. 744 (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Even assuming the legality of the vehicle stop, Jackson still contends that no additional grounds existed for his warrant-less search and detention. \u201cWhen a police encounter goes beyond an investigatory detention,\u201d Jackson argues, it \u201cbe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>comes a \u2018seizure\u2019 of the suspect\u201d and \u201cfull probable cause is required for the seizure, not a mere showing of articulable suspicion.\u201d In making this argument, Jackson views being questioned, ordered out of the vehicle (albeit at gunpoint), and frisked as an arrest. He also assumes that, under Fourth Amendment principles, all seizures must be arrests for purposes of triggering the probable cause requirement. We find merit in neither argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Investigatory detentions and arrests both involve Fourth Amendment seizures.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They are quite dissimilar, however, in actual practice and in legal principle. In an investigatory detention, an officer seeks to determine whether a crime has been, or is about to be, committed. The suspect\u2019s freedom to leave is impaired, but only temporarily. If the officer\u2019s suspicions do not ripen into probable cause, the suspect must be promptly released once the purpose for the stop has been fulfilled. In contrast, an arrest is \u201c \u2018the initial stage of a criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hill, </em>264 Va. at 547, 570 S.E.2d at 808 (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 26, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1882, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). \u201cAfter an arrest, a citizen\u2019s liberty is completely constrained, at a minimum, until a judicial officer has determined the issue of bail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the \u201cdifferent consequences that attend an arrest and an investigative detention are manifest.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">During an investigatory stop, the officer may conduct a pat-down search for his own safety if he has a reasonable belief that the person may be armed and dangerous. <em>See Ybarra v. Illinois, </em>444 U.S. 85, 93-94, 100 S.Ct. 338, 343, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979). The officer need not be \u201cabsolutely certain that the person is armed.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>217 Va. at 556, 231 S.E.2d at 221. \u201cIf he reasonably believes that the individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>ual <em>might </em>be armed, the search is warranted to protect himself or others who may be in danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">In assessing whether a suspect may be armed and dangerous, an officer may consider \u201ccharacteristics of the area surrounding the stop, the time of the stop, the specific conduct of the suspect individual, the character of the offense under suspicion, and the unique perspective of a police officer trained and experienced in the detection of crime.\u201d <em>Christian, </em>33 Va.App. at 714, 536 S.E.2d at 482 (footnote omitted). Courts assess reasonableness from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, making allowance for the necessity of split-second decisions. <em>See Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1872, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In <em>Scott, </em>we approved a pat-down search of a suspect who had reportedly brandished a firearm in a public place. The report came from an anonymous source which identified only the suspect\u2019s appearance and location. The weapons frisk was nonetheless \u201cwarranted for the officer\u2019s protection and the protection of the public\u201d given the immediate and potentially deadly risk the suspect posed. <em>Scott, </em>20 Va.App. at 729-30, 460 S.E.2d at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Here, a contemporaneous report by a concerned citizen said three black males in the white Honda had been disorderly and one of them had brandished a firearm. When questioned directly about having a gun, Jackson conspicuously attempted to hide under his crossed arms a bulge that a trained officer immediately believed to be a weapon. The officers, therefore, did not act unreasonably by suspecting the bulge \u201cmight be\u201d a firearm. <em>Simmons, </em>217 Va. at 556, 231 S.E.2d at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>We also reject Jackson\u2019s argument that the investigatory detention and weapons frisk amounted to a full custodial arrest. To protect themselves during a valid <em>Terry </em>stop, police officers have a right to draw their weapons, to handcuff a suspect, or even to threaten to use force if the circumstances reasonably warrant it. <em>See generally Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 851, 857, 434 S.E.2d 319, 323 (1993), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>18 Va.App. 454, 444 S.E.2d 275 (1994). A <em>Terry </em>stop involves</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">a police investigation \u201cat close range,\u201d when the officer remains particularly vulnerable in part <em>because </em>a full custodial arrest has not been effected, and the officer must make \u201ca quick decision as to how to protect himself and others from possible danger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\"><em>Servis v.

If a suspect is dangerous, \u201che is no less dangerous simply because he is not arrest\u00e9d.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Coercive measures, therefore, do not \u201cconvert a stop and frisk into an arrest so long as the methods of restraint used are reasonable to the circumstances.\u201d <em>Johnson v.

Questions of scope, whether in terms of duration or the extent of coercion, must be referred back to the basic reasonableness standard. When \u201cevaluating whether an investigative detention is unreasonable, common sense and ordinary human experience must govern over rigid criteria.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>29 Va.App. at 15, 509 S.E.2d at 517 (quoting <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 685, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 1575, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>In this case, the officers ordered Jackson out of the car to frisk him only after they came to the reasonable conclusion that he was hiding a weapon \u2014 likely the very one that had been brandished earlier. The only way to confirm or dispel that suspicion was to conduct a limited weapons search. Given the circumstances they faced at that time of night, we find nothing unreasonable about the officers unholstering their weapons during the frisk and ordering Jackson out of the car. Thus, we reject Jackson\u2019s contention that the officers went beyond the boundaries of <em>Terry </em>during their detention and weapons frisk of Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Having found the weapon, the officers had probable cause to believe Jackson was the black male who had reportedly brandished a firearm outside the bar. By placing him under arrest at that time, the officers gained the corollary authority to conduct a search incident to that arrest. <em>United States v.

Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 407, 551 S.E.2d 606 (2001), to be at cross purposes with our analysis. In that case, the Commonwealth stipulated that the anonymous tip (alleging a suspected drug dealer was \"armed\") was insufficient to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop, thus rendering the <em>J.L. </em>issue moot. Recognizing this, the Virginia Supreme Court stated: \"Accordingly, we need not address that aspect of the Court of Appeals opinion.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>262 Va. at 414, 551 S.E.2d at 609. From there, <em>Harris </em>went on to address only the question whether the police officer had a reasonable suspicion that the suspect was trespassing. On that narrow issue, <em>Harris </em>held that the Commonwealth could not use a concededly invalid tip (concerning an \"armed\u201d drug dealer) to rehabilitate a <em>Terry </em>stop (based solely on a trespassing hunch) which itself lacked any reasonable suspicion of illegality. Nothing in Harris, therefore, deals with the question whether the tip did or did not satisfy the <em>J.L. </em>standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b691-7\">.

J.L., </em>529 U.S. 266, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000), could not be clearer. Without a dissent, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u201ch[e]ld that an anonymous tip lacking indicia of reliability ... does not justify a stop and frisk whenever and however it alleges the illegal possession of a firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, 120 S.Ct. at 1380.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">I believe the majority misreads the import of <em>J.L. </em>when concluding that the decision turned upon a finding that the informant had not relayed to the police information about criminal conduct. Answering \u201c[t]he question ... whether an anonymous tip that a person is carrying a gun, is without more, sufficient to justify a police officer\u2019s stop and frisk of that person,\u201d 529 U.S. at 268, 120 S.Ct. at 1377, the Supreme Court noted that \u201c \u2018an anonymous tip alone seldom demonstrates the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge or veracity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 120 S.Ct. at 1378 (quoting <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 329, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2416, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990)). On facts virtually identical to this case, the Court concluded the informant\u2019s tip was not proved reliable and reached the holding recited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">If, as the majority opinion here suggests, the issue in <em>J.L. </em>concerned the failure of the informant\u2019s tip to convey evidence of criminal conduct, the resolution of that case would not have required any discussion about the informant\u2019s reliability. In that circumstance, regardless of the informant\u2019s reliability, the officer would have been operating only on a bare suspicion and would not have had a basis to detain <em>J.L. See Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (holding that a police officer may not detain a person for investigative purposes based on \u201chis inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch\u2019 \u201d that criminal activity may be occurring). <em>See also Brown v. Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979). Significantly, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>J.L. </em>notes that <em>\u201c[ajpart from the tip, </em>the officers had no reason to suspect any of the three [men] of illegal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268, 120 S.Ct. at 1377 (emphasis added). Therefore, the majority opinion\u2019s assertion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>tip in <em>J.L. </em>failed to convey information about criminal conduct is simply wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Explaining further the deficiency in the proof of the reliability of the informant\u2019s tip, the Supreme Court noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">The tip in the instant case lacked the moderate indicia of reliability present in <em>White </em>and essential to the Court\u2019s decision in that case.... All the police had to go on in this case was the bare report of an unknown, unaccountable informant who neither explained how he kriew about the gun nor supplied any basis for believing he had inside information about J.L. If <em>White </em>was a close case on the reliability of anonymous tips, this one surely falls on the other side of the line.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-6\"><em>J.L., </em>529 U.S. at 271, 120 S.Ct. at 1379. Indeed, the Supreme Court engaged in an extended discussion of the anonymous informant\u2019s reliability in <em>J.L. </em>precisely because the tip disclosed criminal conduct and might have supported a detention if the informant was proved to be reliable. <em>See Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 146-47, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923-24, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Although all nine justices joined the <em>J.L. </em>opinion, <em>see </em>529 U.S. at 274, 120 S.Ct. at 1380 (Kennedy, J., and Rehnquist, C.J., concurring, and noting \u201cI join in the opinion in all respects\u201d), the concurring opinion also refutes the interpretation the majority opinion in this case gives to <em>J.L. </em>Specifically, the concurring opinion posits as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">An anonymous telephone tip without more is different, however, for even if the officer\u2019s testimony about receipt of the tip is found credible, there is a second layer of inquiry respecting the reliability of the informant that cannot be pursued. If the telephone call is truly anonymous, the informant has not placed his credibility at risk and can lie with impunity. The reviewing court cannot judge the credibility of the informant and the risk of fabrication becomes unacceptable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">On this record, then, the Court is correct in holding that the telephone tip did not justify the arresting officer\u2019s immediate stop and frisk of respondent. There was testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>mony that an anonymous tip came in by a telephone call and nothing more. The record does not show whether some notation or other documentation of the call was made either by a voice recording or tracing the call to a telephone number. The prosecution recounted just the tip itself and the later verification of the presence of the three young men in the circumstances the Court describes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">529 U.S. at 275, 120 S.Ct. at 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Rarely are the facts of two cases as congruent as the facts in <em>J.L. </em>and this case. As in <em>J.L., </em>the officer in this case received information from his dispatcher concerning a report from an anonymous person. As in <em>J.L., </em>the testimony indicates an anonymous informant said that a man brandished a firearm in a public place. <em>See </em>529 U.S. at 268, 120 S.Ct. at 1377 (noting that an anonymous caller reported that a young man \u201cwas carrying a gun\u201d). As in <em>J.L., </em>the testimony indicates the anonymous informant described the gender, race, and location of the accused. As in <em>J.L., </em>the officer did not see a gun before detaining the man. Finally, as in <em>J.L., </em>the circumstances surrounding the anonymous informant\u2019s tip were not sufficient to negate the substantial risk of fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The similarities between <em>J.L. </em>and this case extend beyond the basic facts. Indeed, the two cases present the same Fourth Amendment concerns that troubled the Supreme Court. As in <em>J.L., </em>the officers\u2019 suspicion that Jackson was unlawfully carrying a weapon arose solely from a call made from an unknown location by an unknown caller. \u201cUnlike a tip from a known informant whose reputation can be assessed and who can be held responsible if her allegations turn out to be fabricated, ... \u2018an anonymous tip alone seldom demonstrates the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge or veracity.\u2019 \u201d 529 U.S. at 270, 120 S.Ct. at 1378 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The notion that the police could \u201cinfer that [the tip] ... came from a concerned citizen making a contemporaneous, eyewitness report\u201d merely because the tip alleges \u201can open and obvious crime\u201d is precisely the type of analysis that <em>J.L. </em>rejects. Nothing about such a tip provides a basis upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>anyone might conclude that the anonymous informant is either honest or providing reliable information. A plain reading of <em>J.L. </em>discloses that the Supreme Court, in a footnote, summarily disposed of the thesis advanced by the majority opinion in this case when the Court ruled that \u201c[t]he mere fact that a tip, if true, would describe illegal activity does not mean that the police may make a <em>Terry </em>stop without meeting the reliability requirement.\u201d <em>J.L., </em>529 U.S. at 273 n. *, 120 S.Ct. at 1380 n. *. As in <em>J.L., </em>the tip in the present case lacks indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The majority in this case accepts the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion to disregard <em>J.L. </em>and to rely on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 725, 460 S.E.2d 610 (1995), to create some type of exception for guns. I believe that decision is not supportable. First, <em>Scott </em>was, in my view, wrongly decided, <em>see </em>20 Va.App. at 730-32, 460 S.E.2d at 613-14 (Benton, J., dissenting and noting that \u201c(t]he record in this case contains no basis upon which anyone could have determined that the invisible, unknown informant was reliable or had a basis to know anything other than the presence of the defendant, or someone similarly dressed, in the laundromat\u201d). Second, <em>Scott </em>was decided in 1995, five years before its similar facts were presented to the Supreme Court in <em>J.L. </em>Third, in cases involving the application of constitutional principles, the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2, does not allow state court decisions to trump decisions of the United States Supreme Court. <em>Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde, </em>514 U.S. 749, 750-51, 115 S.Ct. 1745, 1747-48, 131 L.Ed.2d 820 (1995); <em>Harper v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Taxation, </em>509 U.S. 86, 100, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 2519, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993); <em>Kesler v. Department of Public Safety, </em>369 U.S. 153, 172, 82 S.Ct. 807, 818, 7 L.Ed.2d 641 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">I would also note that the Commonwealth pursued, and the Supreme Court of Virginia rejected, an argument similar to that advanced in this case. <em>See Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 407, 551 S.E.2d 606 (2001). There, as here, \u201cthe Commonwealth does not expressly concede the applicability of the holding in <em>J.L. </em>to the facts of this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 551 S.E.2d at 609. There, as here, the Commonwealth argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>that the anonymous informant\u2019s tip about a gun provided a heightened justification to support a detention. <em>Id. </em>at 416, 551 S.E.2d at 611. Rejecting this Court\u2019s decision that the officer could use the tip as a basis for conducting a frisk for the officer\u2019s safety, <em>see Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 325, 334, 533 S.E.2d 18, 22 (2000), the Supreme Court reversed the conviction. The Court noted that the officer\u2019s detention of Harris was contrary to the ruling in <em>J.L. </em>and rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s argument as one that \u201cbootstraps the legitimate concern for law enforcement officers\u2019 safety, which permits a protective search of a legally detained suspect, to serve as the basis for detaining the suspect.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>262 Va. at 416, 551 S.E.2d at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The United States Supreme Court specifically rejected the type of firearm exception that the Commonwealth argued in <em>Harris </em>and in this case and that the majority opinion now resurrects from <em>Scott. </em>The Court unambiguously held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">[A]n automatic firearm exception to our established reliability analysis would rove too far. Such an exception would enable any person seeking to harass another to set in motion an intrusive, embarrassing police search of the targeted person simply by placing an anonymous call falsely reporting the target\u2019s unlawful carriage of a gun____ If police officers may properly conduct <em>Terry </em>frisks on the basis of bare-boned tips about guns, it would be reasonable to maintain under the above-cited decisions that the police should similarly have discretion to frisk based on bare-boned tips about narcotics. As we clarified when we made indicia of reliability critical in <em>Adams </em>and <em>White, </em>the Fourth Amendment is not so easily satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-9\"><em>J.L., </em>529 U.S. at 272-73, 120 S.Ct. at 1378-80 (citations omitted). These principles are equally applicable to a circumstance in which an anonymous informant says he observed the commission of an \u201copen and obvious illegality.\u201d Even in that circumstance, \u201c[i]f the telephone call is truly anonymous, the informant has not placed his credibility at risk and can lie with impunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 120 S.Ct. at 1381 (Kennedy, J., and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Rehnquist, C.J., concurring). In the absence of a \u201cverifiable explanation of how the informant came to know of the information in the tip,\u201d <em>Ramey v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 624, 631, 547 S.E.2d 519, 523 (2001), there still remains \u201ca second layer of inquiry respecting the reliability of the informant that cannot be pursued.\u201d <em>J.L., </em>529 U.S. at 275, 120 S.Ct. at 1381 (Kennedy, J., and Rehnquist, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The Supreme Court has unanimously rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cimminent danger\u201d exception for firearms, and the Court \u201cdemand[s]\u201d an <em>\u201cindicia of reliability </em>... <em>for a report of a person carrying a firearm.\u201d Id. </em>at 274, 120 S.Ct. at 1380 (emphasis added). Because this case is clearly controlled by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>J.L., </em>I would reverse the conviction. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
