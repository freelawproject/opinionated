Barron, Chief Reviser of Title 28 U.S. Code, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, in his article on \u201cThe Judicial Code 1948 Revision\u201d, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aen-dedup-0\">\u201cThere was no purpose on the part of the Revision staff to effect any change in existing law. Despite this, the process of comprehensively examining and rewriting the Code disclosed some grave disparities, inconsistencies and ambiguities not correctable by mere codification. This was due in part to forty years of piecemeal amendment to the 1911 Judicial Code. Some such problems had manifested themselves in difficult and not wholly satisfactory judicial interpretations. The Reviser and the Advisory Committee, upon discovering situations which would not yield to codification, felt in duty bound to apprise Congress of their findings and recommendations. Consequently, a few such changes, substantive in nature, were recommended to Congress. These were carefully outlined in the Reviser\u2019s Notes, and fully considered by the Judiciary Committees of both houses. * * *\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">\u201cBecause of the necessity of consolidating, simplifying and clarifying numerous component statutory enactments no changes of law or policy will be presumed from changes of language in revision unless an intent to make such changes is clearly expressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201cMere changes of phraseology indicate no intent to work a change of meaning but merely an effort to state in clear and simpler terms the original meaning of the statute revised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">\u201cCongress recognized this rule by including in its reports the complete Reviser\u2019s Notes to each section in which are noted all instances where change is intended and the reasons therefor.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The Reviser\u2019s Notes with respect to \u00a7 1400(b) read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">\u201cSubsection (b) is based on said section 109 of title 28 [U.S.C., 1940 ed.], with the following changes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">\u201cWords \u2018civil action\u2019 were substituted for \u2018suit,\u2019 and words \u2018in law or in equity,\u2019 after \u2018shall have jurisdiction\u2019 were deleted, in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">\u201cWords in subsection (b) \u2018where the defendant resides\u2019 were substituted for \u2018of which the defendant is an inhabitant.\u2019 A corresponding change was made in subsection (a).

Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 308 U.S. 165, 60 S.Ct. 153, 84 L.Ed. 167. The phrase in subsection (c), \u201cor is doing business,\u201d extends the philosophy of that case to the act of doing business.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">There is nothing in the Reviser\u2019s Notes to \u00a7 1391 indicating an intent to modify \u00a7 1400.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">At the hearings before Subcommittee No. 1 of the House Judiciary Committee, Honorable Albert B. Maris, United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, and a member of a committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States to collaborate with the Congressional committees in carrying forward the work of revising Title 28, in part stated: \u201cCare has been taken to make no changes in the existing laws which would not meet with substantially unanimous approval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">At the hearings before such Subcommittee No. 1, James William Moore, Professor of Law at Yale University and a special consultant on the revision of Title 28, stated: \u201cVenue provisions have not been altered by the revision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIgW\">An illustration of a plain statement of intention to make a substantive change, where such intention existed, is the Reviser\u2019s Notes to \u00a7 1398, wherein it is stated, \u201cThis section is completely rewritten to give effect to changes recommended by the Judicial Council of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">The principle of waiver announced in Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., supra, prior to the 1948 revision, was repeatedly held to be inapplicable to patent infringement cases. See Blaw-Knox Co. v. Lederle, 6 Cir., 151 F.2d 973; Bulldog Electric Products Co. v. Cole Electric Products Co., 2 Cir., 134 F.2d 545 and Carbide &amp; Carbon Chemicals Corp. v. United States Industrial Chemicals, Inc., 4 Cir., 140 F.2d 47, wherein it was held that 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 109 was the sole provision governing the venue of patent infringement litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">The patent venue statute, as construed in Stonite Products Co. v. Melvin Lloyd Co., 315 U.S. 561, 62 S.Ct. 780, 86 L.Ed. 1026, reflected a sound policy of long standing. It was based on considerations of practicality and convenience in such litigation. A patent infringement action involves a peculiar combination of science or technology and law. In the ascertainment of the pertinent technical facts, it is important that the trial judge have first-hand visual and audible knowledge of the conditions, the environment and the art itself and the testimony of the most competent witnesses. Practicality and convenience are best served when the case is prosecuted where the alleged acts of infringement occurred and the defendant has a regular and established place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">An intention on the part of Congress to depart from that policy should not be lightly inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">We conclude that it was not intended that \u00a7 1400 should be modified or complemented by \u00a7 1391(c); that \u00a7 1400 is the sole provision governing venue in patent cases; and that a corporate defendant may be sued only in a district of a state in which it is incorporated or a district wherein it has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The conclusion we have reached is supported by a considerable body of judicial opinion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-12\">. In its opinion the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">\u201cWe hold that Section 48 is the exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-14\">\u201cSection 48 is derived from the Act of March 3, 1897, c. 395, 29 Stat. 695, and its scope can best be determined from an examination of the reasons for its enactment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u201cSection 11 of the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat. 79, permitted civil suits to be brought in the federal courts against a person only in the district of which he was an inhabitant or in which he was found at the time of serving the writ. That section applied to suits for patent infringement. Chaffee v. Hayward, 20 How. 208, 216, 15 L.Ed. 804, 851; Allen v. Blunt, Fed.Cas. No.215, 1 Blatchf. 480. The Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, retained the provision allowing suit wliereever the defendant could be found. The abuses engendered by this extensive venue prompted the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 373, 24 Stat. 552, which, as amended by the Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866, 25 Stat. 433, permitted civil suits to be instituted only in the district of which the defendant was an inhabitant, except that in diversity jurisdiction cases suit could be started in the district of the plaintiff\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s residence. The substance of those provisions was reenacted as Section 51 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 112).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201cAfter the holding of In re Hohorst, 150 U.S. 653, 14 S.Ct. 221, 225, 37 L.Ed. 1211, that the Act of 1887 as amended did not apply to a suit against an alien or a foreign corporation, \u2018especially in a suit for the infringement of a patent right,\u2019 the lower federal courts became uncertain as to the applicability of the Act of 1887 to patent infringement proceedings. In explanation of Hohorst\u2019s case, it was said in In re Keasbey &amp; Mattison Co., 160 U.S. 221, 230, 16 S.Ct. 273, 275, 40 L.Ed. 402, that \u2018It was a suit for infringement of a patent right, exclusive jurisdiction of which had been granted to the circuit courts of the United States * * *; and was therefore not affected by general provisions regulating the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, concurrent with that of the several states.\u2019 Thereafter the lower federal courts for the most part took the position that the Act of 1887 as amended did not apply to suits for patent infringement, and that infringers could be sued wherever they could be found.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">\u201cThe Act of 1897 was adopted to define the exact jurisdiction of the federal courts in actions to enforce patent rights, and thus eliminate the uncertainty produced by the conflicting decisions on the applicability of the Act of 1887, as amended, to such litigation. That purpose indicates tht Congress did not intend the Act of 1897 to dovetail with the general provisions relating to the venue of civil suits, but rather that it alone should control venue in patent infringement proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\u201cSection 52 is derived from R.S. \u00a7 740, which in turn stems from the Act of May 4, 1858, e. 27, 11 Stat. 272, a general act intended to do away with the insertion of special provisions preserving state-wide venue in acts dividing a state into two or more judicial districts, and the Act of February 24, 1863, c. 54, \u00a7 9, 12 Stat. 662. Respondents insist that Section 52 applies to patent infringement suits because it antedates Section 48, excludes from its purview only suits of a local nature, and is consistent with and complementary to Section 48 since it deals with the problem of venue in the geographical sense rather than in terms of specified classes of litigation. We cannot agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">\u201cEven assuming that R.S. \u00a7 740 covered patent litigation prior to the Act of 1897, we do not think that its application survived that Act, which was intended to define the exact limits of venue in patent infringement suits. Furthermore, the Act of 1897 was a restrictive measure, limiting a prior, broader venue. General Electric Co. v. Marvel Rare Metals Co., 287 U.S. 430, 434-435, 53 S.Ct. 202, 204, 77 L.Ed. 408; Bowers v. Atlantic, G. &amp; P. Co., C.C., 104 F. 887; Cheatham Electric Switching Device Co. v. Transit Development Co., C.C., 191 F. 727. Thus there is little reason to assume that Congress intended to authorize suits in districts other than those mentioned in that Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-11\">.

Under this section as it was prior to the 1948 Judicial Code revision it was held without exception that the phrase \u201cthe judicial district where the defendant resides\u201d had reference to the state of incorporation of a corporate defendant charged with patent infringement. The question is whether the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1391(c) of the 1948 revision of the Judicial Code, which in substance provides that the place of incorporation, the place in which a corporation is licensed to do business or the place in which it is doing business, shall be regarded as the place of residence of a corporation for venue purposes has application to corporations charged with patent infringement. One line of cases holds that revised Section 1391(c) has no impact on Section 1400(b) and that it stands unimpaired as before with respect to patent infringement suits, while another line of cases holds that the term \u201cresides\u201d in Section 1400(b) is for the first time legislatively defined by Section 1391(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Judicial construction should be employed only when there is ambiguity or vagueness in language used. It has no place in the law with respect to language which is clear, unambiguous and logically leads to only one result. Section 1391(c) is general in its application. It applies to corporations without exception. It seems clear to me that it states in clear language that action against corporations without exception may be brought in districts in which they are licensed to do business. The defendant corporation in this case was licensed to do business in the district in which it was sued in this action. But, argues the majority and the cases holding with them, since under the decisions of the courts it had been held that a suit could be brought only in a state of incorporation, the conclusion must be that had Congress intended to change this interpretation it would have so provided in specific language. It is just as logical and more convincing to me that had Congress intended to exempt patent infringement corporate defendants from the effect of the clear language of Section 1391(c), it would, as pointed out by Judge Hall in his opinion in Farr Co. v. Gratiot, D.C.S.D.Cal.1950, 92 F.Supp. 320, 322, have provided \u201c \u2018except in patent litigation.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">When we seek support for our views in the legislative history of an act, it is not too difficult to find what we seek. It is pointed out that the revisor\u2019s notes are keyed to sections of the revision and point out each substantive change in the various sections. Reliance is placed on the fact that no reference is made to any substantive changes in Section 1400(b). But not all important changes were noted in the revisor\u2019s notes. Clearly an important change was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>in Section 1391(c), yet the revisor\u2019s notes do not call attention to this change.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">I can add nothing new to Judge Lind-ley\u2019s able dissenting opinion in C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co. v. Barnes, 7 Cir., 1952, 194 F.2d 410, 415, or to the logic of Judge Hall\u2019s opinion in Farr Co. v. Grat-iot, D.C.S.D.Cal.1950, 92 F.Supp. 320, or to the opinion of the Fifth Circuit in Dalton v. Shakespeare Co., 196 F.2d 469. Until the question is finally settled by the Supreme Court, I adhere to the views expressed in these cases and, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ahpt\">.
