It was there stated that the consideration for the annuity was paid by \u201cMr. Grav-is.\u201d This is consistent with the corrected printed record in the case. However, the original record discloses that the consideration for the annuity was paid by \u201cMrs. Gravis.\u201d The last paragraph of our original opinion, therefore, becomes inappropriate and inapplicable, and it is stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">\u25a0 This paragraph having been no part of the <em>ratio decidendi </em>and there being no merit in the motion for rehearing, the same is, therefore, Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
