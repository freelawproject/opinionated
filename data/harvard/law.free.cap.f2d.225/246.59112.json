The opposition arose in 1948 when applicant sought registration of that mark to include hair dressing cream and oil, body deodorant, and after-shave cologne, alleging use on those preparations since 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The opposition is predicated on the mark \u201cBreck\u2019s,\u201d first used and registered in 1931, for preparations for the treatment of the hair and scalp, and \u201cThe Breck Method,\u201d used since 1915 and registered in 1936, for hair and scalp preparations for dandruff, falling hair, and irritations of the scalp.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The applicant concedes that the opposer commenced use of its marks \u201cBreck\u201d and \u201cBreck\u2019s\u201d prior to the former\u2019s use of the mark \u201cBrisk;\u201d the parties agree the respective goods, nationally advertised and sold, are of the same descriptive properties; and further, that there is no evidence of any instance of actual confusion between the involved marks on the designated goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In sustaining the opposition, the Examiner of Interferences held that, while the marks had no similarity in meaning, they did have such a strong resemblance in both composition and sound that he was clearly of the opinion similarity in those respects was such that contemporaneous use on the specified goods would be reasonably likely to cause confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">In reversing the examiner, the Assistant Commissioner noted that although the marks \u201clook somewhat alike,\u201d a difference in the print type used resulted in a somewhat different appearance; that although there were some similarities in sound, the dissimilarities \u201cprobably outweigh them;\u201d and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cThe greatest dissimilarity is in the meaning or significance of the marks. \u2018Breck\u2019 originally was a surname which has acquired a secondary significance. \u2018Brisk\u2019 is an adjective meaning full of life; keenly alive or alert; sharp or keen to the senses; stimulating; freshly invigorating. As applied to applicant\u2019s products it has these suggestive qualities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">\u201cIt is believed that the impression created by applicant\u2019s mark \u2014 and the recollection of that impression by the purchasing public- \u2014 -is such as to distinguish the goods of applicant from those of opposer, * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">It is always difficult to determine with certainty the presence or absence of \u201ca likelihood of confusion\u201d in the mind of the average purchaser, and becomes extremely so in a case as close as this. That difficulty is well illustrated by the divergent opinions below. We intend no flattery when we say that both the Examiner of Interferences and Assistant Commissioner are individuals of recognized ability and with long experience in the trade-mark field; yet, on the same facts, opposite conclusions were reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">We have carefully reviewed the record and decisions below and are of the opinion the opposition should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">Obviously there is no similarity in the meaning of the two marks, but we think there is such similarity in the overall appearance and sound of the marks as to likely create doubt in the mind of the average purchaser when they are applied to identical goods. While it might well be true that a certain class of purchaser would note the difference in meaning of the marks, we have grave doubts that the average purchaser would attach sufficient importance thereto as to negate or overcome the impression created by their similarity in appearance and sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">As previously noted, the applicant concedes prior use of the marks \u201cBreck\u201d and \u201cBreck\u2019s\u201d on the involved goods. Where an applicant seeks to expand its mark to cover the same type of goods protected by an established mark, it should not be of such a nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>as to \u201clikely,\u201d as contemplated by the statute, create doubt in the mind of the public as to the source or origin of the respective goods. If it should be of that nature, as we think is the case here, any reasonable doubt should be resolved in favor of the established mark.</p>\n<p id=\"ady-dedup-0\">In view of the above it becomes necessary to reverse the decision appealed from,</p>\n<p id=\"Ats\">Reversed,</p>\n<p id=\"avs-dedup-0\">GARRETT and JOHNSON, Judges, dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-14\">.
