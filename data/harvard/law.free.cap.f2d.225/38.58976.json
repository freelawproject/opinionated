Capital Transit filed a third-party complaint against the District of Columbia, appellee here, alleging that the bus had collided with an automobile owned by the District and negligently operated by its agent. Ap-pellee moved for summary judgment, showing by affidavit that the car was being operated by a District policeman as part of his official duties. The District Court granted the motion, finding that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay,\u201d and expressly directing that judgment be entered for \u201cthe third-party defendant District of Columbia, upon the third-party complaint.\u201d Capital Transit appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-20\">The District of Columbia, appellee, urges that the appeal be dismissed because there has been no \u201cfinal decision\u201d from which an appeal can properly be taken. It points out that the appellant\u2019s claim against the District is for con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>tribution, on the theory that both parties are joint tortfeasors, and that only if appellant is ultimately held to be liable to Daisy Broadus will it have any claim against the District.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, it says, the order granting summary judgment is not an appealable \u201cfinal decision\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201cWhen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counter-claim, cross-claim, or <em>third-party claim, </em>the court may direct the entry of a final judgment upon one or more but less than all of the claims only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. * * *\u201d As amended Dec. 27, 1946, effective March 19, 1948; emphasis supplied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\"> The quoted Rule, we have said, \"is applicable'only in instances in which more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, and in which the claim upon which a final judgment is to be entered under the Rule is itself a claim distinct from the other claim or claims.\u201d Gold Seal Co. v. Weeks, 1954, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 249, 254, 209 F.2d 802, 807. In other words, notwithstanding Rule 54(b), there cannot be an appeal from-an order entered upon a part of an indivisible claim. Leonidakis v. International Telecoin Corp., 2 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 934; There must be \u201cmultiple claims of which at least one has been adjudicated.\u201d Pabellon v. Grace Line, 2 Cir., 1951, 191 F.2d 169, 174, certiorari denied Coston Supply Co. v. Pabellon, 1951, 342 U.S. 893, 72 S.Ct. 201, 96 L.Ed. 669. The question is thus \u201cwhether the underlying factual bases for recovery state a number of different claims which could have been separately enforced.\u201d Rieser v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co., 2 Cir., 224 F.2d 198.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Third-party complaints seeking indemnity or contribution have in -several instances been held to present a severable claim, capable of separate final adjudication under Rule 54 (b), Pabellon v. Grace Line, supra, or of trial separate from the principal complaint in the discretion of the District Court, Shippers Pre-Cooling Service v. Macks, 5 Cir., 1950, 181 F.2d 510, certiorari denied, 1950, 340 U.S. 816, 71 S.Ct. 45, 95 L.Ed. 599 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The case for severability in the present instance is strengthened by the fact that Capital Transit\u2019s third-party claim was disposed of on a point of law, namely, that the defendant municipal corporation was immune to suit. In an analogous situation, involving a counterclaim against the United States, Rule 54(b) was held applicable. Oyster Shell Products Corp. v. United States, 5 Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 1022. And see David v. District of Columbia, 1950, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 92, 187 F.2d 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-17\">Capital Transit\u2019s third-party claim that the District was negligent was thus properly held to be distinct from Daisy Broadus\u2019 claim that Capital Transit was negligent. The District Court made the necessary finding that there was \u201cno just reason for delay,\u201d and expressly directed judgment. While this is not conclusive upon us, Gold Seal Co. v. Weeks, supra; Flegenheimer v. General Mills, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>2 <em>Cir., 1951, 191 F.2d 237, we see no </em>reason to disturb the court\u2019s action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Turning to the merits of the appeal: it has long been settled that torts committed by officers and employees of the District of Columbia, in the exercise of governmental functions such as the operation of a police force, cannot be made the basis of liability in a suit against the District. See Wilson v. District of Columbia, 1949, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 28, 179 F.2d 44. Appellant urges that the doctrine of municipal immunity is obsolete and should be abolished. It also urges that the District is liable in this case by reason of the Owners\u2019 Financial Responsibility Act, D.C.Code \u00a7 40-403 (1951). The first of these complaints is one which we have said should not receive judicial correction, but should be addressed to Congress. See Wilson v. District of Columbia, supra, 86 U.S.App.D.C. at page 30, 179 F.2d at page 46. Cf. Calomeris v. District of Columbia, 96 U.S.App.D.C. -, 226 F.2d 266, decided July 21, 1955. The second contention is novel: it seems never before to have been raised in the two decades the Financial Responsibility Act was in effect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No doubt the chief reason the point has not been previously raised is because the statute contains the following definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-14\">\u201c \u2018Person\u2019 shall include individuals, partnerships, corporations, .receivers, referees, trustees, executors, and administrators; <em>and shall also include the owner of any motor vehicle as requisite, but shall not include the District of Columbia.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-15\">Though this provision seems rather in-artistically drafted, its purpose could only have been to exclude the District of Columbia from liability as an \u201cowner\u201d under the broad wording of the operative sections of the Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nothing in the Act or the legislative history serves to contradict that purpose, or to indicate any intention on the part of Congress to subject the District (for the first time) to liability for injuries inflicted by its vehicles in the course of carrying out a governmental function.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that appellant\u2019s third-party complaint was not maintainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-16\">The judgment of the District Court will accordingly be</p>\n<p id=\"b87-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AYa\">.

Weeks, 93 U.S.App.D.C. at page 256 et seq., 209 F.2d at page 808 et seq. As to the cause of action presented in the Rieser case the Second Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-14\">\u201cFar from being merely an action by a bond-obligee on his bond, it is actually that of a corporation\u2019s judgment creditors -who are suing in the right of the corporation to seek redress for a series of torts alleged to have been committed by the defendant against their debtor. This seems to us clearly a case of multiple claims, -where [the court] could enter final judgment upon making the appropriate determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AcH\">.

We recognize, of course, that as to some aspects of Rule 54(b) the Circuit Courts are in conflict. See Mackey v.
