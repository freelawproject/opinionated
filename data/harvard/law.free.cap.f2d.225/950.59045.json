Section 1006 (a) of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, as amended,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> authorizes a court of appeals to review an order of the Board upon petition of \u201cany person disclosing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>substantial interest in such order.\u201d Appellant says his responsibility for enforcement of statutory safety provisions and Board regulations gives him this \u201csubstantial interest\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 created the Civil Aeronautics Authority, consisting of five members,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and empowered it to make and enforce safety regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Act also provided that \u201cThere shall be in the Authority an Administrator\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and directed him to \u201ccooperate with the Authority in the administration and enforcement of this Act\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Authority named him \u201cSupervisor for the Authority\u201d and delegated to him \"\u201csupervisory administrative powers over the Bureau of Safety Regulation\u201d, whose attorneys, employees of the Authority, prosecuted suspension proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">In 1940, Reorganization Plan No. Ill transferred from the Civil Aeronautics Authority to the Administrator, whom it renamed Administrator of Civil Aeronautics, the \u201cfunctions of aircraft registration and of safety regulation described in Titles V and VI of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, except the functions of prescribing safety standards, rules, and regulations and of suspending and revoking certificates after hearing * * <footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Reorganization Plan No. IV changed the name Civil Aeronautics Authority to Civil Aeronautics Board, transferred the Board for housekeeping purposes to the Department of Commerce, placed the Administrator \u201cunder the direction and supervision of the Secretary of Commerce\u201d, and provided that the \u201cAdministrator of Civil Aeronautics * * * and the Civil Aeronautics Board * * * shall constitute the Civil Aeronautics Authority within the Department of Commerce.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"alr-dedup-0\">Nothing in the Reorganization Plans diluted the control of the Board, formerly the Authority, over suspension proceedings, or changed the function of the Administrator in such proceedings. His function continued to be like that of administrative prosecutors in other agencies. His only interest, like that of the Board, in suspension proceedings is in promoting air safety by enforcing the Civil Aeronautics Act. Final decision regarding suspension for violation of regulations continues to rest with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-19\"> We think it follows that the Administrator is not what the Act means by \u201cany person disclosing a substantial interest\u201d in the Board\u2019s order, and lacks standing to petition for review. The right to review of agency action is usually restricted to persons whom the agency regulates and affects adversely.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When one government agency has been found to have standing to seek review of another government agency\u2019s action, the two agencies have had different interests, e. g., when the government as shipper or consumer challenges an administrative rate order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have found no case in which agency action has been reviewed on the application of an official whose function is to prosecute claims in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>and for the same agency,.. We think the purpose of the present review provision was not to permit litigation between the Administrator and the Board but to allow relief to persons aggrieved by the Board\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b996-26\">. 52 Stat. 1024, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 646.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b997-8\">. 52 Stat. 980, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 421(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b997-9\">.

The Board must exercise its adjudicatory functions independently of the Secretary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The legislative history of the Plans emphasizes the clarity of the texts. In safety enforcement actions, if the Administrator seeks a suspension or a revocation of a safety certificate, he files a complaint with the Board. The complaint is in his own name. The regulations provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-7\"><em>\u201cWho may initiate proceedings </em>\u2014(a) <em>Administrator or applicant for airman certificate. A </em>proceeding for suspension or revocation of a certificate may be initiated by the Administrator' of Civil Aeronautics as Complainant by filing a complaint with the Board.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">The matter proceeds exactly as if it were initiated by some other complainant. The Board acts on the matter as a quasi-judicial body, upon the issues and the evidence presented to it by the parties. Thus the Administrator is in the proceeding as a party, in his own name and his own separate Official capacity. He is not like the enforcement staff in the usual administrative agency proceeding, or even like the General Counsel to the National Labor Relations Board, who brings complaints on behalf of the Board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Administrator .thus has an individual responsibility to carry, as is clearly indicated by the Reorganization Plans. It is a responsibility in the public interest. It is not too different from the official responsibility of the Postmaster General in respect to ail mail pay proceedings before the Board. We held him to be a party in interest in such proceedings and allowed him to seek review,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court affirmed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-18\">It seems to me clear that the duly authorized complainant in an adjudicatory proceeding before a quasi-judicial board has a \u201csubstantial interest\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in the matter. If he has enough interest to be the official complainant in an adjudicatory proceeding, he has enough interest to seek review of the decision in that same proceeding: It follows that, in my opinion, the Administrator has a standing to petition for judicial review in the proceeding at bar. I would not dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-19\">On the merits of the controversy I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-20\">Two airplane pilots were involved in an accident. The Civil Aeronautics. Board investigated and called upon the pilots to testify. They claimed the privilege of the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment and of the' Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The hearing officer directed them to testify; they complied. A complaint seeking suspension of their certificates was filed. The Board held it could not suspend, because the statute forbids it, the' men having been compelled to testify*' against themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>The suspension of these pilots would be a forfeiture of a privilege, even if not of a right. The immunity statute<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> extends to forfeitures as well as to penalties. The question, then, is whether the proceeding is punitive or merely remedial. In this connection we go to the Fifth Amendment cases. Any reading of the complaint shows the action prayed is purely punitive. The complaint says baldly that the men were careless and therefore ought to be suspended. It does not allege the pilots to be unqualified. I think they were protected by reason of their testimony taken in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">In substance the result I reach is the same as that reached by the court. The court dismisses the petition and so leaves the Board\u2019s order intact. I would take jurisdiction and affirm the order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b998-11\">. 54 Stat. 1231.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b998-12\">. 54 Stat. 1234.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b998-13\">.
