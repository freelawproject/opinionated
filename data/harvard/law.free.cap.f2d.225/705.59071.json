This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">Reduced to its simplest terms, the claim stated by the plaintiff in his amended complaint is that while he was in the hospital and under an anaesthetic for a prescribed' and scheduled operation upon his left leg and hip, to which he had consented, a Government surgeon, without the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge or consent, performed an unnecessary and uncalled-for operation on his right leg and hip.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-16\">Of this claim, the District Court said, at page 276 of 118 F.Supp.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-17\">\u201cThe act of the surgeon in performing the operation without the consent of. plaintiff constituted an assault and battery under Minnesota law. Mohr v. Williams, 95 Minn. 261, 104 N.W. 12, 1 L.R.A.,N.S., 439. It was there held that a surgeon who performs an operation without the consent of the patient is liable for assault and battery regardless of lack of intent or negligence on his part. Such result is not peculiar to this jurisdiction but is the general rule. See Bonner v. Moran, 75 U.S. App.D.C. 156, 126 F.2d 121, 139 A.L.R. 1366; Wall v. Brim, 5 Cir., 138 F.2d 478.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-19\">This, we think, is an accurate statement of the law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-20\">There is no occasion for repeating or paraphrasing the opinion of the District Court, which we think has clearly demonstrated that the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the Government is, under applicable law, one arising out of an assault and battery, of which the court had no jurisdiction under the Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>At the time this case was argued, the Government was contending that, even if the court had jurisdiction of the claim, the sole recourse of the plaintiff against the Government was under 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 501a allowing compensation for injuries suffered by a veteran during hospitalization. That contention has since been decided adversely to the Government by the Supreme Court in United States v. Brown, 348 U.S. 110, 75 S.Ct. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-10\">. \u201c2680.
