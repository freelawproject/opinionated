On July 2, counsel for appellant deposited the notice of appeal in the mails. The clerk of court received the notice on July 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-24\">Rule 73(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., .requires that notice be <em>filed </em>within thirty days of the entry of judgment. Here, only the act of depositing the notice in the mails occurred within thirty days. This is not a filing; only when the clerk acquires custody has it been filed. Casalduc v. Diaz, 1 Cir., 1941, 117 F.2d 915; Lejeune v. Midwestern Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 149; see also Gradsky v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 1954, 218 F.2d 703. Since the notice of appeal is jurisdictional, the motion to dismiss must be granted. Marten v. Hess, 6 Cir., 1949, 176 F.2d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-25\">It is, accordingly, ordered that the appeal in the above case be and the same is hereby dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
