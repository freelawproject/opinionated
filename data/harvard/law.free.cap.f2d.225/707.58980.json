Inter alia, is the contention that the special inquiry officer applied the wrong burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>The special inquiry officer\u2019s burden of proof as stated by him is: \u201cThe rule is that the proof of alleged citizenship must be clear and convincing, Lee Sim v. United States, 2 Cir., 1918, 218 F. 432, 435; Ex parte Chin Him, D.C. W.D.N.Y.1915, 227 F. [131] 133. Since I find the evidence presented in support of the applicant\u2019s cause to be neither satisfactory, nor clear, nor convincing, he has not sustained his burden of proof and his application for admission should be denied. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The special inquiry officer\u2019s decision if in favor of the applicant is final, the Immigration Service having no right to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1226(c). If adverse to the applicant he may appeal, \u00a7 1226 (b), and make an oral argument on the legality of the special inquiry officer\u2019s decision, \u00a7 6.1(e) of Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">\u201c(e) <em>Oral argument. </em>Oral argument shall be heard by the Board upon request, in any case over which the Board acquires jurisdiction by appeal or certification as provided in this part. If an appeal has been taken, request for oral argument if desired shall be included in the Notice of Appeal. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">That the wrong burden of proof was applied was held in Mar Gong v. Brownell, 9 Cir., 209 F.2d 448, a decision before the instant decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals. We there held, 209 F.2d at page 453, that \u201cno special quantum of proof should be exacted from any person claiming American citizenship merely because of his racial origin. In Kwock Jan Fat v. White, 253 U.S. 454, 464, 40 S.Ct. 566, 570, 64 L.Ed. 1010, the Supreme Court, reversing this court, said: \u2018It is better that many Chinese immigrants should be improperly admitted than that one natural born citizen of the United States should be permanently excluded from his country.\u2019 \u201d This is followed by our similar holding in Ly Shew v. Dulles, 9 Cir., 219 F.2d 413, 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">Although much of the testimony was viva voce and heard by the special inquiry officer, the Board treated the hearing of the appeal as a trial de novo and reappraised the evidence adversely to appellant. Instead, it should have returned the case to the special inquiry officer who heard these witnesses for his appraisal of the evidence applying the ordinary burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">Appellant further contends that because in an administrative proceeding to procure a passport before the United States Consul General in Canton, China, the question was raised as to his citizenship and decided by the Consul in his favor and the passport issued, the burden is on the Immigration authorities to show he is not a citizen by clear and convincing evidence. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 provides that \u201cWhenever any person * * * makes application for admission * * * <em>the burden of proof shall be upon such person </em>to establish that he * * * is not subject to exclusion under any provision of this chapter * * 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1361. Ng Yip Yee was excluded under \u00a7\u00a7 1181(a) (1), 1182(a) (20) of the same chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">Appellant also contends that the special inquiry officer showed prejudice by his statements concerning the large number of claims proved fraudulent in Chinese citizen cases, and that he adversely overvalued mere minor inconsistencies in the testimony. We have no doubt that on the hearing the special inquiry officer will consider what we have held on these contentions in Mar Gong v. Dulles, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-13\">The decision is reversed, the appellant is entitled to a rehearing before the special inquiry officer, the latter ordered to grant it and the writ of habeas corpus is granted for that purpose.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
