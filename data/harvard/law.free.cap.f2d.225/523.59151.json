Fleming and Paul V. McNutt, a partnership doing business as Anthony Wayne Broadcasting; and Radio Fort Wayne, Inc., applied to the Federal Communications Commission for the same television channel at Fort Wayne, Indiana. After a consolidated hearing of the two applications, the trial examiner recommended the Anthony Wayne partnership for the grant. The Commission, however, reversed this initial decision and made the grant to Radio Wayne.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">The Commission agreed with the examiner that each of the parties was legally, financially and technically qualified to construct and operate its proposed station. It concluded that there were no significant differences between the engineering proposals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No preference was given either applicant on the issue of diversification of control of the media of mass communication. Radio Wayne\u2019s ownership of a television station and three standard broadcast stations in Indiana communities (including one in Fort Wayne) was found to be balanced by Anthony Wayne\u2019s control of the Journal-Gazette, a local daily morning newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">Anthony Wayne was accorded a preference over Radio Wayne in two important respects: (1) it offered a superior programming service, primarily because it made provision for the production of programs outside its studios; (2) it was more likely to effectuate'day-to-day program proposals because (a) the partners\u2019 extensive participation in local affairs indicated that their proposals to meet local needs would be fulfilled; (b) ownership and management by the partnership would be more closely integrated; and (c) Radio Wayne had failed to carry out programming proposals made in connection with its acquisition and operation of standard broadcast station WANE in Fort Wayne. Accordingly, the Commission found it \u201cclear that [Anthony Wayne] can be more fully relied upon to provide a service adequately meeting the needs of the Fort Wayne area than can Radio Wayne.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-15\">The Commission believed, however, that this superiority of the Anthony Wayne partnership was outweighed by the acquiescence of the individual partners, as Journal-Gazette stockholders, \u201cin certain advertising practices\u201d which were deemed \u201ccontrary to the public interest.\u201d This consideration controlled the Commission\u2019s decision in favor of Radio Wayne.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-16\">Briefly these are the salient facts concerning the advertising practices. Mr. McNutt and Mr. Fleming were minority stockholders in the morning Journal-Gazette Company. Together with another stockholder, they had power to control this company by virtue of a 1949 voting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>trust agreement. In 1950, the Journal-Gazette entered into an agreement to consolidate its mechanical and business operations with the News Publishing Company, which owns and operates the News Sentinel, an evening paper in Fort Wayne. Under this agreement, management and control of these operations was transferred to Fort Wayne Newspapers, Inc., a corporation created for that purpose. The Journal-Gazette received a one-third interest and elected one director in the consolidated company, while the considerably larger News Sentinel received a two-thirds interest and elected the other two directors. The consolidation was justified, in the Commission\u2019s view, because it was prompted by the desire to provide a \u201cmore economical operation,\u201d and did not eliminate \u201cdiversity in editorial opinion in Fort Wayne.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AbiM\">What the Commission disapproved\u2014 and the only thing it disapproved \u2014 was the institution of joint advertising rates by the newly created company. It found this practice reflected seriously on the comparative qualifications of the Anthony Wayne partners.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under this practice, classified and national advertising is not sold for either the morning or evening paper separately, but is accepted only as a unit for both papers on the basis of their combined daily circulation. Though it was agreed that \u201cMessrs. McNutt and Fleming cannot dictate the advertising practices of the agency corporation,\u201d the Commission pointed out that they were able to control the Journal-Gazette\u2019s \u201cattitude\u201d toward these practices. Responsibility \u201cmust be imputed to them,\u201d it said, in view of their \u201cannounced intention not to take steps to bring about the abandonment of these practices * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Anthony Wayne brought this appeal. Before the appeal was argued, however, Mr. McNutt died. The Commission made the following response to the statement filed in this court suggesting his death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8rl\">\u201cthat in the event this Court should reverse the Commission\u2019s decision herein, the question of the effect of the death of Paul V. McNutt during the pendency of this appeal is one which the Commission will have to decide upon any remand by this Court. This statement is made for the purpose of setting forth our position that the continuation of the appeal proceedings does not affect the right of the Commission, in the event of a remand, to make a determination as to the effect of the death of Paul V. McNutt on the status of appellants under the law of the State of Indiana and other applicable law and Commission policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">In supplemental briefs filed pursuant to our request, all the parties urge that we dispose of the appeal on the present record. They oppose a remand to the Commission, before our review, for its determination of the effect of Mr. McNutt\u2019s death on its decision. The Commission re-asserts that such a determination would be required only if we reverse upon the present record. We are impelled, however, by the particular circumstances of this case to remand before review of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">As we have indicated, any decision on the present record must turn on the question whether the Commission erred in giving controlling weight to the partnership\u2019s attitude toward and acquiescence in the imposition of a joint rate on advertisers. Clearly this consideration de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>pended, in substantial part, upon the mental state and conduct of a person who has since died. The present record does not and could not include a determination of the effect of his death since this crucial circumstance occurred after the record closed. The Commission recognizes that the death of Mr. McNutt would be relevant to reconsideration of the case if we should reverse. We see no reason why it is not relevant now and why we should not have the benefit of its determination before deciding whether to reverse or affirm. Accordingly, the case is remanded to the Commission with directions to reopen the record to the extent necessary to determine the effect of Mr. McNutt\u2019s death and with authority to revise its decision on appeal here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Intervenor Radio Wayne claims that, unless this case is reversed, we lack power to remand with directions to reopen the record. It is true that the Communications Act, unlike some statutes governing administrative agencies,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> confers no specific authority for remand without reversal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But it is not unusual for an appellate body to \u201cremand causes for further proceedings without deciding the merits * * Ford Motor Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 1939, 305 U.S. 364, 373, 59 S.Ct. 301, 306, 83 L.Ed. 221.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the Ford case, after appellate jurisdiction attached, the cause was returned, on petition of the Labor Board, so that the agency might make essential findings prior to a judicial decision. The Supreme Court\u2019s view that such a procedure was proper rested not only on a statutory provision authorizing remand<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but also on the general equity powers which a court exercises in reviewing administrative action. Upon such a review, a court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-13\">\u201cmay adjust its relief to the exigencies of the case in accordance with the equitable principles governing judicial action. The purpose of the judicial review is consonant with that of the administrative proceeding itself, \u2014 to secure a just result with a minimum of technical requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">These principles are not limited to cases in which an agency has made inadequate findings. They extend to cases where, even without fault of the agency, the state of the record may preclude a \u201cjust result.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The failure of this record to deal with Mr. McNutt\u2019s death may have that effect, even if we assume, without deciding, that the record is adequate in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-15\">Remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-11\">. This was also the trial examiner\u2019s holding, to which Anthony Wayne did not except. The partnership\u2019s proposal for a higher- antenna and greater power than Radio Wayne did not warrant a preference, according to the Commission, because its effect upon \u201cpopulations and areas to be served is speculative and cannot be substantiated in the present state of the art.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-18\">. \u201cIn no other area of comparison,\u201d the Commission said, \u201chave we been able to discern significant difference between the parties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-5\">.

Though this practice, deemed contrary to the public interest, was the decisive factor here in the rejection of Anthony Wayne, it did not bar renewal of the license of a standard AM broadcast station owned by the News Sentinel, which has a two-thirds interest in Port Wayne Newspapers, Inc. In explanation of the apparent disparate treatment of the issue, the Commission observed \u201cthat the question before the Commission at the time we considered the renewal application was whether the applicant met minimum qualifications, not its superiority over an applicant competing for the same facilities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b572-5\">.
