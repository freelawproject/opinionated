After verdict, appellant\u2019s able counsel, experienced in criminal law, filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. Thereupon, he filed a notice of appeal, which was not prosecuted but was subsequently dismissed on motion in this court. Thereafter, appellant filed a motion to vacate judgment, and upon denial thereof by the district court, was permitted to appeal in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-18\">On appeal, appellant contends that venue was not established, since it was not clearly shown that a sale or purchase of the drug was made within the District, and that merely finding a person in possession of narcotics does not, under the above mentioned statute, establish venue. The rule is to the contrary. Possession raises a presumption of illegal purchase and, accordingly, of venue. Casey v. United States, 276 U.S. 413, 48 S.Ct. 373, 72 L.Ed. 632; Anderson v. United States, 6 Cir., 189 F.2d 202. There was no satisfactory explanation made to the jury of appellant\u2019s possession of the narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-19\">The order of the district court denying appellant\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
