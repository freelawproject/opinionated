From this conviction, Walker appeals on the ground that the District Court erred in overruling his motion to suppress and his objections to admitting evidence so obtained. This appeal presents the question whether Walker\u2019s barn is afforded the protection of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution and whether this protection is destroyed under the claim of the officers that they had probable cause for making the search without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">An agent for the Internal Revenue Bureau was informed at his office in Birmingham that, \u201cthere might be something on the Clyde Walker place\u201d. This information was from an anonymous source and the agent could not recall when it came or whether it was in the form of a letter or a telephone call. Due to the vague and suspicious nature of the message and the large number of unreliable anonymous messages received by him, the agent doubted its credibility and so testified. Sometime after receipt of the message, however, the agent went, in company with one other federal agent and three state and local officers, to appellant\u2019s farm to \u201clook around\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">Walker\u2019s house, barn and other outhouses lay approximately one mile from the public road and access to them and to his farm could be had only by a private road. While on the private road about one-fourth mile from the Walker house, two of the local officers left the automobile with instructions to circle the farm through the woods and look for possible distilling activities. The other officers drove on to the house. Appellant\u2019s barn was seventy to eighty yards from his house, separated therefrom by his private driveway, and was surrounded by a fence with a gap allowing entrance into the barnyard from the private driveway in front of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-16\">Upon arriving at the circular driveway in front of appellant\u2019s house, the federal agent and one local officer entered the barnyard through the gap which was open at that time. They had seen appellant working on his tractor at the rear of the house and some distance away from the house and the barn. Appellant waved to them and said, \u201cHi\u201d. As the officers approached to within about thirty feet of the barn, they noticed a black garden hose running from the barn, became aware of the odor of cooking mash, and heard a metallic thump and the sound of running footsteps inside the barn. On such perception, the officers entered the barn where they found a still in operation, complete except for the capper which had been knocked off, several barrels of mash, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>twelve gallons of whiskey and a man named Johney Nunnally whom they arrested. The officers could not see inside the barn until they had opened the door and had entered that portion of the barn in which the distilling equipment was found. At the completion of the search, appellant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Upon this evidence supplied by the various federal, state and local officers, introduced over his motion to suppress and his objection, appellant was convicted. He contends that the evidence was illegally obtained by agents of the federal government in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and that it should have been excluded. The Government contends that the barn was not a part of appellant\u2019s curtilage and that, even if it was, the agents had the right to make the search on the ground that they had probable cause to make the search without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The barn here searched was a domestic building constituting an integral part of that group of structures making up the farm home. Every case must be decided upon its own peculiar <em>facts</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>and we hold that, under the facts here, this barn was a part of the curtilage. In Taylor v. United States, 1931, 286 U.S. 1, 52 S.Ct. 466, 76 L.Ed. 951, the house searched was a metal garage adjacent to the dwelling house; in Roberson v. United States, 6 Cir., 1948, 165 F.2d 752, the search was of a smokehouse; and in Walker v. United States, 5 Cir., 1942, 125 F.2d 395, 396, the search was of a shed consisting of a chicken house and garage, which stood fifty to sixty feet from the dwelling house; in each instance it was considered that the curtilage was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In the Walker case the federal agents had found sacks of dry mash near the premises several days before the search and had smelled the odor of mash coming from the shed. After several days of waiting and watching without developments they came onto the premises announcing, \u201c \u2018We have come for your still in that shed\u2019 \u201d. The officers entered the enclosure in which the shed was situated and then entered the shed, where they found a still, mash and jugs of whiskey. We held that the search was of the residence, was illegal and that the evidence obtained thereby should have been suppressed. On the basis of these authorities we hold that appellant\u2019s barn was a part of the curtilage.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">But it is plain that the search cannot be justified on any basis. The Fourth Amendment insures \u201cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures * * -:&lt;\u25a0\u00bb_ The Amendment further provides that no warrants shall issue, \u201cbut upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized\u201d. The language of the Amendment is plain and its meaning clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">In Johnson v. United States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, the Supreme Court quotes from an older case these words: \u201c \u2018It would not be possible to add to the emphasis with which the framers of our Constitution and this Court * * * have declared the importance to political liberty and to the welfare of our country of the due observance of the rights guaranteed under the Constitution by these two [Fourth and Fifth] Amendments. The effect of the decisions cited is * * * that they [such rights] are to be regarded as of the very essence of constitutional liberty; and * * * that these amendments should receive a liberal construction, so as to prevent stealthy encroachment upon or \u201cgradual depreciation\u201d of the rights secured by them, by imperceptible practice of courts or by well-intentioned, but mistakenly overzealous executive officers\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">In the same case Mr. Justice Jackson outlines the judicially created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d under which search without a warrant may be made without being condemned as an unreasonable search. These are limited to search as an incident to arrest, search of a movable vehicle and search which may be justified under rare circumstances to prevent threatened destruction or removal of contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">None of these exceptional circumstances are present here. The arrest of appellant followed and did not precede the search and was based upon the result of the illegal search. We are therefore not required to explore the controversy in progress between members of the Supreme Court as to the search which may attend a legal arrest<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. No vehicle is involved and no' removal of the contraband was possible, the ofiicers being present and able to place guards at all exits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The Government takes the novel position that its ofiicers had a perfect right to enter the barn and make a search solely because it claims that, based on the evidence above outlined, they had probable cause to believe that intoxicating liquors were being manufactured inside the barn. That contention is refuted by a number of recent Supreme Court decisions <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> where searches were held illegal even though the officers had grounds fully as good as those claimed here. The Johnson opinion further furnishes a sufficient answer to the Government\u2019s contention<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; and the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20 at page 32, 46 S.Ct. 4, 6, 70 L.Ed. 145, is also directly in point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-13\">\u201cThe search of a private dwelling without a warrant is in itself unreasonable and abhorrent to our laws. * * * Save on certain cases as incident to arrest, there is no sanction in the decisions of the courts, federal or state, for the search of a private dwelling house without a warrant. * * * Belief, however well founded, that an article sought is concealed in a dwelling house, furnishes no jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>tification for search of that place without a warrant. And such searches are held unlawful notwithstanding facts unquestionably showing probable cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The search and seizure here were unreasonable and in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the motion to suppress the evidence should have been sustained, and the evidence should have been excluded. Because the court below committed error in ruling against appellant in both instances, its judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">RIVES, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\">.

Any assumption that evidence sufficient to support a magistrate\u2019s disinterested determination to issue a search warrant will justify the officers in making a search without a warrant would reduce the Amendment to a nullity and leave the people\u2019s homes secure only in the discretion of police officers. * * * When the right of privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not by a policeman or Government enforcement agent.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b497-9\">RIVES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"aby-dedup-0\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"AIg\">I respectfully dissent. This decision seems to me to be a serious blow to efficient law enforcement not required by the Fourth Amendment. The search and seizure, I think, were reasonable as incidental to the arrest of appellant, and if not, then most certainly as incidental to the arrest of his co-defendant, Johney Nunnally.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-24\">Before entering upon the appellant\u2019s premises, the officers had no information that there was a still in his barn, and hence they had no intention of searching the barn, but were headed direct for a search of the woods.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When within 30 to 60 feet of the barn, Officers Boone and Ferguson smelled the distinctive odor<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of cooking mash (R. 25, 54), saw the black garden hose running beneath the edge of the barn, heard noises \u201clike a can or drum hit the ground\u201d and \u201ca noise that sounded like somebody running\u201d (R. 25). Boone and Ferguson immediately turned and ran to the barn (R. 54, 136), but before they could effect a capture, one man escaped. (R. pp. 42, 83, 103). Promptly upon entering the barn, the officers placed appellant\u2019s co-defendant, Johney Nunnally under arrest (R. 104). They later found Fred Walker, appellant\u2019s brother, hiding in a corn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>crib in the barn (R. 97, 149), but did not arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Appellant and Johney Nunnally were jointly indicted in four counts, each charging the commission of a felony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cCount One: Possession of unregistered still, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2810.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">\u201cCount Two: Carrying on business of distiller without bond, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2833.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">\u201cCount Three: Making mash, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2834.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201cCount Four: Possession of 12 gallons of unstamped whiskey, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2803 (R. 1-2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">In the district court, appellant brought out the fact that Johney Nunnally had pleaded guilty. (R. 104, 150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The district court, after a full and fair hearing, overruled the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, and in so doing made a finding of some facts, which finding is fully sustained by the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">The Fourth Amendment protects \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, <em>houses, </em>papers, and effects, against <em>unreasonable </em>searches and seizures\u201d (emphasis supplied). It is settled that \u201chouses\u201d includes not only dwellings but offices and places of business. Gouled v. United States, 255 U.S. 298, 305, 41 S.Ct. 261, 65 L.Ed. 647. On the other hand, as said by Mr. Justice Holmes in Hester v. United States, 265 U.S. 57, 59, 44 S.Ct. 445, 446, 68 L.Ed. 898 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-18\">\u201c * * * the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people in their \u2018persons, houses, papers and effects,\u2019 is not extended to the open fields. The distinction between the latter and the house is as old as the common law. 4 Bl. Comm. 223, 225, 226.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-19\">See, also, Edwards v. United States, 10 Cir., 206 F.2d 855, 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-20\">In the same opinion, Mr. Justice Holmes further observed, \u201cIt is obvious that even if there had been a trespass, the above testimony was not obtained by an illegal search or seizure.\u201d 265 U.S. at page 58, 44 S.Ct. at page 446. As said by the Fourth Circuit in Janney v. United States, 206 F.2d 601, 604, \u201cThe fact that the officers were trespassers on the defendant\u2019s property was thought to be immaterial.\u201d In Koth v. United States, 16 F.2d 59, 61, the Ninth Circuit said: \u201cThe fact that the officers may have been trespassers does not exclude the evidence after what they saw, heard and smelled.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In United States v. Rogato, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>D.C.M.D.Pa., 39 F.2d 171, 175, the Court said: \u201cNor does the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment extend to the open driveways on each side of the building, or the open space in the rear of the building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Neither the Supreme Court nor any Federal Court of Appeals has ever held that the word \u201chouses\u201d includes open land even within the curtilage of a dwelling. The state courts of Kentucky and of Mississippi, which have held that the land within the curtilage is protected, based their decisions on the word \u201cpossessions\u201d appearing in the Constitutions of those States,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but not contained in the Fourth Amendment. It will be observed that in the Supreme Court ease of Hester v. United States, supra, the officers were concealed prior to the search only 50 to 100 yards from the dwelling. In Martin v. United States, 5 Cir., 155 F.2d 503, 505, Judge Lee speaking for this Court said: \u201cEnclosed or unenclosed grounds or open fields around their houses are not included in the prohibition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Under the facts of this case, I doubt the correctness of the holding that, \u201cthis barn was a part of the curtilage,\u201d but I am not convinced that the \u201ccurtilage\u201d test is the right one. It would imply protection to the open spaces of the lot, and such an extreme position cannot soundly be maintained. It would imply, also, that buildings outside the curtilage are <em>not </em>within the protection of the Fourth Amendment, and, while I am aware of cases so holding,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I can see no reason why a farmer should be afforded less protection in the barn where he actually does business, whether located within the curtilage or not, than is accorded a city dweller in his office. A more accurate statement of the rule, I think, was made by the Fourth Circuit in the recent case of Janney v. United States, supra, 206 F.2d at page 603:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUf\">\u201cWe bear in mind that the protection of the Amendment extends not only to the dwelling house of a defendant but also to the structures used by him in connection with his home or his place of business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A38\">While I thus disagree with the \u201ccurti-lage\u201d test employed by my brothers, I am in accord with their conclusion that appellant\u2019s barn was afforded the protection of the Fourth Amendment. When, however, it comes to a question of degree, of \u201cwhen the right of privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search\u201d,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it seems to me that any attempt to equate a man\u2019s barn with his dwelling must lower the dignity of the latter, and that his home more appropriately meets the description of his castle, of his cottage into which even the King\u2019s men may not enter. In United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 64, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653, the Supreme Court recognized that even though a structure came within the protection of the Amendment, the character of the place was properly to be considered in determining whether the search was reasonable. In our own recent case of Drayton v. United States, 205 F.2d 35, 36, this Court recognized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">\u201cAlthough stricter requirements of reasonableness may apply where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>a dwelling is being searched, compare Davis v. United States, 328 U.S. 582, (592), 66 S.Ct. 1256, 90 L.Ed. 1453; Matthews v. Correa, 2 Cir., 135 F.2d 534, 537, * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgGi\">That language appears to have been taken directly from Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145, 151, footnote 15, 67 S.Ct. 1098, 91 L.Ed. 1399.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">From my brothers' conclusion that the search was an <em>\u201cunreasonable\u201d </em>one, I respectfully but vigorously dissent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">\u201cWhat is a reasonable search is not to be determined by- any fixed formula. The Constitution does not define what are \u2018unreasonable\u2019searches and, regrettably, in our discipline we have no ready litmus-paper test. The recurring questions of the reasonableness of searches must find resolution in the facts and circumstances of each case. Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. 344, 357, 51 S.Ct. 153, 158, 75 L.Ed 374. Reasonableness is in the first instance for the District Court to determine.\u201d United States v. Rabinowitz, supra, 339 U.S. at page 63, 70 S.Ct. at page 434.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">That case overruled Trupiano v. United States, 334 U.S. 699, 68 S.Ct. 1229, 92 L.Ed. 1663, to the extent that Trupi-ano required a search warrant <em>solely </em>upon the basis of the practicability of procuring it, but we held in Rent v. United States, 5 Cir., 209 F.2d 893, 899, that the practicability of procuring a search warrant is still <em>one </em>of the factors to be considered in deciding whether a search without a warrant is reasonable. My brothers think that there was time to procure a search warrant because the officers were \u201cpresent and able to place guards at all exits.\u201d To me this case does not present so leisurely a picture.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Before they could do so, one of the culprits escaped, another hid in the corn crib, and appellant\u2019s co-defendant Johney Nunnally was attempting to escape. Further, what were such guards to do ? Were they to stand helplessly by while the operators of the illicit still fled? If they had sufficient information on which to confine the occupants of the bam to that structure or to arrest them as they fled, then it seems to me that they had authority to enter the barn for that purpose. My brothers say, however, that \u201cno removal of the contraband was possible.\u201d Even that does not seem to me to be so, for pouring illicit whiskey or liquid mash down an underground drain is perhaps a common experience suffered by law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">The Rabinowitz case, as well as a long line of cases, recognizes \u201cThe right without a search warrant contemporaneously to search persons lawfully arrested while committing crime and to search the place where the arrest is made * * Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 30, 46 S.Ct. 4, 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-17\">My brothers say, \u201cThe arrest of appellant followed and did not precede the search and was based upon the result of the illegal search.\" I do not think so, as I will point out in a moment. However, assuming that to be so, then what about the arrest of Johney Nunnally? He has never even questioned the validity of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Arrest, but to the contrary, has pleaded guilty. If the search was lawful as incidental to the arrest of appellant\u2019s co-defendant, it could hardly be unlawful as to the appellant. See United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 51, 52, 72 S.Ct. 93, 96 L.Ed. 59; McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 454, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153; It seems to me, as said by Mr. Justice Black, concurring in Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 39, 40, 69 S.Ct. 1359, 1367, 93 L.Ed. 1782, \u201c* * * that the federal exclusionary rule is not a command of the Fourth Amendment but is a judicially created rule of evidence which Congress might negate.\u201d It is a rule that evidence gained by the Government\u2019s own wrong shall not be used. Cf. United States v. Wallace &amp; Tiernan Co., 336 U.S. 793, 796, 69 S.Ct. 824, 93 L.Ed. 1042. If then the evidence was <em>legally </em>obtained, it is immaterial whether such legality is referable to its connection with appellant\u2019s arrest or to the arrest of his co-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Officer Boone testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">\u201cQ.

I came right back out to the front and called Walker down there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">The appellant was then placed under arrest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> I do not think that we are required nicely to calculate whether the search preceded the arrest, if the two acts were practically simultaneous and the officers had probable cause for believing that one or more of the arrested persons had committed a felony. See Annotations, 74 A.L.R. 1391; 51 A.L.R. 429; 82 A.L.R. 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">Certainly the arrest of Johney Nun-nally was lawful whether measured by federal or state standards. As said by Chief Justice Taft in Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 156, 45 S.Ct. 280, 286, 69 L.Ed. 543: \u201cThe usual rule is that a police officer may arrest without warrant one believed by the officer upon reasonable cause to have been guilty of a felony * * The briefs do not cite us to the authorities as to whether agents of the Alcohol Tax Unit have power to make arrests. United States Marshals, Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and certain other federal officers are authorized to arrest if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested has committed or is committing a felony. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3050 to 3054, inclusive. Under Alabama State law also, an officer may arrest any person without a warrant \u201cwhen he has reasonable cause to believe that the person arrested has committed a felony.\u201d Alabama Code of 1940, Title 15, \u00a7 154. A private person has authority to make arrests \u201cwhere a felony has been committed, though not in his presence, by the person arrested; or where a felony has been committed, and he has reasonable cause to believe that the person arrested committed it * * Id. Section 158. If federal statutes or regulations do not specifically authorize agents of the Alcohol Tax Unit to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>arrests, the Alabama statute provides the standard by which the legality of these arrests must be measured. United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 591, 68 S.Ct. 222, 92 L.Ed. 210; Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 15, note 5, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436; Rent v. United States, 5 Cir., 209 F.2d 893, 897, 900. By any standard, it seems to me that the legality of the arrest of Johney Nunnally cannot be questioned, and there is but slight ground on which to question the legality of appellant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">When the officers smelled, saw and heard the things which reasonably indicated to them that an illicit still was being operated in the barn, one of them ran for the front door and the other for the rear door to head off and capture those committing the felony. Their actions showed that their object was to make the arrests. The participants in crime so understood for, as has been stated, one of them escaped, Johney Nun-nally tried to escape (R. 104) but was arrested, and Fred Walker hid in the corn crib.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-16\">There are a number of almost \u201cgray horse\u201d cases.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> I respectfully submit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>that the cases relied on by my brothers do not hold or tend to the contrary. Let me briefly - discuss each of them in the order in which it is cited in the opinion. Turner v. Camp, 5 Cir., 123 F.2d 840, is cited merely to the point that every case must be decided upon its own peculiar facts, with which all must agree. In Taylor v. United States, 286 U.S. 1, 52 S.Ct. 466, 467, where a garage adjacent to a city residence was searched, the Court repeatedly pointed out, \u201cNo one was within the place, and there was no reason to think otherwise\u201d, and again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajv-dedup-0\">\u201cProhibition officers may rely on a distinctive odor as a physical fact indicative of possible crime; but its presence alone does not strip the owner of a building of constitutional guarantees * * * against unreasonable search. This record does not make it necessary for us to discuss the rule in respect of searches in connection with an arrest. No offender was in the garage; the action of the agents had no immediate connection with an arrest. The purpose was to secure evidence to support some future arrest.\u201d Taylor v. United States, supra, 286 U.S. at page 6, 52 S.Ct. at page 467.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The Roberson case, 6 Cir., 165 F.2d 752, relates only to the question of whether the barn was a \u201chouse\u201d within the protection of the Fourth Amendment, and upon that question we are in substantial agreement. In the Walker case, 5 Cir., 125 F.2d 395, the information on which the search was made was obtained several days theretofore. Likewise, in Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436, a five to four decision, the informer had reported to the officers \u201cthat unknown persons were smoking opium in the Europe Hotel. The informer was taken back to the hotel to interview the manager, but he returned at once saying he could smell burning opium in the hallway.\u201d 333 U.S. at page 12, 68 S.Ct. at page 368. The Court commented that, \u201cNo suspect was fleeing nor likely to take flight\u201d, 333 U.S. at page 15, 68 S.Ct. at page 369. In Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145, 67 S.Ct. 1098, 91 L.Ed. 1399, the search was held reasonable as incident to an arrest. In Trupiano v. United States, 334 U.S. 699, 706, 68 S.Ct. 1229, 1233, 92 L.Ed. 1663, \u201cThe agents of the Alcohol Tax Unit knew every detail of the construction and operation of the illegal distillery long before the raid was made.\u201d That case, as has been commented, has been overruled in part. In McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 455, 69 S.Ct. 191, 193, 93 L.Ed. 153, the officers heard the adding machine, looked over a transom and saw what was transpiring in the room, all without being discovered. The defendant and his rooming house had been kept under surveillance for two months. The Court specifically commented, \u201cHere, as in Johnson v. United States and Trupiano v. United States, the defendant was not fleeing or seeking to escape.\u201d In United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 66, 70 S.Ct. 430, 435, the judgment of the Court of Appeals was reversed, and the Supreme Court held that, \u201cThe motion to suppress the evidence was properly denied by the District Court.\u201d In United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 52, 72 S.Ct. 93, 96 L.Ed. 59, the Government admitted that the search of the hotel room was unlawful as to the Misses Jeffries, but contended that it did not invade the respondent\u2019s privacy. The Supreme Court thought that that was \u201ca quibbling distinction\u201d, 342 U.S. 52, 72 S.Ct. 95. Conversely, here, if the search was lawful as to Johney Nunnally, I submit that it was lawful as to the appellant. In Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 46 S.Ct. 4, the search was not incidental to an arrest, but was of a man\u2019s dwelling several blocks distant from the place of his arrest, after the offense had been committed and while he was in custody elsewhere. The fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>going are all of the authorities upon which the majority relies. Not one of them, I submit, sustains the present ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The evidence against the appellant was so unanswerable that he offered no witnesses in his own behalf. It is a serious matter that a man undeniably guilty of felonious crimes should go unwhipped of justice. It is far more serious that we should establish a precedent under which conscientious and vigilant law enforcement officers will be seriously impeded in the performance of their important duties. Rightly understood, the Fourth Amendment requires extra precautions on the part of officers before searching houses, but it is not a bulwark behind which the lawless may seek shelter. Cf. Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 13, 14, 68 S.Ct. 367. As said in United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 51, 72 S.Ct. 93, 95, \u201c* * * the Amendment does not place an unduly oppressive weight on law enforcement officers but merely interposes an orderly procedure under the aegis of judicial impartiality that is necessary to attain the beneficient purposes intended.\u201d To construe it otherwise is to make the Amendment itself a force for evil rather than for good, and to plant in it a cancer which ultimately may bring about its destruction. I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-10\">. Mr. Boone testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\">\u201cQ.

United States, 9 Cir., 163 F.2d 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">\u201cThe search undertaken did not result alone from the odor of fermenting mash. As the officers were crossing the barnyard they observed a strong odor of cooking mash and as they approached the barn they saw a garden hose extending from beneath the barn across the barnyard lot. About the time they reached the barn door they heard a disturbance within as though someone was attempting to flee from the barn. There was a distinct noise from within the barn that sounded like utensils or some other objects being upset. Before reaching the farm, the officers had no information whatever that a still was being operated in the barn. The evidence indicates that the information which the officers obtained pointed to the fact that a still was being operated in the woods on the farm. The officers stated they were on their way to one section of the wooded area in a direct line across the barnyard when they first detected the odor of mash.\u201d (R. 71, 72)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b498-22\">.

Act of March 2, 1929 (Jones Act, 45 Stat. 1446, 27 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 91, 92). If the information which had reached the officers prior to the arrest and search, that is, prior to the opening of the door of the dwelling house, and the knowledge they had gained through their senses of smell and hearing, was sufficient to give them probable cause to believe that a felony was being committed in their presence, they were entitled to enter the dwelling and make the arrest, United States v. Borkowski (D.C.) 268 F. 408; McBride v. United States, 5 Cir., 284 F. 416; Janus v.
