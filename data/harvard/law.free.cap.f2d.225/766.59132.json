His local draft board had classified him as 1-A. On appeal to the Appeal Board that board classified him 1-0, i. e., conscientious objector available for such civilian work. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 32, Section 1622.14.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Appellant presents two specifications of error, (1) the failure of the trial court to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal made at the close of all the evidence, and (2) in convicting him and entering judgment of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">In general, his claim here is that he presented substantial evidence <em>to the local board, </em>which was not rebutted, and which sustained his claim that he was <em>both </em>a regular and an ordained minister of a recognized sect which did not compensate its ministers, and that he was entitled to receive the more favorable minister\u2019s classification instead of a 1-0 classification. The first claim of error is naturally embraced within the second claim and we therefore look to the record of trial proceedings and the Selective Service System file record for the information upon which his claims are based.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">At the outset he emphasizes the argument that denial of a claim of ministerial status was <em>due </em>to the fact that when he appeared before the local board on December 10, 1951, an individual member asked him if he had \u201cattended or graduated from a recognized Theological Seminary or Bible Institute.\u201d The board minutes state that his answer was \u201cNo\u201d \u2014that he <em>only </em>attended High School and graduated from High School. He was there advised of his right to appeal if the local board retained him in 1-A. He did appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">The burden of his argument here is that the mere asking of this question by the local board member (without more) \u201cmakes apparent\u201d that <em>his failure to have attended or graduated from </em>either of such named religious institutions necessarily became <em>the legal basis </em>of the board\u2019s rejection of his claim that he was <em>both </em>a regular and an ordained minister. It is on this basis that he urges that it becomes our duty to hold that this casual question (in some undisclosed manner) caused the entire membership of that board (and later the Appeal Board) to adopt and apply what he characterizes as an \u201cillegal standard\u201d in appraising and denying his claim of ministerial status.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">To support this \u201cillegal standard\u201d argument appellant cites several cases to the general effect that if a local board <em>uses </em>an illegal standard in classifying a registrant such use invalidates its classification \u2014 here\u20141-A. This argument also overlooks the overriding and superseding effect of a later and different classification by the Appeal Board which (with his record file before it) changed his classification to 1-0.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">As we have noted, appellant also attributes to the Appeal Board the application of the same claimed \u201cillegal standard\u201d when it later classified him as a conscientious objector. His argument on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>this point is vague and tenuous. The record is silent as to just what ultimate conclusion may have moved the Appeal Board to give him a 1-0 classification, and his argument serves only to invite conjecture and sheer speculation on our part. All that is possible to distill from this bare contention in his brief is that we should <em>infer </em>from a silent record that the Appeal Board also saw fit to apply the rule which was applied by the local board in the later noted Kezmes case, but there is no factual basis in the record to justify such a conclusion or to support such an inference. He admitted receiving notice from the Appeal Board that it had classified him as 1-0.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">As to his primary contention above noted, he pinpoints his argument by relying on a recent decision which he assures us is \u201csquarely in point\u201d on this issue\u2014 United States v. Kezmes, D.C., 125 F.Supp. 300. The court\u2019s opinion in that case indicates that it reluctantly granted a motion for judgment of acquittal upon the ground that the <em>standard </em>the local board there obviously applied was erroneous under the doctrine of Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 74 S.Ct. 152, 98 L.Ed. 132. The opinion quotes the language of the local board wherein it plainly appears that it <em>unanimously </em>refused to grant a IV-D classification <em>on the formally stated ground </em>that \u201c \u2018in as much as you have no <em>college </em>education <em>or </em>theological training, we couldn\u2019t consider you a minister in full time capacity or otherwise.\u2019\u201d [125 F.Supp. 301] This formal and unequivocal holding by a local board in the Kezmes case is a far cry from the record before us because the record in that case baldly reveals the exact but erroneous basis of \u2019local board action.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">To argue that in the instant case that <em>both </em>the local board and the Appeal Board deliberately adopted and applied the rule condemned in Kezmes and <em>thus </em>erroneously made this \u201crule\u201d the legal basis for rejecting appellant\u2019s claim to ministerial status, is not only a contention wholly void of support in the record but clearly distorts the record. The mere asking of the challenged question is not indubitable proof, or any kind of proof, that the local board applied the condemned rule, or that the Appeal Board also adopted it when its classification superseded that fixed by the local board. The noted contention is therefore rejected as untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The Selective Service Record</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">That in the performance of its duty some sort of an inquiry of the character of the one made by a board member was justified may also be seen from even a casual inspection of appellant\u2019s selective service file record before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">At appellant\u2019s personal hearing on December 10, 1951 the local board had available in his file a Classification Questionnaire filed by him on July 6,1949. In this formal document he averred that he was (then) \u201ca student <em>preparing </em>for the ministry * * * in a theological or divinity school at Odessa, Texas under the direction of The Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society.\u201d He further stated therein that he was (then) <em>regularly serving as a minister </em>and had been a minister <em>since September 19, 1912. </em>To another form question he answered, \u201cI have been a minister of the Jehovah Witnesses since September, 1942,\u201d and \u201cI do <em>regularly </em>serve as a minister.\u201d As to his <em>vocation </em>he stated that he was an apprentice mason learning the mason trade. (Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">The minutes of the local board meeting on December 10, 1951 recite inter alia that \u201cthe boy said the Jehovah Witness\u2019 consider themselves followers of Christ and HE <em>didn\u2019t </em>attend Theological or Bible Colleges.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">In his 1949 Questionnaire he also set forth that he had been formally ordained as such by \u201cBrother J. Davis\u201d at Klamath Falls, Oregon on September 19, 1942. The claim before the board on December 10, 1951 that he had <em>not attended </em>a divinity school obviously presented a contradictory and confusing argument when measured against his defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>nite claim made in the above noted Questionnaire of 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In the 1949 Questionnaire he gave his date of birth as March 29, 1930 which indicates that he was approximately twelve years of age in September of 1942 at which time he claims to have been \u201cordained\u201d as a minister.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">As a result of appellant\u2019s appearance before the local board on December 10, 1951 it classified him 1-A. He appealed this classification on December 19, 1951 listing two grounds (1) that he was a minister and (2) that he was conscientiously opposed to participation in war.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">On January 10, 1952 the Appeal Board classified him 1-0 (as above indicated).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">On September 17, 1952 appellant filed his Special Report for Class 1-0 Registrants in which he listed various jobs he had held since April 1, 1949. He set forth that he was <em>still employed </em>by Milan and Lund, brick contractors, <em>as an apprentice bricklayer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">On October 23, 1952 he filed an Apprentice Deferment Request.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">On February 24, 1953 the local board requested appellant to indicate his preference of three jobs which it had approved. He replied by letter stating that <em>he applied for deferment as an apprentice bricklayer </em>and that he declined to take any other occupation \u201cthan my present one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">Later and on August 12, 1953, appellant appeared for a second time for a hearing before his local board. The minutes of the board meeting do not indicate that he discussed his ministerial claim at that time. However, on October 22, 1953 he addressed a letter to the local board about his 1-0 classification, stating that he had new evidence which merited attention; that he was then an \u201cArea Study Conductor\u201d one of the duties of this post being the teaching of Bible Study to an adult class. In this letter he added the significant statement that \u201cmy wife and I <em>are planning now so that by next summer </em>[the summer of 1954] we will be able <em>to enter the full time ministry </em>and devote 100 hours a month each <em>in regular preaching activity.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied) As before, the local board had before it his formal claims that in July, 1949 he had been \u201cregularly serving as a minister\u201d since 1942, while in October of 1953 he was \u201cplanning\u201d to engage \u201cin regular preaching activity * * * by next summer.\u201d The paradoxical claims of \u201cregularly serving as a minister\u201d since 1942, while also asserting in October of 1953 that he was \u201cplanning to engage in regular preaching activity * * * by next summer\u201d were certainly sufficiently confusing and contradictory to suggest to a board member that at least an inquiry into the true posture of facts in his case was justified. It was this scrutiny of his file record and the inquiry it engendered that appellant now decries as \u201cunfair\u201d and a procedure that \u201ctaints\u201d the entire selective service process in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-20\">On November 4, 1953 the local board \u201creviewed the complete file\u201d of appellant and did not change the 1-0 classification which had earlier been fixed by the Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-21\">On February 15, 1954 appellant was ordered to report to his local board on February 25, 1954 for instructions to proceed to his place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-22\">On February 23,1954 he acknowledged by letter the receipt of this local board order and in his letter requested a (third) personal appearance coupled with the request that the board classify him as a minister.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>This letter also contained the bare charge that denial of ministerial status was due to \u201cprejudice,\u201d but he did not attempt to define what he meant by the use of this term. However, it is abundantly clear from all of his arguments that the charge of \u201cprejudice\u201d was based on the above noted'question by a local board member, and that asking the question indicates that an \u201cartificial standard\u201d in classifying him was. applied by <em>both </em>the local and the Appeal Board, to which question we later refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The request of February 23, 1954 for another and third personal appearance before the local board was not received by that board until February 26, 1954, <em>one day after appellant had failed to report to the local board for instructions, as ordered. </em>(See footnote 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">We have been at pains to present the salient and pertinent facts revealed by appellant\u2019s file which was before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">In his brief appellant concedes that he makes his living by secular work, but urges that his testimony leaves no doubt that he devoted as much time to his ministry as do many clergy of other sects, hence it (his ministry) <em>was his vocation.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In summary, the argument in his brief is that he was <em>considered a minister by numerous persons </em>and that he \u201cregularly gave substantial amounts of time to this work\u201d; that his secular activities were \u201conly to support his family\u201d and again avers that the denial of his ministerial claim was <em>betsed </em>on his lack of college or theological training.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">There is a short reference in his brief to the action of the Appeal Board in classifying him 1-0 in which appellant makes the bare assertion that the Appeal Board \u201cignored\u201d his claim to a minister\u2019s classification, as a consequence of which <em>its </em>classification (1-0) was \u201carbitrary.\u201d He suggests that this classification <em>indicated </em>that such action \u201cinvolved\u201d the fact tha^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>the <em>local board\u2019s </em>artificial standards\u201d (no college or theological seminary) was also <em>used </em>by the Appeal Board. As we have indicated above, absolutely nothing appearing in the file record lends support to appellant\u2019s bald assumption that the Appeal Board deliberately adopted the Kezmes \u201cbasis\u201d in classifying him.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Appellant also advances the argument in his brief that <em>if </em>the oral \u201cexplanation\u201d he gave in his testimony at trial on September 8, 1954 had been <em>heard </em>by the local board its 1951 classification (1-A) <em>might </em>have been different. And he suggests, by way of an argumentative conclusion, that <em>\u201cthis explanation,\u201d </em>i. e., the 1954 court testimony, was <em>absent </em>from the \u201csummary\u201d before the Appeal Board. His specific argument is that the appeal record omitted such a summary, and that such omission was due to the \u201ctime limit\u201d imposed by the local board which in turn was \u201can unfair diminution of his appellate record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">By use of the term \u201cthis explanation\u201d we must assume that he refers to this additional 1954 \u201cexplanation\u201d which he gave in court approximately two years and nine months later, as the kind of <em>oral testimony </em>he <em>would have added </em>to his \u201cfifteen minutes\u201d of written statement which he tendered to the board in 1951 as his \u201ctestimony,\u201d had the board been willing to receive additional oral comment on the formal statement. By viewing in retrospect the proceedings in December of 1951, he apparently would have us <em>add </em>to the written statement then made, the oral arguments later presented at trial in 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">This Court cannot re-write appellant\u2019s 1951 written testimonial claims for ministerial exemption. The local board could act only on the information as of the date when it was called upon to classify him. Obviously, and in any event, the court-voiced assertions as to his later activities, or his 1954 view of the character of his claimed ministerial activities, could not have been incorporated in the 1951 prepared statement. His contention here seems to be that he was denied a right because the local board failed to prepare a summary\u201d of what he avers in 1954 to be the things he <em>wanted to say </em>to the local board in 1951 by way of <em>amplification </em>of his written statement (which he called his \u201ctestimony\u201d) concerning his (then) ministerial activities. Only by sheer legerdemain could this Court reach back and deliberately write this then unspoken argument into his 1951 board record. Certainly the local board had a right to accept his representation that the 1951 prepared statement was his \u201ctestimony\u201d presenting his then claim to ministerial exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">This written statement of December 10, 1951 was duly incorporated in full in his selective service file and a photostatic copy of the entire statement appears in the file record before this Court and the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">We find nothing in his selective service file which calls for or would justify the conclusion that this written \u201cfifteen minute\u201d statement presenting the ministerial exemption argument he <em>then </em>wanted to read to the local board, was omitted in any part from his file record when that record was transmitted to the Appeal Board for review. The \u201cIndividual Appeal Record\u201d (SSS Form 120) executed by the local board sets forth that the appeal was forwarded to the Appeal Board on December 19,1951, and it is also therein stated that appellant \u201crequested ministerial status.\u201d Thus, his claim for ministerial exemption was squarely placed before the Appeal Board exactly as he expressed it in what he called his testimony contained in the written statement filed with the local board.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">On January 10,1952, the Appeal Board unanimously placed appellant in class 1-0. At a later point we refer to his 1954 testimony in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">As his brief here and his testimony adduced at trial clearly indicate, his case is really bottomed on the contention that he was denied procedural due process because his local board (on December 10, 1951) foreclosed his right to \u201cexplain about our ministry work and minister schools * * * how we learn to become speakers and better ministers. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>had fifteen minutes <em>prepared.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied) He told the lower court that he had not talked very long when \u201cthey asked me some questions\u201d; that \u201cthey changed the subject,\u201d and that he did not have the opportunity to explain the details of his work. His court testimony of 1954 reveals that he therein claimed that he was then spending one hour a week \u201cmostly as a teacher\u201d in directing a class the preparation for which task consumed from an hour to an hour and a half.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">He also testified that he was then engaged in \u201cpublishing\u201d which means preaching to people \u201cat the people\u2019s doors,\u201d and that this work took about five hours a week. He also testified that in April of 1952 he became an \u201cArea Study Conductor\u201d and that in February, 1954 he was appointed as \u201cAssistant Congregation Minister\u201d which post called for preaching to people \u201cin their homes\u201d in an \u201cexclusive territory.\u201d People being so visited were identified as \u201ca congregation\u201d composed of people not members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses sect.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">However, on cross-examination appellant testified that in February of 1954 he was working <em>full time </em>as a bricklayer; that <em>not until </em>September of 1954 did he and his wife \u201center into full time ministry work.\u201d He admitted that he was supposed to \u201creport for work\u201d on February 25,1954, and that he did not \u201creport\u201d but \u201cmailed a letter\u201d on the 24th which he intended \u201cto get there\u201d on the 25th; that up to that time he had made no request to reopen his classification on the basis that he was an Assistant Congregational Servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Because of the stress placed upon the aspect of his case relating to the <em>time </em>allowed him in his personal hearing before the local board on December 10, 1951, we return to the file record minutes of the board which show that the chairman told him that he would be given five minutes to present his case. This record sets forth that appellant then advised the local board that he <em>\u201cwould leave the testimony </em>which he had along with him [in written form] for the board to review.\u201d The minutes also show his oral statement that he \u201cdelivered sermons\u201d and \u201chas 2 Bible Studies, in various homes, a week.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">This Court and the lower court could and did examine this written \u201ctestimony\u201d which he thus wanted the board to \u201creview.\u201d Having been prepared in advance of the hearing we must and do assume that this statement sets out the fifteen minute argument which he now says he wanted to <em>read </em>to the board and which he then considered pertinent and sufficiently enlightening to represent his exact position and claims. Aside from an argument, there is no showing that he was denied or failed to exercise the privilege of fully expressing therein any and all additional pertinent claims, or that he omitted to set them forth in this prepared testimonial statement. Nor is there any showing in the record that the local board did not \u201creview\u201d his written \u201ctestimony,\u201d as he requested. If any presumption attaches, it is that the board did that very thing in the performance of its official duties. The record discloses no evidence which causes us to doubt that the board did \u201creview\u201d this \u201ctestimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">He begins this written \u201cstatement\u201d for the local board with the comment that <em>\u201cthe following is my testimony.\u201d </em>The document covers several typewritten pages and we endeavor to fairly summarize and paraphrase its salient arguments. It sets forth generally that beginning in 1948 I enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School wherein we prepare sermons on various Bible subjects; we have regular lessons in different text books (naming them); in the past eight years (i. e., since 1943, at which time he was about 13 years of age) I have regularly engaged in the house to house preaching activity as well as street work and Home Bible Studies all of which we consider to be the most effective manner of performing our ministerial obligations; that as <em>proof </em>(i. e., of the preaching activity) I cite (here follows a long list of quotations from the Scriptures which he asserts <em>describe </em>the activity that Christian Ministers must perform); that \u201cmy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>stand is one of complete neutrality and thus in opposition to participation in wars between nations, and it would be wrong for me to take any part in any war although I am not a pacifist.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Appended to the \u201cstatement\u201d is a so-called \u201ccertificate\u201d signed by thirty persons in which they \u201ccertified\u201d that they \u201crecognized\u201d appellant as one who regularly engages in preaching activity \u2014 and believe him to be sincere in his objection to engaging in participation in war. So far as the record shows these signers appear to be laymen and not church or sect officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">In his brief appellant has been at pains to carefully summarize for us the substance of his argument that <em>the local hom\u2019d </em>failed to give him a \u201cfair hearing.\u201d He urges that registrants are entitled to fair hearings before their local boards and that a hearing deliberately limited to five minutes, of which two minutes is consumed by the board\u2019s members, is unfair because a registrant has an unusually heavy burden of proof and that he had \u201cprepared fifteen minutes of relevant material for <em>presentation.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Nothing in the record justifies the conclusion that this \u201cprepared fifteen minutes of relevant material for presentation\u201d did not contain a fair summation of the \u201crelevant material\u201d which he wanted to <em>read </em>to the board. And only by a diligent and inexcusable exercise of our imaginative powers could we infer or possibly conclude that the board refused to read, or did not read, the statement left with it since nothing in the record so indicates. Mere conjecture and suspicion suggested only by way of argument cannot be accepted as a substitute for proof, nor do they provide (as he suggests) tangible evidence or a basis in fact for assuming that the hearing and the later appeal process was fatally \u201ctainted\u201d to a degree which calls for reversal of the judgment of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">He further asserts \u201ceven if the local board is unconvinced, it should so handle the situation [reopen] so that the registrant has an opportunity for an appellate determination,\u201d hence \u201cappellant was denied due process in both of the above instances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">The most vital aspect of this case is not shrouded in doubt. The contentions of appellant in oral argument and in his brief make conclusively clear that the heart and soul of his case finally finds expression in the contention that rejection of his two-fold claims by the local board and his later and more favorable classification by the Appeal Board, were <em>wholly induced </em>by the \u201cview\u201d of both boards that he could not be placed in either classification \u201capparently because [to quote his brief] he had not attended or graduated from a recognized Theological Seminary or Bible Institute.\u201d If we strip this heavily emphasized argument from his case it falls by its own weight for the records stamps it as an assumption without the slightest evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">Appellant\u2019s last contention of any substance was advanced as a further ground for reversal of the judgment of conviction. This is the claim that the \u201cwork program\u201d to which he was assigned \u201csuffers from constitutional and related infirmities.\u201d Specifically, he argues that the Selective Service Act and/or Regulations, as construed and here applied, do violence to his rights under the First, Fifth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution in that they (and the board order) call for a private non-federal labor draft which would require performance of services that are not exceptional or related to the national defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">There is a short answer to this sweeping indictment. This Court has previously passed upon a similar and closely related contention and rejected it as being without merit. Niles v. United States, 9 Cir., 220 F.2d 278 affirming a judgment of the lower court in United States v. Niles, 9 Cir., 122 F.Supp. 382. A petition for certiorari to this Court in the Niles case was denied on May 23, 1955, 349 U.S. 939, 75 S.Ct. 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Appellant does riot indicate in his briefs any reason for departure from the general doctrine announced in our Niles\u2019 decision nor does he even refer to that opinion. We think that the rationale of that decision calls for rejection of a contention based on the stated constitutional grounds. Certainly no sound reason exists for this Court to attempt, on vague and tenuous grounds, to override and set at naught the entire civilian work program which is exactly what appellant would have us do.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">We are convinced that appellant had a fair trial, and that on the entire record his classification as 1-0 had a substantial basis in fact. The judgment of conviction should be and is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-10\">. It was stipulated at trial that on February 14, 1954 appellant was ordered to report to the local board for the work he had been ordered to do by the board. The specific charge in the indictment is that he knowingly refused and failed to comply with this order to so \u201creport,\u201d this refusal and failure occurring on February 26, 1954. The <em>refusal </em>to report is not questioned in the case. As a matter of record the selective service file shows that the board order to report to it was mailed on February 15, 1954.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-12\">. Ho testified at Ms trial that in February of 1954 he was working <em>full time </em>as a bricklayer, and that <em>not until September of 1954 </em>did he and his wife \u201center into full time ministry work.\u201d Furthermore, (and below noted) he had enjoyed two personal appearances before the local board, and by letter requested a third personal appearance which request was received one day <em>after </em>he had failed to report for instructions. We perceive no denial of procedural \u201cdue process\u201d when the local board acted (as it did) within the framework of the law and regulations when it assigned this conscientious objector to civilian work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\">. The law, Selective Service Act of 1948, as amended, See. 16(g) (3), 50 U.S. C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 466(g) (8) provides as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018regular or duly ordained minister of religion\u2019 <em>does not include </em>a person who irregularly or incidentally preaches and teaches the principles of religion of a church, religious sect, or organization <em>and does not include </em>any person who may have been duly ordained a minister in accordance with the ceremonial, rite, or discipline of a church, religious sect or organization, <em>tut who does not regularly, as a vocation, </em>teach and preach the principles of religion and administer the ordinances of public worship as embodied in the creed or principles of his church, sect, or organization.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">We are convinced that there was a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for the determination reached by the Appeal Board in classifying appellant 1-0. His file, and his contradictory documentary evidence before the local board and the Appeal Board fully justified the final conclusion of the selective service authorities that his <em>vocation </em>was that of a bricklayer at the time he was ordered to perform civilian work. (See footnote 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">The Supreme Court has pointed out in the prevailing opinion in Dickinson v. United States, 846 U.S. 889, 74 S.Ct. 152, 156, 98 L.Ed. 132, that \u201cpreaching and teaching the principles of one\u2019s sect, if performed part-time or half-time, occasionally or irregularly, are insufficient to bring a registrant under \u00a7 6(g). These activities must be regularly performed\u201d, or in other words, be his <em>vocation. </em>The Court further pointed out that \u201cthe selective service registrant bears the burden of clearly establishing a right to the exemption.\u201d It should be pointed out that we are not here faced with a situation where appellant was merely doing \u201csome secular work\u201d in order to survive \u2014 his own candid admission is that he was doing full-time secular work as a bricklayer at the time he was ordered to report to his local board and that he failed to report. He merely sought more delay.</p>\n<p id=\"aix-dedup-0\">His ministerial claims stand disputed by documentary and affirmative evidence supplied by him and selective service officials were certainly justified in taking him at his word. This argument for reversal of the. conviction is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AcD\">He also frankly argues in his brief that he \u201cpresented satisfactory evidence that he was a conscientious objector.\u201d He was so finally classified and there is ample basis in fact to sustain that classification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
