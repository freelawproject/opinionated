The plaintiff demanded an injunction and an accounting. Jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship, as well as upon Title 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The defendant Vitamin Industries, Inc., a Nebraska corporation, the only actual defendant (the \u201cDietrim Company\u201d not being a legal entity but only a trade name sometimes used by Vitamin Industries, Inc., in connection with its sales of Dietrim), in its answer denied that by using the mark \u201cDietrim\u201d in connection with the sale of its vitamin dietary supplement it had infringed the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark, and denied that there was any confusing similarity between the marks \u201cDietene\u201d and \u201cDietrim\u201d or that any confusion had been occasioned by the alleged similarity of the marks. The defendant asserted that the marks were dissimilar and that the dissimilarity was accentuated by the fact that Dietene was distributed in powder form, in cans, by weight, in two flavors \u2014 chocolate and vanilla, while the defendant\u2019s product was distributed in capsule form in bottles.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The only issue expressly raised by the pleadings was whether the marks \u201cDietene\u201d and \u201cDietrim\u201d were so similar as to make the defendant an infringer or an unfair competitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">The case was tried to the court without a jury. There was little, if any, dispute as to the evidentiary facts. The product Dietene was originated in 1934 by the Dietary Foods Company of Minneapolis, which in that year was acquired by the Dietene Company, not then incorporated but operating as a division of Larx Company, Incorporated, of Minneapolis. In 1951 the plaintiff was incorporated under Minnesota law, and acquired from Larx Company, Incorporated, the trade-mark \u201cDietene\u201d and the good will which went with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">The plaintiff makes and distributes two products: Dietene Reducing Supplement and Meritene Whole Protein Supplement. Both are supplementary foods. Dietene is used primarily as a supplement to a low calorie diet, to provide adequate proteins, vitamins and minerals. Meritene is normally used to provide extra quantities of those things in special diets beyond normal requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">Dietene is distributed in the form of a powder, in cans, to be mixed with milk, and to be used by those on a reducing diet, to insure adequate nutrition. The trade-mark \u201cDietene\u201d has appeared on the cans containing the product as well as upon plaintiff\u2019s letterheads and advertising material. Instructions have been furnished with every can of Dietene, together with a suggested diet. The product has been checked by the American Medical Association, and its seal of acceptance is used on every package and on the plaintiff\u2019s literature and letterheads. Dietene is the only product of its type having this seal of acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>To promote th\u00e9 sale of Dietene, the plaintiff furnishes suggested reducing diets to physicians for distribution to their patients. These diets are distributed through Physicians\u2019 Nutrition Clinics for use by physicians and dietitions. A physician can fill in the name of a patient on one of the suggested diets and give it to the patient to follow. The folders containing the suggested diets are distributed in large numbers, 90,000 sets being used in 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Dietene reaches the public mainly through retail druggists. The plaintiff\u2019s direct customers are wholesale druggists and large retail chain stores. Dietene is not sold on prescription, but upon recommendation and as an over-the-counter product. It is frequently on open display. The product has been assayed once a year by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, to insure that it is as represented. A copy of the report of the Foundation is sent to the American Medical Association to evidence that the product is as claimed. A copy of the report is also furnished the Inspector from the Federal Food and Drug Administration when he comes around. In the middle thirties, Dietene was nationally publicly advertised. Later on, sales promotion was through the medical profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Total net sales of Dietene from 1934 to 1953 were $1,256,137.63. Annual sales for each of the years 1952 and 1953 exceeded $200,000. Sales had been small prior to 1945 and 1946. The increase in sales since that time is attributed to the reinvestment of profits in advertising. Distribution of Dietene is nationwide. From 1934 to 1953 the plaintiff and its predecessors spent or allocated to sales promotion and advertising $431,-358.11. The plaintiff has regularly advertised its product in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the Annals of Internal Medicine, and in Medical Economics and Modern Medicine. It employs ten full-time salesmen, who call on physicians, hospitals, and wholesale and retail druggists. Constant advertising in the American Medical Association Journal, together with the fact that Die-tene is acceptable to the American Medical Association\u2019s Council on Foods and Nutrition, has familiarized doctors with the plaintiff and its product.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The plaintiff discovered that the defendant\u2019s product Dietrim was in competition with the plaintiff\u2019s product in April, 1952, when a department store in Minneapolis advertised the latter, and had Dietene and Dietrim in its drug department. The defendant was notified that the plaintiff claimed infringement of its trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Dietrim has been on the market since 1943 or 1944. The present distribution of Dietrim is small, but the defendant could become a serious competitor. The two products are similar. Both are intended to insure adequate nutrition to those who are upon a reducing diet. It is true that the ingredients of the products are not the same, and that, while Dietene is a powder sold in cans, Dietrim is a powder sold in capsules in bottles. The defendant sells its product in drug stores and department stores in the middle west. Estimated sales are about 5,-000 bottles a year. Dietrim is only one of the defendant\u2019s products. The defendant handles possibly 250 vitamin formulas. It does no direct advertising of Dietrim but enters into agreements with its customers to pay part of the cost of advertising placed by them. The defendant has in the past used \u201cDietrim Company\u201d as a trade name in connection with the sale of Dietrim. Application for registration of the mark \u201cDietrim\u201d was made, apparently in 1945, but the mark is not a registered trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence and the close of all the evidence, the defendant moved for a dismissal of the complaint on the grounds that the plaintiff had failed to prove jurisdiction, infringement, confusing similarity of the marks in suit, damages, or any right to injunc-tive relief. So far as the record on appeal shows, the ownership of the trademark \u201cDietene\u201d, its use by the plaintiff and its predecessors from 1934 to the time of the trial, and the validity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>trade-mark, were unchallenged by the defendant. Its defense was apparently noninfringement, due to an asserted failure of proof of confusing similarity of the marks or of actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The District Court, in deciding the case, Dietene Co. v. Dietrim Co., 121 F.Supp. 785, found that the plaintiff was the owner of the trade-mark \u201cDietene\u201d as applied to a reducing supplement; that the trade-mark was originally registered under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, and subsequently republished on the Principal Register established under the TradeMark Act of 1946, 60 Stat. 427, Title 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1051 et seq. The court pointed out that \u00a7 1052 of Title 15 U.S.C.A. precluded the registration of a mark which is merely descriptive of the goods of the applicant, and ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark \u201cDietene\u201d was merely descriptive of the plaintiff\u2019s product. The court also dissected the two marks in suit, and held, in substance, that since \u201cdiet\u201d was a descriptive word common to both marks and since the plaintiff had added the suffix \u201cene\u201d to \u201cdiet\u201d, while the defendant had added \u201crim\u201d, and since \u201cene\u201d and \u201crim\u201d were dissimilar, there was no confusing similarity between the marks, and that the plaintiff\u2019s mark was not entitled to legal protection as against the defendant. The court made an exhaustive comparison of the trade-mark \u201cDietene\u201d with other trademarks which had, in other cases, been held to be merely descriptive and therefore invalid. While such comparisons are interesting and not necessarily unhelpful, each case of this kind must stand or fall upon its own peculiar facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The trade-mark \u201cDietene\u201d suggests that the product to which it has been applied has some relation to a diet, but it certainly is not merely descriptive of a food supplement consisting of nonfattening vitamins, proteins and minerals for use by those who are on a reducing diet. That a trade-mark is suggestive does not mean that it is invalid and not entitled to protection. Le Blume Import Co., Inc., v. Coty, 2 Cir., 293 F. 344, 351-352; Henry Muhs Co. v. Farm Craft Foods, Inc., D.C.E.D.N.Y., 37 F.Supp. 1013; San Francisco Ass\u2019n for the Blind v. Industrial Aid for the Blind, Inc., 8 Cir., 152 F.2d 532, 533-534; Hanson v. Triangle Publications, Inc., 8 Cir., 163 F.2d 74, 77; Douglas Laboratories Corporation v. Copper Tan, Inc., 2 Cir., 210 F.2d 453, 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">It is our opinion that the trademark \u201cDietene\u201d, while suggestive, is not merely descriptive of the ingredients, qualities or characteristics of the product to which it is applied, and that it is a valid trade-mark, the exclusive use of which by the plaintiff is entitled to legal protection. Moreover, \u201cThe manufacturer or vendor is entitled to the reputation which his goods have acquired and the public to the means of distinguishing between them and other goods; and protection is accorded against unfair dealing whether there be a technical trade-mark or not.\u201d William R. Warner &amp; Co. v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., 265 U.S. 526, 531, 44 S.Ct. 615, 618, 68 L.Ed. 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">It seems to us that with respect to products which may affect human health and which ordinarily should be taken upon the advice or recommendation of a physician, the avoidance of confusing similarity of trade-marks is vitally important.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Under \u00a7 1127 of Title 15 U.S.C. A., \u201cThe term \u2018colorable imitation\u2019 includes any mark which so resembles a registered mark as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.\u201d The use, without consent of the registrant, of a \u201ccolorable imitation\u201d of a registered mark renders the user liable. Title 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">We think that the mark \u201cDie-trim\u201d so closely resembles the registered mark \u201cDietene\u201d that confusion is likely to occur. We are unable to accept the theory that because the plaintiff\u2019s trademark ends in \u201cene\u201d and the defendant\u2019s mark in \u201crim\u201d, confusion will be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">Our conclusion is that, under the evidence and the applicable law, the plaintiff was entitled to the injunctive relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>which it sought, and that the District .Court erred in dismissing the complaint. Since the record indicates that the'plaintiff suff\u00e9red no substantial - damages or loss of profits from the def\u00e9ndant\u2019s competition and that an accounting would be f\u00fctile, we think that none need be' had. Q-Tips, Inc., v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, 3 Cir., 206 F.2d 144, 148; McCormick <em>&amp; </em>Co., Inc., v. B. Manischewitz Co., 6 Cir., 206 F.2d 744, 747. The judgment is reversed with directions to enter a judgment for the plaintiff in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
