In June the parties signed a more formal agreement, designated Supplemental Agreement No. 1, specifying price, quantity, and delivery schedules. The \u201cDefaults\u201d clause and the \u201cDisputes\u201d clause of that contract are set out in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>In August 1951, the, Ordnance District issued the first of a series of change orders, designated Change Order \u201cA,\u201d altering certain specifications and changing the'type of carton used for packaging the ammunition boxes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-4\">Since Jun\u00e9 1, 1951, Lennox had protested certain discrepancies in the specifications and recommended corrective changes. On August <em>29, </em>1951, and on September 28, 1951, the Ordnance District issued Change Orders \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC,\u201d adopting Lennox\u2019s recommendations. Compliance with these change orders required extensive retooling:</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-5\">After Lennox had procured the letter contract, it ordered the type of steel designated by the contract, but the steel was unworkable and unsuitable for the boxes. Apparently other contractors experienced similar difficulty, and in September Len-nox, several other contractors, steel representatives and representatives of various Ordnance Districts concerned, met to discuss it. As a result of that conference, Ordnance issued Change Order \u201cD\u201d on November 23, 1951, changing the ear-bon content of the specified steel. In December, it issued Change Order \u201cE,\u201d providing for an indentation on the bottom of some of the boxes. As a result of these various changes, Lennox did not comply with the delivery schedule called for by Supplemental Agreement No. 1. On January 31, 1952, the parties signed Supplemental Agreement No. 2, providing for a deferred delivery schedule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-11\">During this period, Lennox had incurred large costs in complying with the various change orders issued by the Ordnance District. In February, it presented to the government an invoice showing costs of approximately $437,000 and requested partial payment. Ordnance informed the company that it could receive partial payment of 75% of its invoice, but only if the contract were amended to allow for partial payments and if Lennox provided consideration for the amendment. On March 3, 1952, the parties signed Supplemental Agreement No. 3, containing a clause providing for partial payments, as set forth in part in the footnote,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for a consideration of $3,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>279.64, which was 1% of 75% (the anticipated partial payment) of the invoice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-5\">Following that agreement, there was some production and delivery, lasting until June. In June, production was again disrupted, due to the national steel strike. The parties then signed, on July 17,1952, Supplemental Agreement No. 4, excusing Lennox for delays in performance and setting a delivery schedule subject to delays caused by the strike.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-6\">Shortly after the execution of Supplemental Agreement No. 3 in March, Len-nox had requested a partial payment of 75% of the $437,000 invoice. The Ordnance District had refused to make the entire payment, but did make a payment of approximately $150,000, which went directly to the Mastan Company, Len-nox\u2019s assignee and holder of a chattel mortgage on all of Lennox\u2019s equipment and machinery. Lennox protested vigorously against the failure to pay the full 75% requested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-7\">On July 16, 1952, the Ordnance District issued change order \u201cH,\u201d which required substantial changes in the manufacture of the boxes at no cost to the government and with no change in the delivery schedule. Lennox refused to accept the change order, and, on August 20, 1952, the government issued Change Order \u201cI,\u201d similar to \u201cH,\u201d except that it allowed Lennox to spend up to 10% of the contract price in making the changes required by its terms. Compliance with Change Order \u201cI\u201d required retooling of from 60 to 90 days \u2014 during which there could be no production \u2014 and expenses of approximately $120,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-10\">On August 31, 1952, Lennox presented an invoice of $235,427 for partial payment. That amount included costs incurred in making changes in compliance with Change Order \u201cI.\u201d On September 4, 1952, Lennox conferred with Ordnance District representatives and was advised that a partial payment would be made. On September 22, the company advised the Ordnance District that it would be unable to resume production until a partial payment was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-11\">However, no such payment was ever made. On September 18, 1952, Ordnance issued a 10-day notice of intention to terminate the contract unless Lennox could demonstrate its ability to produce in accordance with the delivery schedule. On October 1, Colonel Walker, head of the Ordnance District, advised Lennox that he would continue the contract if defendant had facilities to complete it on time, and would utilize the monies made available for the purpose. He stated that he would send a production team to determine whether Lennox had facilities suitable for completing the contract and, if the production team reported favorably, he would send a fiscal team to work out a partial-payment program. A production team did visit the plant and reported that Lennox could fulfill its contract if it had the requisite financing. A fiscal team then reported that a partial-payment plan to insure sufficient funds had been worked out. Despite these reports, Colonel Walker, on October 20, 1952, notified Lennox that he intended to terminate the contract and, on October 31, 1952, sent out a notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>termination which is set forth in the footnote.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-4\">The Government\u2019s complaint in this action, as amended in March 1953, sought possession and title to all property covered by the partial payments, under the provision of the Partial Payments Clause providing that, upon the making of any partial payment, title to all materials, in-vestory, and non-durable tools acquired by or produced for the performance of the contract shall vest in the government. The Government also demanded $149,118.38 for unrecouped partial payments. Lennox counterclaimed for damages arising out of the contract. The trial judge found that the government had breached the contract and denied recovery or title to the government. He dismissed the counterclaims for lack of jurisdiction, but without prejudice to their prosecution in the Court of Claims. The Government appeals from that part of the judgment adverse to it. Defendant has not appealed from the order dismissing the counterclaims.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-5\">Leonard P. Moore, Brooklyn, N. Y. (William C.

The evidence amply supports that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">The original contract set forth no delivery schedule. Supplemental Agreement No. 1 provided for deliveries starting on or before July 31, 1951. Supplemental Agreement No. 2 dated January 31, 1952, states that \u201cit has been administratively determined that the Contractor was excusably delayed from 1 Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>tember 1951, by reason of unforeseeable delays in delivery of materiel and by reason of acts of the Government.\u201d And Supplemental Agreement No. 4, signed July 17, 1952, stated that \u201cit has been administratively determined that the Contractor has been excusably delayed in the performance of the contract,\u201d and substituted a delivery schedule, \u201csubject to delay in receipt of steel\u201d as a result of the strike. From July 17 to August 20, Lennox received no mill steel because of the strike, and on August 20 the Government issued Change Order \u201cI,\u201d which, the trial judge found, required retooling for some sixty to ninety days, during which there could be no production. Before that period had expired, the contract had been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Even without the administrative determinations of justifiable delay contained in the supplemental agreements, the record shows that Lennox was not in default. Because of discrepancies in the specifications and the change orders necessary to correct them, the trial judge found, on evidence which fully supports him, that the lack of production up to March 3, 1952, was entirely the fault of the government; that Lennox produced substantially in accordance with delivery schedules between March 3, 1952 and June 2, 1952; and that delays after that date were due, first to the steel strike, and then to Change Order \u201cI.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">A majority of the court \u2014 -Judges MEDINA and HINCKS \u2014 think that the government was not in default. Their views \u2014-in which the writer of this opinion concurs as an alternative basis of affirmance \u2014-are set forth in Point II of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The separate views of the writer of this opinion are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The trial judge found that, at the time of the contract\u2019s termination, the government was itself seriously in default, in that it had fallen very substantially short in discharging its obligation to make partial payments in accordance with the Partial Payments Clause \u2014 that, indeed, it was solely because of that default that defendant could not thereafter have performed. If the judge was correct in that respect, he was also correct in holding that the government wrongfully terminated the contract and therefore cannot ground its action on the title provision of that clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">This conclusion turns on the meaning of the Partial Payments Clause. The problem may be approached from two angles: (a) the interpretation of the contract; (b) reformation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">1. It should be noted at the outset that, as the contract was one with a federal agency, the doctrine of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, does not apply. See, e. g., Clearfield Trust Company v. United States, 318 U.S. 363, 366-367, 63 S.Ct. 573, 87 L.Ed. 838; Phelan v. Middle States Oil Corporation, 2 Cir., 220 F.2d 593, 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">2. The Partial Payments Clause was added on March 31, 1952 by Supplemental Agreement No. 3. Colonel Walker, the principal contracting officer of the New York Ordnance District, testified that, if, when Supplemental Agreement No. 3 was made, the defendants\u2019 incurred costs were $437,283.39, and if defendants were not then in default or likely to be, the government would then have paid defendants 75% of that amount as a partial payment. Answering a question put by the judge, Walker added: \u201cWe are <em>doing it every day with hundreds of other contracts.\u201d </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>He had previously testified, in answer to the judge\u2019s questions, that <em>it was the \u201cpractice\u201d to pay \u201c75 percent </em>of allowable substantial costs,\u201d and that <em>what the Partial Payments Clause \u201creally meant\u201d was that a payment of 75% of such cost would be made if the contractor was a \u201cgood risk.\u201d </em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Subsequently, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-16\">\u201cThe Court: <em>Colonel Walker said that it was the pattern and common </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>knowledge and the practice among all the contractors to pay them 75% so it was well known that that was what the Government did; is that right?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\"><em>\u201cMr. </em>Flagg (government counsel) : <em>I will accept that.\u201d </em><footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4q\">Walker further testified that Mr. Stadler, a government employee, had been authorized \u2014 that it was his \u201cduty\u201d - \u2014 to negotiate Supplemental Agreement No. 3, and the duty of Kelly \u2014 Chief of the Legal Section of the New York Ordnance District \u2014 to draft it. In the light of Walker\u2019s testimony, as construed by the judge with the acquiescence at the trial of government counsel, we turn to the testimony of Pearl, defendant\u2019s president. He testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">He was told that Stadler was to negotiate with him \u201ctoward working up a partial payment clause to be inserted in our contract so that money could be made available to us under that clause.\u201d Pearl informed Stadler that defendant\u2019s incurred costs as of January 1932 were some $437,000. Stadler told Pearl that defendant \u201ccould get 75%, which was * * * $327,964.04.\u201d Stadler stated that, in order to justify the addition of the Partial Payments Clause, defendant would have to give consideration to the government and that a sufficient consideration would be \u201cone percent of the 75% of our incurred costs, in other words, of $327,964.04; * * * That was the understanding; he stated to me that we were going to get $327,000 and we were going to pay the Government $3200, and that was the understanding and the arrangement we had at that time, on or about February 19, 1952.\u201d Stadler took Pearl to Kelly; Stadler told Kelly, in Pearl\u2019s presence, that \u201che had just completed the negotiations of a partial payment arrangement which called for the payment of $327,000, and he asked him to prepare the proper legal papers which would make it possible for that to be part of the contract.\u201d Supplemental Agreement No. 3 resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">The foregoing has marked significance in several respects:</p>\n<p id=\"b354-15\">(a) The uniform conduct of the government in paying other contractors 75%, pursuant to the Partial Payments Clause, serves as an administrative interpretation of that clause and of the Regulation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since such was the uniform practice of the New York Ordnance District, it is proper to infer, absent contrary evidence, that, on the basis of the so-called \u201cpresumption\u201d of regularity, the Department of the Army had approved and adopted this interpretation, i. e., one which left no room for the exercise of discretion when the contractor was not in default (or a \u201cbad risk\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">(b) The uniform governmental practice fully supports Pearl\u2019s testimony that, in agreeing to that clause, and in agreeing to pay as a consideration 1% of the 75% of defendant\u2019s incurred costs, defendant was advised by the government\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>representatives that the clause meant that the government would surely pay defendant 75% (less 1% of 75%). Thus both parties intended that clause to be so understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Especially because of Walker\u2019s testimony concerning the government\u2019s uniform practice, the evidence of surrounding circumstances, including the negotiations, becomes markedly important in determining what the parties meant by the word \u201cmay\u201d in the Partial Payments Clause. For, in appropriate circumstances, the word \u201cmay\u201d has often been construed as \u201cshall.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Some authorities hold that such extrinsic evidence may be considered, only if the language of the contract is ambiguous. The government contends that \u201cmay\u201d confers unrestricted discretion. We think that, in its context, \u201cmay\u201d sufficiently lacks clarity to satisfy the \u201cambiguity\u201d test,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that its meaning is \u201cnot so clear as to be self-evident\u201d,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that it was \u201ccapable of being understood in more senses than one\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">It bears on the meaning of \u201cmay\u201d in this contract that, if that word is construed as wholly permissive, unreasonable consequences would ensue: (a) On that interpretation, defendant paid $3,-200 for the addition of a clause which would yield defendant nothing unless the Contracting Officer, governed by mere whim, chose to direct a payment, (b) At the trial, government counsel conceded that, under the interpretation for which the government then contended, the clause would give the government, upon termination of the contract, title to thousands of dollars of property even if the government had made a partial payment of but $50.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If this interpretation were correct, then the clause \u201cset a skillful trap\u201d for the \u201cunwary\u201d defendant, and \u201cNo such purpose should be attributed to the government. * * * In construing the document the presumption should be indulged that both parties were acting in good faith.\u201d Sylvan Crest Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States, 2 Cir., 150 F.2d 642, 643. It \u201cis not out of place to say that the government should be animated by a justice as anxious to consider the rights of the bidder as to insist upon its own.\u201d United States v. Purcell Envelope Company, 249 U.S. 313, 318, 39 S.Ct. 300, 301, 63 L.Ed. 620. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>the government now seeks to construe the contract, it comes close to being \u201c \u2018such as no man in his senses and not under delusion would make on the one hand, and as no honest and fair man would accept on the other\u2019accordingly, that construction should be rejected if possible. See Hume v. United States, 132 U.S. 406, 415, 10 S.Ct. 134, 137, 33 L.Ed. 393; Scott v. United States, 12 Wall. 443, 445, 20 L.Ed. 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">But even if \u201cmay\u201d is not thus ambiguous, evidence of the negotiations was admissible. The \u201cambiguity-on-its-face\u201d rule is a vestigial remain of a notion prevailing in \u201cprimitive law.\u201d \u201cThe primitive law,\u201d says <em>Wigmore, </em>\u201clooked only at the expression. * * * The mark of primitive legal standards, throughout all, is formalism.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Plucknett tells us that \u201cuntil late in the Middle Ages, English lawyers tried to avoid the problem of interpretation. Indeed, even the word [i. e., interpretation] connoted in their minds fraud or evasion.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Says Pat\u00f3n, in \u201cprimitive law,\u201d the \u201cbinding element is sought in the sacred ritual and not in the intention of the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> With the advent of writing, the written word came to possess a magic potency.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-16\">The \u201cprimitive\u201d \u2014 ritualistic and magical \u2014 attitudes have relaxed their grip. The later rationalization that, to receive extrinsic evidence is to court the danger of perjury, has also been eroding: Such evidence is now everywhere received to show, for instance, (a) fraud or illegality, (b) that an apparent deed is but a mortgage, or (c) that a written contract was not to become operative except upon the happening of an orally agreed-upon condition.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">Even if a word in a written agreement is not ambiguous on its face, the better authorities hold that its context, its \u201cenvironment,\u201d must be taken into account in deciding what the parties mutually had in mind when they used that verbal symbol.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-18\">The problem of interpreting a contract is, of course, that of understanding the communication between the parties.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Like many communication-problems in non-legal fields, it is frequently none too easy of solution.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Judge Learned Hand has sagely warned that, in attempting a solution, it is \u201cone of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary * * <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This warning has an ancient lineage. Ihering (in the middle of the 19th century) taught that the Roman jurists had emphasized the \u201cspirit\u201d as against the letter, and noted that, \u201cA close adherence to the letter is a mark of unripeness everywhere, and especially in law.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In the 14th century, an Italian lawyer, Lucas De Penna, scorned the suggestion that the \u201cdictionary equivalents\u201d of words constitute the sole basis of ascertaining their meaning, and opposed literal interpretation (or \u201cpure verbalism\u201d), since words are but clumsy \u201cvehicles\u201d of expression, and the isolation of words from their context is the mark of an inexperienced interpreter.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In 1932, it was observed in Hurst v. W. J. Lake &amp; Co., 141 Or. 306, 16 P.2d 627, 629, 89 A.L.R. 1222 that \u201cthe language of the dictionaries is not the only language spoken in America.\u201d Corbin, in 1951 said, \u201cThere is no dictionary on earth * * * that can record all the usages of words or other symbols. * * There is no law requiring the contractors to express themselves in \u2018good English\u2019. * * * On the contrary, the law requires the court to put itself as nearly as possible, in the position of the parties, with their knowledge and their ignorance, with their language and their usage. It is the meaning * * * of the parties, thus determined, that must be given legal effect.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">Accordingly, it is regarded by many authorities as a fallacy that, in interpreting contractual language, a court may not consider the surrounding circumstances unless the language is patently ambiguous. Any such rule, like all rules of interpretation, must be taken as a guide, not a dictator.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The text should always be read in its context. Indeed, text and context necessarily merge to some extent, just as an individual\u2019s \u201cinner environment\u201d includes the air in his lungs.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> When the text is in a foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>language, which environs it, resort to a translation becomes necessary; <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> when the parties to an American-worded contract employ their own private language, foreign to the judge, he should similarily translate its apparent meaning by resort to their private glossary.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The parties may use \u201ctheir own special dictionary\u201d which (when put in evidence) supplies the key to what their words meant to them.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> On this view, the apparent \u201cpublic\u201d meaning must give way to the parties\u2019 \u201cprivate\u201d meaning, for they have created their own little \u201cpublic,\u201d their own private public.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The preliminary negotiations often function as a most important part of the \u201ccontractual history\u201d of the words employed. Our courts have come to rely on the \u201chistory\u201d of a statute in construing its literal verbiage.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Many of those judges who, through scepticism about that technique, have developed a sort of context-phobia with reference to statutes,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> have no doubts about judicial reliance on a contract\u2019s history. For, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Professor Richard Powell points out,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> the words of a statute are usually chosen by but a portion of the legislature, and the purposes of that small portion \u201care often wholly unknown and unapproved\u201d in actuality by most members of that body, while the words of a contract are selected by the parties whose purpose is far more readily ascertainable by consulting their negotiations.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">To shut out the light furnished by the parties themselves \u2014 to read their words not as they meant them but as they appear when denuded of that meaning \u2014 is to decide an unreal, fictitious, hypothetical case. To reject the insights derived from their previous negotiations, which reveal their actual purposes, is to create a narrow rule of relevance which ar-tificializes the facts.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Doubtless on that account, even those courts which still say ambiguity is a necessary condition of considering such extrinsic evidence are quick to find such ambiguity, on slight grounds, when the extrinsic evidence is convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Our court has taken the broader view. In Nicoll v. Pittsvein Coal Co., 2 Cir., 269 F. 968, 971-972, this court (per Hough, J.) said, \u201c[W]e think that there is no reason in the nature of things why the individual parties to a transaction may not employ words or whole phrases in a particular sense irrespective of the ordinary sense. * * * In sound theory there is in each case only a question of fact, viz.: Were the parties using words in a special mutual sense? * * * [Tjhere is no doubt at all that ambiguity in phrase is not necessary to let in evidence of usage.\u201d In Rotberg v. Dodwell &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 152 F.2d 100, 101, we said: \u201c[T]he intent is made clear by the affidavit of defendant\u2019s attorney which, after reciting this background, states that he explicitly told plaintiffs\u2019 attorney that he would require a general release so as to terminate all possible claims by plaintiffs in the future, as well as in the present. Plaintiffs insist that this statement cannot be considered under the parol evidence rule. But that rule does not exclude evidence to interpret, explain, or clarify (rather than contradict) the written document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">Writes Corbin: \u201cWords have no meaning ; it is users of words who give them meaning.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> * * * It is sometimes said that if the words of a contract are plain and clear, evidence of surrounding circumstances to aid interpretation is not admissible. But some of the surrounding circumstances always must be known before the meaning of the words can be plain and clear; and proof of the circumstances may make a meaning plain and clear when in the absence of such proof some other meaning may also have seemed plain and clear.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> * * * It is not necessary that words should be unusual words or words that are \u2018ambiguous on their face\u2019 in order to admit evidence of special usage. And evidence often establishes a special and unusual meaning definitely in conflict with the more common and ordinary usage.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> * * Among the surrounding circumstances that are admissible for purposes of interpretation are included many acts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>statements of the parties antecedent to and contemporaneous with the making of the contract. But, it may be asked, does not the \u2018parol evidence rule\u2019 exclude evidence of such antecedent statements and understandings? The answer to this question is No. That supposed rule of evidence purports to exclude testimony only when it is offered for the purpose of \u2018varying or contradicting\u2019 the terms of an \u2018integrated\u2019 contract; it does not purport to exclude evidence offered for the purpose of interpreting and giving a meaning to those terms. The terms of any contract must be given a meaning by interpretation before it can be determined whether an attempt is being made to \u2018vary or contradict\u2019 them. The question in any particular case, therefore, may become this: When does interpretation cease and when does variance begin ? So far as this question is concerned, any and all surrounding circumstances may be proved so long as they are material and relevant on the issue of what the contract is and what meaning should be given to its words.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> * * * The court will give legal effect to the words of a contract in accordance with the meaning actually given to them by one of the parties, if the other knew or had reason to know that he did so. In determining the meaning so given by the one and the fact of knowledge or reason to know by the other,.the court will hear all relevant evidence of the surrounding circumstances, including the admissions of the parties, the negotiations and antecedent communications between them, and all current usages that might have affected their choice of the words. In the process of interpretation, it is the court and not the parties who should be reasonably, or even remarkably, intelligent.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> * * * In determining whether the two parties gave the same meaning to their express words and what that meaning was, or in determining whether one party gave a particular meaning to the words and the other knew or had reason to know that he did, the court will need to know the' preliminary negotiations and communications between the parties to the contract. These are among the relevant surrounding circumstances; and evidence of what they were is admissible. This is true, even though the words of the contract seem to the judge to have a \u2018plain and clear\u2019 meaning for him. A reasonably intelligent judge will not try to force <em>his </em>meaning upon the parties, when relevant and trustworthy evidence may convince him that one or both of them had another meaning.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> * * <em>* </em>As long as the court is aware that there may be doubt and ambiguity and uncertainty in the meaning and application of agreed language, it will welcome testimony as to antecedent agreements, communications, and other factors that may help to decide the issue. Such testimony does not vary or contradict the written words; it determines that which cannot be varied or contradicted.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> * * * A contractor is bound in accordance with the meaning that he induces another to understand and act upon, if he knows or has reason to know that the other will so understand and act. And in determining whether or not he has reason to know, the court should be advised of all the surrounding circumstances; of the meaning that is given to the language of the agreement by common usage, by usage in the trade or business or profession of the parties; of communications between the parties during preliminary negotiations and during the execution of the writing; and of subsequent interpretations and practical application by either party that is assented to or acted upon by the other.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">For authorities supporting Corbin, see, e. g., United States v.

Even were we constrained by the \u201cambiguity-on-the-face\u201d rule, we should, on the facts here, hold that the contract must be reformed so that \u201cmay\u201d is not permissive, as the government contends. That is, if \u201cmay\u201d on its face means unregulated discretion, the contract must be rectified because it mistakenly reflects the actual intention. It matters not here whether we call this a case of mutual mistake<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> or one of mistake by defendant which plaintiff knew and induced.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The evidence of mistake amply justifies such relief: It is most clear and convincing. Under the federal merged procedure, the court can grant such equitable relief and then treat the contract as thus reformed.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> As here there was no jury, the judge could perform both those functions. It is of no moment that defendant did not formally ask such relief, for we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>may regard its pleading as amended to conform to the proof.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">4. Colonel Walker testified that the reason for the government\u2019s termination of the contract was that defendant at that time was in default on deliveries under the original contract and under the supplemental agreements. But, as shown above, defendant was not then in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The government, then, wrongfully terminated the contract. The title provision of the Partial Payments Clause did not entitle the government to assert that title and to seek delivery of the property when defendant was not in default but when the government had substantially breached its contractual obligation and in such a way as to prevent defendant\u2019s performance.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">5. Plaintiff points to the clause providing that if, after notice of termination for cause, it is determined that defendant\u2019s failure to perform \u201cis due to causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence\u201d of defendant, the notice shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant to the clause entitled \u201cTermination for Convenience of the Government.\u201d The latter clause provides that the contract may be terminated \u201cwhenever the contracting officer shall determine that such termination is in the best interests of the government,\u201d and that, in such event, the defendant shall \u201ctransfer title and deliver to the government * * * the fabricated or unfabricated parts, work in process, completed work, supplies, and other material produced as a part of, or acquired in connection with the performance of, the work terminated by the Notice of Termination, and * * * the completed or partially completed plans, drawings, information, and other property which, if the contract had been completed, would have been required to be furnished to the Government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">For the reasons above noted, the government, because of its breach which prevented performance by defendant, is in no position to ask enforcement of the title provision of the \u201cConvenience\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">6. The \u201cChanges\u201d clause provides that \u201cfailure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled \u2018Disputes.\u2019 \u201d The \u201cDisputes\u201d clause provides that a dispute \u201cshall be decided by the Contracting Officer\u201d; that within 30 days the contractor may appeal to the Secretary of the Army or his duly authorized representative; that if no appeal is taken, \u201cthe decision of the Contracting Officer shall be final and conclusive\u201d; that the Contractor is entitled to be heard and offer evidence in support of its appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-15\">Defendant did whatever was necessary to protect its right of appeal to the Secretary of the Army: A week after termination of the contract by the Contracting Officer, it served upon the New York Ordnance District and upon the Secretary of the Army a notice of appeal from the decision of the Contracting Officer, pursuant to the \u201cDisputes\u201d clause. As the trial judge found: \u201cIt is not disputed that this appeal was served and that it was timely. Rule 4(c), promulgated by the Board of Contract Appeals, provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-16\">\u201c \u2018c. Trial briefs. Counsel for the government shall thereafter file with the Board a memorandum asserting the factual and legal issues which counsel for the government considers may be involved in a hearing upon the appeal.

The evidence further indicates and is not disputed by the plaintiff that nothing was done with respect to Rule 4(c). * * * The Contracting Officer, as Lennox aptly points out, made it impossible for the attorney for Lennox to prepare a memorandum asserting the factual and legal issues to be considered upon appeal and, this being so, if this constitutes the sole appeal procedure, then obviously in the instant action the appeal procedure was not only grossly inadequate but unavailable to the defendant because the Contracting Officer refused to make a record and simply sat and let time tick away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">7. Because of the nature of the government\u2019s breach, the trial judge correctly rejected the government\u2019s claim for money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">8. The following is the moral of this case: A Colonel may not deal with civilians as if they were soldiers subject to his command. In military service, subordinates must (within wide limits) obey the orders of their superiors, even if the orders be arbitrary. But when a military officer represents the government in carrying out a contract, he must recognize the restraints imposed by civil legal rules as to private dealings. If that were often forgotten, we would be on the way to militarizing civilian life, to the rule of the Commissars. Early in the 19th century, Tocqueville wrote: \u201cI have often asked myself what would happen if, amid the relaxation of democratic manners, and as a consequence of the restless spirit of the army, a military government were ever to be founded among any of the nations of the present age. I think that even such a government would * * * retain none of the fierce characteristics of a military oligarchy. I am persuaded that, in such a case, a sort of fusion would take place between the habits of official men, and those of the military service. The <em>administration would assume something of a military character, and the army some of the usages of the civil administration. The result would be a regular, clear, exact, and absolute system of government: the people would become the reflection of the army, and the community be drilled like a garrison.\u201d </em><footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">Judges MEDINA and HINCKS would decide this case solely on another ground which we all agree is valid and disposi-tive.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">We all think that the evidence fails to show a breach by the defendant. The defendant\u2019s non-performance was due to the action of the Government\u2019s contracting officer in issuing a notice of termination. No breach by the defendant having been shown, the Government may not recover damages. The only other relief sought is, essentially, the enforcement of an equitable lien on the defendant\u2019s property. Its right to enforce concededly depends upon a termination of the main contract. Clearly, as a suitor in equity the Government would be precluded from asserting a termination resulting from its own wrongful breach. But for purposes of this ground of affirmance we do not base our decision upon a breach of contract by the Government. Our disposition turns on the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s contention that by invoking the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clause of the contract it has brought about a \u201ctermination\u201d upon which its right to relief sought may be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\"> It is true that the Government had a legal right to invoke that clause: it was not invalid. Doubtless it might be invoked to prevent accrual, of further liabilities or as a valid defense to an action at law, \u2014 as, for instance, where the Government sued for damages consisting of costs of manufacture unneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>sarily incurred after a notice of termination given because of a changed condition obviating the need for goods contracted for. But granted that the Government had a legal right to invoke the clause as a shield, it does not follow that by using the termination thus created as a sword it is entitled to enforce an equitable right. Its right to equitable relief may not be left to depend upon its own inequitable conduct. Here the notice of termination was expressly predicated upon the defendant\u2019s alleged inability to perform. In view of the fact that the \u201cresearch team\u201d of Government experts sent to investigate the defendant\u2019s ability to perform had shortly before made a report favorable to the defendant, we think the good faith of the contracting officer in terminating on the ground of inability was questionable. But that aside, if inability to perform existed when the notice of termination issued, the evidence makes it clear that it resulted in substantial part from the contracting officer\u2019s refusal at an earlier stage to use his conceded discretion to make larger partial payments. Even if the contract should not be so interpreted as to give the defendant a legal right to larger partial payments, we think that on the relevant evidence it was arbitrary and inequitable to refuse to make them especially since the defendant\u2019s need therefor was in substantial part attributable to successive change orders made by the Government. And so by reason of its own earlier inequitable conduct the Government is disentitled to the equitable relief which it now seeks. Especially is this so since to grant the relief here sought would be to enforce specific performance of a penalty clause in the contract. Moreover, although the Government has made partial payments in excess of the aggregate amount which it has already recouped, it is not entitled to the relief sought on the ground of unjust enrichment. This is so because (1) of its own inequitable conduct, and (2) it has not proved that the defendant will be enriched, unjustly or otherwise, if it is allowed to keep the property which the Government seeks to take. The defendant should not be so penalized merely because its opportunity to perform was prevented by circumstances beyond its control and by the manifest unfairness of the plaintiff. Such a penalty is repugnant to equity. See, e. g. Precision Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Automatic Co., 324 U.S. 806, 814-815, 65 S.Ct. 993, 89 L.Ed. 1381; United States v.

S., 223 U.S. 695, 701-702, 32 S.Ct. 352, 56 L.Ed. 614, i. e., that where the power of the government under a contract is complete and its agent\u2019s decision conclusive, then the government owes a corresponding duty to have its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>agent\u2019s judgment exercised reasonably, and not capriciously or in bad faith. In effect, Congress adopted the views of Justices Douglas and Jackson in their dissenting opinions in Wunderlich, 342 U.S. at pages 101-103, 72 S.Ct. 156-157.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">True, the new statute, literally read, applies only to the \u201cdisputes\u201d clause of a contract like that before us here. Congress, however, stated a general policy forbidding a government official to act capriciously in the exercise of a power of decision under such a contract. Such a policy should not be interpreted in a niggardly manner. See Van Beeck v. Sabine Towing Co., 300 U.S. 342, 350-351, 57 S.Ct. 452, 456, 81 L.Ed. 394; \u201cIt would be a misfortune if a narrow or grudging process of construction were to exemplify and perpetuate the very evils to be remedied. There are times when uncertain words are to be wrought into consistency and unity with a legislative policy which is itself a source of law, a new generative impulse transmitted to the legal system.\u201d In Gooch v. Oregon Short Line R. Co., 258 U.S. 22, 24, 42 S.Ct. 192, 193, 66 L.Ed. 443, the Court said: \u201cFor although courts sometimes have been slow to extend the effect of statutes modifying the common law beyond the direct operation of the words, it is obvious that a statute may indicate a change in the policy of the law, although it expresses that change only in the specific cases most likely to occur to the mind.

See, e. g., Sullivan, The Aspects of Science (2d series, (.1.926) 15-17) \u201cProfessor Rougier, in his \u2018Paralogismes du Rationalisme,\u2019 instances the different significations so elementary and unambiguous a concept as a triangle has for different minds. He takes Euclid, Schopenhauer, Duns Scotus, Spinoza, and Goethe. For Euclid a triangle exists merely by definition, and its properties are the logical consequences of the primary axioms or postulates which have been assumed. Except in relation to these postulates it has no existence, and it signifies nothing whatever except what can be deduced logically from its definition. Schopenhauer takes the triangle as something \u2018given\u2019; it is, presumably, in some way \u2018innate.\u2019 Its properties are to be discovered by experiment. Thus, of the properties Schopenhauer discovers he can only state that they exist; he cannot, like Euclid, show that they are necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"AxGb\">\u201cTo Duns Scotus real knowledge of anything is a knowledge of its essence as belonging to the eternal order of the universe, as a necessary consequence of the perfection of God. He says: \u2018To know the properties of a triangle by this participation in the divine, by the no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tion of the order of the universe, an expression of the perfection of God, is to know the properties of a triangle in a more noble manner than by the philosophic method.\u2019 To Duns Scotus the Euclidean conception of a triangle is superficial ; to imagine the triangle exhausted by its definition is to miss its real significance; it is only when seen in its relation to the perfection of God that the \u2018reality\u2019 of the triangle is grasped and that it can be said to be understood. This craving for a \u2018deeper reality,\u2019 this tendency to see even the arbitrary creations of the mind as symptomatic of some cosmic principle, is by no means difficult to detect at the present day, although it seldom leads to the creation of so comprehensive and thorough-going a system as that of Duns Scotus.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u201cThe intuitive knowledge of Spinoza, his knowledge of the third kind or \u2018clear knowledge,\u2019 is not unlike the \u2018noble manner\u2019 of knowing of Duns Scotus. It is again knowledge which concerns the relations of the essence of a thing to the attributes of God. In the Farbenlehre of Goethe we have an example of a quite different way of apprehending a triangle, a way that Goethe himself calls mystical. To the mystic the triangle is not to be taken as a thing in itself, either as a mere definition or as a partial expression of the perfection of God; it is merely one embodiment of a principle of triangularity, just as, to the Pythagoreans, the number 8, the octave, love and friendship, harmony, are all expressions of the same thing. Logical relations, physical properties, moral qualities are all as it were, interchangeable on this view. Minds of this kind find analogies and resemblances where 'other minds can trace no connexion whatever. These instances by no means exhaust the methods of understanding the most simple and unambiguous phenomena. There are, for instance, the Hegelian understanding of notion as a manifestation of the dialectical process, and the Bergsonian method of \u2018intellectual sympathy,\u2019 whereby the observer transports himself to the interior of the moving body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AvU\">See Aristotle, On Sophistical Refutations, 165a, 10-12: \u201cFor names (i. e., words) are finite * * * while things are infinite in number.
