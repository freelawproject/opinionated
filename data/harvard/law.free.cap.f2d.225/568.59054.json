The District Court held the increases not authorized by the Act and granted summary judgment for appellees upon cross motions filed by the parties. 125 F.Supp. 643 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-23\">The pertinent provisions of the Act may be summarized as follows: \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 201 formulate the basic salaries for officers and members of the Police and Fire Departments;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 102(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 202(a) provide for \u201clongevity increases\u201d in salary for five years continuous service ; \u00a7 301<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides for increases in pen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>sion allowances<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to reflect the salary-increases granted by the previous sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The question presented is whether the Act grants increases in the pension allowances of individuals retired before its effective date, based upon longevity of active service <em>before </em>retirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We hold that it does. Section 301 provides that \u201ceach individual <em>heretofore </em>or hereafter retired * * * shall be entitled to receive\u201d an increase in pension allowances based upon the increases in salary he would have received under the Act \u201cif he were in active service\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.) Since any such individual would have received the salary increase for longevity of service (\u00a7\u00a7 102(a) and 202(a)), this increase is plainly includible in calculating pension allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The words of the Act are clear and unambiguous. Hence there is no need to consider the legislative history.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But that history does not suggest a different result. The House bill, H.R. 3795, originally contained the following proviso in \u00a7 301:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\"><em>\u201cProvided, </em>that no such individual retired prior to the effective date of this Act shall be entitled to any increase in pension relief allowance or retirement compensation based on longevity increases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">This proviso was struck out, however, by one of several amendments suggested by the Committee on the District of Columbia in favorably reporting upon the bill. In passing the bill as amended,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the House evidenced its intent not to exclude from the benefits of longevity increases those individuals already retired on the effective date of the Act. Nor is any contrary intent to be found in the language of the bill passed by the Senate, which differed only slightly from the House bill.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellees, however, rely on the following language in the Senate Report on its bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-13\">\u201cThis latter proviso is contained in section 301 of H.R. 3795. Those persons already retired prior to the effective date of this Act will get the benefit of the increases in basic compensation provided by this Act in the computation of their pensions or retired pay; but such increases will not include any increases based on longevity for such retired persons. Longevity increases are intended to benefit those in the service at this time, and those retired hereafter will get the benefit of such longevity increases.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">But \u00a7 301 of the House bill contained no proviso at the time this Report was written. Hence the reference to \u201c[t]his latter proviso\u201d strongly suggests that the writer of the Senate Report was under the mistaken impression that the bill under consideration still contained the proviso in question. In any case, one sentence in a Senate Report is not controlling where both houses of Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>have passed a bill containing unambiguous language to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We hold therefore that individuals retired from the Police and Fire Departments before July 1, 1953, are entitled to increases in their pension relief allowances and retirement compensation based upon the longevity increases provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 102(a) and 202(a) of the Act. The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded with directions to enter summary judgment for appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-11\">. 67 Stat. 72 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-12\">.
