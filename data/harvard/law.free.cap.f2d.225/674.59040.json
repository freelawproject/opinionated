The basis for the claim of invalidity is that petitioner was tried by a United States [Army] Court Martial after petitioner had been restored to civilian status, for an alleged offense committed while he was a member of the United States Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-16\">Petitioner seeks to bolster his claim that the district court should have taken jurisdiction and decided the merits of it, by citing Gutterman v. Hiatt, D.C.Pa. 1946, 65 F.Supp. 285, and U. S. ex rel. Pruett v. Hiatt, D.C.1944, 55 F.Supp. 993. Neither of these cases supports the claim. In fact, they are directly against it. It is true the court in the Gutterman case, 65 F.Supp. at page 288, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-17\">\u201c* * * [it] considered petitioner\u2019s contentions as to both sentences in order that he may be fully advised in relation thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-18\">The ruling on the point of using habeas corpus in the circumstances was, however, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-19\">\u201cAs already stated, petitioner is restrained by reason of two sentences, either of which considered independently, would not as yet have expired; consequently, if any one of the two sentences is valid, he would not be entitled to immediate release.\u201d [Citing numerous authorities.] 65 F.Supp. 285, 288.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-20\">This court has held to the principle stated in the quotation, in the following cases: Ex parte Melendez, 9 Cir., 1938, 98 F.2d 791; McNealy v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 1938, 100 F.2d 280; Dunlap v. Swope, 9 Cir., 1939, 103 F.2d 19; De-maurez v. Squier, 9 Cir., 1941, 121 F.2d 960; Graham v. Squier, 9 Cir., 1944, 145 F.2d 348; McDonald v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 1945, 149 F.2d 768; Oddo v. Swope, 9 Cir., 1951, 193 F.2d 492; Woollomes v. Heinze, 9 Cir., 1952, 198 F.2d 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-21\">The Supreme Court of the United States has definitely settled the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>in McNally v. Hill, 1934, 293 U.S. 131, 137, 55 S.Ct. 24, 27, 79 L.Ed. 238, wherein it says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\">\u201cThere is no warrant in either the statute or the writ for its use to invoke judicial determination of questions which could not affect the lawfulness of the custody and detention, and no suggestion of such a use has been found in the commentaries on the English common law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-22\">.
