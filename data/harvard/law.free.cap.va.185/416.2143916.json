E. (2d) 271. Furthermore, such evidence should be based upon or preceded by the filing of a formal pleading\u2014either a petition or a writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ten motion\u2014alleging the necessity of such change, with the opportunity to the opposing party to answer the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The petition for a rehearing urges that we should have determined upon the present record whether the appellant father was entitled to the exclusive custody of the child on the ground that the mother had moved her residence to Washington, D. C., and intended to take the child there and beyond the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In our former opinion we held that the trial court erred in refusing to allow the appellant to file his petition and show, if he can, that for a number of reasons he should have exclusive custody of the child. Under this petition, or a proper amendment thereto, the appellant will have an ample opportunity of showing whether the removal of the child to Washington by its mother is for its best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">With this clarification of our views, the former opinion is adhered to and the rehearing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">\n<em>Rehearing denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
