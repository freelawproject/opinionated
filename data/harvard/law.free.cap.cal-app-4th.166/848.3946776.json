Code, \u00a7 211) and in count 11 with assault with a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The information alleged under each count that the offense had been committed in association with, and for the benefit of, a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)) and that a principal had been armed with a firearm (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)); in addition, the information alleged under counts 1 through 10 that a principal had personally used a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (b), (e)(1)). Appellant pleaded not guilty and denied the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Yuseff Sinclair, who was also charged with the robberies alleged against appellant in counts 9 and 10 and related offenses, was tried with appellant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Trial by jury began on February 8, 2007. Prior to the submission of the case to the jury, the information was amended to charge appellant with an additional count (count 12) of assault with a firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)), accompanied by gang and armed principal allegations (\u00a7\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(A), 12022, subd. (a)(1)). Appellant pleaded not guilty to the new charge. The jury found appellant guilty as charged in the information, as amended, and found the special allegations to be true. The trial court imposed an aggregate sentence of 44 years four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">FACTS<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">Appellant contends that (1) there is insufficient evidence to support the findings regarding the gang enhancements on counts 1 through 8, and (2) there was sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">A. <em>Gang Enhancements</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>B. <em>Sentencing Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in imposing sentence. The trial court sentenced appellant to a term of imprisonment totaling 44 years four months. Regarding count 1, the trial court struck the firearm use enhancement (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (b), (e)(1)), and imposed a sentence of three years, plus a 10-year gang enhancement (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(C)), and a one-year armed principal enhancement (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)). Regarding counts 2 through 10, the trial court struck the gang enhancements (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(C)) and the armed principal enhancements (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)). On each of counts 2 through 8, the trial court imposed a consecutive sentence of one year, plus three years four months for the firearm use enhancement (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (b), (e)(1)); on each of counts 9 and 10, the trial court imposed a concurrent sentence of three years, plus a 10-year firearm use enhancement (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (b), (e)(1)). Finally, on each of counts 11 and 12, the trial court imposed a concurrent sentence of three years, plus a 10-year gang enhancement (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(C)), and a one-year armed principal enhancement (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">1. <em>Count 1 (Robbery of Manuel Peraza)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in imposing sentence on count 1. She argues that the trial court was obliged to impose a 10-year enhancement for firearm use pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivisions (b)(1) and (e), rather than a 10-year gang enhancement pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(C), and thus the additional one-year armed principal enhancement pursuant to section 12022, subdivision (a)(1) must be stayed or stricken. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the trial court was required to impose the 10-year firearm use enhancement, and to impose and stay the one-year armed principal enhancement; in addition, we conclude that the matter must be remanded to the trial court to determine whether to impose and stay the 10-year gang enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">We begin by addressing the gun use enhancement. Subdivisions (b)(1) and (e)(1)(A) of section 12022.53 establish a 10-year enhancement for <em>any </em>principal involved in a violation of section 186.22, subdivision (b), as long as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>some principal in the violation personally used a firearm.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Subdivision (h) of section 12022.53 provides that \u201cthe court shall not strike an allegation under this section or a finding bringing a person within the provisions of this section.\u201d In addition, subdivision (j) of section 12022.53 provides: \u201cWhen an enhancement specified in this section has been admitted or found to be true, the court shall impose punishment for that enhancement pursuant to this section rather than imposing punishment authorized under any other provision of law, unless another enhancement provides for a greater penalty or a longer term of imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The key issue is whether the phrase \u201canother enhancement\u201d in subdivision (j) of section 12022.53 permitted the trial court to impose the greater punishment authorized by a <em>combination </em>of enhancement provisions\u2014that is, section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(C), and section 12022, subdivision (a)(1)\u2014in lieu of the 10-year firearm use enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (e)(1). No court has addressed this question. Generally, in construing a statute, we look first to the plain language of the statute, viewed in context. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez </em>(2008) 43 Cal.4th 1118, 1125-1127 [184 P.3d 702] <em>(Gonzalez).) </em>Here, the phrase \u201canother enhancement\u201d is singular; moreover, within the surrounding sentence, the term \u201cenhancement\u201d is tied to individual enhancement provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The conclusion that the phrase \u201canother enhancement\u201d does not encompass combinations of enhancements finds additional support from <em>People v. Shabazz </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 55 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 750, 130 P.3d 519] <em>(Shabazz). </em>There, our Supreme Court addressed former subdivision (j) of section 12022.53, which provided: \u201cWhen an enhancement specified in this section has been admitted or found to be true, the court shall impose punishment [for that enhancement] pursuant to this section rather than imposing punishment authorized under any other provision of law, unless <em>another provision of law </em>provides for a greater penalty or a longer term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>(Shabazz, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at pp. 67-70, italics added &amp; omitted.) The court concluded that the italicized language meant \u201canother enhancement provision,\u201d rather than \u201cany sentencing provision that provides for a sentence greater than that specified [section] 12022.53.\u201d <em>(Shabazz, </em>at pp. 67-70, italics omitted.) The Legislature subsequently amended subdivision (j) to reflect the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation. (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 1661 (2001-2002 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>Reg. Sess.); see Stats. 2002, ch. 901.) Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, subdivision (j) of section 12022.53, by its plain language, mandated the imposition of the 10-year gun use enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Regarding the remaining enhancements, our Supreme Court recently explained in <em>Gonzalez </em>that when a section 12022.53 enhancement must be imposed, the trial court is obliged to impose and <em>stay </em>an additional enhancement under section 12022.5. Subdivision (f) of section 12022.53 provides: \u201cAn enhancement involving a firearm specified in Section 12021.5, 12022, 12022.3, 12022.4, 12022.5, or 12022.55 shall not be imposed on a person in addition to an enhancement imposed pursuant to this section.\u201d  The court in <em>Gonzalez </em>determined that the term \u201cimpose,\u201d as found in subdivision (f) and other portions of section 12022.53, means \u201cimpose and then execute,\u201d and thus held that when the trial court imposes a section 12022.53 enhancement, it must impose and stay an additional enhancement under subdivision 12022.5. <em>(Gonzalez, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th at pp. 1127-1130.) The court reasoned that its construction of subdivision (f) best promoted the legislative purposes underlying section 12022.53, namely, the deterrence and punishment of gun violence. (Gonzalez, at p. 1129.) Under <em>Gonzalez, </em>the trial court was obliged to impose and stay the one-year armed principal enhancement pursuant to section 12022, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">In view of <em>Gonzalez, </em>we also conclude that subdivision (e)(2) of section 12022.53 authorized\u2014but did not oblige\u2014the trial court to impose and stay the 10-year gang enhancement pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(C). Subdivision (e)(2) provides that such enhancements <em>\u201cshall not be imposed on a person in addition to an enhancement imposed pursuant to this subdivision, </em>unless the person personally used or personally discharged a firearm in the commission of the offense.\u201d (Italics added.) Because the jury made no finding that appellant personally used a gun in connection with the robbery charged in count 1, we must interpret the language italicized above, with an eye to harmonizing section 12022.53 internally and facilitating legislative intent <em>(Gonzalez, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th at pp. 1125-1126). As the italicized language is similar to that interpreted in <em>Gonzalez, </em>subdivision (e)(2) of section 12022.53 authorized the trial court to impose and stay the gang enhancement on count l.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Our conclusion regarding subdivision (e)(2) of section 12022.53 departs from <em>Gonzalez </em>in one respect due to a difference between the gang enhancement and enhancements under sections 12022.5 and 12022, subdivision (a)(1). Subdivision (g) of section 186.22 accords the trial court discretion to strike a gang enhancement \u201cwhere the interests of justice would best be served.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> No analogous provision in sections 12022.5 or 12022 permits the striking of enhancements under section 12022.5 or 12022, subdivision (a)(1).  In view of this difference, we conclude the trial court was obliged to impose and stay the gang enhancement on count 1, <em>unless </em>it exercised its discretion to strike the enhancement under subdivision (g) of section 186.22. Here, the trial court struck the gang enhancement on count 1 solely on the basis of a misapprehension concerning section 12022.53, subdivision (e)(2). Accordingly, the matter must be remanded to the trial court to impose and stay the gang enhancement on count 1, unless the court exercises its discretion to strike the enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (g). <em>(People v. Carmony </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 367, 378 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 880, 92 P.3d 369] [an abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court, in ruling, is unaware of its discretion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">2. <em>Counts 11 and 12 (Assault with a Firearm on Ricardo Reyes and April Pope)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in imposing sentence on counts 11 and 12. She argues that the underlying offense, namely, assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)), involved personal use of a firearm as an element, and thus the trial court improperly imposed a one-year armed principal enhancement pursuant to section 12022, subdivision (a)(1). In addition, she argues that because the underlying offense is a serious felony (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(23)), rather than a violent felony (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)), the trial court could properly impose only a five-year gang enhancement pursuant to subdivision (b)(1)(B) of section 186.22. In our view, these contentions are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Subdivision (a)(1) of section 12022 authorizes a one-year enhancement for the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, \u201cunless the arming is an element of that offense.\u201d Under section 245, subdivision (a)(2), \u201cAny person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a firearm shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years . . . .\u201d  Accordingly, to establish a conviction under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>provision, \u201cthe prosecution must prove the defendant used a firearm in the commission of the offense.\u201d <em>(In re Jose A. </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 697, 700 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 44]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Maldonado </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 627, 633-635 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 117].) As appellant suffered felony convictions under subdivision (a)(2) of section 245, the trial court erred in imposing the one-year enhancements on counts 11 and 12. Respondent agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Subdivision (b)(1)(B) of section 186.22 authorizes a five-year enhancement when the underlying offense is a \u201cserious felony,\u201d as defined in section 1192.7, subdivision (c); in addition, subdivision (b)(1)(C) of section 186.22 authorizes a 10-year enhancement when the underlying offense is a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d as defined in section 667.5, subdivision (c). Subdivision (c)(23) of section 1192.7 includes as a serious felony \u201cany felony in which the defendant personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon,\u201d and thus encompasses assault with a firearm (see <em>People v. Maldonado, </em>supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p. 635 [\u201cin the scheme of section 245, assaults with a firearm are treated as an especially dangerous type of assault with a deadly weapon\u201d]). Because assault with a firearm is not listed as a violent felony in section 667.5, the trial court was required to impose only the five-year gang enhancement on counts 11 and 12. Again, respondent agrees. In sum, the judgment regarding each of counts 11 and 12 must be modified to strike the one-year armed principal enhancement (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)) and 10-year gang enhancement (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(C)), and to reflect that a five-year gang enhancement (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(B)) has been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">3. Other Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In view of our conclusions regarding count 1 (see pt. B.I., <em>ante), </em>the trial court erred in imposing sentence on counts 2 through 10. Regarding these counts, the trial court struck the gang enhancements (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(C)) pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (e)(2), and the armed principal enhancements (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)), pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (f). For the reasons explained above, the trial court was obliged to impose and stay the armed principal enhancements, rather than strike them, and to impose and stay the gang enhancements, unless it struck the enhancements under section 186.22, subdivision (g). We also note that the abstract of judgment recites no sentence for count 12. The abstract of judgment must be amended to correct this error.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">The judgment is reversed with respect to the sentence, and the matter is remanded to the trial court with the following directions: on count 1, to impose a 10-year gun use enhancement (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (b), (e)(1)), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>impose and stay a one-year armed principal enhancement (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)), and impose and stay a 10-year gang enhancement (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(C)), unless the trial court exercises its discretion to strike the gang enhancement (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (g)); on each of counts 2 through 10, to impose and stay a one-year armed principal enhancement (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)), and impose and stay a 10-year gang enhancement (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(C)), unless the trial court exercises its discretion to strike the gang enhancement (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (g)); and on each of counts 11 and 12, to strike the one-year armed principal enhancement (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)) and 10-year gang enhancement (\u00a7 186.22, subd.. (b)(1)(C)), and impose a five-year gang enhancement (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(B)). The judgment is affirmed in all other respects. The trial court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment that reflects these rulings and recites a sentence for count 12 (see pt. B.3., <em>ante), </em>and to forward a copy of the amended abstract of judgment to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Epstein, P.
