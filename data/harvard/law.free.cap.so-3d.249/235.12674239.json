Defendant, Bernard Lampton, filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief arguing two assignments of error. For the reasons that follow, we affirm defendant's convictions and sentences on counts one through five and counts seven through nine, affirm defendant's conviction on counts six, vacate defendant's sentence on count six, and remand to the trial court for resentencing on count six. We further grant appellate counsel's motion to withdraw as counsel of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 27, 2014, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging defendant, Bernard J. Lampton, with two counts of attempted first degree murder in violation of La. R.S. 14:27:30 (counts one and two), two counts of felon in possession of a firearm in violation of La. R.S. 14:95.1 (counts three and four), possession of a stolen firearm in violation of La. R.S. 14:69.1 (count five), aggravated flight from an officer in violation of La. R.S. 14:108.1C (count six), conspiracy to distribute heroin in violation of La. R.S. 40:979 and La. R.S. 40:966A (count seven), possession with the intent to distribute cocaine in violation of La. R.S. 40:967A (count eight); and possession with the intent to distribute heroin in violation of La. R.S. 40:966A (count nine). On August 28, 2014, defendant pled not guilty at his arraignment. Defendant filed numerous motions, including a motion for preliminary hearing, and motions to suppress evidence, statement, and identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 9, 2015, defendant withdrew his not guilty pleas and pled guilty as charged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court sentenced defendant to twenty-five years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence on counts one and two; twenty years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence on counts three and four; five\n   years imprisonment at hard labor on counts five and six; twenty-five years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence on count seven; twenty-five years imprisonment at hard labor with the first two years without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence on count eight; twenty-five years imprisonment at hard labor with the first ten years without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence on count nine. The trial court ordered all sentences to run concurrently with one another and with his sentence in district court case number 14-4626.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 5, 2017, defendant filed an application for post-conviction relief, seeking an out-of-time appeal. On June 26, 2017, the trial court granted defendant's request for an out-of-time appeal. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because defendant entered guilty pleas, the underlying facts were not fully developed at a trial. However, during the guilty plea colloquy, the State provided the following factual basis for the guilty pleas:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [O]n July 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2014, Mr. Lampton went to a location to complete a heroin sale that was arranged before the time he arrived with an individual whom he had previously, within that preceding week, engaged in a heroin transaction. Police officers approached him upon arrival. As he sat in his car, the police officers exited their car. Mr. Lampton fired a shot at one of the officers, missing him, striking the officer's vehicle. Mr. Lampton then began driving his car through the police officers and their vehicles striking one of the police officers and knocking him to the side. All officers then began a pursuit with lights and sirens-And, by the way, all those officers had identified themselves as police officers and had their identification clearly displayed. All the officers began pursuit, and that pursuit included more vehicles that had lights and sirens going. During the course of the pursuit, Mr. Lampton made a left to run away, disregarding multiple traffic signals and traveled in excess of thirty miles an hour over the speed limit. Ultimately his car was stopped. When his car was stopped, a quantity of drugs was found in the car. Search along the pathway revealed that one gun was recovered and other drugs were recovered along the path that the vehicle followed. A second gun was fired but not recovered, according to the police investigation. The amounts of drugs that were found, which were both heroin and cocaine, were consistent with an intent to distribute. The only gun that was recovered was a .40 caliber Glock, and that gun was established to have been stolen. At the time that he possessed that Glock and the second gun, which was the gun that was fired at Lieutenant Donald Meunier, Mr. Lampton had previously been convicted of the crime of possession of Ecstasy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under the procedure adopted by this Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Supreme Court explained that an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief must demonstrate by full discussion and analysis that appellate counsel \"has cast an advocate's eye over the trial record and considered whether any ruling made by the trial court, subject to the contemporaneous objection rule, had a significant, adverse impact on shaping the evidence presented to the jury for its consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11870799\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/241/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When conducting a review for compliance with\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   , an appellate court must conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the appeal is wholly frivolous.\n   <em>\n    Bradford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n    676 So.2d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Appellate counsel contends that defendant pled guilty and was sentenced pursuant to a counseled plea agreement and that he did not reserve the right to seek review of any trial court rulings. He argues that there does not appear to be a basis in the record to support a claim that the guilty plea was constitutionally infirm as the plea colloquy and guilty plea form properly advised defendant of his rights. Appellate counsel states that defendant was advised that by pleading guilty he was giving up his rights to an appeal and that his plea is supported by a detailed executed waiver of rights form, including a colloquy with the trial court. Appellate counsel asserts that defendant's plea agreement was advantageous and defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Appellate counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record wherein he stated he notified defendant that he filed an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief and that defendant had a right to file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief in this appeal. Additionally, this Court sent defendant a\n   letter by certified mail informing him that an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief had been filed and that he had until October 19, 2017 to file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief. Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Our independent review of the record supports appellate counsel's assertion that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The bill of information properly charged defendant and plainly and concisely stated the essential facts constituting the offenses charged. It also sufficiently identified defendant and the crimes charged. See La. C.Cr.P. arts. 462 - 466. Further, as reflected by the minute entries and commitment, defendant and his counsel appeared at all crucial stages of the proceedings against him, including his arraignment, guilty pleas, and sentencing. Thus, there are no appealable issues regarding defendant's presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Further, defendant pled guilty in this case. When a defendant pleads guilty, he waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings leading to the guilty plea and precludes review of such defects either by appeal or post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v. Wingerter\n   </em>\n   , 05-697 (La. App. 5 Cir. 03/14/06),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8440853\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/926/662/#p664\">\n    926 So.2d 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 664. Therefore, it appears that all non-jurisdictional defects were waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   No rulings were preserved for appeal under the holding in\n   <em>\n    State v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9676631\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/584/\">\n    338 So.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1976). Although defendant filed several pre-trial motions, including motions to suppress evidence, statement, and identification, the record does not show that the trial court ruled upon defendant's motions prior to the time defendant pled guilty and defendant did not object. When the trial court does not hear or rule on a pretrial motion, and the defendant does not object prior to pleading guilty, the motion is considered waived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State v. Corzo\n   </em>\n   , 04-791 (La.

Therefore, defendant's motions are waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Once a defendant is sentenced, only those guilty pleas that are constitutionally infirm may be withdrawn by appeal or post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v. McCoil\n   </em>\n   , 05-658 (La. App. 5 Cir. 02/27/06),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8449925\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/1120/#p1124\">\n    924 So.2d 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1124. A guilty plea is constitutionally infirm if it is not entered freely and voluntarily, if the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   colloquy is inadequate, or when a defendant is induced to enter the plea by a plea bargain or what he justifiably believes was a plea bargain and that bargain is not kept.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8449925\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/1120/#p1124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A review of the record reveals no constitutional infirmity in defendant's guilty pleas. Defendant was aware he was pleading guilty to two counts of attempted first degree murder, two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, one count of possession of a stolen firearm, one count of aggravated flight from an officer, one count of conspiracy to distribute heroin, one count of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine, and one count of possession with the intent to distribute heroin. In the waiver of rights form and during the colloquy, defendant was advised of his right to a jury trial, his right to confrontation, and his privilege against\n   self-incrimination as required by\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   . Defendant signed the waiver of rights form indicating that he understood he was waiving his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   rights by pleading guilty. During the colloquy, defendant also stated that he understood he was waiving those rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Also during his guilty plea colloquy, defendant stated that he had not been forced, coerced, or threatened into entering his guilty pleas. Defendant stated that he understood these convictions could be used against him in the future to enhance or increase any future penalties. He was advised during the colloquy and by the waiver of rights form of the minimum and maximum sentences of imprisonment and the actual sentences that would be imposed if his guilty pleas were accepted. After the colloquy, the trial court accepted defendant's pleas as knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant's sentences were imposed pursuant to, and in conformity with, the plea agreement. La. C.Cr.P. art. 881.2A(2) precludes a defendant from seeking review of a sentence imposed in conformity with a plea agreement, which was set forth in the record at the time of the plea.\n   <em>\n    State v. Moore\n   </em>\n   , 06-875 (La. App. 5 Cir. 04/11/07),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8305997\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/958/36/\">\n    958 So.2d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Washington\n   </em>\n   , 05-211 (La. App. 5 Cir. 10/06/05),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9020490\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/916/1171/#p1173\">\n    916 So.2d 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1173. Further, defendant's sentences for all counts except count six fall within the sentencing range prescribed by the statutes. See La. R.S. 14:27D(1)(a); La. R.S. 14:30 ; La. R.S. 14:95.1B; La. R.S. 14:69.1B(1); La. R.S. 14:108.1E ; La. R.S. 40:797B; La. R.S. 40:967(4)(b) ; La. R.S. 40:966B. Moreover, defendant's plea agreement was beneficial to him in that the sentences were ordered to run concurrently and with district court case number 14-4626, and the State agreed not to file an habitual offender bill of information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   However, the trial court erred in sentencing defendant on count six, aggravated flight from an officer. The transcript reflects that the trial court sentenced defendant on count six to five years imprisonment at hard labor. While the transcript reflects that defendant was advised that the sentencing range had a maximum of two years, his plea agreement and the guilty plea colloquy show that he was advised he would receive five years imprisonment on count six. At the time of the offense, the statute provided for a penalty of imprisonment at hard labor of not more than two years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See La. R.S. 14:108.1E. Therefore, we find that the sentence on count six is illegally harsh because it is beyond the maximum allowed by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. art. 882, an appellate court can correct an illegal sentence at any time. An appellate court is authorized to correct an illegal sentence when the exercise of sentencing discretion is not involved.\n   <em>\n    State v. Durapau\n   </em>\n   , 01-511 (La. App. 5 Cir. 10/30/01),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9472584\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/800/1052/\">\n    800 So.2d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1054 ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Ross\n   </em>\n   , 09-431 (La. App. 5 Cir. 11/24/09),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7049928\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/28/475/#p489\">\n    28 So.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 489-90. The sentence on count six is illegal because it exceeds the two-year statutory maximum allowed under La. R.S. 14:108.1. Because the correction of this error necessarily involves the discretion of the trial court, we vacate defendant's sentence on count six and remand to the trial court for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because appellate counsel's brief adequately demonstrates by full discussion and analysis that he has reviewed the trial court proceedings and cannot identify any basis for a non-frivolous appeal and our independent review of the record supports counsel's assertion, appellate counsel's motion to withdraw as attorney of record is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pro Se\n    </em>\n    Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief, defendant contends that \"there are legal points arguable on the merits that trial counsel and appellate counsel overlooked.\" He argues that he had a viable entrapment defense. He contends that the confidential informant in this case, with the aid and inducement of \"Agent Clements,\" persuaded him to commit the crime of conspiracy to distribute heroin, distribution of cocaine, and possession with intent to distribute heroin. He argues that trial and appellate counsel were ineffective because had they investigated or even read the police reports, they would have urged an entrapment defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Entrapment is a defense that arises when a law enforcement official or a person acting in cooperation with such an official for the purpose of obtaining evidence of a crime, originates the idea of the crime and then induces the person to engage in conduct constituting the offense when that person is not otherwise disposed to do so.\n   <em>\n    State v.
