(\"the former husband\") has petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus directed to the Baldwin Juvenile Court (\"the juvenile court\") in postdivorce proceedings between him and K.M.G. (\"the former wife\"). The former husband and the former wife have been involved in litigation for years, and their filings have created a procedural quagmire. In his current lengthy petition to this court, the former husband argues extensively about an exhaustive number of issues arising from numerous cases. Despite the inclusion of an extensive amount of extraneous material, the focus of the current petition is a claim that the juvenile court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to enter an order in a specific case on June 29, 2017. The former husband seeks the writ of mandamus to compel the juvenile court to vacate that order. The former husband made factual assertions in support of his petition. The former wife did not respond to the former husband's petition; therefore, we are required to \"consider the averments of fact in [the] petition as true.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9346028\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/840/132/#p135\">\n    840 So.2d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135 (Ala. 2002).

The procedural history pertinent to the former husband's amended Rule 60(b) motion in the .05 action and his Rule 60(b) motions in the original action and in the .04 action is not clear from the materials before us, but it appears that the juvenile court held a hearing on the former husband's motions on January 26, 2017. On March 9, 2017, before the juvenile court ruled on the former husband's motions, the former husband filed a petition for the writ of mandamus in this court directed to the .04 action, which was docketed as appellate case no. 2160397 (\"\n   <em>\n    T.T. II\n   </em>\n   \"). In his petition, the former husband asked this court to direct the juvenile court to rule on his Rule 60(b) motion in the .04 action. The filing of the petition for the writ of mandamus did not deprive the juvenile court of jurisdiction in the .04 action. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

Copies of the Final Judgment of Divorce and Separation Agreement that was incorporated therein were referenced by the Court in the .00 [action, i.e., the original action,] and were filed numerous times over the years in the various other cases. However, no action was ever commenced nor motion made by the State of Alabama in that initial case filing to have those previous orders domesticated or registered as foreign decrees, and no\n   order was ever made to that effect. The failure to do so results in this court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and any orders to modify that initial order or to hold the [former husband] in contempt of that initial order are void.

On April 11, 2017, the juvenile court entered an order in the .04 action dismissing the action without prejudice.

On May 26, 2017, the former husband filed a motion to strike the former wife's March 31, 2017, motion in the .05 action, in which he asserted, among other things, that the juvenile court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case. Also on May 26, 2017, the former husband filed a \"motion to dismiss\" in the .05 action, in which he appeared to seek dismissal of the .05 action and all pending motions based, in part, on a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On June 29, 2017, after a hearing, the juvenile court entered the following order in the .05 action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"This matter having come before the Court on the [former wife's] motion to alter, amend or vacate an order of the Court related to the [former husband's] Rule 60 motion in this cause, and the Court having considered the law and the arguments from both sides, the Court hereby ORDERS, ADJUDGES and DECREES as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"1. The Court grants the [former wife's] motion to alter, amend or vacate and hereby vacates its prior order in this matter of March 10, 2017, wherein the Court found that there was no subject matter jurisdiction in the case due to the Georgia order not being registered properly pursuant to [the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act ('UIFSA') ]. However, the Court finds in favor of the [former husband] on his Rule 60 motion as follows.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"2. First, UIFSA was not adopted until after the initial order in this case was entered. [The Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act ('URESA') ] was the law in effect at that time, and URESA did not contain the same strict registration requirements that UIFSA does.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"3. However, the Court finds that this matter was not truly a case that fell under URESA as the initial action in this case did not seek to enforce a Georgia order. In the first petition in 1995, the State of Alabama filed to initiate a child support order based on (1) [Aid to Dependent Children benefits] that had been provided to the children and for which the State sought reimbursement, and (2) because the State claimed that the divorce of the parties was granted in 1994 and the final judgment of divorce did not contain any order of support or an attached settlement agreement of the parties regarding support. Therefore, the State was not attempting to enforce the Georgia order at all, but establish child support in Alabama.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"4. The Court at that time had subject matter jurisdiction based on the fact that Alabama was the home state of the [children], both parents resided here, and the State had provided benefits to the [children]. Further, the State had personal jurisdiction over the [former husband] as he lived and worked in Alabama. Therefore, the initial order of support is a valid and binding order, establishing support effective 7/1/95 in the amount of $370 per month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"5. Subsequently, Judge Lang Floyd entered several orders following petitions for contempt that were filed, and in February of 2004 all arrears from the Alabama order were deemed paid in full.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"6. In 2011, following a motion for contempt, Judge Carmen Bosch entered an order that purported to calculate an arrearage from the [former husband] from 1992 forward from a Georgia court order entered prior to the divorce in that matter. While the [former husband] alleges that Judge Bosch should be disqualified due to her prosecuting the initial action, this Court does not need to address this issue, as the Court finds the order VOID on other grounds, to-wit: at that time of that proceeding UIFSA was in place and required registration of an out of state order before it could be enforced. No such registration occurred. Because of the foregoing finding, the Court declines to address whether or not the previous orders entered by Judge Floyd would render this order void on the grounds of res judicata.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"7. Under the Alabama order, child support terminated by operation of law on March 5, 2008, when the last minor child reached the age of majority. Giving the [former husband] credit for all payments made pursuant to the Alabama order from February 2004 to the last payment made in 2014, the Court finds that the [former husband] is in arrears in child support in the amount of $3,103.92 with interest of $7,023.95.
