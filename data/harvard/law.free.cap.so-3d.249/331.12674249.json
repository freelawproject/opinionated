David Thomas admitted in oral and written statements to police that he and Jontez Garvis had attacked Fred Jackson and stolen cash from him. After being hospitalized for forty-one days due to the injuries inflicted by the two men, Jackson died. Thomas was indicted for and convicted of capital murder. The trial court sentenced Thomas to life in prison without parole. After review, we affirm Thomas's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On January 29, 2012, Sean Snow, a deputy sheriff, responded to Tri-State Recycling, also known as The Can Man, located at 416 Woodrow Wilson Drive in the City of Jackson, First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, pursuant to a 911 call. The 911 caller reported that a man was lying unresponsive behind The Can Man. Deputy Snow found the man, who later was identified as Fred Jackson, lying on his back. According to Deputy Snow, Jackson's \"[f]ace was kind of bluish gray,\" his face was bruised, and he had \"dried up blood on the right-hand side of his head.\" Deputy Snow called American Medical Response (\"AMR\") and the fire department to the scene and they transported Jackson to University of Mississippi Medical Center (\"UMMC\"). Deputy Snow accompanied Jackson to UMMC where a physician informed him that Jackson had a \"fifty/fifty chance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Deputy Snow obtained and reviewed surveillance videotape footage from The Can Man. He testified that, on the surveillance videotape footage, he had observed two men entering The Can Man, moving to the rear of the property, and proceeding behind a parked truck. The two men \"appeared to be striking Mr. Jackson\" and\n   continued doing so \"somewhere around fourty [sic], forty-one, seconds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Officer Felix Hodge of the Robbery Homicide Division of the Jackson Police Department received a tip that David Thomas was in a room at the Studio 6 Motel on Interstate-55 North. The record is silent as to how Thomas had become a suspect. According to Officer Hodge, the room was registered to a Tera Johnson and when an attempt was made to contact the occupant of the room, Thomas initially said his name was Jerrell Davis. After Thomas was taken into custody, Officer Hodge recited\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   warnings and obtained Thomas's written waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Officer Hodge then interviewed Thomas. A video recording of the interview was played for the jury at Thomas's trial. Thomas said during the interview that he had gone to The Can Man to \"get a battery to get cash\" in order to finance a visit to Nightlife, a nightclub at which a rapper by the name of Future was to perform a show. In the jury's presence, Officer Hodge read the statement Thomas gave:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Jontez [Garvis] came to my house that morning and got me. He asked me was I ready to go get those batteries? He said that he needed money for child support and pampers for his baby. We went through the pathway in the place. We were looking around but didn't find the batteries. I heard a noise, like, a welding machine or a generator. I asked [Garvis] did he hear that? And he said: No. I saw the truck. And I said: Man, there is somebody out here. He said: So, we can get him. We went up to the man and attacked him. I hit him once. [Garvis] hit him two or three times. We weren't planning on it to happen to him like that. I was scared from that morning on. [Garvis] called somebody to come pick us up. We went to the house. And I thought about it. We prayed that [Jackson] would make it through, and everything would be okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thomas also indicated in his written statement and in the interview that he and Garvis had taken $250 from Jackson and that they had hit him with the rod with which he had been welding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6. After forty-one days at UMMC, Jackson died on March 9, 2012. On May 9, 2012, Thomas and Garvis were indicted jointly for capital murder. The State did not seek the death penalty and requested that the cases \"be severed for purposes of jury trial.\" The Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County granted the motion to sever Thomas's and Garvis's jury trials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7. Dr. Erin Barnhart, who in 2012 was a deputy medical examiner with the Mississippi Medical Examiner's Office, testified that she performed the autopsy on Jackson on March 10, 2012. Dr. Barnhart testified that Jackson's head had suffered multiple fractures: \"fractures of the calvarium, or top of the head; fractures at the base of the skull which is the inner aspect of the cranial cavity; and multiple fractures of his face.\" She continued: \"[H]e had [ ] partially healed cerebral contusions or bruising of the brain\" and \"a subdural hematoma [,] which means blood within the cranial cavity between the brain and the surface of the skull.\" Dr. Barnhart testified, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, that the cause of Jackson's death was complications of blunt head trauma, and the manner of his death was homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8. On cross-examination, Dr. Barnhart was asked about a notation in the autopsy report of \"probable aspiration pneumonia.\" According to Dr. Barnhart, aspiration\n   pneumonia\"is generally caused when someone cannot protect their airway,\" meaning \"that they have an altered level of consciousness and therefore may aspirate or breath in mucus, and hence bacteria that are in their mouth,\" therefore, \"a pneumonia may develop.\" Dr. Barnhart testified that Jackson was to be discharged to a nursing home. She stated that the aspiration pneumonia may have contributed to Jackson's death, but that aspiration pneumonia could be ruled out as a cause of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. The trial court denied Thomas's motion for a directed verdict. After consultation with the trial court and defense counsel about his right to testify in his defense, Thomas decided not to do so. The defense intended to call two witnesses, Dr. Steven Hayne and Jontez Garvis, for Thomas's case-in-chief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. Pretrial, the State had moved\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude the testimony of Dr. Hayne. After a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   hearing, the trial court granted the State's motion and excluded Dr. Hayne's testimony. The defense moved for reconsideration\n   <em>\n    ore tenus\n   </em>\n   before its case-in-chief, and the trial court denied the motion. The defense then called Jontez Garvis to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. After the close of testimony and closing arguments, the jury retired to deliberate. It found Thomas guilty of capital murder. The trial court sentenced Thomas to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The trial court denied Thomas's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12. Thomas now appeals. His counsel raises two issues. First, he argues that the State failed to adduce sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict. Second, he argues that the trial court erred by excluding Thomas's proposed expert defense witness, Dr. Hayne. Thomas also has filed a supplemental brief,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , in which he raises the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1. Whether the trial court erred by finding Thomas competent to stand trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   2. Whether the trial court erred by denying Thomas's motion to recuse the trial judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   3. Whether the trial court misapplied\n   <em>\n    Batson v.

Whether cumulative error requires reversal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13. We address each issue in turn. For clarity, we will address Thomas's pro-se claim concerning Dr. Hayne together with his counsel's claim. We also will combine our discussion of the errors that Thomas claims concerning the jury instructions. Additional facts and procedural history will be discussed as necessary for each issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Whether the State adduced sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 14. Thomas's counsel first argues that \"[t]he expert testimony from Dr. Barnhart shows that the State failed to\n   prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any damage inflicted by the Defendant was the legal cause of death.\" Dr. Barnhart testified, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, that the cause of Jackson's death was complications of blunt head trauma, and the manner of his death was homicide. Dr. Barhnart testified that aspiration pneumonia\"certainly may been contributory,\" but that aspiration pneumonia could be ruled out as a cause of Jackson's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15.

Thomas admitted to police that he had gone to The Can Man location with Garvis and he admitted that he had attacked Jackson: \"I hit him once.

The defense took the position at trial that Thomas was at The Can Man and had participated in the robbery, but that the cause of Jackson's death was not the injuries sustained during the robbery, but rather aspiration pneumonia which was contracted during Jackson's hospital stay. On appeal, the defense maintains its argument that the testimony of Dr. Barnhart was insufficient to support the capital-murder conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 18. This Court considered a case in which the victim had been shot six times and died in the hospital \"several days after his admission for treatment of his gunshot wounds....\"\n   <em>\n    Holliday v.

The issue here is whether the trial court erred in finding that Dr. Hayne's testimony did not meet the Mississippi standards for admissibility. This Court never has held that the defendant's entitlement to an expert witness obviates a determination of the admissibility of the expert's proposed testimony under Mississippi Rule of Evidence 702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 24.

It seems unlikely that he died from probable aspiration pneumonia as reported in the postmortem examination and that he would have a protected airway with a tracheostomy tube in place. Furthermore, feeding and nutrition was provided through a gastrostomy catheter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Dr. Hayne said that Jackson's physicians had indicated that he had required \"24-hour a day, seven-day a week care and he needed to be in a nursing home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 25. During the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing, Dr. Hayne proffered testimony that Jackson had died from nosocomial pneumonia, or hospital-acquired pneumonia. He maintained that he could discern Jackson's cause of death from Jackson's medical records, which indicated that UMMC had administered \"Staph aureus medication,\" a \"specific treatment for Pneumonia, hospital acquired.\" Dr. Hayne continued that the manner of death was \"therapeutic complication,\" which he agreed is a relatively new manner of death classification. Dr. Hayne stated that \"therapeutic complication\" is used \"in multiple jurisdictions\" as a cause of death. He referenced only New Jersey and Connecticut, but then said that use of \"therapeutic complication\" as a cause of death is \"growing very rapidly.\" Dr. Hayne agreed that \"therapeutic complication\" as a cause of death never has been accepted by a court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 26. The trial court granted the State's motion to exclude Dr. Hayne's testimony, finding it \"entirely too speculative to be submitted to the jury in any fashion.\" The trial court found that Dr. Hayne had not testified to a reasonable degree of medical certainty and that his report \"is devoid of any such medical certainty.\" The trial court referenced Dr. Hayne's use of \"uncertain terms such as 'it seems unlikely that [Jackson] died from probable aspiration pneumonia.' \" Moreover, the trial court observed that \"it is undisputed that the victim was in the hospital strictly because of the severe injuries he sustained during the alleged beating by this defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The defense moved for reconsideration\n   <em>\n    ore tenus\n   </em>\n   before its case-in-chief and the trial court denied the motion, reasoning that \"Dr. Hayne's opinions were speculative and unsure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 27. Here, it is clear from the record that Dr. Hayne's opinions were not offered to a reasonable degree of medical certainty. Dr. Hayne indicated that the \"therapeutic complication\" cause of death classification never has been accepted in court. The trial court also recognized that Dr. Hayne used \"uncertain terms such as 'it seems unlikely that [Jackson] died from probable aspiration pneumonia.' \" Accordingly, the trial court cannot be said to have abused his discretion in excluding Dr. Hayne's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 28. Further, as discussed in Issue I, we have held that \"[t]he unlawful act or omission of accused need not be the sole cause of death.

Here, the trial court appointed Dr. Benjamin Root to perform a competency evaluation on Thomas. Dr. Root assessed Thomas on December 12, 2013, and reported \"to a reasonable medical certainty that the defendant is incompetent to stand trial at this time.\" Dr. Root observed that Thomas \"cannot work with his attorney and cannot comprehend his legal situation to any reasonable level that would pass constitutional muster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 32. On June 17, 2014, the trial court conducted a competency hearing.

Dr. Root was cross-examined with regard to errors in the report he produced, including the defendant's race.

After Dr. Root's testimony at the hearing, the State proposed, and the defense agreed, that Thomas should have another medical examination done at the Mississippi State Hospital at Whitfield, Mississippi.

In the absence of an objection or a request to cross-examine Dr. Lott, the trial court found Thomas competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 35.

According to Kelly, Circuit Judge Jeff Weill, Sr., had authored a letter to the Hinds County Board of Supervisors asserting \"that the appointment [of] private attorneys [was] necessary because the attorney Alison Kelly, attorney of record in the case at bar, is both an incompetent and non law-abiding attorney.\" Judge Weill had stated in the letter to the Board of Supervisors that \" 'good cause' has been shown to preclude\n   Ms. Kelly from participating in any matter involving indigent representation in my courtroom ...\" and that \"I want the board to be aware that Ms. Kelly's failure to comply with the law and the requirements of her position will necessarily result in some additional expense by way of appointment of separate counsel.\" The trial court denied the motion for recusal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 37.

In\n   <em>\n    Hartfield\n   </em>\n   , the trial court evaluated the defense's proffered race-neutral reason for the strike, that a prospective white juror \"had been asleep during voir dire.\"\n   <em>\n    Hartfield\n   </em>\n   , 161 So.3d at 139. The defense had exercised its \"first seven peremptory strikes on white jurors, while accepting all African-American jurors tendered.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138. The trial court in that case determined that the proffered race-neutral reason for the prospective juror's exclusion was pretext, having himself observed that the prospective juror \"had not been sleeping, but had yawned and closed his eyes ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 44. Here, the trial court found that the State had made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that the defense had engaged in race discrimination in jury selection. The court then asked defense counsel \"to state a non-race, non-gender or non-religious based reason\" to justify the peremptory strikes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 45. With regard to Loicka Hodges, the first white juror struck by the defense, Defense counsel said that she did not bow her head to pray with the other venire members when the trial court had offered a prayer earlier in the proceedings. Defense counsel also pointed out that Hodges had been born in France and had spent thirty \"or so years of her life in France.\" Defense counsel expressed concern with regard to the \"possible distinction she's going to make between the laws of France versus the laws of the United States.\" Finally, defense counsel stated that Hodges had not participated in\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   \"in almost any fashion\" and that he \"didn't really get any answers from her.\" The trial court granted the State's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge and allowed Hodges to sit as a juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 46. Defense counsel stated that Edward Milam, the second prospective white juror struck, had not spoken during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   by the State or by the defense: \"since he never talked[,] the unknown is so large.\" According to defense counsel, Milam worked at McNeely Plastics, possibly as a tradesman. Defense counsel continued: \"if he is a tradesman, I don't want a juror placing themselves in the shoes of the victim in this case ....\" Defense counsel stated, \"I don't know if [Milam] was paying attention during voir dire. But I know he did not participate.\" The trial court found the defense's justification for the strike to have been pretextual and that the defense \"was engaged in purposeful discrimination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 47. Defense counsel argued that he struck Danny Fultz, the third prospective white juror, because of his work as a machinist at Eaton Aerospace. The victim in the case was a welder and was welding at the time of the attack. Defense counsel also mentioned that \"we brought him back\" and \"[h]e gave us some more information.\" When \"brought back,\" Fultz had informed the court and the lawyers that his father had been a victim of \"an investor [who] cheated him out of some money\" and that, due to his father's experience,\" he \"hope[d]\" that he could be impartial. The trial court allowed the defense to strike Fultz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 48. Evidence in the record supports the trial court's determination that the defense's proffered race-neutral reasons for striking the jurors were pretextual. As to Hodges, the trial court did not accept defense counsel's proposed reason that Hodges kept her eyes open during the initial prayer as a legitimate race-neutral reason. Also, in regard to Milam, the trial court noted that defense counsel did not strike a number of other jurors who had not spoken during voir dire. Further, the record reveals that the trial court resolved the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge against Fultz in\n   Thomas's favor. After review of the record, we cannot say that the decision of the trial court to include Hodges and Milam on Thomas's jury is clearly erroneous or against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.

Instructions D-5 and D-6 informed the jury that if the State had failed to prove any element of capital murder beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury should consider either aggravated assault (D-5) or culpable-negligence manslaughter (D-6). Instruction D-14 defined aggravated assault. Instruction D-16 was a heat-of-passion manslaughter instruction. Instruction D-17 was a form of the verdict instruction informing the jury how it should style its verdict if it found Thomas not guilty of capital murder, murder, manslaughter, or aggravated assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 51.

It is important to note what this case is not. This is not a case in which the defendant successfully objected to the language\n   of an elements instruction and the court neglected to correct the error or substitute language. Neither is this a case in which the State successfully objected to the language of an instruction to which the defendant was otherwise entitled and the court failed to substitute appropriate language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7426782\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/684/625/\">\n    684 So.2d 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1996). Finally, this is not a case in which a defendant negligently or inadvertently failed to object to a flawed elements instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6952513\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/134/266/\">\n    134 So.3d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2014). Instead, it is a case in which the error might more appropriately be referred to as \"demanded\" by the defendant rather than \"invited.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 59. In this case, the State offered Instruction S-2, which properly and appropriately set out the elements of capital murder and specifically referred the jury to Instruction S-3. Instruction S-3 properly and appropriately set out the elements of robbery. Defense counsel, after initially stating he had no objection, backtracked and objected to Instruction S-3. He noted, correctly, that in the indictment there was \"no charge for robbery,\" as the commission of robbery was merely an element of capital murder. Defense counsel made clear that there was no mistake. He acknowledged that robbery was listed in the indictment. The Court then requested counsel to explain the objection further. Defense counsel referred to the additional instruction as confusing and complained that it treats robbery as a \"second count.\" The State then agreed to withdraw the instruction. However, defense counsel once again inquired to be sure it had been withdrawn and, upon receiving an affirmative response, stated \"All right. That's all I needed to know. I'm sorry.\" The Court later proceeded to amend Instruction S-2, to remove the reference to Instruction S-3, and renamed it Instruction S-2B. In response to the Court's explanation, defense counsel stated, \"I'm clear now your honor. No objection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 60. The record demonstrates that defense counsel's successful objection to Instruction S-3 was a tactical decision. He acted with full knowledge of the consequences. He did not want the jury instructed on the elements of robbery. He felt that the instruction would be confusing to the jurors, misleading them into believing the defendant was charged with a second count. The tactical decision, whether wise or not, is further brought home in defense counsel's closing argument in which he stated the defendant had admitted that he had committed the crime of robbery and used it to support the defendant's credibility on the capital-murder issue in which he argued that \"The State can't pick and choose what they want you to believe.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 61.

Further, the State met its burden to instruct the jury by submitting proper instructions as to both the elements of capital murder and the underlying crime of robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reddix v.

In the end, the trial judge accepted their communal position and gave an instruction that lacked the elements of the underlying crime. Trial courts expect and deserve guidance from the attorneys as to jury instructions. It is common practice for trial judges to accept agreements between the parties as to such issues, as it is assumed that the agreement is made for the mutual benefit of the parties or as a contemplated concession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 65. While the trial court would have been within its authority to insist on instructing the jury on the elements of the underlying felony, we decline to find any error. A reversal is not required where the trial court and the State both acted to properly instruct the jury, but the defendant-in a tactical decision-objected to the instruction. A defendant cannot object to an elements instruction, succeed on the\n   objection, use that success to minimize the issue to a jury, bolster his own credibility with the success of the objection, and then cry error and complain about the lack of an elements instruction on appeal.

Here, even though the trial court's failure to do so may have been precipitated by defense counsel, it nevertheless was the trial court's responsibility and the State's responsibility to ensure that the jury was instructed correctly and fully, notwithstanding the apparent ineptitude of the defendant's lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \u00b6 77. The only way in which a jury is informed of the charge against the accused, including all the elements of the charge, is through the trial court's formal instructions to the jury. The elements of the underlying felony take on greater-than-usual importance in capital murder cases. A defendant who effects the death of another in any manner that is neither legally excusable nor justifiable can be found guilty of capital murder only if the underlying felony is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This means that a felonious killing of another person that, without the underlying felony, might be prosecuted as manslaughter or vehicular homicide, becomes a capital offense for which a defendant can be sentenced to death or life without parole when the underlying felony is properly pled and sufficiently proven to a correctly instructed jury. Of the capital\n   murder offenses requiring an underlying felony, as is the case here, the elements of the underlying felony become the elements of capital murder. Thus, in cases such as the one at bar, the State's obligation to prove the underlying felony is of indispensable importance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   \u00b6 78. Here, the jury had no way of knowing whether the crime of robbery had been proven because it received no instruction from the court that informed it of what it takes, fact-wise, to prove robbery. Such an instruction rightly was tendered by the State; but because defense counsel foolishly objected to it and the trial judge denied the instruction to the State without requiring an appropriate substitute, the jury was left to guess about the elements of the predicate felony, without which this would not have been a capital case. It cannot be said, therefore, that Thomas was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of capital murder, since the jury was deprived of knowledge of all the elements of that crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6 79. The majority's approach, which affects not only the present case but those in the future as well, relieves Mississippi's criminal court trial judges of an enormous aspect of their responsibility as ultimate guardians of the all-important fair trial and returns us to the ways of the pre-\n   <em>\n    Newell\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   era during the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries. Then, jury instructions were regarded as falling mainly within the province of the litigants and their attorneys. Judges offered little or no input, other than marking the proposed instructions\n   <em>\n    granted\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    denied\n   </em>\n   , and occasionally making pen-and-ink edits to tendered instructions, then reading the granted ones to the jury. Instructions in those days were captioned, \"INSTRUCTION NO. ____ FOR THE STATE\" or \"INSTRUCTION NO. ____ FOR THE DEFENDANT,\" and began, \"The Court instructs the Jury for the State....\" or \"The Court instructs the Jury for the Defendant ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b6 80. In the realm of correct jury instructions, which are essential for fair trials in which jurors are bound to follow\n   <em>\n    the instructions of the court\n   </em>\n   -not\n   <em>\n    the instructions of the lawyers\n   </em>\n   -accurate instructions on the applicable law are indispensable to fairness. Jurors rightly regard the legal instruction they receive as coming from\n   <em>\n    the judge.\n   </em>\n   This is the only source of information jurors have respecting the law they are to follow in reaching their decisions. The jurors, the litigants, and the public have a right to believe that those instructions are correct and\n   <em>\n    complete\n   </em>\n   . They never should be provided a set of jury instructions that is incorrect or incomplete because of lawyer ineptitude that was observed but left uncorrected by a jury trial's only lawgiver, the presiding judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   \u00b6 81. Historically, and at present, Mississippi trial jurors cannot function as such unless and until they have taken on themselves a solemn oath, which now is prescribed in the Mississippi Rules of Criminal Procedure:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Oath of Jurors.\n   </strong>\n   The court shall, on the record of each trial, give the jurors the following oath or remind the jurors that they still are under the following oath:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   You, and each of you, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that you will well and truly try all issues and execute all writs of inquiry that may be submitted to you, or left to your decision by the court, or under its direction, during the present term, and true verdicts give according to the evidence. So help you God.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   Additionally, in each capital case, the jurors shall be sworn to \"well and truly try the issue between the state and the defendant, and a true verdict give according to the evidence and the law.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   M.R.Cr.P. 18.5(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   \u00b6 82. The majority professes its solid support for the \"legal tenet\" articulated in\n   <em>\n    Harrell\n   </em>\n   , which, in actuality announced nothing new in its affirmation of trial judges' well-established and long-recognized responsibility to assure that the court's instructions to the jury respecting the law the jurors are bound to follow is correct and complete. But a pledge of allegiance to a legal tenet that is unaccompanied by conscientious and consistent adherence to it rings rather hollow and, in reality, is without value. Struggling to absolve judges of their role in trials as the ultimate guardians of all things legal, my learned colleagues in the majority whine that trial courts, in their review of the jury instructions proposed by the parties, would have to be imbued with omniscience-a quality possessed only by Deity and unattainable for mere mortals, including trial judges-in order to do their jobs. Of course, their job descriptions include the duty to give legal instructions to jurors that, in addition to being accurate, must be complete, as is made clear by the foregoing legal tenet to which the majority claims devotion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   \u00b6 83. The knowing and informed waivers required for valid felony guilty pleas are equated by the majority with the tacit, implied waiver ascribed to a clueless defendant whose careless lawyer fails to object to an incorrect jury instruction or unwittingly submits an insufficient one to a trial judge. This attempted analogy provides a less-than-apt comparison. That said, candor compels an acknowledgment that there are some significant similarities between the two otherwise-dissimilar kinds of waiver. Guilty pleas are conducted under the watchful eyes, attentive ears, and alert minds of judges who bear heavy responsibility for going to whatever lengths are necessary to see that all applicable constitutional and legal rights of the accused are protected. Part of the judge's job is to be sure that they are, and to correct whatever deficiencies, in the exercise of judicial diligence, he or she may detect. If deficiencies appear and cannot be rectified by judicial explanation, a recess for the accused to confer with counsel, or other appropriate means, the judge, as the ultimate decider of the sufficiency of guilty pleas, is duty bound not to accept the plea. Similarly, the observant and conscientious Mississippi circuit court judge who actually studies the tendered instructions-which now must be filed in advance of trial under Mississippi Rule of Criminal Procedure 22(b)(1)-and finds them to be incomplete and/or incorrect is duty bound by this Court's decisions, including\n   <em>\n    Harrell\n   </em>\n   (whose tenet the majority lauds), and by the judge's oath of office, which says in part \"... that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as a circuit court judge...,\" Miss. Const. Art. 6, \u00a7 155, not to put jurors in a position of relying on, and basing their decision on, a set of incomplete and/or incorrect jury instructions. It is, indeed, the judge's job to detect and cause to be remediated whatever errors and/or omissions may exist in jury instructions. With great respect for my colleagues in the majority, for this Court to hold that, in effect, that buck stops with the lawyers and not with the judge, is grossly erroneous and sets a very perilous precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   \u00b6 84. Of course, the trial judge's duty in this regard is not just to the jurors, but-and perhaps more so-to the person on trial, to the public, and to the law itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   \u00b6 85. Here, these duly-sworn jurors were not given judicial instructions, to which they were entitled, on all of the applicable Mississippi law they were bound to follow. Thomas was convicted of murder in the commission of a robbery by jurors who were not informed of what the State must have proven to them, beyond a reasonable doubt, for the jurors to have been justified in believing, from the evidence, that a robbery had occurred. The elements, or ingredients, of robbery simply were not provided them. The majority holds that, because of attorney error, which should have been obvious to the trial judge and to the prosecutor, this glaring omission was perfectly all right. In effect, the defendant-according to the majority-is forever stuck with his attorney's blunder-a blunder the lawgiver had no duty to recognize and to correct. It is more than obvious that this case should be reversed and remanded for a new trial by a fully and correctly instructed jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   \u00b6 86. The majority acknowledges that the trial court's erroneous failure to instruct the jury on the elements of robbery was invited by defense counsel's actions. I agree. But the ineffectiveness of Thomas's attorney is clearly apparent from the record and alone requires reversal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed. 2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Thomas's lawyer's significant failure patently prejudiced Thomas's case inasmuch as it resulted in the jury's not knowing of elements of the crime that the prosecution was obligated to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Defense counsel's objection, that Thomas's indictment was defective for failure to list the elements of robbery, may have had some merit but was untimely. But the State's withdrawal of the objectionable jury instruction triggered the necessity of a substitute jury instruction detailing the elements of robbery. Accordingly, I would hold that defense counsel's failure to request a substitute jury instruction informing jury of the elements of the underlying felony of robbery constitutes prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   KING AND ISHEE, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    The indictment alleged that David Thomas \"did willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously kill Fred Jackson, a human being, without the authority of law, with or without any design to effect death while and when engaged in the commission of the crime of Robbery ....\" Even though the contention of the attorney was accurate, and failure to list the elements of the crime underlying the capital murder does constitute a defect in the indictment, the sufficiency of the indictment is not an issue raised on appeal, nor was it an issue raised pretrial in a demurrer or motion to quash the indictment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    <em>\n     Newell v.
