The mother ultimately filed a petition for nullity and corresponding motion for summary judgment. However, the trial court denied her motion for summary judgment and dismissed her petition for nullity, and the mother now appeals that judgment. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 1, 2015, the State, through the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), filed a \"Petition for Termination of Parental Rights and Certification for Adoption\" concerning two of the minor children of Tracy Alexander. A bench trial on the merits of the petition was held on December 1, 2015. The children's mother, Ms. Alexander, was not present at the trial, and neither Ms. Alexander's counsel, Richard P. Moreno, nor counsel for DCFS had an explanation for her absence. Mr. Moreno explained to the trial court that he had recently \"been unable to contact [Ms. Alexander], despite repeated efforts\" but that he had \"her last current address\" and had \"notified her twice by mail and once in conversation\" about the trial date. Citing Ms. Alexander's absence, Mr. Moreno orally moved for a continuance, which the trial court denied, and the matter proceeded in her absence. The trial court ultimately granted DCFS's petition, thus terminating Ms. Alexander's parental rights over the minor children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 15, 2015, Ms. Alexander filed a motion for new trial based on her absence at the trial. At a hearing on the motion, Lazetter West, the DCFS caseworker handling Ms. Alexander's case, testified that on November 5, 2015, she received a letter from Mr. Moreno requesting that Ms. West arrange transportation for Ms. Alexander to attend the December 1, 2015 trial. Ms. West explained that, after receiving the letter, she \"tried to call Ms. Tracy on the number, but for some reason, [she] couldn't get through\" because the \"number kept being busy or something.\" She stated that she further tried to reach Ms. Alexander by calling the residence where Ms. Alexander had reported to be living and the place where Ms. Alexander had reported to be working but was informed that Ms. Alexander no longer lived nor worked there, respectively, and had not provided forwarding information. Ms. West confirmed that she did not alert Mr. Moreno of her inability to get in touch with Ms. Alexander to schedule transportation prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. Alexander also testified at the hearing. When asked whether she was aware of the trial date beforehand and whether she was aware that she needed to attend the trial, Ms. Alexander answered: \"I wasn't aware I needed to be here, but I was aware of it.\" Regarding her efforts to attend the trial, she indicated that she called Ms. West \"two or three days before the court date\" and left voicemail messages asking Ms. West to return her calls. Ms. Alexander stated that she did not receive return phone calls from Ms. West and had no other means to attend the trial. Ms. Alexander also stated that she called her attorney in the days leading up to trial, and the following colloquy occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Q. Did you ever call your lawyer before the trial?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Q. After you could not get hold of Ms. West?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A. I called him, and he's the one who told me to call Ms. West to file for a ride.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Q. Okay. And then you called her and couldn't get her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q. That was the 25th. That was six days prior to trial?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. Yeah, six days prior to trial. Now, I do know that Thanksgiving, I believe, was the 26th.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Uh-huh (yes).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q. Did you try on the 27th? Did you try on the 30th?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A. No, I didn't try after those days. I tried-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. You tried calling your lawyer on those days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. Yeah, I tried calling my lawyer on those days. And I called, and she said she was going to give him a message to call me back, and he didn't call me back yet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. Okay. So your lawyer didn't call you back?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the hearing on the motion for new trial, Ms. West also testified that although her telephone number had changed around October 19, 2015 when she received a promotion, she recorded a voicemail greeting that notified callers that her telephone number had changed and provided her new telephone number.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regarding the change to Ms. West's telephone number, Ms. Alexander stated that, prior to the trial, she had called and left voicemail messages on the old telephone number and did not learn of Ms. West's new telephone number until after the trial. She testified that the voicemail greeting on the old telephone number provided Ms. West's name and stated that \"she couldn't be reached at the time. Please leave a name and a message, and she'll get back to\" the caller. Ms. West testified that she had checked her old voicemail every day prior to the trial and had not received any messages from Ms. Alexander. She stated that she \"never heard from Ms. Tracy\" and did not receive any voicemail messages from Ms. Alexander until after the trial on approximately December 19, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Following the hearing, the trial court denied Ms. Alexander's motion for new trial. In oral reasons for ruling, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   It is clear that the DCFS worker did not call the lawyer for Ms. Alexander to tell him that she could not locate Ms. Alexander to pick her up from wherever she was to bring her to trial. However, the worker did attempt, and I'm satisfied that the worker did attempt to contact Ms. Alexander and was unable to do so and actually contacted the third person that was involved in the matter, who also did not know where Ms. Alexander was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   I am not going to expand the duties of the DCFS workers to call the lawyers to tell them that they can't get in touch with the clients to pick them up to bring\n   them to court. I think that goes above and beyond what should be expected of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Also, I find that the testimony of the DCFS worker, Ms. West, was more detailed and credible then [sic] that of Ms. Alexander when it comes to the issue of who was called when and what messages were left, et cetera.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ms. Alexander appealed, and a panel of this court affirmed the trial court's denial of the motion for new trial, as well as the termination of parental rights. Ms. Alexander then filed a writ application, which the supreme court denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State in the Interest of G.M.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16-405%20%28La.App.%203%20Cir.%209/28/16%29\">\n    16-405 (La.App. 3 Cir. 9/28/16)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190063\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/201/1014/\">\n    201 So.3d 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 16-1945 (La. 11/18/16),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12352021,12352002,12352029,12352006\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/210/290/\">\n    210 So.3d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thereafter, on December 1, 2016, Ms. Alexander filed a \"Verified Petition for Nullity of Judgment for Fraud and Ill Practices\" in which she asserted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The aforementioned failures of DCFS to arrange for transportation for TRACY to the December 1 Termination Trial, or to inform TRACY's counsel of that failure before December 1, or to inform the trial court of that failure at the December 1, 2015 Termination Trial constitute fraud and ill practices within the meaning of Article 2004B of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In response, DCFS filed an exception of res judicata and a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the issues raised by Ms. Alexander's petition had been considered in this court's September 28, 2016 judgment and that \"there does not exist a genuine issue of material fact that has not been determined by the prior tribunals[.]\" Thereafter, Ms. Alexander filed a motion for summary judgement concerning her petition for nullity. The trial court ultimately denied Ms. Alexander's motion for summary judgment, dismissed her petition for nullity, and granted DCFS's motion for summary judgment, stating, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   In reviewing the Joint Stipulations of Fact, it is clear that ALEXANDER's attorney had requested transportation for ALEXANDER to the termination hearing, and that in response, the DCFS case worker assigned to the case attempted prior to the trial to contact ALEXANDER to arrange transportation to the termination trial, but was unable to contact ALEXANDER. The Joint Stipulation further provides that ALEXANDER's own counsel of record tried to contact her for some 3 weeks or so prior to the trial, and was likewise unable to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court finds that the DCFS attempts to contact ALEXANDER to arrange for transportation were sufficient. The Court further finds that ALEXANDER was aware of the trial date, and that it was her duty to ensure that she attended such hearing if she desired to do so. There was no ill practice or fraud perpetuated by DCFS in this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Ms. Alexander appeals that judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserting the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   I.

Since that time, this Court has accepted those two requirements as the necessary elements in establishing a nullity action under Art.2004.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gladstone v.

However, based on the testimony adduced at the hearing on the motion for new trial, the inability to arrange for transportation appears to stem, at least in part, from Ms. Alexander's failure to act on her own behalf in that she had not provided DCFS with current contact information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8191805\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/995/43/#p49\">\n    995 So.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on Ms. West's testimony, she did not have an accurate phone number, home address, or workplace location to be able to contact Ms. Alexander. Moreover, while it may be argued that Ms. Alexander believed that transportation would be provided, Ms. Alexander was put on notice that transportation arrangements had not been made when she neither spoke with anyone from\n   DCFS nor received information about any such arrangements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7431474\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/671/404/\">\n    671 So.2d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though Ms. Alexander testified that she called her attorney, left messages for him, and did not receive a return phone call, her testimony fails to indicate that her messages notified her attorney of her inability to speak with Ms. West. Ms. Alexander testified that she was aware of the trial date. However, there is no indication that, as the trial date approached, Ms. Alexander notified anyone, including her attorney, that she had been unable to arrange transportation with DCFS. Thus, the trial court did not have that information available to it on the day of trial. As discussed above, a petition for nullity is not \"the solution to legal rights lost through one party's negligence or failure to act.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11694752\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/718/609/#p611\">\n    718 So.2d at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In her petition for nullity, Ms. Alexander also stated that DCFS's failure to disclose to either her counsel or the trial court the inability to arrange transportation constitutes fraud and ill practices that deprived her of her right to testify.

That determination depends on the nature of the information and the circumstances surrounding the hearing. A party is not obliged to produce evidence favorable to the opponent or to present the opponent's version of the case, and the failure to disclose all information on the issue is not ill practice unless concealment or deceit is involved.

Namely, she testified that she had no independent\n   means of transportation and had not spoken with Ms. West or anyone else at DCFS prior to the trial to arrange for transportation. Thus, because her absence and the reasons for said absence are information that Ms. Alexander could have ascertained herself, we find that there was no fraud or ill practice relating to DCFS's failure to disclose its unsuccessful attempts to arrange transportation with Ms. Alexander.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8328515\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/951/1058/#p1067\">\n    951 So.2d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Above we have determined that DCFS's inability to arrange for transportation and failure to disclose this inability do not constitute fraud or ill practices pursuant to La.Code Civ.P. art. 2004. We thus find that Ms. Alexander did not prove that she was entitled to a judgment of nullity pursuant to La.Code Civ.P. art. 2004. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly dismissed Ms. Alexander's petition for nullity; denied Ms. Alexander's motion for summary judgment; and granted DCFS's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.
