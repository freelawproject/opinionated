For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff, Karen Sue Thibodeaux, was involved in a May 2, 2014 automobile accident in Lafayette, Louisiana, when her vehicle was struck by another vehicle being driven by Vivian Boutte, who was at the time employed by Walgreens. The accident occurred as Ms. Boutte was headed back to her home in Napoleonville after attending a training course recommended by her boss. A police officer who responded to the scene issued a citation to Ms. Boutte for failure to yield. As a result of the injuries she sustained in the accident, Plaintiff filed suit against Ms. Boutte and her automotive liability insurer, GEICO Casualty Company. Plaintiff also named Walgreens as a defendant, alleging that Ms. Boutte was in the course and scope of her employment with Walgreens when the accident occurred, thus making it vicariously liable for the damages caused by Ms. Boutte's actions. Walgreens denied that Ms. Boutte was in the course and scope of her employment at the time of the accident and claimed it had no liability for Ms. Boutte's negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Walgreens and Plaintiff filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of Walgreen's vicarious liability for Ms. Boutte's actions. In her motion for partial summary judgment, Plaintiff also claimed that Ms. Boutte's negligence was the sole legal cause of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following a hearing, the trial court rendered judgment on June 1, 2017, denying Walgreens' motion for summary judgment and granting Plaintiff's cross-motion for partial summary judgment based upon its findings: \"(1) that Vivian Boutte was in the course and scope of her employment with Walgreens at the time of this May 2, 2014 incident; (2) that Walgreens is vicariously liable for any injuries or damages sustained by plaintiff caused by the incident; and (3) that Vivian Boutte was the sole legal cause of this incident.\" Walgreens appealed and is now before this court asserting the following assignments of error:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1.

Nevertheless, if the mover will not bear the burden of proof at trial on the issue that is before the court on the motion for summary judgment, the mover's burden on the motion does not require him to negate all essential elements of the adverse party's claim, action, or defense, but rather to point out to the court the absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to the adverse party's claim, action, or defense. The burden is on the adverse party to produce factual support sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that the mover is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(D)(1). \"Appellate courts review summary judgments de novo under the same criteria that govern a district court's consideration of whether summary judgment is appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Larson v.

She explained that her pharmacy manager asked her to attend a training class on how to perform cholesterol testing, a service that Walgreens wanted to offer its customers for a fee. The class was being taught at the Walgreens headquarters in Lafayette, the Walgreens' \"scheduler,\" Rene Nuss, told her that she \"needed to come in and get that additional training,\" and Ms. Nuss made the arrangements for Ms. Boutte to attend that particular\n   training session. She drove her personal vehicle to the training and submitted her mileage for reimbursement. Ms. Boutte confirmed that the Morgan City store where she worked had the equipment needed to do the cholesterol testing that she was being trained to perform. On the day of the accident, Ms. Boutte worked at the Morgan City store until about 1:00 p.m. before driving to attend the training in Lafayette. A Walgreens' employee provided the training, which began at 3:00 p.m. and lasted between thirty and forty-five minutes. Ms. Boutte recalled speaking with a Walgreens' manager for about twenty minutes before leaving for her home in Napoleonville, which was approximately ninety miles from Lafayette. She stated that she was driving cautiously because she \"didn't know anything\" about Lafayette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its brief to this court, Walgreens admits that there are no reported Louisiana cases involving the exact factual situation presented in this appeal. Walgreens argues that application of the\n   <em>\n    Orgeron\n   </em>\n   factors should lead this court to reverse the trial court judgment finding that Ms. Boutte was in the course and scope of her employment when the accident occurred. It points out that Ms. Boutte's shift at its Morgan City store had ended approximately three and one-half hours before the accident occurred and that she was not paid wages during her attendance at the training nor for her travel time to and from the training. It admits, however, that Ms. Boutte was reimbursed for her mileage. Walgreens suggests that the training was optional, that Ms. Boutte was not required to attend the training to keep her job, that the training \"does not show up in her personnel file,\" and that the \"motivation of Ms. Boutte was entirely personal and specifically to enhance her overall performance as a pharmacist, not to benefit Walgreens.\" It points out that the 'training was not conducted by either [Ms. Boutte's] pharmacy or district manager, but [by] a Walgreens' employee she did not know\" and that testing \"equipment used during the training was outdated, so the trainees could not check the results.\" Finally, Walgreens states that \"[n]o cholesterol testing was performed at the store where Ms. Boutte worked through the time she left Walgreens' employment almost two years later, and Walgreens was actually backing off of actually performing these tests in general because it was rarely done at most of its stores.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We find little merit to Walgreens' arguments. When an employee is told by a supervisor that he or she needs a certain type of training, that employee can hardly be expected to disregard the suggestion or to inquire whether their job depends upon completion of that training. And while there is often an element of personal enhancement when an employee attends a training class, Walgreens' suggestion that Ms. Boutte attended the class for \"entirely personal\" reasons borders on the absurd. Even more ridiculous is Walgreens' suggestion that Ms. Boutte's training should have been conducted by a Walgreens' employee that she personally knew. Walgreens puts much emphasis on the fact that no cholesterol testing was ever performed at the Morgan City location where Ms. Boutte worked. We find this logic to be disingenuous, as that information was gained in hindsight, and the fact remains that Ms. Boutte's supervisor asked her to attend the training, which the Walgreens' scheduler set up for May 2, 2014. Moreover, Walgreens could not have offered the testing to its customers if it had not trained its pharmacists in how to conduct such testing, and the fact that it apparently made a business decision to discontinue cholesterol testing, when it never really embraced that endeavor in the first place,\n   can certainly not factor into our course and scope of employment analysis. Similarly, the fact the equipment on hand at its training facility was outdated when Walgreens conducted the cholesterol training of its employees reflects poorly on Walgreens. Finally, because Walgreens controlled what was placed in its employee's records, we attach little significance to the fact that any information regarding Ms. Boutte having completed the cholesterol training was not in her personnel file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On the other hand, our assessment of the\n   <em>\n    Orgeron\n   </em>\n   factors to the facts before us convince us that Plaintiff met her burden of proving the absence of genuine issues of material fact and that she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law finding that Ms. Boutte was in the course and scope of her employment with Walgreens when the accident occurred. The cholesterol training class which was held at Walgreens' headquarters in Lafayette was obviously \"related to the service\" of Walgreens in \"time place and purpose;\" Ms. Boutte's act of attending the training bore a strong \"relationship\" with Walgreens' business; Ms. Boutte's motivation for completing the training was to follow her supervisor's directions; and it is more than reasonable for Walgreens to expect that Ms. Boutte's would \"perform the act\" of completing the training her supervisor requested that she take.\n   <em>\n    Orgeron\n   </em>\n   , 639 So.2d at 227. We note that, because the training occurred in a city that Ms. Boutte was unfamiliar with, the chances of her getting in an accident as she navigated to and from Lafayette were increased.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Voinche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887959\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/155/146/#p151\">\n    155 So.3d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As Walgreens correctly points out, no single\n   <em>\n    Orgeron\n   </em>\n   factor is determinative and the factors must be considered in their totality. Because the majority of the\n   <em>\n    Orgeron\n   </em>\n   factors preponderate in favor of us finding that Ms. Boutte was in the course and scope of her employment when the accident occurred, we conclude that Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment was properly granted and Walgreens' motion for summary judgment was properly denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed in its entirety. All costs of this appeal are assessed against Walgreen Louisiana Company, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Conery, J., concurs in part, dissents in part, and assigns reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Conery, J., concurs in part, dissents in part, and assigns reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   I concur with the majority's decision to affirm the judgment of the trial court denying the motion for summary judgment filed by Walgreen Louisiana Co., Inc. (Walgreens). I respectfully dissent from the majority's decision to affirm the trial court's partial summary judgment in favor of Ms. Thibodeaux and against Walgreens that found Ms. Boutte was in the course and scope of her employment with Walgreens at the time of the subject collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"The summary judgment procedure is designed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action[.]\" La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(A)(2). In this case, summary judgment has certainly not secured a \"just, speedy, and inexpensive determination\"\n   <strong>\n    of this action\n   </strong>\n   . Instead, it has caused extensive delays and expensive, unnecessary litigation for all sides. Walgreens filed its motion for summary judgment in April 2017. Now, thirteen (13) months later, we are still arguing about whether this case is appropriate for summary judgment and if either party requests a rehearing and eventual writ to the Louisiana Supreme Court, as may reasonably\n   be anticipated, additional delays and more litigation expenses are certain to follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Had this case simply gone to trial, it is highly likely that this case would have been resolved long ago. Walgreens stipulated that Ms. Boutte was at fault. Ms. Boutte, her pharmacy manager, and the Walgreens employee who set up the training in question could have testified in less than one (1) day and the case would have properly been decided on the merits where the trial judge and/or the jury could have weighed the evidence, assessed credibility, and found the facts. Instead, partial summary judgment was granted in favor of Ms. Thibodeaux and that judgment was appealed by Walgreens. Having considered the record presently before us, I find that there are genuine issues of material fact and underlying credibility evaluations that make summary judgment an inappropriate means of resolution. It is well settled that issues of credibility have no place in summary judgment procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mouton v.

She clocked out at 1:00 p.m. from her job in Morgan City when her regular shift ended. She then traveled in her own vehicle and on her own time to the Walgreens district headquarters in Lafayette, Louisiana, where she attended an optional forty-five-minute training on cholesterol testing put on by a Walgreens employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After Ms. Boutte left the Walgreens premises in Lafayette, she was free to go anywhere she liked. She certainly was no longer \"under the control\" of Walgreens. She was leaving Lafayette in route to her home in Napoleonville when the accident at issue occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Ms. Boutte was not paid wages for her time driving to and from the Walgreens training or for the time spent at the training because she was a full-time salaried employee who finished her regular shift at 1:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the accident to attend the optional training. Ms. Boutte initially testified in her deposition that she was paid mileage for her trip, but this issue is now disputed by Walgreens in a proffer it made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Counsel for Ms. Thibodeaux claims that Ms. Boutte was contacted by the Walgreens' \"scheduler,\" Ms. Ren\u00e9 Ness, about the need for her to attend the training. According to Ms. Boutte's deposition testimony, Ms. Ness told her she \"needed to\" and \"probably should\" get the additional cholesterol training. However, despite evidence supporting the fact that \"the scheduler\" said Ms. Boutte \"needed to\" attend the training, it is Walgreens' position that Ms. Ness had no supervisory authority over Ms. Boutte. Ms. Ness was responsible for scheduling part time pharmacists known as \"floaters.\" As a full time pharmacist, Ms. Boutte was not a \"floater.\" Contrary to the majority's statement that Ms. Ness was Ms. Boutte's \"boss\" and \"supervisor,\" Ms. Boutte's deposition testimony was uncontradicted that at the time of the accident, she was permanently assigned to the Morgan City location as a\n   salaried staff pharmacist and was not a \"floater\" subject to the supervision of Ms. Ness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ms. Boutte's deposition testimony was that she was supervised by the pharmacy manager as well as a district manager, who oversaw the online courses that Ms. Boutte\n   <strong>\n    was required to take to maintain her certification as a pharmacist\n   </strong>\n   and maintain her employment at Walgreens.

She had finished her regular shift as a pharmacist in Morgan City at 1:00 p.m. and had \"clocked out.\" It is likewise undisputed that Ms. Boutte was not required by her immediate supervisors to attend the training course. Further, even if the training was mandatory, it was over, and Ms. Boutte was free to go anywhere she liked.

The ruling of the supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Michaleski\n   </em>\n   reversing summary judgment in favor of the employer required an analysis of whether there was\n   <strong>\n    a substantial connection\n   </strong>\n   to the work of his employer and the employer's expectations of its employees. The employee driver alleged to be at fault was an offshore worker who was temporally working at a land rig site. The supreme court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   An oil company employee, working \"seven days on\" with living quarters and a food and gas allowance furnished by the employer, who is returning to the work place from a necessary trip for himself and a co-worker to eat is in the course of his employment. Such journey is necessitated by the employment, since all the men had to leave the rig site to purchase groceries or a meal....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Returning from a trip to buy food was an activity arising out of the nature of the employment. The employer anticipated the necessity of these temporary absences, because it compensated the employees with a per diem for their food and gasoline expenses. All of these employees were required to obtain meals or groceries away from the rig site and were furnished an allowance for that purpose. Leger did not deviate either in route or time on his errand.

The undisputed record evidence is that Ms. Boutte was paid for the mileage expense related to the Walgreens' training session at issue here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Uniform Rules-Courts of Appeal, Rule 1-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the supplemental affidavit issue aside, there are genuine issues of fact as to whether Ms. Boutte was in the course and scope of her employment with Walgreens at the time of her after hours off premises collision with Ms. Thibodeaux, and, if this case is remanded, whether she was paid mileage may be one of the factors in a judge or jury's decision on the merits. It is not the determining factor in this summary judgment decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   It is significant to note that the deposition of Ms. Boutte was offered by both parties in support of and in opposition to the cross motions for summary judgment. Both attorneys did an excellent job of questioning Ms. Boutte in her deposition and then quoting excerpts from her deposition that supported their arguments. Counsel for Ms. Thibodeaux claims it is undisputed that Ms. Boutte was required to attend the training in Lafayette, La., because in her deposition in response to his question she stated that Walgreens' scheduler, Ms. Ren\u00e9 Ness said, \"you need to come on in and get this training.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Counsel for Ms. Thibodeaux also argued that the cholesterol training Ms. Boutte received was done by Walgreens to benefit Walgreens during Ms. Boutte's employment. Based on Ms. Boutte deposition testimony, the Morgan City location did have the necessary equipment to do cholesterol testing, and her co-worker Mr. Paul Taylor, had completed the training necessary to do the testing, if required. Ms. Thibodeaux's counsel ably argues that it was in Ms. Boutte's interest, as well as that of Walgreens, to have Ms. Boutte certified to do the cholesterol testing if needed. He argues that Ms. Boutte's travel to and from the training was necessary and incidental to her employment with Walgreens and the trial court's decision finding that she was in the course and scope of her employment should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   However, in response to questions by Walgreens' attorney, Ms. Boutte also testified in that same deposition that her pharmacy manager and her district manager, both her immediate supervisors, did not tell her she had to go to the training in Lafayette. The training was not mandatory and was not a part of the training that was required for her to maintain her employment and certification at Walgreens:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Q. So when you were scheduled to-when you-Ren\u00e9 Ness scheduled you to take this course, this was something that you decided that you wanted to do on your own?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   A. Yes\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Q. Okay. But nobody at Walgreens was making you take that course?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Additionally, as previously indicated, Ms. Boutte's employment records submitted in support of Walgreens' motion for summary judgment includes all of her employment mandated training and does not\n   list the cholesterol training on May 2, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Further, factor two in\n   <em>\n    Edmond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7024671\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/73/424/#p426\">\n    73 So.3d at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"whether the act was reasonably incidental to the performance of the employee's duties,\" requires an analysis of whether the training Ms. Boutte received in Lafayette was \"reasonably incidental to the performance\" of Ms. Boutte's duties. Ms. Boutte testified in her deposition that the cholesterol training at the Walgreens headquarters she attended had never been utilized at the Morgan City location where Ms. Boutte was permanently assigned as a pharmacist, both before the accident and after her employment ended almost two years after the accident in question. According to Ms. Boutte's deposition testimony, she attended the training for her own knowledge, not because it was required of her or was of benefit to Walgreens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   I would find that the trial court erred in weighing the evidence and making a credibility determination when it found that there is no genuine issue of fact as to whether the training in Lafayette was required, or \"primarily employment rooted[,]\" and whether Ms. Boutte was still \"in the course and scope of employment\" for Walgreens when the accident occurred.\n   <em>\n    Edmond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7024671\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/73/424/#p426\">\n    73 So.3d at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, it is undisputed that the training was over, and Ms. Boutte was free to go anywhere she liked when the accident occurred. Walgreens exercised no control whatsoever over her movements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   I would further find that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the benefit, if any, Walgreens received from Ms. Boutte's voluntary cholesterol training and whether that benefit makes the training \"reasonably incidental to the performance of the employee's duties,\" sufficient to find her to be in the scope of [her] employment when she was driving home after completion of the training.\n   <em>\n    Edmond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7024671\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/73/424/#p426\">\n    73 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   426 ;\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winzer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6823520\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/185/876/\">\n    185 So.3d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Woolard v.

This court denied the writ on the basis that Walgreens had an adequate remedy on appeal, as the \"granted summary judgment\" was immediately appealable under La.Code Civ.P. art. 1915(A) ; we noted that Walgreens \"can assign the denial of its cross motion for summary judgment as an error in the appeal.\"\n    <em>\n     Thibodeaux v.
