The prior opinion dated February 28, 2018, is withdrawn, and the attached opinion is issued in its place. No further motions for rehearing will be entertained.\n  </p>\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   PER CURIAM.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   David Elkin appeals the postconviction court's denial of his \"application for sentencing review by juvenile offender,\" filed pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.802. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Elkin was indicted for the capital felony of murder in the first degree on May 30, 2003, when he was sixteen years old. His judgment reflects that he pleaded no contest\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to a violation of section 782.04(3), Florida Statutes (2002), murder in the second degree, a first-degree felony. The trial court sentenced him on July 13, 2004, to twenty-five years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Relying on section 921.1402, Florida Statutes, and rule 3.802(b)(3), Elkin applied for sentencing review in January 2017 because he had served \"nearly\" fifteen years of his twenty-five-year sentence for \"second-degree murder.\" The postconviction court did not consider the merits of Elkin's application. Instead, it erroneously concluded that Elkin could not take advantage of section 921.1402 because he committed his crime before the statute's effective date of July 1, 2014. The supreme court has rejected that view.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Falcon v.

Elkin has now served more than fifteen years of his sentence, and while his judgment appears to support his entitlement to a sentencing review, both Elkin's application for review and his plea form indicate that Elkin was convicted of second-degree murder with no distinction\n   between second-degree murder, a violation of section 782.04(2), and second-degree felony murder, a violation of section 782.04(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the denial of Elkin's application for review and remand to the trial court to rule on the merits of the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   SILBERMAN, BLACK, and LUCAS, JJ., Concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    The plea form attached to Elkin's application for review, however, indicates that he pleaded guilty.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
