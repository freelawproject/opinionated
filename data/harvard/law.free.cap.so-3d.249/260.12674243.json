For the reasons\n   set forth below, we affirm Dajuan's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 25, 2010, Dajuan and co-defendant, Dennis Lewis (\"Dennis\")-two seventeen-year-olds-were indicted by the grand jury for the charge of second degree murder of fifteen-year-old James McKenzie (\"James\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A jury trial commenced on October 19, 2015, and concluded on October 21, 2015. With an eleven to one vote, the jury convicted Dajuan of second degree murder, a violation of La. R.S. 14:30.1. Prior to sentencing, Dajuan filed motions for new trial and post-verdict judgment of acquittal, which the district court denied. On June 16, 2016, Dajuan was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    ERRORS PATENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to La.C.Cr.P. art. 920, a review for errors patent on the face of the record reveals no errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dennis and James lived in the same neighborhood on Hauck Drive in New Orleans, Louisiana. On the morning of November 30, 2009, Dennis asked James to go with him to an abandoned house in the neighborhood. Dajuan was with Dennis. While at the abandoned house, Dennis held James from behind while Dajuan stabbed James forty-nine times. James was found dead in the abandoned house; and his face was wrapped in duct tape and his body was covered in a sheet of plastic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the three days of trial, the following pertinent testimony was elicited:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Lashonda Enclade\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lashonda Enclade (\"Ms. Enclade\"), James' mother, recalled that on November 30, 2009, she went to work, leaving James at home to babysit his youngest brother, five-year-old K.S.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Enclade lived on Hauck Drive. While at work, she attempted to call James, but she did not reach him. When she returned from work, K.S. told her that James left the house that morning with Dennis and a \"boy with dreads.\" When James did not come home that night or the following day, Ms. Enclade called the police and reported James missing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ms. Enclade testified that Dennis had threatened James at knifepoint on Thanksgiving Day, and Dennis accused James of stealing his gun. Ms. Enclade also stated she was aware Dennis recruited someone to help him reclaim his gun. Ms. Enclade made several attempts to speak to Dennis' mother about James' disappearance. On Saturday, December 5, 2009, Ms. Enclade walked to Dennis' house and confronted Dennis' mother. Dennis' mother denied that she and her son knew anything about James' disappearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Also, Ms. Enclade, her family, and friends began canvassing the neighborhood on December 5, 2009, with flyers requesting information on James; and the flyer had a picture of James on it. The neighbors began telling the family members information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. Enclade testified that \"[t[he neighbors was [sic] coming out, saying they heard, stuff they seen, Dennis and my son ... and another boy, walking up the street.\" Another neighbor told Ms. Enclade he smelled smoke coming from the backyard of Dennis' home on Monday, November 30, 2009. Ms. Enclade testified that based on information from the neighbors, her family members entered an abandoned house on the corner and found James' body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Detective Debra Norman\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Detective Debra Norman (\"Detective Norman\"), employed by the New Orleans Police Department (\"NOPD\"), testified that she was dispatched on December 5, 2009, to Hauck Drive on a disturbance call. As she arrived on the scene, Detective Norman noticed people posting pictures of a missing person. Detective Norman learned that a neighbor saw Dennis burning clothes in the backyard of his mother's house on November 30, 2009. Detective Norman entered the backyard to investigate the report and discovered a pile of burned clothing on the ground. At the time she made that discovery, she heard screams coming from the abandoned house on the corner of Hauck Drive and Prentiss Street. She relocated to the house and found James' body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Dennis Lewis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On that same day, December 5, 2009, Dennis was taken to the police station where he was interrogated by Detective Orlando Matthews (\"Detective Matthews\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the interrogation, Dennis gave several statements to police including a statement implicating Dajuan as the person who stabbed James.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At trial, Dennis denied killing James and explained he pled guilty because, \"[i]f I got a paid lawyer, you [the State] wouldn't be able to use the [Dennis'] statements.\" Dennis expounded he confessed to the police that he stabbed James to protect his mother from the threat made by the police to put her in jail. When questioned by the State about how he knew details about the crime scene such as where the victim's body was found, and that the body was covered with plastic, Dennis said that Detective Matthews told him. Dennis continued to deny any involvement in the murder and said he never told his mother he stabbed the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Since Dennis denied any involvement in the murder, the State played a portion of a videotaped statement taken during Dennis' interrogation at the police station. This portion of the video depicted Dennis in a room with his mother, and Dennis telling his mother that Dajuan stabbed James. At that time, Detective Matthews had left the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following the playing of the video, Dennis admitted, at trial, that he had stabbed James, but he denied Dajuan was involved. Dennis explained that James stole his gun and that James took it from his \"stash spot\" in the neighborhood. Dennis admitted the last time he saw James was when they left together from James' house. Dennis recalled he and James went into an abandoned house; he told James they were going to talk about something. When the two entered the abandoned house, Dennis began hitting James and James tried to fight back. Dennis found a knife in the house and began stabbing James. When asked how he stabbed James, Dennis testified that he \"just grabbed him and started stabbing.\" Dennis stated James tried to run, but he held James down. After Dennis stabbed James, he wrapped James' face with duct tape. Dennis testified he left before James died. Dennis stated he\n   burned his and James' clothes in the backyard of his home to get rid of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because Dennis continued to deny any involvement by Dajuan, the State played the entire videotaped statements given by Dennis to police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, in the last statement to Detective Matthews, Dennis stated he went to James' house on the morning of November 30, 2009. He wanted to confront James about stealing his gun. He continued explaining that he and Dajuan lured James to an abandoned house on Hauck Drive to smoke marijuana. According to Dennis, because James continued to deny stealing his gun, Dajuan stabbed James multiple times while Dennis held James from behind. Dennis stated he found a knife in the house, and later, he threw the knife in the river. Dennis wrapped James' face and head in duct tape and covered the body with a sheet of plastic. He and Dajuan returned to Dennis' house where Dennis burned his, Dajuan's, and James' blood-stained clothing and shoes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dennis gave to Dajuan some of his clothing and a pair of his sister's shoes, which had rainbow shoelaces, for Dajuan to wear home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After the jury heard the videotaped statements, Dennis retracted his statement that Dajuan stabbed James. He explained he lied about Dajuan stabbing James so his mother would think he was innocent of the murder, and Dennis stated he perjured himself at trial when he testified he did not kill James. Dennis testified he lied when he said he gave Dajuan his sister's shoes to wear home after the murder. Dennis explained he saw Dajuan purchase the women's shoes from Footlocker. When Dajuan was arrested, he was wearing women's tennis shoes similar to the description Dennis gave in his statement. Dennis identified the shoes at trial. When confronted by the State with the fact that two different sized shoe prints were left at the murder scene, Dennis claimed one print belonged to him and the other to the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    John Duzac\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Former NOPD Detective John Duzac (Mr. Duzac) testified that in 2009 he was assigned to the Crime Task Force with the FBI, and he was dispatched to Hauck Drive on December 5, 2009. Mr. Duzac said that during the course of his investigation, he learned Dennis threatened the victim with a knife on Thanksgiving Day. Additionally, he discovered that a neighbor had seen Dennis burning items in Dennis' backyard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Duzac obtained evidence of the burned clothing retrieved from the rear of Dennis' residence on Hauck Drive; the evidence included three socks-one pair of socks and a single sock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mr. Duzac identified photographs of the scene. Many of the photographs depicted bloody footprints taken at the scene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Duzac testified one of the footprints measured 280 millimeters and another footprint measured 245 millimeters. Mr. Duzac estimated one was about a size 10 and the other about a size 7. Mr. Duzac explained the smaller footprint was photographed at the scene of the crime on December 8, 2009. Mr. Duzac recalled, when Dajuan was arrested, he was wearing a pair of tennis shoes. These shoes were introduced into evidence and published to\n   the jury; they were identified as \"[o]ne pair of rainbow colored Nike tennis shoes, size 6.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    K.S.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   K.S., James' brother, was eleven years old and in the sixth grade at the time of trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   K.S. testified the last day he saw James was November 30, 2009, at their home. K.S. stated James left the house with \"Dennis\" and \"the other person with dreads.\" K.S. recalled being brought to the Child Advocacy Center at Children's Hospital in New Orleans (\"Center\") and speaking to a person about what happened the morning James disappeared. The interview occurred on December 14, 2009. At the Center, K.S. identified two people from pictures he viewed in separate photographic line-ups. From one photographic lineup, K.S. identified the \"boy with dreads,\" and he acknowledged he circled Dajuan's picture in the line-up with a crayon. From the second photographic lineup, K.S. identified Dennis, and he acknowledged he circled Dennis' picture in the line-up with a crayon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Daniel Dooley\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Daniel Dooley (\"Mr. Dooley\"), a forensic interviewer at the Center, testified he interviewed K.S. on December 14, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Dooley testified that K.S. identified, and circled in crayon, one picture from each photographic lineup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Dr. Samantha Huber\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Dr. Samantha Huber, Chief Forensic Pathologist for the New Orleans coroner's office, autopsied the victim's body. Dr. Huber testified the victim bled to death after being stabbed forty-nine times. Most of the wounds were delivered to the victim's chest and abdomen. Those wounds incised the victim's lungs, liver, stomach and heart. She noted that some of the stab wounds were made to his arms and legs, as if the victim was defending himself. She also noted that the back of the victim's body did not exhibit any stab wounds. Dr. Huber testified that the injuries inflicted were not inconsistent with there being two perpetrators with one of the perpetrators holding the victim. Dr. Huber recalled that when she received the victim's body at the morgue, the clothing on the body included green shorts, boxer shorts, white undershirt, and pair of white socks that were blood soaked. Dr. Huber was of the opinion the bottom of the soles of the socks were blood-soaked because James may have stepped in his blood and/or he was standing up when he was stabbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Dajuan's jailhouse calls\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The jailhouse calls of Dajuan to his family and friends were played for the jury. The pertinent content of the calls included: (1) Dajuan stating that Dennis was one of his best friends, but they had different friends; (2) Dajuan referring to Dennis as his \"fall-partner\"; and (3) an unnamed person offered to find someone to testify on Dajuan's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Dajuan assigns fourteen errors.

The jury heard testimony of the burned clothing recovered from Dennis' home, which consisted of three socks-a pair of socks and a single sock, and that James had on both of his socks when Dr. Huber performed the autopsy. The jurors were likewise shown pictures depicting the bloody footprints and heard exhaustive testimony about the two different-sized footprints, one footprint being smaller than the other footprints. Moreover, the women's size 6 tennis shoes, that were worn by Dajuan when he was arrested, matched the description Dennis gave in his statement to police.

K.S. testified Dennis and the \"boy with dreads\" came to his home, and James left with them. K.S. was home alone with James, when Dennis, who he knew from the neighborhood, and Dajuan, an unknown person, came to the door. K.S.'s description of Dajuan as having \"dreads\" is consistent with Dajuan's image in the picture K.S. identified from the photographic lineup. K.S. was certain when he circled Dajuan's picture with a crayon and was unequivocal in his identification of Dajuan. K.S. identified Dajuan from the lineup only two weeks after the murder. Finally, K.S. distinguished Dajuan from the other suspect\n   in the photographic lineup who wore an orange shirt/jumpsuit just like Dajuan. Accordingly, we find the district court did abuse its discretion in denying the suppression of K.S.'s identification of Dajuan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   This assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR NOS. 11 AND 12: VIDEOTAPED STATEMENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Dajuan complains his Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the State's failure to turn over to the defense, during discovery, the portion of Dennis' videotaped statement in which Dennis told his mother Dajuan stabbed the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    Discovery of video\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   During opening statements, the State disclosed to the jury that they would view and/or hear Dennis' videotaped statement to police. The State pointed out that the videotape contained a segment between Dennis and his mother in which Dennis tells his mother Dajuan stabbed James. The defense objected on the basis it had never received that portion of the videotape depicting this exchange. The district court overruled the objection. The defense suggested that the objection be discussed with the court later, and the judge agreed. The record contains no further objection to the admissibility of videotaped statements on discovery grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The State avers, in its brief, that it turned over the entire videotaped statements given by Dennis to police in a timely manner prior to trial.

When the State asked Dennis whether he recalled what he told his mother, after Detective Matthews left the interrogation room, Dennis indicated he did not. The State asked if he wanted to refresh his recollection and Dennis stated, \"Yes.\" Following, the defense lodged an objection. The defense urged that the portion of the video referenced by the State should not be shown to the jury to refresh Dennis' recollection. It appears from the record that only the audio was played for the jury. After Dennis reviewed the exchange between himself and his mother, he expressed it did not refresh his memory. The State moved to have the video admitted into evidence and published to the jury. The defense objected and urged only the exchange between Dennis and his mother should be played. The district court agreed and only that portion of the video was played at that time. We find the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting that portion of the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Dajuan urges even if the video was properly admitted, La.

Mr. Arcuri reported that just a few days prior to trial, Dajuan left his jail cell and struck a deputy with a chair, and this action may result in a charged offense.

Also, she stated that Dajuan's step-father was a part of his life. Ms. Alridge reported that Dajuan was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder at the age of five, and he had received medication and therapy for these conditions throughout his life. Ms. Alridge stated when Dajuan was twelve years old, Hurricane Katrina hit and the family lost everything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Dr. Bauer testified she was familiar with\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . The defense asked Dr. Bauer to describe the position of the American Psychological Association regarding imposition of sentences of life without parole for juveniles. Dr. Bauer responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   Essentially, the American Psychological Association states that juveniles are immature, more vulnerable to risk, and more changeable. And for those reasons that juveniles shouldn't be committed to a sentence of life without parole because it doesn't take into account their reduced culpability, and it doesn't take into account the possibility for change in the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Dr. Bauer was of the opinion that sixteen and seventeen year-olds who have been incarcerated are capable of learning to change their behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   On cross-examination, Dr. Bauer agreed that in order to determine whether a particular sentence would be best for a particular person, it would be important to know and/or to evaluate that person, to know the nature of the crime committed, and to know what that person did in the years following the errant behavior. Dr. Bauer admitted she had not evaluated Dajuan. She stated she did not know his medical history or the specifics of the crime. She indicated she was retained to testify only about \"the science of the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   During Dr. Bauer's testimony, the district court requested that the doctor be informed of the facts and to give her expert opinion regarding the \"science behind the brain development and behavior of adolescents and decision making\" as it related to the present case. After being informed of the specifics of the charged crime, Dr. Bauer said that she would not be comfortable rendering an opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Following the hearing, the district court sentenced Dajuan to life imprisonment without the benefit of parole. In setting forth reasons for the sentence imposed, the district court commented the expert called by Dajuan failed to evaluate Dajuan and \"unfortunately failed to provide this Court any circumstances that would mitigate as it relates to the sentencing [sic] which the Court is compelled to impose.\" The district court, found, it was a \"very heinous crime\" and gave his reasons for imposing the sentence without the benefit of parole:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n   The court is of the opinion this does not represent the conduct of anyone with an impulsive behavior. Taking into consideration that the fact that [the defendant] was seventeen years and three months, the court does find that the crime was horrific, callous, calculating,\n   and it totally outweighs any evidence presented including any testimony about any abusive or chaotic childhood.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   Again the court did not have the opportunity to hear any testimony from the expert as it relates to the evaluation of the defendant. The court is also concerned as we've tried to demonstrate in this community that there is a distinction when it becomes an issue of justice and mercy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   But the fact remains that [the defendant] has demonstrated that he is not capable of continuing to maintain the type of citizenship, the type of conduct, the type of behavior that is expected of anyone in this community. The court is mindful of the fact that based on the sentence the defendant would not be able to receive any parole eligibility or sentence accordingly, and I do find so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <em>\n    Application of Miller factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Dajuan stabbed a fifteen year-old boy, who he did not know, forty-nine times and left him to die in an abandoned house. The district court heard testimony of the devastating impact on James' family because of his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Dajuan was seventeen-years old and three months at the time he stabbed James. The district court heard testimony from Ms. Alridge regarding Dajuan's childhood and character. Despite hearing testimony that Dajuan had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, the district court was of the opinion \"this does not represent the conduct of anyone with an impulsive behavior.\" Further, as to Dajuan's possibility of rehabilitation, there was no testimony for the district court to consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   We find the record evidence shows the district court diligently considered both the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and found \"that the crime was horrific, callous, [and] calculating\" in compliance with Article 878.1 and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the sentence imposed is not so grossly out of proportion to the seriousness of the offense as to shock our sense of justice. Dajuan's sentence is commensurate to sentences imposed in similar cases with similar-aged defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given this careful review by the district court, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a sentence of life imprisonment without the benefit of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   These assignments of error lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO 1: INCOMPLETE RECORD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Dajuan complains his right to review on appeal has been compromised by an incomplete trial record.

A review of the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   transcript does not reflect there was an omission as to this juror, and Dajuan fails to point out where the omission is in the record.

I write separately to emphasize the facts that substantiate this young man's life sentence. Based on the record, I find sufficient evidence to support Mr. Alridge's conviction and sentence. While there is no forensic evidence linking Mr. Alridge to the murder, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence, including the confession supplied by Dennis Lewis, from which the jury could conclude that Mr. Alridge intended to kill the victim. Additionally, appellate courts have previously deemed a life sentence without parole was not excessive in cases in which the defendants were of the same age and younger than Mr. Alridge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Mr. Lewis confessed he restrained the victim by his arms, while Mr. Alridge stabbed the victim forty-nine times. Dr. Huber's testimony explained that the victim's injuries, primarily to the front of his body, were consistent with being restrained by one person and stabbed by another, thus\n   debunking Mr. Lewis' contention that he acted alone in murder. As the victim bled to death in the house, Mr. Lewis encased the victim's head and face in plastic tape and placed a plastic sheet over the body. Mr. Lewis and Mr. Alridge then went to Mr. Lewis' house to destroy the evidence by burning their clothes and shoes, which included three socks, two of which were a pair. Mr. Alridge had to borrow some of Mr. Lewis' clothes and a pair of Mr. Lewis' sister's tennis shoes in order to return to his own residence. Smoke from the clothes burning aroused the suspicion of a neighbor, who confronted Mr. Lewis about what was going on and reported the activity of the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   The circumstantial evidence supported Mr. Lewis' statement. K.S., the victim's youngest brother, testified at trial that the victim left their house on November 30, 2009, with \"Dennis\" and a \"person with dreads.\" The forensic interviewer at the Child Advocacy Center, who interviewed K.S. the day the victim's body was discovered, confirmed that K.S. identified pictures of Mr. Lewis and Mr. Alridge as the people he last saw with the victim. Additionally, Detective Duzac testified that neighbors reported to the police having observed three males enter the abandoned house in which the victim's body was eventually found. When Detective Duzac examined the murder scene, the body was clothed, covered in plastic wrap and stabbed multiple times, just as Mr. Lewis confessed to Detective Matthews. Further, Mr. Lewis' confession was corroborated by Detective Duzac's testimony that when Mr. Alridge was arrested, he was wearing the girl's white tennis shoes with colored laces Mr. Lewis said he gave Mr. Alridge after burning the clothes and shoes they had worn when they murdered the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   Considering both the brutal nature and extent of injuries inflicted upon the victim-forty-nine stab wounds, and viewing all the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Alridge specifically intended to kill the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   Likewise, I find Mr. Alridge's life sentence without the possibility of parole is neither disproportionate nor excessive and unconstitutional. A trial judge is afforded wide discretion in determining sentences, and the court of appeal will not set aside a sentence for excessiveness if the record supports the sentence imposed.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , 15-0866, p. 12-13 (La.

Mr. Alridge's conviction for second degree murder mandated a life sentence. The only determination the trial court was called upon to make was whether Mr. Alridge would be granted or denied parole eligibility. At the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   hearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the victim's family testified to the devastating impact of the victim's murder on the family. The State also offered the testimony of Blake Acuri of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, who recounted several prison incidents involving Mr. Alridge while he was incarcerated awaiting trial. As a result of these incidents, Mr. Alridge was identified within the prison system as one of the most dangerous inmates, requiring his being confined to his cell for twenty-three hours a day and allowed, for one hour, out of his cell, though his hands and legs had to be restrained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   While Mr. Alridge's mother testified that Mr. Alridge was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder at age\n   five and had received medication and therapy for both, no medical evidence of any mitigating facts were presented. Nevertheless, the trial court held the matter open to allow defense an opportunity to further investigate and present mitigation evidence. The defense offered the testimony of Dr. Bauer in mitigation; however, her testimony was limited to \"the science of the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   decision.\" Dr. Bauer admitted that she had not evaluated Mr. Alridge, knew nothing of his medical history, and testified that she was not comfortable rendering an opinion regarding Mr. Alridge's ability to change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   In light of these facts and jurisprudence, in which a life sentence without parole was deemed not excessive in cases of defendants of the same age and younger than Mr. Alridge, I find the sentence of life imprisonment without parole does not constitute excessive punishment.

Further, the victim's feet were never measured and he was found in socks-Dennis testified that he burned the victim's shoes in his backyard.... Thus, the single \"smaller\" print could have belonged to the victim. Finally, even if there were two shoeprints left by two perpetrators, this print was not consistent with any shoes associated with Dajuan-he was arrested in shoes whose prints did not match the distinct pattern of the shoeprint, and the police did not find any shoes at his home that matched the prints left at the scene....
