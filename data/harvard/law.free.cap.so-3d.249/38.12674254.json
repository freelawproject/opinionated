For the reasons that follow, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State of Louisiana, by and through its Attorney General, filed the instant suit against AstraZeneca AB, AstraZeneca LP, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, and Aktiebolaget Hassle (collectively \"AstraZeneca\") on March 18, 2015. The State alleges that AstraZeneca intentionally delayed approval of a generic equivalent to their brand pharmaceutical product Toprol-XL\u00ae in an effort to limit competition from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and in violation of state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of a generic being delayed, the State alleges that it, through the Louisiana Medicaid program, paid more in reimbursement for Toprol-XL than it otherwise would have paid for the generic equivalent. The State also claims that it lost substantial amounts in reimbursements paid outside of the Medicaid program. In its lawsuit, the State asserts that its claims arise from antitrust violations under the Louisiana Monopolies Act (\"Monopolies Act\"), LSA-R.S. 51:121,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and from violations of the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"LUTPA\"), LSA-R.S. 51:1401,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Alternatively, the State asserts that it has a claim for unjust enrichment. It seeks restitution, treble damages, attorney fees, and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response, AstraZeneca filed multiple exceptions, including the ones at issue herein-the peremptory exceptions raising the objections of no right of action and no cause of action. Following argument on AstraZeneca's exceptions, the trial court found that all claims were vested with the Department of Health and Hospitals (now Louisiana Department of Health or \"LDH\") rather than the State. No evidence was introduced at the hearing. Because the trial court found that all claims were vested with LDH, it sustained the exceptions of no right of action and no cause of action and dismissed the State's claims with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State has appealed, assigning the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. The trial court erred in sustaining Defendants' Exceptions of No Right of Action and No Cause of Action in this suit, based upon its finding that the State of Louisiana is not the proper party in interest to bring the suit and/or that the Louisiana Department of Health has the sole right to assert these claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2. The Trial Court erred in sustaining Defendants' Exceptions of No Right of Action and No Cause of Action in this suit, based upon its finding that the State of Louisiana's role as an indirect purchaser of Toprol-XL bars the State from pursuing antitrust claims and LUTPA claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3. The Trial Court erred in sustaining Defendants' Exceptions of No Right of Action and No Cause of Action in this suit by dismissing the State's claims that are not derived from Medicaid expenditures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   4.

In connection with its exception raising the objection of no right of action, AstraZeneca maintains that LDH, as opposed to the State, is the only party that has a right of action. AstraZeneca avers that the Louisiana Supreme Court has recognized: (1) state agencies with the power to \"sue and be sued\" as \"the sole parties capable of bringing suit to enforce their rights\" and (2) that lawsuits concerning the duties of such agencies should be instituted by the agency and not by the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    State ex rel. Dep't of Highways v. City of Pineville,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9543372\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/403/49/#p52\">\n    403 So.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52 (La. 1981). AstraZeneca notes that LDH is \"a body corporate with the power to sue and be sued,\" and contends that LDH is statutorily vested with responsibility for Medicaid. LSA-R.S. 36:251A and 36:254D(1)(a)(i). Further, AstraZeneca asserts that LDH is the owner of the funds used to reimburse pharmacies for the purchase of Toprol-XL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LSA-R.S. 46:153.3. Nevertheless, AstraZeneca maintains that even if the funds could be classified as belonging to the State, any action against it would belong to LDH under the rationale of\n   <strong>\n    City of Pineville.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On the other hand, while the State recognizes that LDH is a body corporate with the power to sue and be sued, the State maintains that it is not asserting any right that was ever solely possessed by LDH. The State avers that under the rationale of\n   <strong>\n    Pineville,\n   </strong>\n   the political subdivision becomes the sole party capable of asserting a claim only when the claim asserted derives from property owned (or a contract entered into) exclusively by that political subdivision or agency. The State argues that while LDH administers the Medicaid program, all Medicaid funds belong to the State. The State claims that all of the funds paid through the Medicaid\n   program come from the State's general fund and from federal funds granted the State on which the State remains obligated-funds which were never a part of LDH's budget and never the distinct property of LDH. The State additionally alleges that there were non-Medicaid funds that were also paid out by the State. As such, the State maintains that it has a right to bring this action in its own name stemming from its ownership of those funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Recently, this court addressed a similar issue in\n   <strong>\n    State v.

We note that substantially similar arguments were asserted by the defendant manufacturers in\n   <strong>\n    Abbott,\n   </strong>\n   wherein the defendants urged that \"the district court correctly recognized that the State cannot pursue claims that, by law, belong to a state agency ....

However, I disagree with the majority opinion insofar as it reverses that portion of the judgment of the trial court sustaining AstraZeneca's objection of no cause of action and I disagree with the majority's reasoning that AstraZeneca's objection of no cause of action was essentially one of no right of action. Based on my review of the State's petition, and accepting the well-pleaded facts set forth therein as true, I find that the State has failed to state a cause of action against AstraZeneca for alleged violations of the Monopolies Act, LUTPA, and unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Pursuant to the Monopolies Act, \"no person shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any person to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce within this state.\" La. R.S. 51:123. LUTPA outlaws unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 51:1405. As to unjust enrichment, La. C.C. art. 2298 provides that a person who has been enriched without cause at the expense of another person is bound to compensate that person, with the term \"without cause\" excluding cases in which the enrichment results from a valid juridical act or the law. Furthermore, the remedy of unjust enrichment is subsidiary and is not available if the law provides another remedy for the impoverishment or declares a contrary rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364107,12364116,12364100\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/216/802/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As set forth in the State's petition, its claims against AstraZeneca are based on its \"indirect purchases\" of Toprol-XL.

Since the State, as an indirect purchaser, cannot state a cause of action against AstraZeneca under either the Monopolies Act or LUTPA, the State cannot employ a subsidiary unjust enrichment claim to circumvent this rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    Coastal Environmental Specialists, Inc. v.
