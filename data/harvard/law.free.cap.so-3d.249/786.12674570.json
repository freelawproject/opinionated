We affirm the revocation of Fountain's probation and his resulting sentences without further comment; however, the trial court erroneously entered a second judgment when it imposed Fountain's sentences upon revocation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schaufler v.

Because the trial court initially adjudicated Fountain guilty and entered a judgment against him when it imposed his split sentences, the second judgment was unauthorized and should be stricken.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793489\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/195/1147/#p1148\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[T]he circuit court only enters a judgment on a violation of probation in those instances when it withheld an adjudication of guilt, i.e., withheld judgment, at the time it originally imposed probation.\" (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793489\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/195/1147/#p1148\">\n    195 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1148-49 ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm the revocation of Fountain's probation and his resulting sentences but remand for the trial court to vacate the second written judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   NORTHCUTT and LUCAS, JJ., and CASE, JAMES R., ASSOCIATE SENIOR JUDGE, Concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
