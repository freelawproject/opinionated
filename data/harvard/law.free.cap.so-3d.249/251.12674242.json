For the following reasons, we affirm Defendant's convictions and sentences on counts one and two, vacate Defendant's sentence on count three, and remand the matter for resentencing consistent with this opinion. Additionally, we remand the matter for correction of the uniform commitment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 26, 2015, a Jefferson Parish Grand Jury indicted Defendant with second degree murder, in violation of La. R.S. 14:30.1. Defendant was arraigned on March 27, 2015, and pleaded not guilty. On January 12, 2017, a Jefferson Parish Grand Jury returned a superseding indictment charging Defendant with second degree murder, in violation of La. R.S. 14:30.1 (count one), attempted second degree murder, in violation of La. R.S. 14:30.1 and La. R.S. 14:27 (count two), and intimidation of a witness, in violation of La. R.S. 14:129.1 (count three). Defendant was re-arraigned on January 13, 2017, and pleaded not guilty. On September 11, 2017, the State amended the indictment as to the dates of occurrence in count three. On September 12, 2017, the State amended count one of the indictment to manslaughter, in violation of La. R.S. 14:31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Afterward, on that same date, Defendant withdrew his not guilty pleas and pleaded guilty as charged. Because Defendant pleaded guilty, the underlying facts were not fully developed at a trial. Nevertheless, the State alleged in the amended superseding indictment that on or about December 7, 2014, Defendant, in Jefferson Parish, violated La. R.S. 14:31, in that he committed the manslaughter of Maurcell Mitchell (count one). The State also alleged in that same indictment that on or about December 7, 2014, Defendant, in Jefferson Parish, violated La. R.S. 14:30.1 and La. R.S. 14:27, in that he attempted to commit the second degree murder of Kentrell\n   Riley (count two). The State further alleged that on or between December 7, 2014 and September 11, 2017, Defendant, in Jefferson Parish, violated La. R.S. 14:129.1, in that he \"intimidate[d], impede[d], by force or threats of force to Israel Jones\" with the intent to influence his testimony in a judicial proceeding, reporting of criminal conduct, or appearance at a judicial proceeding (count three).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the colloquy, the State provided the following factual basis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Your Honor, if this matter would go to trial, the State would be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt as to count 1, that on or about December the 7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of 2014, the defendant violated Revised Statute 14:31, in that he did commit manslaughter, being responsible for the murder of Marcel Mitchell.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   As to count 2, that on that same date of December the 7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2014, the defendant violated Revised Statute 14:2730.1 [sic] in that he did attempt to commit second degree murder of Kentrell Riley.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   And as to count 3, on or between December the 7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2014, and September the 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of 2017, the defendant violated Revised Statute 14:129.1 in that he did intimidate, impede by force or threats of force Israel Jones with the intent of influencing his testimony in judicial proceedings reporting criminal conduct or appearance at a judicial proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After hearing the factual basis, Defendant indicated that he committed those crimes. The trial judge, thereafter, sentenced Defendant to imprisonment at hard labor for 30 years on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently with each other and with any other sentence Defendant may have been serving at the time. On September 13, 2017, the trial judge vacated those sentences, resentenced Defendant to imprisonment at hard labor for 30 years on each count to run concurrently with each other and with any other sentence Defendant may have been serving at the time, and gave him credit for time served. The trial judge also ordered the sentence on count two to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. On October 10, 2017, Defendant filed a timely\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for appeal, which was granted. The instant appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his counseled assignment of error, Defendant requests that this Court review the record for any errors patent. In\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   assignments of error, Defendant alleges the trial court erred in imposing three concurrent 30-year sentences for his convictions, as those sentences were not in conformity with his plea agreement; his sentence for the intimidation of a witness conviction is illegal; and, the trial court erred in restricting parole for his attempted second degree murder conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Anders\n    </em>\n    Brief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under the procedure adopted by this Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The supreme court explained that an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief must demonstrate by full discussion and analysis that appellate counsel \"has cast an advocate's eye over the trial record and considered whether any ruling made by the trial court, subject to the contemporaneous objection rule, had a significant, adverse impact on shaping the evidence presented to the jury for its consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When conducting a review for compliance with\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   , an appellate court must conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the appeal is wholly frivolous.\n   <em>\n    Bradford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1110. If, after an independent review, the reviewing court determines there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal, it may grant counsel's motion to withdraw and affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence. However, if the court finds any legal point arguable on the merits, it may either deny the motion and order the court-appointed attorney to file a brief arguing the legal point(s) identified by the court, or grant the motion and appoint substitute appellate counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   An independent review of the record supports appellate counsel's assertion that there are no non-frivolous issues concerning Defendant's conviction to be raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The indictment properly charged Defendant and plainly and concisely stated the essential facts constituting the offenses charged. It also sufficiently identified Defendant and the crimes charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. C.Cr.P. arts. 462 - 466. Furthermore, the minute entries reflect that Defendant and his counsel appeared at all crucial stages of the proceedings against him, including his arraignment, guilty pleas, and sentencing. As such, there are no appealable issues surrounding Defendant's presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Further, Defendant pleaded guilty in this case. Generally, when a defendant pleads guilty, the defendant normally waives all non-jurisdictional defects\n   in the proceedings leading up to the guilty plea and precludes review of such defects either by appeal or post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v. Turner\n   </em>\n   , 09-1079 (La. App. 5 Cir. 7/27/10),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038467\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/455/#p459\">\n    47 So.3d 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459. Here, Defendant entered unqualified guilty pleas, and therefore, all non-jurisdictional defects are waived. No rulings were preserved for appellate review under the holding in\n   <em>\n    State v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9676631\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/584/\">\n    338 So.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1976).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to suppress the evidence; however, the record does not indicate it was ruled upon. When a defendant does not object to the trial court's failure to hear or rule on a pre-trial motion prior to pleading guilty, the motion is considered waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Corzo\n   </em>\n   , 04-791 (La. App. 5 Cir. 2/15/05),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9037104\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/896/1101/#p1102\">\n    896 So.2d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1102. Defendant did not object to the trial court's failure to rule on his motion to suppress the evidence prior to pleading guilty. As such, we find that motion was waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Also, once a defendant is sentenced, only those guilty pleas that are constitutionally infirm may be withdrawn by appeal or post-conviction relief. A guilty plea is constitutionally infirm if it is not entered freely and voluntarily, if the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   colloquy is inadequate, or when a defendant is induced to enter the plea by a plea bargain or what he justifiably believes was a plea bargain and that bargain is not kept.\n   <em>\n    State v. McCoil\n   </em>\n   , 05-658 (La. App. 5 Cir. 2/27/06),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8449925\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/1120/#p1124\">\n    924 So.2d 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A review of the record reveals no constitutional infirmity in Defendant's guilty pleas. The record shows that Defendant was aware he was charged with and pleading guilty to the crimes of manslaughter, attempted second degree murder, and intimidation of a witness. On the waiver of rights form and during the colloquy with the trial judge, Defendant was advised of his right to a jury trial, his right to confrontation, and his privilege against self-incrimination, as required by\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Defendant signed the waiver of rights form, indicating that he understood he was waiving these rights by pleading guilty. During the colloquy with the trial judge, Defendant also indicated that he understood those rights. During his guilty plea colloquy and in his waiver of rights form, Defendant indicated that he had not been forced or coerced into entering his guilty plea. After the colloquy with Defendant, the trial court accepted Defendant's pleas as knowingly and voluntarily made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As to the sentences, Defendant was informed during the colloquy and in the waiver of rights form of the maximum sentences for the offenses of manslaughter, attempted second degree murder, and intimidation of a witness (counts one, two, and three, respectively). In the waiver of rights form, he was informed of the actual sentences that would be imposed if his guilty pleas were accepted. The trial judge informed Defendant that the maximum sentence that could be imposed on each count was 40 years. She did not inform Defendant of the minimum sentences for each count; however, the penalty for manslaughter is not more than 40 years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , La. R.S. 14:31. The trial judge incorrectly informed Defendant of the maximum sentence for attempted second degree murder. She advised Defendant that the maximum sentence for that offense was 40 years; however, the sentencing range for attempted second degree murder under La. R.S. 14:30.1 and La. R.S. 14:27, is ten to 50 years without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As to the conviction for intimidation of a witness (count three), the trial judge imposed an illegal sentence. At the\n   time of the offenses, La. R.S. 14:129.1(C) provided the sentencing ranges for a violation of that statute as follows, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (2) Whoever violates the provisions of this Section in a criminal proceeding in which a sentence of death or life imprisonment may be imposed, the offender shall be fined not more than one hundred thousand dollars, imprisoned for not more than forty years at hard labor, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (3) Whoever violates the provisions of this Section in a criminal proceeding in which a sentence of imprisonment necessarily served at hard labor for any period less than a life sentence may be imposed, the offender shall be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars, or imprisoned for not more than twenty years at hard labor, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (4) Whoever violates the provisions of this Section in a criminal proceeding in which any other sentence may be imposed, the offender shall be fined not more than ten thousand dollars, imprisoned for not more than five years, with or without hard labor, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the instant case, the trial judge sentenced Defendant to imprisonment at hard labor for 30 years on count three. However, because the instant case involves a criminal proceeding where a sentence of imprisonment is necessarily at hard labor for less than a life sentence, Defendant should have been sentenced under La. R.S. 14:129.1(C)(3), which provides for a possible sentence of a fine of not more than $50,000, or imprisonment for not more than 20 years, or both. The trial judge imposed an illegal sentence on count three, since she sentenced Defendant to 30 years on count three when the applicable sentencing provision only provides for a maximum sentence of 20 years. Because the sentence on count three is illegal, we vacate that sentence and remand for resentencing on that count only.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We further note, La. C.Cr.P. art. 556.1(A)(1) provides that, prior to accepting a guilty plea, the court must personally inform the defendant of the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered, any mandatory minimum penalty, and the maximum possible penalty. \"Any variance from the procedures required by this Article which does not affect substantial rights of the accused shall not invalidate the plea.\" La. C.Cr.P. art. 556.1(E). Violations of La. C.Cr.P. art. 556.1 that do not rise to the level of\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   violations are subject to harmless error analysis.\n   <em>\n    State v. Craig\n   </em>\n   , 10-854 (La. App. 5 Cir. 5/24/11),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7022861\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/66/60/#p64\">\n    66 So.3d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the instant case, any violation of Article 556.1 did not cause prejudice, since Defendant knew the sentences he would receive on counts one and two, and he received those sentences. Thus, we find that the advisement of the agreed upon sentences on counts one and two was sufficient for compliance with La. C.Cr.P. art. 556.1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7022861\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/66/60/#p64\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 64 ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Broadway\n   </em>\n   , 40,569 (La. App. 2 Cir. 1/25/06),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8999371\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/920/960/#p963\">\n    920 So.2d 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 963.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Additionally, La. C.Cr.P. art. 881.2(A)(2) precludes a defendant from seeking review of a sentence imposed in conformity with a plea agreement which was set forth in the record at the time of the plea.\n   <em>\n    State v. Washington\n   </em>\n   , 05-211 (La. App. 5 Cir. 10/6/05),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9020490\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/916/1171/#p1173\">\n    916 So.2d 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1173. The record reflects that Defendant was sentenced in conformity with the plea agreement that was set forth in the record at the time of the plea. However, as was discussed above,\n   although his sentences on counts one and two fall within the sentencing ranges set forth in the statutes, the sentence on count three does not fall within the sentencing range set forth in the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , La. R.S. 14:31 ; La. R.S. 14:30.1 ; La. R.S. 14:27 ; La. R.S. 14:129.1. In any event, Defendant's plea agreement was beneficial to him in that he was originally indicted in count one with second degree murder for which he could have received a life sentence; however, the State amended that charge to manslaughter, and he received a 30-year sentence on that count to run concurrently with the sentences on counts two and three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because appellate counsel's brief adequately demonstrates by full discussion and analysis that she has reviewed the trial court proceedings and cannot identify any basis for a non-frivolous appeal, and an independent review of the record supports counsel's assertion, except for the sentence on count three that can be addressed by this Court in an error patent review, appellate counsel's motion to withdraw as attorney of record is granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    30-year concurrent sentences\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant claims that he instructed his trial counsel to inform the prosecutor that, in addition to reducing the second degree murder charge to manslaughter in count one, Defendant also wanted the prosecutor to consider a counteroffer of 25 years on each count to run concurrently. He also claims that his trial counsel approached the prosecutor who tentatively agreed to those terms pending final approval from his supervisor. Defendant argues that as a consequence, he was improperly induced to enter guilty pleas. In support of his position, he points to the September 11, 2017 transcript, which he says reflects that the defense approached the State with a plea offer and the prosecutor said he intended to recommend to his supervisor. Defendant acknowledges, however, that at the sentencing hearing the next day, the State and his counsel omitted any specific reference to Defendant's proposed sentencing counteroffer of 25 years. He contends that as a result of the prejudicial omission of this material information from the record, the State prosecutor and trial counsel, through their silence, induced him to plead guilty on the erroneous assumption that the 25-year sentence had been approved by implication. Defendant states that when he was resentenced on the following day, he believed that the trial court was going to correct his sentences. However, Defendant notes that the prosecutor failed to clarify to the court whether the 25-year sentences had been approved by the district attorney. He also notes that trial counsel did not consult with him to explain the State's final decision on the proposed counteroffer of 25 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A review of the record reveals no constitutional infirmity in Defendant's guilty pleas. The record reflects that Defendant was aware of the crimes to which he was pleading guilty and that he was advised of and waived his rights. He indicated that he was not forced or coerced into entering his guilty pleas. The record also reflects that Defendant was informed by the waiver of rights form of the actual sentences that would be imposed if his guilty pleas were accepted,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 30 years on each count to run concurrently, and that he received those sentences. Neither the transcript nor\n   the waiver of rights form reflects that Defendant was to be sentenced to three concurrent 25-year sentences. There is nothing in the record to support Defendant's claim that his guilty pleas were contingent upon him receiving three concurrent 25-year sentences. As such, we find that this claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Illegal sentence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant argues that his sentence on count three is illegal. Because we have previously determined in this opinion that his sentence on count three is illegal and vacated the sentence, we hold that this issue is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Parole restriction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court erred by restricting parole on count two, attempted second degree murder, citing La. C.Cr.P. art. 890.1 and Louisiana's Justice Reinvestment Reform Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 890.1 provides for the waiver of minimum mandatory sentences, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if a felony or misdemeanor offense specifies a sentence with a minimum term of confinement or a minimum fine, or that the sentence shall be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, the court, upon conviction, in sentencing the offender shall impose the sentence as provided in the penalty provisions for that offense, unless one of the following occurs:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (1) The defendant pled guilty pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement with the prosecution and the court, which specifies that the sentence shall be served with benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence or specifies a reduced fine or term of confinement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (2) In cases resulting in trial, the prosecution, the defendant, and the court entered into a post-conviction agreement, which specifies that the sentence shall be served with benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence or specifies a reduced fine or term of confinement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   ***\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   E. At the time the sentence is imposed pursuant to this Article, the Uniform Commitment Sentencing Order shall specify that the sentence is imposed pursuant to the provisions of this Article.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In the instant case, the transcript reflects that Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted second degree murder in count two in violation of La. R.S. 14:27 and La. R.S. 14:30.1 and was sentenced to imprisonment in the Department of Corrections for 30 years without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. A review of those statutes indicates that the trial judge correctly ordered the sentence on count two to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Also, the record does not indicate that the plea was entered pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. art. 890.1. As such, we find that Defendant's claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Errors Patent Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The record was reviewed for errors patent, according to La.
