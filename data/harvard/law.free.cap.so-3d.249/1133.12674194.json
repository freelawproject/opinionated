In the father's petition, he alleged, among other things, that the mother \"had neglected the child's educational needs, had abused drugs, and had abandoned the child on more than one occasion.\"\n   <em>\n    L.R.S.

After a trial, the juvenile court entered a judgment declining to find the child dependent, stating that \" 'the current action is an initial custody determination' \" and finding \"that custody should be awarded to the father based on the best interests of the\n   child.\"\n   <em>\n    L.R.S.

Code 1975, \u00a7 12-15-102(8) 4., had abandoned the child,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 12-15-102(8) 5., and was abusing drugs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 12-15-102(8) 8. A juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction over petitions alleging the dependency of a child, Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 12-15-114(a), even when the dependency petition involves a custody dispute between parents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    T.K. v.

However, in this case, the juvenile court did not find the child dependent. This court has consistently held that a juvenile court cannot use its dependency jurisdiction to dispose of the custody of a child unless the juvenile court finds the child to be dependent,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    K.C.G.

Code 1975, \u00a7 12-15-310(b). Thus, the juvenile court did not have the authority under \u00a7 12-15-114(a) to enter its judgment.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381806\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/229/772/\">\n    229 So.3d at 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court proceeded to discuss whether there were any other alternative jurisdictional bases on which the juvenile court could enter a judgment in the case; having found none, this court concluded that the juvenile court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to enter its judgment and, therefore, that the judgment was void.\n   <em>\n    L.R.S. I\n   </em>\n   , --- So.3d at ----. This court dismissed the appeal with instructions to the juvenile court to set aside its void judgment.\n   <em>\n    L.R.S. I\n   </em>\n   , --- So.3d at ----. The father filed an application for rehearing, which prompted a second opinion from this court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    L.R.S. II\n   </em>\n   , --- So.3d at ----, in which this court maintained its original disposition of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the issuance of this court's opinions, the mother filed a motion requesting from \"the Presiding Judge of the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit ... an Order appointing a Circuit Judge to hear the Parties' Petitions and Motions.\" On March 13, 2017, the juvenile court entered an order denying the mother's motion and dismissing the father's petition; the juvenile court stated: \"[A]s the Court of Civil Appeals has found no jurisdiction, and ordered the vacating of the [judgment], this Court lacks any other option [other than dismissing the petition].\" The juvenile court's judgment also stated that any future custody petition should be filed in Utah, where the child currently lives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, the mother argues that the juvenile court erred in dismissing the father's petition; instead, she argues, the juvenile court should have transferred the case to the Mobile Circuit Court. We note, however, that, in this court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    L.R.S. I\n   </em>\n   , we did not order the juvenile court to transfer the case to the Mobile Circuit Court. As we expressed previously, the father's petition contained allegations of dependency, which are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the juvenile court.\n   <em>\n    L.R.S. I\n   </em>\n   , --- So.3d at ---- (citing \u00a7 12-15-114(a), Ala. Code 1975 ). As stated in\n   our previous opinion, once a juvenile court determines that a child is not dependent, pursuant to \u00a7 12-15-310(b), Ala. Code 1975, the only action it may take is to dismiss the case.\n   <em>\n    L.R.S. I\n   </em>\n   , --- So.3d at ----. Therefore, we conclude that the juvenile court complied with this court's opinion and \u00a7 12-15-310(b) by dismissing the father's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The mother also argues that the juvenile court's declining to transfer the case violated her right to due process; however, the mother does not cite any authority establishing that the juvenile court's compliance with our instructions and the well-established law concerning the juvenile court's jurisdiction violates her due-process rights. Therefore, we cannot find any error on this point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    White Sands Grp., L.L.C. v. PRS II, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8182899\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/998/1042/#p1058\">\n    998 So.2d 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1058 (Ala. 2008) (\"Rule 28(a)(10)[, Ala. R. App. P.,] requires that arguments in briefs contain discussions of facts and relevant legal authorities that support the party's position. If they do not, the arguments are waived.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The mother also argues that the juvenile court erred in concluding that Utah is the proper forum for a custody action under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, \u00a7\u00a7 30-3B-101 et seq., Ala. Code 1975. As we previously recognized, however, the juvenile court, having declined to find the child dependent, lacked jurisdiction to take any action other than to dismiss the case. Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 12-15-310(b). Therefore, any statement regarding the proper court in which to file a custody petition is without any legal effect, and, therefore, we will not address the mother's arguments regarding the merits of the juvenile court's statement on that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we affirm the juvenile court's judgment dismissing the father's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ON REHEARING EX MERO MOTU: AFFIRMED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thompson, P.J., and Pittman, Thomas, and Donaldson, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    The father was identified as \"M.J.\" in the previous appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Note from the reporter of decisions: The July 28, 2017, opinion was withdrawn and the appeal placed on rehearing ex mero motu by an order issued July 28, 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
