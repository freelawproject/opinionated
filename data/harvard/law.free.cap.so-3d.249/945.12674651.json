Palowsky, III, individually and on behalf of Alternative Environmental Solutions, Inc., filed a Petition for Damages against the defendant, Allyson Campbell, a law clerk for the Fourth Judicial District Court (Fourth JDC), asserting that Ms. Campbell maliciously and intentionally harmed Mr. Palowsky \"when she spoliated, concealed, removed, destroyed, shredded, withheld, and/or improperly 'handled' court documents\" in the matter entitled\n   <strong>\n    Palowsky v. Cork,\n   </strong>\n   Docket No. 13-2059, of the Fourth JDC. Thereafter, on July 31, 2015, Mr. Palowsky filed a First Supplemental, Amended, and Restated Petition for Damages, adding as defendants, Chief Judge H. Stephens Winters, Judge Carl V. Sharp, Judge J. Wilson Rambo, and Judge Frederic C. Amman, current Fourth JDC judges, and retired Judge Benjamin Jones, the current Fourth JDC administrator\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the Judges), asserting that they aided and abetted Ms. Campbell \"by allowing her free rein to do as she pleased and then conspiring to conceal [Ms.] Campbell's acts.\" Subsequently, all the judges of the Fourth JDC recused themselves from the matter, and the Louisiana Supreme Court appointed retired Judge Jerome J. Barbera, III, as judge ad hoc to preside over the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In response to Mr. Palowsky's pleadings, Ms. Campbell and the Judges each filed a motion to strike specific paragraphs of Mr. Palowsky's petition and various exceptions, including the peremptory exception raising the objection of no cause of action based on judicial immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 5, 2015, the trial court held a hearing on the motions to strike and the exceptions of no cause of action. The trial court first addressed the motions to strike and ordered that forty-six paragraphs and three subparagraphs of Mr. Palowsky's eighty-eight paragraph amended petition be stricken, finding them to be immaterial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After granting the motions to strike, the trial court addressed the exceptions of no cause of action based on the remaining paragraphs of Mr. Palowsky's amended\n   petition. The trial court determined that the Judges and Ms. Campbell were entitled to absolute immunity for their alleged actions and granted the exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 11, 2015, the trial court signed a judgment regarding the motions to strike filed by Ms. Campbell and by the Judges. On that same date, the trial court also signed a judgment granting the exception of no cause of action in favor of Ms. Campbell and a judgment granting the exception of no cause of action in favor of the Judges, dismissing Mr. Palowsky's case against them with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Palowsky filed an appeal of the three judgments with the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, and seven of the judges of that court recused themselves. Therefore, on September 7, 2016, the Louisiana Supreme Court ordered the transfer of the appeal of the matter to the Court of Appeal, First Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In his appeal, Mr. Palowsky has assigned the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A. The trial court erred by finding that forty-six paragraphs and three subparagraphs in Mr. Palowsky's amended petition were immaterial and granting the defendants' motions to strike same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   B. The trial court erred by finding that the Judges had absolute immunity from liability for their actions and thereby granting their exception of no cause of action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   C. The trial court erred by finding that Ms. Campbell had absolute immunity from liability for her actions and thereby granting her exception of no cause of action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   D. The trial court erred in refusing to give Mr. Palowsky the opportunity to amend his petition to state a cause of action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    THE MOTIONS TO STRIKE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 964 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The court on motion of a party or on its own motion may at any time and after a hearing order stricken from any pleading any insufficient demand or defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The granting of a motion to strike pursuant to Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure article 964 rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.\n   <strong>\n    Pitre v.

Motions to strike are viewed with disfavor and are infrequently granted. They are disfavored because striking a portion of a pleading is a drastic remedy, and because they are often sought by the movant simply as a dilatory tactic. However, a motion to strike is proper if it can be shown that the allegations being challenged are so unrelated to a plaintiff's claims as to be unworthy of any consideration and that their presence in the pleading would be prejudicial to the moving party.\n   <strong>\n    Carr v.

(AESI). Mr. Palowsky also asserted that he filed suit against W. Brandon Cork, the other fifty-percent shareholder of AESI, for damages Mr. Palowsky suffered as a result of Mr. Cork's theft, fraud, racketeering, and breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In his original petition against only Ms. Campbell, Mr. Palowsky alleged that Ms. Campbell acted outside the course and scope of her employment to maliciously and intentionally harm Mr. Palowsky by allegedly destroying or withholding certain court filings. Mr. Palowsky's First Supplemental, Amended, and Restated Petition for Damages again stated that Ms. Campbell was acting outside the course and scope of her employment duties and added the Judges as defendants for allegedly \"aiding and abetting [Ms.] Campbell by allowing her free rein to do as she pleased and then conspiring to conceal [Ms.] Campbell's acts.\" He did not allege any participation on the part of the Judges in the alleged destruction or withholding of court documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Campbell filed her motion to strike on August 10, 2015, and the Judges filed their motion on August 25, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which the Judges and Ms. Campbell asserted that most of Mr. Palowsky's allegations of \"fact\" in his amended petition were included for no other purpose than to embarrass, harass, and unnecessarily criticize the defendants. The trial court, in its oral reasons, discussed the issues of immateriality and prejudice necessary for a motion to strike pursuant to LSA-C.C.P. art. 964. As to prejudice, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [C]ertainly the allegations that have been made about the previous events that go back even the 2010 [event] involving\n   Ms. Campbell and then the other events that are alleged in the petition, the amended petition, about the actions and inactions of the judges certainly all of the information provided is prejudicial because it-it shows these parties to suggest to the reader that these parties are acting contrary to the ethics and responsibilities of their job and these allegations point to the reader that they've committed crime, and that they have acted badly, and that something should happen to them as a result of their activity. So there's no doubt that the allegations are prejudicial because anyone who would read that if they were convinced of the truth of it would form conclusions both about Ms. Campbell and the judges about their fitness and their ethics and their responsibility. Anyone who would read those allegations would certainly have questions about those things. So I don't think there's any doubt that the allegations that are at issue in the case are prejudicial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thereafter, the trial court addressed the second factor of \"whether or not these allegations have any bearing on the subject matter of the litigation,\" which it framed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   What this [amended] petition says is that Allyson Campbell, a law clerk to the judges of this district, an employee of the court, caused harm to the plaintiff by her actions in concealing, destroying, removing, withholding, and improperly handling, and I'm not quoting that verbatim, in improperly handling pleadings and court documents pertaining to civil litigation filed in this district by the plaintiff against a former business associate. So that's how I would sum up the cause of action by the plaintiff against Ms. Campbell. The petition also says that the named defendant judges are liable to the plaintiff for damages as a result of their aiding and abetting Ms. Campbell and conspiring to conceal her actions. So that's my summary of what this lawsuit is about.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court then addressed the materiality of the allegations, finding a difference between materiality and admissible evidence at the trial of the matter, and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [I]n looking at the other allegations of the petition that the defendants seek to strike it is evident to me that many of them are immaterial to the cause of action.... The question is, is whether or not they are material to the cause of action. And I made a determination that most of the [paragraphs] that are complained of are not material.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court concluded that the following paragraphs of Mr. Palowsky's petition contained allegations that were immaterial to his lawsuit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The court will strike Articles 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, paragraph A of 52, and paragraph C of 52, paragraph E of 52, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 79, 80, 81, and 82.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The paragraphs stricken included allegations of payroll irregularities and investigations, as well as assertions of payroll fraud by Ms. Campbell and a conspiracy to cover up the fraud by the Judges. More specifically, the petition asserted the existence of an investigation by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor into possible payroll fraud regarding some Fourth JDC employees being paid for hours that were not worked. Other paragraphs stricken as immaterial regarded the destruction or concealment of documents in other cases by Ms. Campbell and the subsequent knowledge by the Judges. Additionally, paragraphs detailing Ms. Campbell's personal\n   life and work habits were deleted by the trial court. Mr. Palowsky asserted that Ms. Campbell boasted in a local bar that she had shredded or withheld a court document in another case and that she had a weekly \"society\" column entitled, \"A modern guide to handle your scandal,\" in which she made comments, such as, \"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit,\" and, \"It's not cheating if it's in your favor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   While many of the stricken allegations in Mr. Palowsky's amended petition have nothing to do with his present lawsuit, some of the stricken paragraphs arguably show a prior history of concealment or destruction of court documents by Ms. Campbell. Particularly, Paragraphs 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, and 52C refer to the alleged destruction or concealment of court documents by Ms. Campbell in a case handled by another attorney in the Fourth JDC and the Judges' subsequent knowledge of same. Upon careful review of these allegations, and finding that they could have some bearing on the subject matter of the litigation, in that they allege a pattern of behavior by Ms. Campbell of destroying court documents, we cannot find that these paragraphs are immaterial to this matter. Therefore, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in striking Paragraphs 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, and 52C. Additionally, we find an abuse of discretion in striking Paragraphs 58, 61, 63, 68, 69, 71, 80, and 81 as they also refer to Ms. Campbell's pattern of behavior or willingness to act in such a manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Therefore, we reverse in part the December 11, 2015 judgment of the trial court insofar as it granted the motions to strike by the Judges and by Ms. Campbell with regard to Paragraphs 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 52C, 58, 61, 63, 68, 69, 71, 80, and 81 of Mr. Palowsky's amended petition, finding those paragraphs material to the instant matter. We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in striking as immaterial Paragraphs 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 39, 42, 52A, 52E, 59, 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 70, 79, and 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    NO CAUSE OF ACTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As used in the context of the peremptory exception, a \"cause of action\" refers to the operative facts which give rise to the plaintiff's right to judicially assert the action against the defendant.\n   <strong>\n    Scheffler v.

The immunity is extended because of the function it protects rather than the title of the person who claims it.

A judicial opinion is not that of the law clerk, but of the judge. However, law clerks are closely connected with the court's decision-making process and are sounding boards for the judge's tentative opinions and legal researchers who seek the authorities that affect those decisions. Clerks are privy to the judge's thoughts in a way that neither parties to the lawsuit nor his most intimate family members may be. Moreover, the work done by law clerks is supervised, approved, and adopted by the judges who initially authorized it. Law clerks are essentially extensions of the judges at whose pleasure they serve. Therefore, a law clerk who is clearly assisting the judge in carrying out judicial functions is covered by the doctrine of absolute immunity.\n   <strong>\n    Id.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    Mitchell v. McBryde,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521507\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/944/229/#p230\">\n    944 F.2d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230 (5th Cir. 1991). Essentially, the immunity granted to the law clerk is derivative of the immunity afforded the judge and flows from that judicial immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In this matter, after granting the motions to strike, the trial court considered the exceptions of no cause of action filed by Ms. Campbell and by the Judges. The Judges and Ms. Campbell maintain that the trial court correctly granted the exceptions after finding that they were entitled to absolute immunity. In granting the exception of no cause of action filed by the Judges, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   There is no question in my mind that supervision and control of a law clerk employed by a district court is something that would be within the jurisdiction of a district court judge.... The judge has to decide what cases to give to the clerk. The judge has to decide what he wants the clerk to do with regard to those cases. That clerk might have other duties, but all of the duties of the clerk of course are what the judge decides they should be or not be. So there's no doubt that with regard to the actions of the judges in this case in their contact with and in their relationship as the employer of Ms. Campbell that their actions are within their jurisdiction. That other factor is whether the actions are judicial in nature is what is-seems to be the most [contentious] in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The court then discussed the four factors used to determine if acts are judicial in nature, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   I've already stated in reference to the jurisdiction issue about whether or who is involved in the assignment of work and supervision of law clerks and certainly that is a normal judicial function, the supervision, management, assignment, and control of a law clerk is certainly a normal judicial function. There's no one else to perform that function. There's no one else that should perform that function. So number one is clearly satisfied. Number two, is whether the acts occurred in the courtroom or appropriate adjunct spaces.... [I]f there's a complaint that a judge failed to supervise or conspired in supervision or in concealing wrongful acts of a law clerk the question is not whether the judge's actions take him or her out of immunity because you don't examine the act itself. You examine the nature and function of it, and that is the contact between the judge and the law clerk which is a judicial function. So that's where the inquiry with regard to immunity ends. It's not with attempting to separate a particular act out; it's the nature and function of the act which in this case is the allegation that the judges in their role of supervision failed to act properly. Number three, whether this controversy centered around a case pending before the court? Well, there's no doubt about that. That's exactly what the petition is about. That all of this was done to the prejudice of Mr. Palowsky in the case of\n   <em>\n    Pa\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    owsky versus Cork\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   That's what the case is about. So that factor is met. The fourth factor, whether the acts arose directly out of a visit to the judge in his official capacity? Those-that particular factor of course addresses issues or situations where a judge may have made a ruling in the courtroom that someone was aggrieved by. Circumstances don't always permit the application of that, and as\n   <em>\n    Malina\n   </em>\n   says in some situations and I'm quoting from the\n   <em>\n    Malina\n   </em>\n   case; immunity is to be afforded even though one or more of the\n   <em>\n    McAlester\n   </em>\n   factors is not met, and certainly that is the case here.\n   <em>\n    Malina\n   </em>\n   also reminds us that the concept of immunity is to be broadly construed in favor of granting immunity. The allegations of the petition against the judges clearly fall inside these factors, and the judges in this case are granted absolute immunity in the law for their alleged acts of wrongdoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Then, in discussing whether Ms. Campbell was entitled to immunity, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   The question of whether a law clerk should be granted immunity is generally tied to the judge being granted immunity because they generally occur at the same time.... And what the courts say is that it doesn't make any sense to grant immunity to the judge and then leave the law clerk exposed to liability for being part of the same judicial process.... I recognize the difference in the facts of this case from the facts of most cases that you read about immunity of law clerks. As I said generally the judge gets sued, and when the judge gets sued you know the disgruntled litigant sues everybody that was involved in the process that he's disgruntled about. The difference in this case is that the lawsuit starts off against Ms. Campbell alleging that she committed wrongful acts with regard to Mr. Palowsky's case against Mr. Cork. The petition never alleges that Ms. Campbell took those actions at the direction of the judge, the judge assigned to the case or any other judge. Never says that. And then the amending petition adds the judges as conspirators and enablers. So it's in a factual basis chronologically it's not what you see in most of the other cases. But there is no distinction in the way that the actions of Ms. Campbell-there is no distinction in the application of immunity to the facts of this case, as alleged. There is no reason why I would be directed in another direction to apply the law of immunity to Ms. Campbell in this case because of the chronology of what the plaintiff says happened or didn't happen. Her actions, alleged actions, regarding mishandling and destroying documents in the plaintiff's lawsuit are nonetheless actions involving a pending case in the judicial process. So she under the law is entitled to absolute immunity as directed by the cases and by the body of jurisprudence that governs this concept.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Upon our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, after carefully considering the applicable law and jurisprudence, in light of the underlying purpose of the judicial immunity doctrine, we conclude that Mr. Palowsky has stated a cause of action against Ms. Campbell. As previously stated, a law clerk's actions in assisting a judge to carry out judicial functions are covered by the doctrine of absolute immunity. The review, handling, and consideration of the record are all part of the judicial process. However, that immunity cannot extend to the independent act by a law clerk of intentionally destroying documents or withholding documents from the judge or jury without the judge's knowledge. The intentional destruction or concealment of court documents that was not at the direction or instruction of a judge, as alleged herein, is not part of the adjudicative process. Rather, it is the antithesis of the judicial function. Mr. Palowsky asserts that Ms. Campbell was \"uncontrollable for years\" and acting independently outside the scope of her judicial functions as an employee of the court. As alleged, Ms. Campbell was neither assisting the Judges in carrying out judicial functions nor acting at the direction of any judge and was acting in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    Oliva,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542775\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/839/37/#p39\">\n    839 F.2d at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we conclude that Mr. Palowsky has stated a cause of action against Ms. Campbell insofar as he has asserted the intentional concealment or destruction of documents from the court outside of any directive from a judge, and we reverse the December 11, 2015 judgment that sustained Ms. Campbell's exception of no cause of action to the extent that it finds Ms. Campbell absolutely\n   immune for the intentional destruction of court documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As to the Judges, we conclude that they have absolute judicial immunity from Mr. Palowsky's lawsuit. The allegations directed to the Judges in Mr. Palowsky's First Supplemental, Amended, and Restated Petition for Damages do not deprive them of judicial immunity. This immunity applies, \"however erroneous the act may have been, and however injurious in its consequences it may have proved to the plaintiff.\"\n   <strong>\n    Cleavinger,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201485\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/193/#p199\">\n    474 U.S. at 199-200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201485\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/193/#p199\">\n    106 S.Ct. at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <strong>\n    Bradley,\n   </strong>\n   80 U.S. at 347 ).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    Mitchell,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521507\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/944/229/#p230\">\n    944 F.2d at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As to the allegations against the Judges, even were they acting in excess of jurisdiction, they were not acting in the clear absence of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has explained that \"[a] judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority; rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the 'clear absence of all jurisdiction.' \"\n   <strong>\n    Stump,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2334\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/349/#p362\">\n    435 U.S. at 356-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 98 S.Ct. at 1105 (quoting\n   <strong>\n    Bradley,\n   </strong>\n   80 U.S. at 351 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, the actions or inactions of the Judges, in allegedly conspiring to conceal the actions of Ms. Campbell, would have been taken in their judicial capacity in working and interacting with Ms. Campbell within the parameters of the judicial process. There are no allegations of participation by the Judges in the destruction of documents and only allegations of knowledge by the Judges of the destruction of documents after the fact. The allegations against the Judges amount to a failure to properly supervise Ms. Campbell in the handling of cases before the court and the failure to reveal her actions once discovered. Looking at the nature and function of the actions of the Judges, and not the acts themselves, the Judges' actions encompass the supervision of and working with a law clerk on cases before them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we cannot find error and affirm the December 11, 2015 judgment of the trial court that sustained the Judges' exception of no cause of action and dismissed all claims against the Judges with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the above and foregoing reasons, we reverse in part the December 11, 2015 judgment of the trial court insofar as it granted the motions to strike by the Judges and by Ms. Campbell with regard to Paragraphs 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 52C, 58, 61, 63, 68, 69, 71, 80, and 81 of Mr. Palowsky's amended petition.

Defendant Judges\n   are liable\n   <em>\n    in solido\n   </em>\n   to Palowsky for damages he has suffered as the result of their aiding and abetting Campbell by allowing her free rein to do as she pleased and then conspiring to conceal Campbell's acts which compounded the adverse effects of her acts on Palowsky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    8.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Palowsky submits first, though, that his allegations against Defendants must be viewed in light of other actions they have taken in recent years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Campbell's History of Payroll Fraud and Defendant Judges' Complicit Cover-Up of Same\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    9.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendant Campbell is the highest paid law clerk in the Fourth JDC even though she is the only Fourth JDC law clerk who is not a licensed attorney and even though there is at least one law clerk who has been employed there longer than she has been.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    10.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Upon information and belief, Campbell has not been to a continuing legal education course since graduating from law school in Alabama 15 years ago. Instead, she apparently receives continuous on-the-job training from different judges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    11.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   On March 3, 2015,\n   <em>\n    The News-Star\n   </em>\n   reported that the Louisiana Legislative Auditor had issued a report indicating that some Fourth JDC employees might have been paid for hours which were not worked. In other words, payroll fraud had probably been committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    12.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Defendant Campbell was apparently the only subject of the Auditor's report on suspected payroll fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    13.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Upon information and belief, unlike all other law clerks employed by the Fourth JDC, Campbell reportedly did not electronically enter the time she spent at work until after May 2014, a month she \"unexpectedly\" had off without pay. Furthermore, her office reportedly went vacant for days, if not weeks, at a time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    14.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Moreover, Campbell has posted several pictures on her Facebook page which were viewable by the public\n   <sup>\n    8\n   </sup>\n   and which indicated that she not only did her job in restaurants and/or bars, but also that she drank alcohol while doing so. For example, she captioned one picture, which was obviously taken in a restaurant and which showed food and alcoholic beverages, \"Seafood nachos at the office.\" She then posted a picture from the same restaurant of her half-eaten meal and two empty glasses and commented, \"Too many house hooker drinks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    15.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Notably, Defendants Amman, Sharp, and Rambo, along with Judge B. Scott Leehy, certified Campbell's time sheets and records for state payroll.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    16.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Defendant Judges all owe an administrative duty to properly audit, investigate, and report suspected payroll fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    17.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   As Chief Judge, Defendant Winters' present administrative duties and responsibilities include the proper auditing, investigating, and reporting of any suspected payroll fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    18.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Nonetheless, Defendant Judges have not only allowed Campbell to commit payroll fraud, but they have also actively schemed to cover up same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    19.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   As just one example, Defendant Winters filed suit number 15-0770 on March 20, 2015, against Hanna Media Inc., d/b/a/\n   <em>\n    The Ouachita Citizen\n   </em>\n   newspaper, after it filed a criminal complaint against the Court over public records requests dealing with the Court's internal investigations of possible payroll fraud involving Campbell as well as her felonious destruction of court documents, which is discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    20.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In that suit, the Court argued that Campbell's right to privacy with regard to her employment file was stronger than the public's right to know if its tax funds were being used to pay someone who was committing, or allegedly committing, payroll fraud. Campbell intervened in that suit and, thereby, became a party to the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    21.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Even though the Legislative Auditor had reported that some court employees might have been paid for hours which they did not work, and even though Campbell had posted pictures on her Facebook page which indicated that she was eating and drinking alcohol at her \"office,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   restaurants or bars, Defendant Winters, on behalf of the Court, stridently protected Campbell's privacy \"rights\" and deprived the public of the opportunity to learn whether they were paying her to \"work\" while she was out of the office eating and drinking alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    22.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Additionally, in that same litigation, a draft judgment which was unsigned, undated, and unfiled in the suit record was somehow received and circulated by and between Campbell, a party litigant, and Defendant Jones more than\n   <strong>\n    one week in advance\n   </strong>\n   of any signed and dated judgment or reasons for judgment being made available to the public or to the defendant therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    23.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In an interview with\n   <em>\n    The Ouachita Citizen,\n   </em>\n   Judge Jones admitted the impropriety of having an unsigned and undated draft of a judgment before same is released to all parties in the litigation, but he refused to state from whom he obtained such document and, more disturbingly, when it was obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    24.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Upon information, Defendant Campbell had two deputy clerks of court aiding and abetting her document destruction, removal, and/or mishandling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    25.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Palowsky avers that Defendants Jones and Campbell were clandestinely working to improperly obtain\n   <em>\n    ex part\u00e9\n   </em>\n   the judgment of the\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   judge assigned to hear Defendant Winters' lawsuit, if not to actually help influence and/or draft the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    26.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Given these facts, Palowsky submits that not only were Defendant Judges complicit in Defendant Campbell's payroll fraud, but they also schemed and conspired with her to conceal the fraud from the tax-paying public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Campbell's History of Destruction, Mishandling, and/or Concealment of Documents and Defendant Judges' Complicit Cover-Up of Same\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    27.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Defendant Judges all owe an administrative duty to properly audit, investigate, and report suspected document destruction, concealment, and/or mishandling. As Chief Judge, Defendant Winters' present administrative duties and responsibilities include the proper auditing, investigating, and reporting of any suspected document destruction, concealment, and/or mishandling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    28.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In addition to having a history of committing payroll fraud, Campbell also has a history of destroying and/or concealing court documents, and Defendant Judges have covered this up to protect Campbell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    29.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   For example, in 2012, Monroe attorney Cody Rials complained to Defendant Sharp that Campbell had withheld and/or shredded his court document in a case that was pending before said judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    30.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Upon information and belief, the investigation of Campbell's suspected felonious conduct was assigned to Defendant Sharp, who, upon information and belief, interviewed an eyewitness who confirmed that he observed Campbell bragging in a local bar that she had destroyed Rials' court document. Nevertheless, Sharp, who found the eyewitness to be credible, refused to investigate further, and he shut the investigation down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    31.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Thus, in 2012, Defendant Sharp covered up Campbell's destruction of Rials' document and remained silent as to same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    32.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In 2014, when Defendant Campbell wrote \"A modern guide to handle your scandal,\" one of her weekly \"society\" columns in\n   <em>\n    The News-Star,\n   </em>\n   Rials believed that Campbell was goading him and gloating over the fact that she had gotten away with destroying his document. As a result, he wrote to court personnel to again complain about Campbell's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <strong>\n    33.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Upon information and belief, Rials was then ordered to reduce his complaint of such felonious conduct to writing, which he did. The Court then appointed Defendant Jones to investigate, which is a purely administrative task, Rials' complaint of Campbell's felonious misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    34.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   It is believed that during the investigation, Defendants Sharp and Jones interviewed an unbiased disinterested witness who personally saw and heard Campbell sitting in a bar boasting about shredding Rials' document so that Sharp could not review it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    35.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Once the eyewitness, a local attorney, was interviewed and found credible, the \"investigation\" was closed and the cover up began yet again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    36.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   No official Fourth JDC records of the investigation are believed to have survived Defendant Jones' retirement at the end of 2014. In fact, Defendants Winters and Jones advised\n   <em>\n    The Ouachita Citizen\n   </em>\n   that there were no discipline records involving Campbell which the Court could provide in response to the newspaper's request for public records in March 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    37.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Further, during the trial of the Court's suit against\n   <em>\n    The Ouachita Citizen,\n   </em>\n   counsel for the Court argued to the\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   judge that there was no \"eyewitness\" testimony to Campbell's alleged felonious destruction of court documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    38.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Perhaps more importantly, although the Court admitted that it had Rials' written complaint, it argued that Campbell's destruction of court documents was a mere \"personnel\n   matter,\" and that Campbell's privacy rights outweighed the tax-paying public's right to know whether a Court employee was destroying documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    39.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Additionally, upon information and belief, when the Clerk of Court could not locate\n   <em>\n    52\n   </em>\n   writ applications which had been \"missing\" for over a year, it was discovered that Campbell, who was clerking for Defendant Sharp at the time, had used the applications as an end table in her office. Nonetheless, it does not appear that she was ever reprimanded, much less punished, for same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    40.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Thus, Palowsky submits that not only were Defendant Judges complicit in Defendant Campbell's felonious destruction of documents, but they also schemed and conspired with her to cover up same from the tax-paying public and from litigants and their counsel. Defendant Judges' affirmative acts to cover up Campbell's felonious conduct amounts to misprision of a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    41.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Actions in\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Palowsky v.

Even though Campbell's conduct had been corroborated by an eyewitness interviewed by Defendant Sharp who stated that Campbell boasted in a local bar that she had, indeed, shredded or withheld a court document in order to cause loss, injury, or inconvenience to attorney Rials, Defendant Judges refused to do anything to control, much less punish, Campbell. This showed Palowsky that Campbell had aptly demonstrated that she was beyond supervision, let alone discipline, and furthermore that Defendant Judges were covering up her actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   D. In 2014, Defendant Jones was appointed to investigate complaints that Campbell was improperly \"handling\" Palowsky's filings. Defendant Jones concluded that the missing documents resulted from nothing more than delays caused by a new \"filing process\" in the Clerk's office. Nevertheless, the Clerk of Court advised counsel for Palowsky that the new \"filing process\" referenced by Defendant Jones did not exist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   E.

In compliance with this Court's local rules, Palowsky contemporaneously filed a supporting memorandum with the Clerk of Court detailing the facts and circumstances, including Campbell's actions, which justified his recusal request. Moreover, counsel hand delivered a copy of same to Judge Rambo's chambers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   <strong>\n    55.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Shortly after the recusal motion and memorandum were filed, Defendant Rambo held a status conference wherein he expressed his extreme displeasure to Plaintiff's counsel that Plaintiff had filed a motion to recuse\n   <strong>\n    without a supporting memorandum.\n   </strong>\n   Counsel for AESI and Palowsky advised Defendant Rambo that was exactly why they were asking him to recuse himself,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   because their filings were obviously being intercepted before he could read them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   <strong>\n    56.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Obviously Defendant Campbell had, once again, acted outside the course and scope of her employment to intentionally harm Palowsky by withholding and/or concealing court documents and wrongfully thwarting his constitutional rights to due process and access to courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <strong>\n    57.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   After Palowsky and AESI suffered harm which was intentionally and maliciously inflicted upon them in Defendant Rambo's court for more than two years by Campbell in her efforts to damage them and to assist their opponents and their counsel, Defendant Rambo, while denying bias, recused himself without a hearing. Palowsky's case was then assigned to Defendant Sharp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   <strong>\n    58.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Palowsky then filed a motion to recuse the Fourth JDC judges\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   on the basis that Campbell and the Court had become inextricably intertwined in litigation when Defendant Winters, on behalf of all the judges, filed suit against\n   <em>\n    The Ouachita Citizen\n   </em>\n   to protect Defendant Campbell's alleged privacy rights as discussed in paragraphs 18 through 26 above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    59.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Palowsky's motion to recuse has recently been set for hearing in front of Defendant Sharp on August 20, 2015; however, he has informed all counsel in writing that he is not going to allow any testimony to be submitted during that hearing. Such refusal to hear evidentiary testimony is a clear violation of Palowsky's rights of due process and meaningful access to courts and is being done for the sole purpose of continuing the cover up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   <strong>\n    60.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Palowsky avers that Defendant Judges' actions have been undertaken to cover up Campbell's misdeeds and felonious acts and to prevent any testimony or evidence of same from becoming part of the record in his litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   <strong>\n    61.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Palowsky submits that his allegations against Campbell and Defendant Judges must be viewed in light of other actions she has taken during her employment and the judges' concealing of same all as set forth above in paragraphs 9 through 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   <strong>\n    62.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Palowsky also submits that his allegations must be considered in light of Defendant Campbell's personal philosophies on life which she has smugly published in her weekly \"society\" column during his litigation and which might lead one to believe that she is, to put it mildly, narcissistic and incapable of submitting to any authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   <strong>\n    63.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   For example, on May 31, 2015, she wrote, \"You will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit,\" a quote which she attributed to Oscar Wilde before he was imprisoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   <strong>\n    64.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   On February 15, 2015, she quoted Oscar Wilde again when she said that \"to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   <strong>\n    65.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   On April 5, 2015, she told her readers as follows: \"I say live life to the fullest, follow no one's rules except your own (and law enforcement, of course) and continue to excel at your own personal spectacular talents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   <strong>\n    66.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   On April 12, 2015, she ended her column by quoting Henry Rollins: \"In winter, I plot and plan.

David Johansen's words \"I am doing exactly what I want to do, and I am having fun doing it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   <strong>\n    68.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   On June 21, 2015, Campbell wrote, \"Escape the ordinary. Almost anything is possible if you have enough time and enough nerve.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   <strong>\n    69.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   On July 12, 2015, she penned, \"It's not cheating if it's in our favor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <strong>\n    70.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   In another blatant display of narcissism, when Campbell's alleged improprieties and the litigation between the Court and\n   <em>\n    The Ouachita Citizen\n   </em>\n   were reported on by\n   <em>\n    The Acadiana Advocate,\n   </em>\n   Campbell posted a comment on the paper's online site and stated as follows: \"Dear advocate [sic]: first of all my name is spelled Allyson, not Allison.\" She then went on to explain the role of an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   <strong>\n    71.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Palowsky notes that by allowing Campbell to write her weekly \"society\" column in which she has published articles which clearly show her admiration for Palowsky's opponent's attorney Hayes, by failing to properly supervise her, and by allowing, either directly or indirectly, her to withhold court documents in order to delay proceedings and harm Palowsky,\n   Defendants Rambo, Amman, Winters, Jones, and Sharp have violated multiple Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   <strong>\n    72.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   For example, Canon 3(A)(3) requires that a judge have his staff be \"patient, dignified, and courteous\" to litigants and lawyers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   <strong>\n    73.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Canon 3(A)(4) states that a judge shall not permit his staff to \"manifest bias or prejudice\" through \"conduct or words.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   <strong>\n    74.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Canon 3(A)(8) prohibits a judge and his personnel from \"mak[ing] any public comment that might reasonably be expected to affect [a pending proceeding's] outcome or impair its fairness....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   <strong>\n    75.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Canon 3(B)(2) states that a \"judge shall require staff, court officials and others subject to the judge's direction and control to observe the standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to the judge and to refrain from manifesting bias or prejudice in the performance of their official duties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   <strong>\n    76.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Palowsky notes that Article V, \u00a7 25(C) of the Louisiana Constitution provides in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   On recommendation of the judiciary commission, the supreme court may censure, suspend with or without salary, remove from office, or retire involuntarily a judge for willful misconduct relating to his official duty, willful and persistent failure to perform his duty, persistent and public conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, conduct while in office which would constitute a felony, or conviction of a felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   <strong>\n    77.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Regardless of Defendant Campbell's writings in her society column, Palowsky states that her actions of improperly handling pleadings and filings appear to be not only habitual, but also, at the very least, to be tacitly approved by Defendant Judges as she has apparently never even been reprimanded, much less disciplined, for same by any of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   <strong>\n    78.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   It is more likely, though, that Campbell's actions have been purposely concealed by Defendant Judges in a scheme to maliciously defraud and harm Palowsky and deprive him of his constitutional rights to due process and access to courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Recusal of All Judges of This Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   <strong>\n    79.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Palowsky avers that all the judges of the Fourth JDC should recuse themselves from this matter since Defendants are employees of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   <strong>\n    80.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   Moreover, as discussed above, this Court, through Defendant Judges, has an apparent history of protecting Campbell even though several attorneys in different cases, including\n   <em>\n    Palowsky v. Cork,\n   </em>\n   have complained about her suspected felonious destruction of documents and even though she has reportedly been investigated for public payroll fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   <strong>\n    81.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   Not only has this Court allowed Campbell to do as she pleases at the courthouse without recourse, but as noted above, it chose to sue a local newspaper to protect her employment records from being made public, and therein, it denied that there were any eyewitnesses to Campbell's destruction of documents even though Defendants Jones and Sharp reportedly interviewed an eyewitness who personally heard Campbell bragging about same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   <strong>\n    82.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   The above facts and circumstances require that the Fourth JDC be recused\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   and an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   judge be appointed to hear and decide the instant lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Requests for Relief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   <strong>\n    83.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   To date, Plaintiff has endured more than two years of needless delay, court costs, attorney fees, embarrassment, mental stress, and inconvenience (as referred to in Civil Code article 1953) and has, likewise, been denied his constitutional rights to due process of law and access to courts as a result of Campbell's pattern of malicious and intentional misconduct and Defendant Judges' complicity in same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   <strong>\n    84.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   Campbell's wrongdoings have been reported time and again by different attorneys in different cases and investigated time and again by Defendant Judges but have nevertheless been allowed to continue. It is now painfully apparent that not only has Campbell been unsupervised and uncontrollable for years, but Defendant Judges have actively schemed to allow her conduct to continue unabatedly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   <strong>\n    85.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Palowsky avers that Campbell's and Defendant Judges' actions constitute fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, abuse of process, destruction or concealment of public records, misprision of felonies, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violation of his rights under the Louisiana Constitution to due process and access to courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   <strong>\n    86.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   Palowsky therefore states that he, individually and on behalf of AESI, is entitled to be compensated for any and all damages that he and AESI have suffered as the result of Defendants' fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, abuse of process, destruction or concealment of public records, misprision of felonies, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violation of his Louisiana constitutional rights to due process and access to courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   <strong>\n    87.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   At this time, Plaintiff seeks no relief under any federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   <strong>\n    88.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   Palowsky hereby requests a trial by jury on all his claims, including without limitation, his intentional tort claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Stanley R.
