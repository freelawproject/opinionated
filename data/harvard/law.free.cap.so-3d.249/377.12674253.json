This appeal arises from the Marion County Youth Court's adjudication of E.K.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a neglected child. A number of\n   errors stem from this adjudication. First, E.K. was adjudicated neglected even though her mother was not properly before the youth court and her father received no notice of the adjudication hearing. Second, after review, we find that the neglect petition was legally insufficient to provide notice to E.K. or her parents of the neglect charges. Third, the evidence offered to support a finding of neglect at the adjudication hearing was legally insufficient. As such, we vacate the youth court's adjudication order and render judgment in favor of E.K. and her parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Elizabeth A. King and Timothy King are the parents of E.K. E.K. was born on December 31, 2001. With a history of ADHD, epilepsy, autism, mental disability and obsessive, compulsive disorder (OCD), E.K. functioned on the level of a two-year-old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Elizabeth and Timothy had been separated for two weeks at the time of the initial investigation in this case. They had been divorced for four years in the past before having remarried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. In December 2015, the Mississippi Department of Human Services Division of Family and Children's Services\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"DHS\") was contacted by law enforcement officials about Elizabeth and E.K. DHS responded to Elizabeth's residence on December 4, 2015. Law enforcement officers on the scene were concerned that Elizabeth was high on drugs, due to her repetitive 911 calls. According to the report, Elizabeth had called 911 multiple times, claiming that Timothy was in her attic or outside her home attempting to gain access to her residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. DHS prepared an investigative report that catalogued its interactions with Elizabeth and E.K. \"No abuse or neglect was substantiated\" during DHS's visit, and the report found that Elizabeth loved E.K., was protective of her, and assisted her. Elizabeth and E.K. had a \"great relationship.\" Further, there was no evidence of serious physical harm or injury and no reported or evident physical injuries. Timothy's history of domestic violence toward Elizabeth, Elizabeth's fear of Timothy, and the fact that Timothy \"has not harmed [E.K.]\" were catalogued in the report. Elizabeth denied using drugs but did test positive for marijuana use. Concerning Elizabeth's positive test for marijuana, the report stated that \"this is being addressed and will be recommended for services by the agency.\" One narrative attached to the investigative report recounted that Elizabeth admitted to taking a \"Colonapin [sic] to try to get some sleep.\" Elizabeth acknowledged that the \"Colonapin\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   was not prescribed for her by a physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. According to the report, Elizabeth secured a protective order against Timothy and changed the locks to her residence. Last, the report noted that DHS was ordered by the Marion County Youth Court\n   \"to open prevention case to monitor to [sic] safety in the home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. The record contains a letter that accompanied the DHS investigative report and recommended that the youth court informally monitor the Kings. The initial intake order entered in the youth court followed the letter's recommendation and ordered informal monitoring of the Kings or E.K. DHS's court summary next revealed that Elizabeth had entered a service agreement on January 27, 2016. According to the summary, Elizabeth had tested negative for drugs on January 5, 2016, and had tested \"negative dilute\" on February 2, 2016; March 3, 2016; and March 21, 2016. On April 20, 2016, Elizabeth had informed DHS that she was tired and frustrated and would not take any more drug tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. As a result of Elizabeth's refusal, a second intake order was entered in the youth court. This intake order directed a formal petition to be entered. DHS directed a formal petition to adjudicate E.K. as a neglected child be entered. Count 1 of the petition alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   That on or about 04/20/2016, in MARION COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI, [E.K.] did become a NEGLECTED CHILD as defined by \u00a7 43-21-105(1) of the Mississippi Code of 1972, Annotated. Prevention case was open [sic] to monitor the safety issues in the home. During a visit to the home the mother told the DHS Worker that she was tires [sic] and frustrated and would not do any more drug tests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Renee Porter was appointed as the attorney and guardian ad litem (GAL) for E.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. DHS issued summons to Elizabeth and Timothy on May 18, 2016, for an adjudication hearing on June 6, 2016. The summons was returned unserved on June 2, 2016, with the note: \"unable to make contact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. The adjudication hearing was held on June 6, 2016. Elizabeth, E.K., and the GAL were present. At the hearing, Michelle Tony, a DHS caseworker, testified to the grounds for the neglect petition. Tony testified that the agency had been contacted by law enforcement officers who were concerned that Elizabeth was mentally ill. Tony maintained that \"[t]he home checked out fine\" and that a prevention case was opened after Elizabeth tested positive for marijuana. In response to the GAL's questioning, Tony also mentioned that Elizabeth was refusing to take any additional drug tests. From the bench, the youth court then adjudicated E.K. as neglected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. It appears from the transcript that the youth court immediately proceeded to the disposition hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The GAL asked Elizabeth if she would take a drug test, and-for the first time on the record-Elizabeth spoke, replying: \"I'll go take a drug test, but my child ain't neglected. And you ... every time you are at my house, you state that [E.K.] is in the best of care. Did you not? Do you not--\" The prosecutor immediately objected, and the GAL moved to continue the hearing to allow Elizabeth to take a drug test. The court then questioned Elizabeth concerning the \"negative-dilute\" drug tests. The\n   court informed Elizabeth, \"We're concerned about drug use. If there's no drug use, we're not concerned. We are concerned about the child. She seems to be doing well under your care, but we want to continue that. We just need a little help from you.\" Elizabeth stated, \"If [the hair follicle drug test is] court ordered, I'll take it.\" The youth court continued the hearing until June 20, 2016, and ordered Elizabeth and Timothy to take a hair-follicle drug test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12. On June 20, 2016, the youth court entered an emergency custody order, awarding custody of E.K. to the Marion County Department of Human Services pending a shelter hearing. Another emergency custody order awarded custody of E.K to DHS and ordered law enforcement officials to assist in locating E.K. At the shelter hearing held on June 28, 2016, Tony explained that E.K. could not be located during this time. Tony testified that on June 25, 2016, law enforcement officials found E.K. and DHS took custody of her. At this same hearing, counsel for the Kings questioned the sufficiency of the adjudication of E.K. as neglected. The GAL objected to the attacks on the adjudication of E.K. After the hearing, the youth court determined that custody should remain with DHS. The youth court also ordered Elizabeth and Timothy to submit to a hair-follicle drug test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13. Elizabeth's and Timothy's counsel formally entered an appearance on July 1, 2016, and filed two motions. The first motion was to set aside the shelter order, to return E.K. to Elizabeth and Timothy and to stay local proceedings; the second motion was for permission to seek interlocutory appeal. The second motion attacked the evidentiary basis of the adjudication of E.K. as a neglected child. After a hearing, the youth court entered an order permitting Elizabeth's and Timothy's interlocutory appeal \"of this Court['s] June 6, 2016 Adjudication Order....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14. On February 21, 2017, the youth court again ordered Elizabeth to submit to a hair-follicle test due to her test showing \"diluted.\" This time, though, it found that Timothy did not have to submit to a hair follicle test \"in that none of his test[s] were questionable.\" Elizabeth submitted to the hair-follicle test on March 3, 2017. On April 3, 2017, the youth court entered a permanency order, granting custody of E.K to Elizabeth and Timothy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15. E.K., Elizabeth, and Timothy now appeal the sufficiency of the neglect petition, the sufficiency of the evidence supporting adjudication, the lack of notice and service of process to Elizabeth and Timothy for the adjudication hearing, several of the custody orders and the orders concerning the hair-follicle drug tests. The issues related to the adjudication order are dispositive of the appeal before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16. \" 'The appellate standard of review for youth court proceedings is the same as that which we apply to appeals from chancery court....' \"\n   <em>\n    In re J.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6895463\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/204/#p208\">\n    151 So.3d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 208 (Miss. 2014) (quoting\n   <em>\n    A.B. v.

Several cases also are implicated in this analysis. Much of Mississippi's caselaw that involves notice and service of process in youth court interpreted previous versions of the Youth Court Act.

For instance, the first time that Elizabeth spoke on the record was during the initial disposition hearing, which was held immediately after E.K was adjudicated neglected. Speaking for the first time, Elizabeth consented to a drug test, but, in doing so, revealed that she did not consent to or agree with the youth court's adjudication of E.K. as a neglected child. Elizabeth declared: \"I'll go take a drug test, but my child ain't neglected. And you ... every time you're at my house, you state that [E.K.] is in the best care. Did you not? Do you not --\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   At this point, the youth court prosecutor interrupted Elizabeth with an objection, presumably since E.K. already had been adjudicated as neglected. The youth court eventually continued the disposition hearing and ordered a drug test for Elizabeth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 30. The first time that Elizabeth spoke on the record, she immediately sought to contradict the evidence that was entered at the adjudication hearing, as was her right under Section 43-21-557(1)(e)(iv). The fact that Elizabeth improperly raised this evidence at the disposition hearing instead of at the adjudication hearing only underscores her lack of understanding of the proceedings and the gravity of the youth court's violation of her right to representation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Timothy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 31.

Timothy also can prove prejudice.

Soon after the current Youth Court Act was passed into law, this Court addressed a number of petitions that it found to be insufficient. Most, if not all, of these cases were delinquency proceedings that relied on the Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    In Interest of Dennis\n   </em>\n   . There, this Court determined that the petition on which the minor was adjudicated was insufficient to notice the minor or his parents of the specific acts of misconduct.\n   <em>\n    In Interest of Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9794308\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/291/731/#p733\">\n    291 So.2d at 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, we acknowledge the difference between a delinquency proceeding (which is quasi-criminal) and a neglect proceeding. While a neglect petition perhaps should not be held to the same standard as a criminal indictment, the petition-given Sections 43-21-455 and 43-21-105 -has to be legally sufficient to provide the minor and her parents notice of \"the particular circumstances which will be inquired into at the adjudicatory proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    In Interest of Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9794308\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/291/731/#p733\">\n    291 So.2d at 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 39. The petition here cited the definition of \"neglected child\" under\n   Section 43-21-105(1). The facts described in the petition to adjudicate E.K. as neglected, though, were minimal. In total, the facts in the petition read: \"Prevention case was open to monitor the safety issues in the home. During a visit to the home the mother told the DHS Worker that she was tired and frustrated and would not do any more drug tests.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 40. Without any connection to E.K. as a neglected child these facts failed to inform E.K., Elizabeth or Timothy of the particular circumstances that would be adjudicated. The Kings were left to guess the connection between Elizabeth's frustration and decision not to submit to further testing and the neglect of E.K. There were no facts to \"show\" that E.K. was \"a neglected child.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2043-21-455\">\n    Miss.

The insufficiency of the petition is clearer when considering the context of this case as revealed by the record. The investigative reports are full of commendations of Elizabeth's care for E.K., their healthy relationship and the love that E.K. demonstrates towards Elizabeth. In the absence of a causal connection between the facts alleged in the petition and the petition's charge of neglect, the petition was legally insufficient to provide notice to E.K., Elizabeth or Timothy of \"the particular circumstances which w[ere to] be inquired into at the adjudicatory proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    In Interest of Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9794308\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/291/731/#p733\">\n    291 So.2d at 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Sufficiency of the Evidence of Adjudication\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 42. The Kings further maintain that the evidence on which the youth court adjudicated E.K. as neglected was insufficient. This Court has described the standard of review of the sufficiency of the evidence supporting an adjudicatory order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   When a Youth Court makes an adjudication of neglect, this Court considers all the evidence before the Youth Court in the light most favorable to the State.

Section 43-21-551 provides that \"an adjudicatory hearing shall be held ... to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to find that the child is ... a neglected child.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2043-21-551\">\n    Miss.

Moreover, \"[i]n arriving at its adjudicatory decision, the youth court shall consider only evidence which has been formally admitted at the adjudicatory hearing.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2043-21-559\">\n    Miss.

From a review of the transcript, we find no evidence entered at the adjudication that related to E.K.'s status as a neglected child. Tony, the DHS caseworker, testified that Elizabeth's home checked out fine and that \"she was just very frightened of her husband.\" Tony maintained that Elizabeth was given a drug test and tested positive for marijuana. She also testified that Elizabeth refused to take further drug tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 44. None of the testimony at the hearing proved that E.K. was neglected. No evidence was offered to show that Elizabeth's fear of Timothy somehow led to E.K. being neglected. Further, the evidence of Elizabeth's positive test for marijuana usage-while potentially relevant-was not shown to have affected E.K. at all. In fact, Tony testified that Elizabeth's home \"checked out fine\"-evidencing Elizabeth's care for E.K. In order to have\n   been sufficient to adjudicate E.K. as a neglected child, the evidence must have shown that she actually was neglected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 45. Elizabeth's marijuana usage does not negate the requirement of a causal connection between the drug usage and the neglect. This is a familiar concept under the Youth Court Act in other contexts. For instance, a positive drug test for marijuana usage is insufficient on its own to establish probable cause for the issuance of a custody order.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2043-21-301\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-21-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) (Rev. 2015). In part, Section 43-21-301 reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   A finding of probable cause ... shall not be based solely upon a positive drug test of a child's parent for marijuana;\n   <em>\n    however, a finding of probable cause may be based upon an evidence-based finding of harm to the child or a parent's inability to provide for the care and supervision of the child due to the parent's use of marijuana.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2043-21-301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Here, there was no testimony or evidence of any relation between Elizabeth's positive test result and E.K.'s status as neglected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 46. The youth court did not err in ordering DHS to monitor the Kings. Its authority to do so-based on a preliminary inquiry after receiving a report from DHS-is found in Mississippi Code Section 43-21-357(2)(c). The evidence of Elizabeth's drug usage was sufficient for DHS to monitor the Kings and E.K. Further, Elizabeth's later, diluted negative results \"may [have] create[d] suspicion, or perhaps even an inference of drug use\" that merited further monitoring and investigation.\n   <em>\n    A.B. v. Lauderdale Cty. Dep't of Human Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7063696\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/13/1263/#p1266\">\n    13 So.3d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1268 (Miss. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 47. Elizabeth's refusal to submit to further drug screens, however, did not automatically render E.K. neglected. As Elizabeth had entered into a service agreement with DHS, she arguably was violating the youth court's initial intake order that required DHS to monitor E.K. The solution to Elizabeth's refusal to take additional drug tests, though, was to seek to enforce the intake order against Elizabeth in the youth court. The solution was not to have E.K. adjudicated neglected where the evidence did not support that finding. Even when viewed in the light most favorable to the adjudication, the evidence failed to demonstrate that E.K. was neglected within the meaning of Section 43-21-105(l).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 48. First, a review of the record and transcript reveals that Elizabeth did not knowingly or voluntarily waive her right to service of process or her right to representation of counsel for E.K.'s adjudicatory hearing and the subsequent disposition hearing. The record also is devoid of any evidence of notice to Timothy of his daughter's adjudication. Despite the fact that Elizabeth was not properly before the court and Timothy was not before the court at all, the youth court adjudicated their daughter neglected and ordered them to submit to drug screens. Second, the neglect petition was legally insufficient to give notice to E.K., Elizabeth or Timothy of \"the particular circumstances which w[ere to] be inquired into at the adjudicatory proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    In Interest of Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9794308\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/291/731/#p733\">\n    291 So.2d at 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, the evidence offered\n   at the adjudicatory hearing of E.K.'s status as neglected was insufficient to support the neglect adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 49. While we do not doubt that the youth court acted in a sincere belief that it had E.K.'s interests in mind, the record before us reveals a worrisome disregard for the provisions of the Youth Court Act. The provisions of the Youth Court Act are designed to protect \"the child's best interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2043-21-103\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-21-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2015). Further, the provisions support our state's public policy \"that the parents of each child shall be primarily responsible for the care, support, education and welfare of such children.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2043-21-103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, all of the proceedings after the adjudication hearing are hopelessly infected by the errors discussed above. Thus, we vacate the youth court's adjudication order and render final judgment in favor of the Kings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 50.\n   <strong>\n    VACATED AND RENDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   WALLER, C.J., RANDOLPH AND KITCHENS, P.JJ., KING, COLEMAN, MAXWELL AND ISHEE, JJ., CONCUR.
