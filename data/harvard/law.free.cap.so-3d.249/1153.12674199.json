R. Crim. P., attacking his capital-murder conviction and sentence of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In August 2005, Saunders was convicted of murdering 77-year-old Melvin Clemons during the course of a robbery and a burglary and of attempting to murder Agnes Clemons. Saunders was sentenced to death for his capital-murder convictions and to life imprisonment for his attempted-murder conviction. We affirmed his convictions on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saunders v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7054209\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/10/53/\">\n    10 So.3d 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. Crim. App. 2007). This Court issued the certificate of judgment on December 1, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2009, Saunders filed a timely postconviction petition in the Baldwin\n   Circuit Court. (R. 27.) The State filed its answer and a motion to dismiss the petition. (R. 104.) The circuit court summarily dismissed Saunders's petition. In August 2010, Saunders filed a Rule 32.1(f), Ala. R. Crim. P., motion to extend the time for appealing the summary dismissal of his petition, because, he said, he had not been notified that his postconviction petition had been dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court denied that motion. Saunders then filed a notice of appeal. By order dated June 28, 2011, this Court dismissed that appeal after holding that the circuit court's ruling was void because no filing fee had been paid and the payment of the filing fee had not been waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saunders v. State\n   </em>\n   (CR-10-0005, June 28, 2011),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20So.%203d%20232\">\n    107 So.3d 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. Crim. App. 2011) (table).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While the appeal in\n   <em>\n    Saunders v. State\n   </em>\n   , (CR-10-0005), was pending in this Court, Saunders filed three additional postconviction petitions seeking an out-of-time appeal from the circuit court's ruling dismissing his first postconviction petition. He filed postconviction petitions in August 2010, January 2011, and again in June 2011. The circuit court denied the petition Saunders filed in January 2011, and Saunders appealed. By order dated April 24, 2013, this Court dismissed that appeal after finding that the circuit court's ruling was void because jurisdiction of the case was solely in this Court at the time that the circuit court issued its ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saunders v. State\n   </em>\n   (CR-10-1375, April 24, 2013),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20So.%203d%201232\">\n    161 So.3d 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. Crim. App. 2013) (table). We also noted in the order of dismissal, that in the interest of judicial economy, it would be within the circuit court's discretion to consolidate the remaining postconviction petitions Saunders had filed in that court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The circuit court consolidated Saunders's remaining postconviction petitions and granted Saunders's request for an out-of-time appeal. This appeal is from the circuit court's ruling of February 11, 2010, summarily dismissing Saunders's first postconviction petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On direct appeal, this Court stated the following facts surrounding Saunders's convictions as set out by Saunders in his detailed confession to police:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Saunders told Sgt. [Tony] Fuqua that he had purchased crack cocaine twice on July 9; the first time he purchased and smoked $50 worth of the drug, the second time he purchased $100 worth of the drug. Saunders said that he went onto the property next to his mother's mobile home, on the other side of a hedgerow, to smoke the last of his crack cocaine because he was ashamed of smoking crack, and he did not want to be near his mother's mobile home when he was ingesting the drug. Saunders said that Mr. Clemons saw him and asked him what he was doing there, and that he told Mr. Clemons that he was getting high; Mr. Clemons then yelled at him and told him to get off the property. Saunders told Sgt. Fuqua that as Mr. Clemons turned\n   to leave, Saunders heard him say something about calling the police; that he became infuriated; and that he then picked up the crowbar and hit Mr. Clemons on the head several times. Saunders said that he was not sure, but that he believed Mr. Clemons was dead. Saunders acknowledged that he had borrowed the crowbar from Mr. Clemons earlier that day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Saunders told Sgt. Fuqua that after he hit Mr. Clemons, he wandered around to clear his head, and then decided to approach the Clemonses' house to try to take any valuables so that he could buy more crack cocaine. He admitted that he feigned an asthma attack and that Mrs. Clemons then let him inside the house. Saunders said that he became angry when Mrs. Clemons tried to call for help, and he grabbed her from behind. Saunders also said that he smoked crack cocaine in the house several times and that Mrs. Clemons had poured a glass of milk for him; according to Saunders, milk helped calm him when he smoked crack cocaine. Sgt. Fuqua asked Saunders about the Windex brand glass cleaner, and Saunders told him that he had used the Windex to wipe down every place he touched to try to destroy fingerprint evidence. Saunders told Sgt. Fuqua that he did not intend to kill or to rape Mrs. Clemons and that he took Mrs. Clemons to a back bedroom so that he could shut the door and escape. Saunders said that after he ran out the back door of the house, he heard a gunshot and he went to his mother's mobile home.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Saunders v.

Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceeding's two-phase structure vitally affect counsel's strategic calculus. Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendant's guilt is often clear. Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.

P., Saunders failed to meet his burden of pleading the full facts in support of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Moreover, the trial record clearly shows that Saunders made a detailed confession to police in which he gave a minute-by-minute account of the murder, that his confession was admitted into evidence over counsel's vigorous objections, and that the direct evidence connecting Saunders to the murder was overwhelming.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although it is true that counsel did concede that Saunders committed the act that resulted in Clemons's death, counsel did not concede that Saunders had any intent to kill.

In fact, enough evidence was presented on this defense to warrant a jury instruction on voluntary intoxication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   More importantly, this Court on direct appeal found that trial counsel was not ineffective for conceding Saunders's guilt and for questioning Saunders in the manner that he did.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \"Based on our thorough review of the record in light of the legal principles set out above, we conclude that Saunders has not established that defense counsel was ineffective. Based on the trial record alone, with no testimony from defense counsel about the reasons he took the actions to which Saunders now objects, we find that defense counsel made a reasonable, tactical decision to admit to the underlying facts of the crimes, and then to argue that Saunders did not commit capital murder because he was under the influence of crack cocaine and, therefore, unable to form a specific intent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"Immediately after he was arrested, Saunders confessed to killing Mr. Clemons by hitting him on the head with the crowbar he had borrowed earlier from Mr. Clemons, and he admitted that he had feigned an asthma attack to gain\n   entry into the Clemonses' residence, where he attacked Mrs. Clemons and took money from Mr. Clemons's wallet and from Mrs. Clemons's purse. Faced with Saunders's confession, with Mrs. Clemons's identification of Saunders at trial and her testimony at trial, and with the other testimony and evidence establishing Saunders's participation in the crimes, defense counsel reasonably attempted to urge the jury to find Saunders guilty of lesser-included charges based on Saunders's inability to form the specific intent to commit capital murder. In his opening argument to the jury, defense counsel argued that Saunders 'snapped' while smoking crack cocaine, that he struck Mr. Clemons on the head (R. 376), and that 'everything that happened afterwards would have been an afterthought' (R. 378). Defense counsel also argued in his opening statement that Saunders did not have the intent to murder or to rape Mrs. Clemons, although he admitted the State would present evidence of an assault. (R. 378.) Finally, defense counsel argued that, once the police apprehended Saunders, they did not investigate some of the details provided by Saunders and by Mrs. Clemons, and the police did not eliminate the possibility that Saunders did not act alone. In his closing argument, defense counsel argued that, while there was no question about who committed the acts against the Clemonses, the question for the jury was to determine Saunders's intent. According to counsel, Saunders did not have the specific intent to commit capital murder because he did not plan to commit the series of crimes and the robbery and burglary were afterthoughts that arose after Saunders 'snapped' and killed Mr. Clemons. Counsel also argued that the jury could conclude that Saunders's intoxication on crack cocaine negated his specific intent to commit murder and that the jury could find Saunders guilty of manslaughter.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Saunders v.

Agnes Clemons testified that Saunders smoked crack cocaine twice while he was in her house terrorizing her. (Trial R. 408.)

Lt. David White of the Foley Police Department testified that at the edge of the woods near the Clemons's house police discovered \"an ashtray that had a smoking pipe in it\" and a \"little baggy, sandwich baggy that contained a small amount of crack cocaine in it.\" (Trial R. 862.) Saunders also testified in his own defense. He said that he purchased crack cocaine twice on the day of the murder, that he went to the Clemons's property to smoke cocaine, that he did not recall choking or strangling Clemons because, he said, he was high on crack cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The record clearly shows that Saunders's trial counsel did present a great deal of evidence of Saunders's drug use.

Saunders failed to plead how this evidence should have been presented or what expert should have presented this evidence. As the State correctly argues in brief, Saunders failed to identify any expert who would have testified to the effects of drug abuse at Saunders's trial.

Marie Saunders Young, Saunders's older sister, testified about the members of the Saunders family and about their chaotic upbringing. Young testified that when she and her five brothers were growing up, the family moved frequently and lived in several small houses, a hotel, small mobile homes, and an abandoned building. They were often evicted for failing to pay the rent, and they often did not have electricity or running water in the places they lived. Young stated that their parents were violent toward each other and that they drank alcohol to excess. Young said that it was she, not her parents, who took care of the house and her brothers, and who made sure the boys went to school, had clean clothes, did their homework, and completed the chores she had assigned to them. According to Young, their mother hit all the children with mop and broom handles and other objects as corporal punishment. Young said that, although she graduated from high school, Saunders quit school in the middle of the sixth grade, when he was 13 or 14 years old. Young testified that she and her husband had let Saunders live with them for a while at one point, that her husband taught Saunders carpentry, and that Saunders worked with her husband. However, Young testified that Saunders 'was doing a long list of drugs' and drank alcohol. (R. 1151.) She also testified that Saunders had attempted suicide, according to Young. Saunders once attempted to shoot himself in the head with a nail gun, but failed because someone had unplugged the gun.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   \"Joanne Terrell, a certified clinical social worker, completed a psychosocial assessment of Saunders. Terrell testified that the focus of a psychosocial assessment is on a variety of environmental factors, including the person's childhood, adolescence, family history, school and work history, drug and alcohol problems, family relationships, and psychiatric problems. Terrell testified about the details she learned about Saunders's upbringing, which she described as 'disastrous' (R. 1258), and concluded, among other things, that Saunders grew up in a neglectful, abusive, and dangerous environment; that he witnessed domestic violence and was a victim of violence in his home; that Saunders lived in an impoverished and 'gypsy-type environment' (R. 1261); that he became anxious and depressed and had learned to deal\n   with his feelings by ingesting drugs and alcohol and that he developed a significant dependency on drugs and alcohol; and that on the night of the crimes for which Saunders was convicted in this case, his acute drug and alcohol intoxication, combined with what Terrell believed to be Saunders's psychological disorder, had resulted in Saunders's having a diminished capacity to appreciate his actions. On cross-examination, however, Terrell acknowledged that Saunders had told her associate who interviewed him that he had had a good childhood,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   that he had all the food and clothing he needed, and that he had received gifts for birthdays and Christmases. Terrell also acknowledged that her report inaccurately stated that Saunders's parents had divorced when he was 10 or 11 years old, when, in fact, they had divorced when Saunders was approximately 6 years old. Therefore, Terrell admitted, Saunders did not observe physical violence between his parents after he was 6 years old.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   \"Stanley Brodsky, a clinical psychologist, evaluated Saunders before trial. Dr. Brodsky conducted a forensic clinical interview, reviewed available psychiatric records, and administered three psychological tests to Saunders. Dr. Brodsky found no information suggesting that when Saunders committed the crimes for which he was convicted he was unable to differentiate between right and wrong; Dr. Brodsky also found no evidence that Saunders was unaware of his actions or that he was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions. Dr. Brodsky concluded that Saunders suffered from a major depressive disorder 'with mood congruent psychotic features' (R. 1196), and explained that Saunders had reportedly experienced auditory hallucinations, a voice telling him to 'just go ahead and do it,' which was related to his past suicide attempts. (R. 1197.) Dr. Brodsky determined that Saunders had a history beginning in early adolescence 'of a huge intensity and volume of alcohol and drug abuse, almost every imaginable, available illegal drugs and lots and lots of legal drugs that he used as well as large amounts of alcohol,' which led Dr. Brodsky to diagnose Saunders as suffering from polysubstance dependency. Dr. Brodsky also concluded that Saunders could control himself, but that he had a diminished capacity to control himself when he committed the crimes, and that the diminished capacity was the result of his psychological disorder and the drugs he had ingested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   \"Calvin Means, Jr., classification officer at Baldwin County Correctional Facility, testified that Saunders was in the 'high max' classification at the facility (R. 1176), but that, during the 13 or 14 months that Saunders had been at the facility, he had received no disciplinary citations.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <em>\n    Saunders v.

As to Part I of this Court's opinion, however, I concur in the result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   In Part I of this Court's opinion, this Court correctly explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   \"Saunders argues that the circuit court's order of summary dismissal is legally defective because, he says, 'it is impossible without evidentiary development to render merits determinations of ineffective assistance of counsel claims that are predicated upon unpresented (sic) evidence.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   249 So. 3d at 1159 (quoting Saunders's brief, p. 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In rejecting this argument, this Court quotes the following portion of the circuit court's order summarily dismissing Saunders's Rule 32 petition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   \" 'This Court\n   <em>\n    was able to observe\n   </em>\n   Saunders's counsel at all phases of this case and counsels's performance did not fall below the objective standard of reasonableness gauged by prevailing professional standards. Petitioner's complaint of failure on the part of his counsel to present testimony or evidence is without merit, as it would have merely been repetitive. Everything complained of was presented to the jury in the guilt phase and penalty phase of the trial.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   249 So. 3d at 1159 (emphasis added). This Court then holds that \"a postconviction petition may be summarily dismissed on its merits.\" 249 So. 3d at 1159. Furthermore, this Court explains that, \"because no evidentiary hearing was held, the circuit court was not required to make specific findings of fact on each claim raised in Saunders's petition.\" 249 So. 3d at 1161.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Although these holdings are generally correct,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daniel v.

App. 2011), when a circuit court summarily dismisses a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the merits based on that court's personal observations of counsel's conduct, we apply a different rule. Indeed, we have explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   \" ' \"[I]f the circuit judge has personal knowledge of the actual facts underlying the allegations in the petition,\" '\n   <em>\n    he may summarily deny the petition, but he nonetheless must state his reasons for the denial in a written order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Monroe v.

To the extent that this Court's opinion implies a\n   holding to the contrary, that holding is in conflict with caselaw from this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Regardless, in my opinion, the circuit court's order provides a reason for summarily dismissing Saunders's claim based on the circuit court's personal observations; thus, I concur in the result as to Part I of this Court's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    Rule 32.1, Ala.
