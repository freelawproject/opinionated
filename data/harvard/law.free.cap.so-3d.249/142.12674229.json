With respect to the convictions, we affirm; with respect to the sentences, we affirm in part, correct in part, vacate in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Around 2008, a criminal street gang called the \"110'ers\" formed in the New Orleans Lower Garden District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 110'ers consisted mostly of males in their late teens and early twenties, and its territory centered around the River Garden Apartments. The 110'ers was comprised of three sub-gangs: the St. Thomas Youngins (\"STY\"), the St. Mary Mafia (\"SMM\"), and the Skull Squad Mafia (\"SSM\"). In 2011, SSM began associating with another gang,\n   the Young Mafia Fellaz (\"YMF\") to murder rival gang members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 8, 2013, fifteen individuals were indicted in connection with the activities of the 110'ers. Among those indicted were the Defendants,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   who were jointly charged with conspiracy to commit racketeering (Count 1); conspiracy to commit illegal use of weapons (Count 2); and the second degree murders of Shawanna Pierce and Brianna Allen (Counts 27 and 28).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   With the exception of Count 1, all charges in the indictment were alleged, under La. R.S. 15:1403(B), to have been committed with the intent to promote, further, or assist in the affairs of a criminal gang.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 15:1403(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before trial, Harden moved to sever the charges related to the murders of Ms. Pierce and Brianna (Counts 27 and 28) from all other charges and to exclude the hearsay statements of Sandifer and Newman. Each of the motions was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 14, 2015, the State proceeded to trial against the Defendants on Counts 1, 2, 19, 21, 27, 28, 37, and 38. During the 11-day trial, the State presented the testimony of 49 witnesses and introduced 192 exhibits. At the conclusion of trial, the jury rendered the following verdicts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Count 1 (conspiracy to commit racketeering): as to Sandifer and Newman, guilty as charged; as to Harden, not guilty;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Count 2 (conspiracy to commit illegal use of weapons): as to each of the Defendants, guilty as charged;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Counts 27 and 28 (second degree murder): as to each of the Defendants, guilty as charged;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   as to Sandifer\n   and Newman only the jury further found that these murders were committed \"in furtherance of criminal gang activities.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 17, 2015, the Defendants were sentenced as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Count 1 (conspiracy to commit racketeering): Sandifer and Newman were each sentenced to 50 years imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Count 2 (conspiracy to commit illegal use of weapons): Sandifer, Newman, and Harden were each sentenced to 10 years imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Counts 27 and 28 (the second degree murders of Ms. Pierce and Brianna): Sandifer, Newman, Harden were each sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence; and, as to Sandifer and Newman, an additional 25 years imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence in light of the jury's finding that the murders had been committed in furtherance of gang activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Together, the Defendants assign 17 errors. The assignments overlap considerably, and each of the Defendants has adopted the assignments of the others. For ease of discussion, we organize the assignments into the five issues-(1) cognizability; (2) sufficiency; (3) severance; (4) admissibility; and (5) sentencing-and address the assignment by issue rather than number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Cognizability\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Defendants contend that conspiracy to commit racketeering and illegal use of\n   weapons during a crime of violence are non-cognizable double inchoate crimes. The Defendants also contend that, because those crimes are non-cognizable, the jury instructions were erroneous, confusing, and resulted in a \"vague verdict.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State contends that neither issue has been preserved for appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As to the jury instructions, the State's argument has merit. The Defendants failed to object to the jury instructions on any basis; thus, they failed to preserve for appellate review any issue relating to the jury instructions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.

Marsh\n   </em>\n   , 17-0584, p. 4, n. 5 (La.

Accordingly, we will address the Defendants' argument as to the cognizability of conspiracy to commit racketeering.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Louisiana Racketeering Act, La. R.S. 15:1351,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (the \"LRA\"), provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A. It is unlawful for any person who has knowingly received any proceeds derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity to use or invest, whether directly or indirectly, any part of such proceeds, or the proceeds derived from the investment or use thereof, in the acquisition of any title to, or any right, interest, or equity in immovable property or in the establishment or operation of any enterprise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   B. It is unlawful for any person, through a pattern of racketeering activity, knowingly to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise or immovable property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   C.

R.S. 15:1352(A) includes inchoate crimes, conspiracy to violate La. R.S. 15:1353(C) is a double-inchoate crime and is, thus, non-cognizable. This court recently rejected that argument in\n   <em>\n    State v. Davenport\n   </em>\n   , 16-0223, p. 30 (La. App. 4 Cir. 10/18/17), --- So.3d ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204700652\">\n    2017 WL 4700652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *16 noting that \"conspiracy to commit racketeering under La.

The reviewing court must consider the record as a whole. If rational triers of fact could disagree as to the interpretation of the evidence, the rational trier's view of all the evidence most favorable to the prosecution must be adopted.

Guillory was armed with a two-tone, silver and black Smith &amp; Wesson semi-automatic handgun that he had borrowed from Charles \"Buddy\" Lewis (a 110'er); Harden was armed with a Ruger handgun. While they were riding around the city, Guillory and Harden agreed on a plan to shoot at rival gang members. They called Sandifer and Newman, who agreed to join them. Jackson and Marigny were dropped off because they were unarmed. Sandifer and Newman were included because both were known to be armed; in particular, Newman was known to have access to an assault rifle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The four-Guillory, Harden, Sandifer, and Newman-then drove to the intersection of Simon Bolivar Avenue and Martin\n   Luther King Boulevard, where they spotted a crowd, including rival gang members Lionel \"Lonnie B\" Allen, Burnell \"Baldy\" Allen, Emanuel \"Duke\" Casame, and Delwin \"Pooh\" McClauren. Guillory, who was driving, circled the block several times before parking the Maxima on a side street. Sandifer, Newman, and Harden exited the Maxima; Guillory remained in the vehicle. Sandifer and Newman were armed with handguns; Harden was armed with an assault rifle. Their exit from the Maxima was captured on surveillance video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The three-Sandifer, Newman, and Harden-approached the crowd and opened fire. Sandifer and Newman focused their gunfire at several men standing on the median, striking two rival gang members; Harden fired over a dozen shots in the direction of a residence where a child's birthday party was being held, striking and killing Brianna, the daughter of Burnell Allen and the five-year-old niece of Lionel Allen. Ms. Pierce, who was driving her car nearby, was also struck in the head and killed by another one of Harden's bullets. When they had finished, the Defendants returned to the Nissan Maxima.

La. R.S. 14:30.1. In support of their contention that the evidence is insufficient to support their convictions for the second degree murders of Ms. Pierce and Brianna, the Defendants advance two arguments. First, they argue that, because the State offered only circumstantial evidence of identification, the State failed to carry its burden of negating any reasonable probability of misidentification. Second, they argue that the State did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they had the specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm.

On arrival, they observed a crowd, some of whom were rival gang members. Each of the Defendants fired at the crowd. This evidence was sufficient to permit a rational juror to infer that each of the Defendants shared the specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm on any and all persons present in the crowd, including Brianna.

The four then drove to another part of town where they expected to find rival gang members. On arrival, while Guillory (the driver) stayed with the vehicle, the Defendants exited the vehicle and opened fired in an attempt to murder as many rival gang members as they could find.

In support of their contention that the State failed to prove the existence of an enterprise, the Defendants advance two arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   They first argue that the State failed to prove that the Enterprise existed separately from the racketeering activities. The record does not support that argument; to the contrary, the record reflects that the State offered considerable evidence, both direct and circumstantial, that the Enterprise had an existence separate from the pattern of racketeering activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Numerous witnesses testified that all members of the Enterprise operated under the common name of the \"110'ers\" and affiliated with one of three sub-gangs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   They had tattoos and flashed hand signs signifying their membership in the gang.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   They frequently congregated in a designated area to discuss the gang's activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   They appeared together in several gang-themed music videos.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   They made\n   social media posts pledging loyalty to the gang.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   They used a shared, coded language when discussing the gang's activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   They pooled and traded weapons and ammunition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   To honor members murdered by rival gangs, they organized events at which customized memorial t-shirts were worn bearing the gang's name.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon committing their first murder, members were elevated to the rank(s)-both a status and a sub-group-of \"Team Murder.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   These facts are direct evidence that the Enterprise was an established and durable association-in-fact with an existence separate from the crimes committed by its members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, it is now well settled that the existence of an association-in-fact may be \"inferred from the evidence showing that persons associated with the enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity\" because \"the evidence used to prove the pattern of racketeering activity and the evidence establishing an enterprise may in particular cases coalesce.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyle v.

Given the breadth and duration of the racketeering activities in this case, that inference was not unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Nonetheless, the Defendants argue that the State failed to prove that the Enterprise had sufficient structure to be an association-in-fact because no evidence was presented that the Enterprise had \"leadership or management.\" An identical argument was considered and rejected in\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The crux of petitioner's argument is that a RICO enterprise must have structural features in addition to those that we think can be fairly inferred from the language of the statute. Although petitioner concedes that an association-in-fact enterprise may be an \"informal\" group and that \"not much\" structure is needed, he contends that such an enterprise must have at least some additional structural attributes, such as a structural \"hierarchy,\" \"role differentiation,\" a \"unique\n   <em>\n    modus operandi\n   </em>\n   ,\" a \"chain of command,\" \"professionalism and sophistication of organization,\" \"diversity and complexity of crimes,\" \"membership dues, rules and regulations,\" \"uncharged or additional crimes aside from predicate acts,\" an \"internal discipline mechanism,\" \"regular meetings regarding enterprise affairs,\" an \"enterprise 'name,' \" and \"induction or initiation ceremonies and rituals.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   We see no basis in the language of RICO for the structural requirements that petitioner asks us to recognize.

Such a group need not have a hierarchical structure or a \"chain of command\"; decisions may be made on an ad hoc basis and by any number of methods-by majority vote, consensus, a show of strength, etc. Members of the group need not have fixed roles; different members may perform different roles at different times. The group need not have a name, regular meetings, dues, established rules and regulations, disciplinary procedures, or induction or initiation ceremonies.

The State began its case by presenting, through the testimony of numerous former 110'ers, extensive background information on the gang, its members, and its activities. The State then offered evidence, in essentially chronological order, of the numerous discrete acts of racketeering activity committed by the Defendants and other 110'ers, as well as the investigation of those crimes by the police.

Significantly, in addition to the verdicts of guilty of as charged, the jury acquitted Harden as to the conspiracy to commit racketeering (Count 1); the jury returned a lesser responsive verdict of first degree robbery as to Sandifer's charge of armed robbery with a firearm (Count 21) and additionally found that Sandifer had not committed that crime in furtherance of gang activity; the jury found that Harden had not committed the murders of Ms. Pierce and Brianna (Counts 27 and 28) in furtherance of gang activity; and the jury found that Newman had not committed the second degree murder of Marlon Smith (Count 37) or the attempted second degree murder of Kevon Robinson (Count 38) in furtherance of gang activity. These verdicts demonstrate that the jury was not confused, hostile, or wiling to infer a criminal disposition and that the jury was able to distinguish between the Defendants, the charges, and the evidence; the verdicts thus belie any argument that the Defendants were prejudiced by joinder of the charges in this case. Thus, the Defendants have not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion to sever.
