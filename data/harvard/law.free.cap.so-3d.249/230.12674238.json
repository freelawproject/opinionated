(\"Ohio Management\"), and Allied World Assurance Company (US), Inc. (\"AWAC\"), and dismissing Ms. Faciane's case with prejudice. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court's September 25, 2017 summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ms. Faciane resided at the Golden Key Apartments, apartment number 327, located at 4209 Division Street from November 9, 2013 until she moved out in May 2014. On March 16, 2016, Ms. Faciane filed suit against defendants/lessors, Golden Key (owner of the apartment complex) and Ohio Management (manager of the apartment complex) and Ohio Management's insurer, AWAC. Ms. Faciane argued that on April 14, 2015, while she was sleeping in her apartment, sheetrock fell from the apartment's ceiling due to a leak in the ceiling. In her petition, she claimed that \"sheet rock fell from the apartment's ceiling, striking [her] on her left leg and body and causing her to slip down on floor thereby wetted by rain water [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] injuring her neck and back.\" Ms. Faciane contended that defendants were liable for allowing their apartments to remain in disrepair, failing to properly repair the ceiling after being informed that it was leaking, failing to properly maintain the\n   apartments and failing to institute proper inspection procedures to ensure repairs in her apartment were properly made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 18, 2017, defendants, Golden Key and Ohio Management, filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that the lease agreement between defendants and Ms. Faciane contained a provision requiring Ms. Faciane to hold defendants harmless for any personal injury or property claims. Defendants claimed that pursuant to La. R.S. 9:3221, Ms. Faciane assumed responsibility for the condition of the premises, including the roof of the apartment, except in case of defendants' neglect or failure to take action to remedy such defect after lessee's written notification of the defect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants further argued that they were not informed of any defect with Ms. Faciane's ceiling/roof until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the alleged accident occurred. Defendants contended that because they did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the defect in the roof, as required under the terms of the lease, they were entitled to summary judgment because they could not be held liable for Ms. Faciane's damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 24, 2017, AWAC, as the insurer of Ohio Management, filed a motion to adopt the motion for summary judgment filed by Golden Key and Ohio Management.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Faciane filed an opposition arguing that several genuine issues of material fact existed precluding summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   She argued that defendants admitted that there were at least two instances of prior notice of a hole in her apartment ceiling. Ms. Faciane contended that the only evidence of an alleged repair was her testimony that defendants only sprayed paint over the hole, not that defendants repaired the hole. She stated that after the initial attempted repair, she called the manager and told her that the ceiling had not been adequately fixed. Ms. Faciane further told the manager that the\n   technician sprayed the \"popcorn substance on her furniture.\" Ms. Faciane claimed that there was no proof that defendants performed inspections and/or adequately inspected their premises. Moreover, she argued that there was evidence of prior notice of the defective condition. Ms. Faciane stated that defendants were liable for her damages under both negligence and strict liability theories. Therefore, she contended that defendants were not entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 25, 2017, the trial court granted the motions for summary judgment in favor of defendants and against Ms. Faciane, dismissing her case with prejudice.

App. 2 Cir. 1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, Ms. Faciane contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants and dismissing her case with prejudice. She argues that 1) defendants had actual and constructive notice of the defect in their premises; 2) defendants are strictly liable to her for the defect to their building pursuant to La. C.C. art. 2322 ; and 3) her own affidavit is not contrary to her deposition. Ms. Faciane contends that genuine issues of material fact exist to preclude summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this case, Ms. Faciane allegedly suffered injuries caused by a leak in the ceiling of her apartment. Although a tenant\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   notice a leak on the\n   <em>\n    interior\n   </em>\n   of his or her apartment's ceiling, a tenant is not likely, nor reasonably expected, to inspect or have knowledge of leaks or holes on the\n   <em>\n    exterior\n   </em>\n   roof of the apartment complex. Nor do we find that a tenant would have sufficient expertise or knowledge of the history of the roof,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , prior damage or repairs, to assume responsibility for the roof of the apartment complex. There is no doubt that Ms. Faciane's ceiling is part of\n   a solid, shared roof covering the entire apartment complex, shared by multiple tenants, and is a common accessory not subject to waiver under La. R.S. 9:3221.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Therefore, the law controlling the lessor-lessee relationship applies in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under La. C.C. art. 2696, a lessor warrants the thing suitable for use for its intended purpose. In a residential lease, a lessee cannot waive the warranty for vices or defects that seriously affect health or safety. La. C.C. art. 2699. We find that a waiver of a defect in a solid, shared roof covering an entire apartment complex that results in damages to a tenant/lessee clearly affects health and safety, and is therefore not enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Upon our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record, we find that the trial court erred in granting defendants' motions for summary judgment and dismissing Ms. Faciane's claims. Under the general code articles controlling the lessor-lessee relationship, Ms. Faciane has a viable claim of strict liability under La. C.C. arts. 2696 and/or 2697, since her injuries resulted from an alleged defect in a common accessory of the apartment complex,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the solid, shared roof, and her claim is not affected by the contractual waiver signed pursuant to La. R.S. 9:3221. Ms. Faciane does not need to prove notice and therefore, summary judgment is not appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Barnes v.
