(MCC) and dismissing Nu-Lite's claims against them under the Louisiana Public Works Act (LPWA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 21, 2009, the St. Tammany School Board (STPSB) entered into a contract for additions and renovations to Abita Springs Elementary School, a public work located in St. Tammany Parish, for which Brunt served as the general contractor. MCC wrote Brunt's mandatory bond for the project. Brunt subsequently subcontracted electrical work with Axis Construction Group, L.L.P. (Axis). Nu-Lite furnished electrical supplies to Axis and, when Axis failed to pay for those electrical supplies, on September 30, 2010, Nu-Lite sent notice to STPSB, Brunt, and MCC, by certified mail, advising of its intent to file a sworn statement of claim or privilege. The letter included a copy of the statement, which stated that a balance of $144,603.05 was outstanding from Axis and that the affidavit was made to secure Nu-Lite's privilege under the LPWA. On October 1, 2010, Nu-Lite had its statement of claim or privilege recorded in the mortgage records of St. Tammany Parish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nu-Lite filed this lawsuit on May 11, 2011, averring entitlement to relief under the LPWA. Nu-Lite named Brunt, the general contractor, MCC, the surety, and Axis, the subcontractor with whom it had contracted, as defendants. On June 24, 2011, Brunt and MCC filed an answer, generally denying Nu-Lite's claims and asserting various defenses. They also asserted a claim against Axis and a reconventional demand against Nu-Lite.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 22, 2012, MCC issued a bond to cover Nu-Lite's privilege claim, which was marked \"CANCELED BY BOND\" two days later, on May 24, by the St. Tammany Parish Clerk of Court's office. It is undisputed that on December 12, 2011, STPSB recorded a certificate of substantial completion, which constituted a notice of acceptance of work by the governing authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 13, 2016, Brunt and MCC filed a peremptory exception of no right of action, averring that because Nu-Lite had failed to comply with notice provisions under the LPWA, it had no right of action. Brunt and MCC contended they were entitled to have Nu-Lite's claims dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A hearing was held on January 12, 2017, and on January 23, 2017, the trial court issued written reasons for judgment, finding\n   that Nu-Lite had failed to comply with the LPWA and, therefore, had no right of action to enforce its claim against Brunt and MCC. Thus, on February 15, 2017, the trial court signed a judgment in conformity with its ruling, sustaining the exception of no right of action, dismissing Nu-Lite's claims against Brunt and MCC with prejudice, and ordering the release of the MCC bond posted by Brunt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 15, 2017, the trial court signed a judgment in conformity with its written ruling. Nu-Lite suspensively appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   An action can only be brought by a person having a real and actual interest which he asserts. La. C.C.P. art. 681. The function of the exception urging no right of action is to determine whether the plaintiff belongs to the class of persons to whom the law grants the cause of action asserted in the suit. La. C.C.P. art. 927A(6). The focus in an exception of no right of action is on whether the particular plaintiff has a right to bring the suit; it assumes that the petition states a valid cause of action for some person and questions whether the plaintiff in the particular case is a member of the class that has a legal interest in the subject matter of the litigation.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jones v. Americas Ins. Co.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , 2016-0904 (La. App. 1st Cir. 8/16/17),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12367612\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/537/#p540\">\n    226 So.3d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The exception does not raise the question of the plaintiff's ability to prevail on the merits or the question of whether the defendant may have a valid defense. Unlike the objection of no cause of action, evidence supporting or controverting an objection of no right of action is admissible on the trial of the exception for the purpose of showing that the plaintiff does not possess the right he claims or that the right does not exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. C.C.P. art 931.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The party raising a peremptory exception bears the burden of proof. To prevail on a peremptory exception pleading the objection of no right of action, the defendant must show that the plaintiff does not have an interest in the subject matter of the suit or legal capacity to proceed with the suit.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12367612\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/537/#p540\">\n    226 So.3d at 540-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Whether a plaintiff has a right of action is a question of law and is therefore reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   on appeal. Appellate review of questions of law is simply to determine whether the trial court was legally correct. On legal issues, an appellate court gives no special weight to the findings of the trial court but, instead, exercises its constitutional duty to review questions of law and render a judgment on the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12367612\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/537/#p540\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Discussing the LPWA, in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pierce Foundations, Inc. v.

La. R.S. 38:2242A. As the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pierce\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   court pointed out,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804273\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/190/298/#p301\">\n    190 So.3d at 301-302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , one means for asserting a claim under the LPWA is set forth in La. R.S. 38:2242B, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Any claimant may after the maturity of his claim and within forty-five days after the recordation of acceptance of the work by the governing authority or of notice of default of the contractor or subcontractor, file a sworn statement of the amount due him with the governing authority having the work done and record it in the office of the recorder of mortgages for the parish in which the work is done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   La. R.S. 38:2247, also addresses notice, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Nothing in this Part shall be construed to deprive any claimant, as defined in this Part and who has complied with the notice and recordation requirements of R.S. 38:2242(B), of his right of action on the bond furnished pursuant to this Part, provided that said action must be brought against the surety or the contractor or both within one year from the registry of acceptance of the work or of notice of default of the contractor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   except that before any claimant having a direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor but no contractual relationship with the contractor shall have a right of action against the contractor or the surety on the bond furnished by the contractor, he shall in addition to the notice and recordation required in R.S. 38:2242(B) give written notice to said contractor within forty-five days from the recordation of the notice of acceptance by the owner of the work or notice by the owner of default, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed and the name of the party to whom the material was furnished or supplied or for whom the labor or service was done or performed. Such notice shall be served by mailing the same by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, in an envelope addressed to the contractor at any place he maintains an office in the state of Louisiana.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pierce\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   court explained that the plain language of La. R.S. 38:2242B and La. R.S. 38:2247 conflict, because La. R.S. 38:2242B provides that a claimant \"may\" file a sworn statement, but La. R.S. 38:2247 refers to the recordation \"requirements\" of La. R.S. 38:2242B. Because of this ambiguity, the Court pursued statutory meaning in the context of the statute as a whole, with particular focus on the statute's purpose, and concluded that it was a fundamental error to render the permissive \"may\" in La. R.S. 38:2242(B) -\"[a]ny claimant may ... file a sworn statement\"-mandatory in La. R.S. 38:2247.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pierce\n    </em>\n    ,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804273\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/190/298/#p301\">\n    190 So.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Court determined that an interpretation of La. R.S. 38:2247 that essentially trumps the permissive language in La. R.S. 38:2242B overlooks that La. R.S. 38:2247 is first and foremost a prescription provision, providing an additional year to parties filing suit after the acceptance of work or default notice is filed.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804273\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/190/298/#p301\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804273\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/190/298/#p301\">\n    190 So.3d at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In this case, the trial court concluded that because Nu-Lite, who it is undisputed was a claimant under La. R.S. 38:2242A, recorded its claim on October 1, 2010, well before the December 12, 2011 date of STPSB's notice of acceptance of the work, Nu-Lite's claim was not filed within forty-five days of that notice of acceptance and, thus, was untimely filed and recorded under La. R.S. 38:2242B. Citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gootee Constr., Inc. v. Atkins,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   2015-0376 (La.

A sub-subcontractor claimant had filed and recorded its statement of claim, and the subcontractor contended that the sub-subcontractor was not entitled to payment until the subcontractor had been paid by the general contractor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gootee Constr., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6844730\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/178/629/\">\n    178 So.3d at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gootee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   court concluded that because the governing authority had not yet recorded its notice of acceptance, the sub-subcontractor's statement of claim was premature. In so determining, however, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gootee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   court held that the ruling in no way affected the sub-subcontractor's future ability to perfect a claim under the LPWA.

In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gootee,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the subcontractor instituted its suit prior to the governing authority's acceptance of work, and the cancellation of the sub-contractor's claim in the public records was expressly recognized to have been without prejudice since the \"ruling in no way affect[ed] [the sub-subcontractor's] future ability to perfect a claim under the [LPWA].\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gootee,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6844730\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/178/629/\">\n    178 So.3d at 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by the time that Brunt and MCC asserted the exception of no right of action, STPSB had already filed its acceptance of work. Importantly, unlike the subcontractor in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gootee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   seeking to have a sub-subcontractor's prematurely filed and recorded claim cancelled, in this lawsuit, which was instituted by Nu-Lite to enforce its claim, Brunt and MCC answered the petition without raising the issue of prematurity. Instead, six years after having first been apprised of the claim, over five years after the commencement of litigation, and nearly five years after the acceptance of work by the governing authority, Brunt and MCC urged for the first time that Nu-Lite's premature filing and recording of the statement of claim was deficient as a matter of law, thereby failing to set forth a right of action and warranting the dismissal of Nu-Lite's claims against them with prejudice. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nu-Lite complied with La. R.S. 38:2242B by filing and recording its statement of claim or privilege in the St. Tammany mortgage records on October 1, 2010, after it sent notice of Axis' nonpayment to STPSB, Brunt, and MCC on September 30, 2010, which included a copy of the statement of claim or privilege. Although the statement was filed and notice was sent prior to STPSB's notice of acceptance, we do not find this detrimental to Nu-Lite's claim. La.

Nu-Lite then recorded the statement in the mortgage records, and the claim was subsequently canceled by MCC's bond. Additionally, Nu-Lite instituted this lawsuit to enforce its\n   claim, and Brunt and MCC filed an answer and an amended answer before STPSB's acceptance of work without having raised the issue of the timing of Nu-Lite's filing and recordation of the statement of claim or privilege. Therefore, we conclude that because Brunt and MCC were sufficiently notified of the claim, the requirements of La.

Hunt Ragusa, acknowledged in his September 30, 2016 affidavit that Nu-Lite notified both STPSB and Brunt of Axis' nonpayment in the September 30, 2010 correspondence, and that Nu-Lite recorded its statement of claim or privilege on October 1, 2010. Moreover, on June 24, 2011, well before STPSB's December 12, 2012 acceptance of work, Brunt and MCC answered Nu-Lite's May 11, 2011 petition, which set forth the outstanding balance due it from Axis. And Brunt and MCC twice amended their pleadings prior to STPSB's acceptance of work. The record clearly establishes that Brunt and MCC had actual notice of Nu-Lite's claim, the amount claimed, stated with substantial accuracy, and the name of the party to whom the material was furnished. Thus, they had actual notice of the claim within forty-five days of STPSB's notice of acceptance, and Nu-Lite satisfied the requirements of La.

In the November 30, 2012 supplemental and amended pleadings, Brunt and MCC also added additional defenses against Nu-Lite and asserted a reconventional demand against Nu-Lite as well as third-party demands against Axis owner, Charles Bandi, and various Nu-Lite owners, directors, and employees in their individual capacities. According to the allegations by Brunt and MCC, the individual Nu-Lite representatives were liable for fraudulent and/or\n    <em>\n     ultra vires\n    </em>\n    acts because they had \"repeatedly recommended [that] Axis be awarded [the] subcontract\" even though they had actual knowledge of Bandi's pending voluntary petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and a personal business debt of $58,294.45 that Bandi owed to Nu-Lite. On November 17, 2015, the trial court signed an order voluntarily dismissing MCC's claims against the Nu-Lite representatives without prejudice. Additionally, Brunt and MCC filed a third supplemental answer on July 20, 2015, in which they raised seven more defenses against Nu-Lite.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Along with the exception of no right of action Brunt and MCC filed combined motions for partial summary judgment, maintaining that Nu-Lite had failed to preserve its privilege under the LPWA; and for a mandamus, seeking an order directed at the recorder of mortgages to cancel the statement of claim or privilege and to release the MCC bond since Nu-Lite had refused to have the statement of claim or privilege extinguished. Because the trial court had sustained the exception of no right of action, it determined that the motions were moot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    On December 19, 2016, the trial court signed an order allowing Brunt and MCC to substitute their memorandum in support of their combined motions for partial summary judgment and mandamus relief and the exception of no right of action. In the motion to substitute, Brunt and MCC represented that overlooked documents had eliminated one basis for their claims for requested relief. Specifically, they removed their claim that Nu-Lite had failed to afford timely notice to Brunt and STPSB as required by La. R.S. 38:2242F. Despite the removal of these grounds, in its reasons for judgment, the trial court apparently inadvertently referenced Brunt and Nu-Lite's earlier memorandum and concluded that because Nu-Lite had failed to provide the requisite notice under La. R.S. 38:2242F, it failed to preserve its right to file a privilege for any material delivered before July 1, 2010. On appeal, Brunt and MCC agree that this was an incorrect basis to sustain the exception of no right of action and, therefore, the propriety of that ruling is not within the scope of our review.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    La. C.C.P. art. 931 provides in pertinent part, \"On the trial of the peremptory exception pleaded at or prior to the trial of the case, evidence may be introduced to support or controvert any of the objections pleaded, when the grounds thereof do not appear from the petition.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Given our\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    standard of review and mindful that the trial court pretermitted a determination of the motion for partial summary judgment, see La. C.C.P. art. 966F (limiting appellate review to those issues set forth in the motion under consideration by the court at that time), we find no merit in the assertion by Brunt and MCC that Nu-Lite is precluded on appeal from offering an argument it did not raise in its opposition memorandum at the trial court to support its right of action especially where, as here, it is challenging the basis for the trial court's dismissal of its claims. Brunt and MCC's reliance on La. U.R.C.A. Rule 1-3, providing that courts of appeal will review only issues which were submitted to the trial court, is inapposite since the issue of whether Nu-Lite had a right of action was clearly before the trial court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    La.
