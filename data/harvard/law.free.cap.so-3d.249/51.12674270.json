Two young women in their early twenties were killed when their vehicle failed to navigate a curve in the road, traveled across the opposing lane and its shoulder, and hit a tree stump in the ditch opposite their lane of travel. The driver of the vehicle was Lacy Johnson. Her passenger was Breann Sonnier. Breann Sonnier's mother, Gaynelwyn Sonnier, filed suit against the DOTD, alleging faulty construction and maintenance of the roadway and the ditch. Breann Sonnier's father, Elwood Sonnier, and Lacy Johnson's mother, Marilyn Clark, filed similar suits. The three suits were consolidated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to trial, the suits of Marilyn Clark and Elwood Sonnier were settled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Also prior to trial, the trial court made interlocutory rulings on various motions in limine, two of which precluded the plaintiff's traffic experts from giving opinions on whether a DOTD project was a \"major reconstruction\" and on whether the subject roadway created an \"unreasonable risk of harm\" for drivers. The court also ruled that a lab report would be admitted at trial showing that Lacy Johnson had a 0.10% blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following an eight-day jury trial, the jury rendered a verdict finding that the roadway at issue did not contain defects creating an unreasonable risk of harm for drivers. The plaintiff, Gaynelwyn Sonnier, appeals the trial court's interlocutory judgments\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   limiting the testimony of her experts for trial, and she appeals the final judgment dismissing her suit based upon the jury verdict in favor of the DOTD. She asks this court to reverse those rulings, allocate fault between the driver and the DOTD, and award damages to her between $500,000 and $3,000,000 for the loss of her daughter Breann.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A trial court has great discretion in evidentiary matters, and its decisions regarding motions in limine are reviewed using the abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

It should be noted at this point that Mr. Evans and Mr. Robert did provide testimony regarding their opinions that the roadway contained defects. Mr. Evans testified that the ten-foot travel lanes were too narrow; that the two-foot-wide shoulders should have been four feet wide; that the foreslope of the ditch was too steep at 1:1 and should have been 1:3 to allow a vehicle to recover after leaving the pavement; and that the stump \"at the toe of the slope\" was an impermissible obstruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, Mr. Evans, who was testifying as an expert in traffic engineering and accident reconstruction, did not reconstruct the accident; he did not inspect the vehicle or perform a damage and crash analysis of the vehicle; he did not calculate what path the vehicle would have taken if the shoulders had been wider and flatter, or where the vehicle might have gone if it had not hit the stump. He relied heavily on the police report regarding the stump as causing all of the vehicle's damage and regarding where the vehicle left the road. He thought the police report said the driver was traveling almost parallel to the road when the left tires left the pavement causing him to opine that she was \"following the curve\" with no loss of control and still inputting steering, even though she was going eastbound in the westbound lane when she left the road and entered the shoulder. Mr. Evans opined that the opposing shoulders were designed to benefit even drivers who crossed the opposing lane to access the shoulder driving in the wrong direction, and he denied the characterization that the driver actually had twelve feet of width, ten feet of travel lane width and two feet of shoulder width, to correct her path after crossing the center line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The trial court permitted all of Mr. Evans's testimony except for a few pages from his total deposition of over 160 pages. The reasoning of Judge Cole that was adopted by Judge Deshotels was in part to preclude the terminology \"unreasonably\n   dangerous\" or \"unreasonable risk of harm\" because that language constitutes the legal test to be decided by the jury. The plaintiff asserts that this was error, quoting La.Code Evid. art. 704, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not to be excluded solely because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact. However, in a criminal case, an expert witness shall not express an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Here, the trial court had multiple reasons for limiting Mr. Evans's testimony which involved keeping his testimony within the bounds of his expertise.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [T]he Court is accepting Mr. Evans as an expert in the field of traffic engineering. He is not an expert in the fields of highway engineering, construction, or design, or human factors engineering. And he wasn't proffered as that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Whether the State has breached its duty by knowingly [ ] maintaining a defective or unreasonably dangerous roadway, depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. This is a task for the trier of fact. To determine this risk, the trier of fact will consider the broad range of social, economic and moral factors and the social utility of the plaintiff's conduct at the time of the accident. Again he is not being offered as a human factors expert, although that is kind of-it is a field that is not far from it, engineering expert. The cost to the State in avoiding the risk is one of the factors that has to be considered in this utility-risk evaluation. And that is up to the trier of fact. This includes not only the cost to fix the instant deviation but other similar deviations on Highway 10. The Court does not believe that he can give an opinion as to whether the roadway is unreasonably dangerous or not because it falls outside his area of expertise. It is not included in his education, training or methodology. The specialized knowledge of Mr. Evans [is] the field of traffic engineering so it cannot assist the trier of fact in making this utility-risk determination.

There, the plaintiff hydroplaned into a bridge abutment that did not have a guardrail right after a reconstructed portion of the roadway was prematurely opened to traffic and before the 1994 plan was completed; the plan called for a guardrail, which was installed only days after the accident. The trial court allowed one of the plaintiff's experts, Mr. James Clary, to testify that \"an unguarded bridge end on a highway of [that] classification [was] unreasonably dangerous.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 505. Even though he testified that an AASHTO guidelines manual\n   classified the absence of a guardrail as unreasonably dangerous, and then was not able to produce corroborating evidence, the appellate court did not find the trial court in error for allowing him to testify regarding the \"ultimate issue\" under La.Code Evid. art. 704.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 508.

More specifically, Ms. Sonnier argues that the 1946 DOTD guidelines for major reconstruction included four-foot-wide shoulders, a 3:1 side slope, and twenty feet of horizontal clearance beyond the travel lanes, and that these guidelines apply to the roadway which was converted from gravel to asphalt in 1949. Mr. Evans testified that he reviewed the final estimate for the 1949 project and that it constituted a \"major reconstruction\" that required application of the 1946 guidelines. DOTD's representative testified that the conversion to asphalt in 1949 was an overlay project, not a major reconstruction. Judge Cole found that whether or not the project was a major reconstruction could only be determined by design engineers or construction engineers and that Mr. Evans and Mr. Robert were traffic engineers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Mr. Evans's bachelor's degree in the 1950s was in electrical engineering, and he took a post-graduate course in traffic engineering which he said included geometric design of highways. His work has been largely consulting work. Ms. Sonnier argues that Mr. Evans's affidavit shows that he was qualified by fifty years of experience. In his affidavit, however, he admits that he was \"not generally involved in the\n   specific design or even in the maintenance of roads and highways.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The court stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   As I said earlier a traffic engineer, they are not responsible for infrastructure of the highway system. The Court doesn't believe that his education, experience and methodology qualifies him to ... evaluate the project proposed, the cost of same, and make a determination that this is or is not major reconstruction. The Court believes it is beyond his area of expertise and not included in his methodology. Therefore, the Court does not believe he can give an opinion that the 1949 project for Highway 10 was a major reconstruction. He can talk about the AASHTO Standards and, you know, why it is unsafe there. I don't think he can make that one opinion. But he can certainly talk about the roadway and what he believes are a hazard there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's ruling on this issue. In\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8179553\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/5/839/#p858\">\n    5 So.3d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which is virtually on-point with the present case, the Louisiana Supreme Court reversed the first circuit's judgment in favor of the plaintiff, finding that the evidence did not support a reconstruction of the roadway at issue. There, a legally intoxicated driver with a 0.12% BAC was \"straightening out the curves\" in a section of Highway 37 by driving south in the opposing north-bound lane of the two-lane highway as he approached each curve.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8179553\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/5/839/#p858\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8179553\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/5/839/#p858\">\n    at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The driver's car went into a ditch, struck at least one tree, caving in the roof and ejecting both the front-seat passenger and the rear-seat passenger. The front-seat passenger was killed, and the back-seat passenger, who was the driver's nine-year-old nephew, was thrown into the road and hit by another vehicle. He survived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The child's expert in\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   testified that the roadway at the accident site had been reconstructed in 1975 and that DOTD had failed to comply with its own and AASHTO's design standards. He further testified that the substandard lane width, shoulder width, shoulder slope ratio, and right of way with trees was a cause-in-fact and legal cause of the accident. The jury found the driver 60% at fault and DOTD 40% at fault. The trial court granted DOTD's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), and the first circuit reversed on appeal, reinstating the jury's verdict. The Louisiana Supreme Court reversed, finding that the car was already out of control before it left the road, finding the driver to be 100% at fault, and reinstating the trial court's JNOV in favor of DOTD. In addressing the design and maintenance of the roadway, the supreme court found that the 1975 project/plan, which had \"Reconstruct Base and Surfacing\" in its title, was nevertheless\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a \"major reconstruction\" requiring the application of 1975 standards. DOTD experts had testified that the plaintiff's expert was the only person who would characterize the 1975 overlay or preservation project as a major reconstruction. Those witnesses testified that reconstruction projects took four to five years to develop, cost $500,000 to $600,000 per mile in the 1970s, involved federal funds, required a full topographic survey, required upgrades to the vertical and horizontal geometry of the road, and required the purchase of land for additional rights-of-way. Conversely, the project in\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   was done by an independent contractor, to be completed in sixty days at $520,000 for all 4.5 miles, did not require additional rights-of-way, and required no work on the existing shoulders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We note that the plaintiff's expert in\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   was Mr. James Clary, and he was allowed to give his opinion on what constituted a major reconstruction. However, as\n   seen above in\n   <em>\n    Rosen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9514170\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/809/498/\">\n    809 So.2d 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Mr. Clary had qualifications in the fields of highway design, engineering, signage, safety, and maintenance. In the present case, Mr. Evans did not have those qualifications; nor did he support his opinion on major reconstruction with proper evidence, such as the kind of information as that testified to by DOTD's engineers in\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiff's other traffic engineer, Mr. Robert, also testified that Highway 10 had undergone a major reconstruction in 1949, using the same reasoning that the travel surface went from gravel to asphalt. Accordingly, the record supports the trial court's limitation on the testimony of the plaintiff's experts. This is no abuse of discretion in this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jury's Verdict\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Ms. Sonnier contends that the jury manifestly erred in finding that the roadway contained no defect resulting in an unreasonable risk of harm that caused the passenger's injuries. We disagree. Over eight days of trial, the jury heard and saw ample evidence to support its verdict. DOTD's accident reconstructionist, Jeremy Hoffpauir, testified that Lacy Johnson simply drove her vehicle straight off the road. Trooper Anthony Scott Farris, Mr. Hoffpauir, Mr. Evans, and Mr. Robert all testified that there was no physical evidence, such as tire marks, indicating that the driver attempted to apply her brakes or input steering before she left the roadway. Contrary to Mr. Evans's belief expressed in his deposition testimony, Trooper Farris did not believe that the driver was parallel to the road when she entered the shoulder on the other side of the highway. Trooper Farris testified at trial that the driver's car travelled straight from the east-bound lane, crossed the center line, and went off the edge of the road in a straight path with no evidence of steering or breaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Trooper Farris further testified that the warning sign of the curve ahead and the advisory speed was in place. DOTD's traffic engineering expert, Dr. Joseph Blaschke, and the plaintiff's expert, Mr. Robert, testified that the signage met the requirements of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Dr. Blaschke also said there was no defect in the striping, design, or speed limit. Additionally, he said the shoulder width and slope did not violate DOTD policy. Typically, plans and guidelines are adjusted because of the geometry and conditions present. Further, the stump was in a heavily wooded area, and removal of the tree would make no difference because other trees were next to the stump.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Testimony at trial indicated that the driver drove this highway every day and was familiar with the road. Mr. Hoffpauir testified that the driver could see the curve ten seconds in advance of reaching it and had time to react. He said the curve was not severe and required only nine degrees of steering, which most drivers do on a daily basis. Mr. Evans also testified that the curve was not severe and that a driver could safely negotiate the curve. All agreed that the driver had a ten-foot travel lane and a two-foot unimproved shoulder on the other side of the center line within which to correct her path and get back into her own lane. DOTD Maintenance Engineer Damon Cooley said he inspected the area and did not observe a defect in the roadbed or the shoulder that could have caused this accident. Trooper Farris said no defect caused the driver to leave the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As previously discussed, the DOTD owes a duty to a prudent driver who is momentarily distracted, but Dr. Blaschke testified that Lacy Johnson, the driver, was more than momentarily inattentive. The plaintiff's toxicologist, Dr. Ernest Lykessa\n   agreed. DOTD's toxicologist, Dr. Gary Wimbish, and Dr. Lykessa testified that 0.10% BAC results in cognitive impairment, blurred vision, decreased hand-to-foot-to-eye coordination, decreased perception-reaction time, and impaired judgment and reasoning. Dr. Wimbish further stated that the driver's BAC impairment more probably than not included a reduced ability to timely input a steering maneuver before the crash. Dr. Blaschke said that driver perception-reaction time is impaired at 0.08% BAC. The plaintiff's own expert, Mr. Evans, stated in his report that alcohol may have played a part in the driver's having left the roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The purpose of a roadside ditch is to drain the highway. La.R.S. 48:1(17). In cases involving alcohol and/or injuries occurring in ditches, the courts usually do not find a duty of DOTD to protect against such risks. That is because the utility of the ditch is high while the conduct of the driver is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Oster v.
