Saunders, Marc T. Amy. And Candyce G. Perret, Judges.\n  </author>\n<p id=\"p-8\">\n   SAUNDERS, Judge\n   The issues presented in this writ application arise out of a claim for workers' compensation brought by Blann Kyle (\"Kyle\") against his employer, Boise, alleging that his hearing loss was caused by his employment at Boise's Paper Mill in DeRidder, Louisiana. Kyle retired on June 4, 2010, after being employed at the paper mill since 1976. The 1008 was filed on September 19, 2017.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-9\">\n   On January 23, 2018, Kyle filed a motion for expedited hearing pursuant to La.R.S. 23:1121. Kyle alleged that Boise failed to authorize an initial visit with his choice of treating physician, Dr. Brad LeBert, an otolaryngologist. Kyle sought an order from the WCJ directing Boise to authorize the initial visit with Dr. LeBert, to reimburse Kyle for the cost of an audiogram, and to pay two penalties and attorney's fees for Boise's arbitrary and capricious behavior.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-10\">\n   Boise opposed the motion and alleged that Kyle's claims were prescribed. Boise also argued that Kyle's request for penalties and attorney's fees in his motion for expedited hearing was an unauthorized use of summary proceedings.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-11\">\n   Kyle's motion came for hearing on February 20, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The WCJ took the matter under advisement. On March 9, 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the WCJ issued an oral ruling denying Kyle's motion and found that \"there is a tenuous link between the alleged hearing loss\" and Kyle's employment such that Boise had \"good cause for the refusal of the choice of physician.\" A judgment denying Kyle's motion was signed on April 16, 2018.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-12\">\n   Kyle timely filed his notice of intent to seek writs, and the WCJ set a return date of May 16, 2018. This writ application was timely filed.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-13\">\n   No trial date has been set.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-14\">\n<strong>\n<em>\n     SUPERVISORY RELIEF\n    </em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-15\">\n   In our sister case,\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

The exhibits were proffered. They are contained in the writ application at pages 43-48. We find that due to the redactions, no useful information can be gleaned from them. Two pages from Kyle's deposition were received into evidence as D-7 without objection. This exhibit is not contained in the writ application. Reportedly, the deposition testimony establishes that Kyle had a hearing test in 2008 or 2009 that showed some hearing loss. We find that this does not establish good cause because it is not enough \"to reasonably counter the factual and medical information presented by the claimant.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.
