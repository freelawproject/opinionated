Code, \u00a7 187; all subsequent undesignated section references are to the Penal Code). The jury also found that he personally used a shotgun during the murder (\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)). He was acquitted of assaulting Robert McAlvain with a firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Following his sentence of 20 years to life in state prison (15 years to life on the murder conviction plus an upper consecutive term of 5 years for the gun-use enhancement), defendant appeals, contending: (1) he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel\u2019s unawareness of a recent change in a statute led counsel inadvertently to open the door to evidence of defendant\u2019s violent conduct, which undermined his defense; (2) he was improperly impeached with a conviction for felony vandalism; (3) he was convicted on a standard of proof less than required by due process; (4) cumulative error denied him a fair trial; and (5) the trial court improperly aggravated the gun-use enhancement sentence. In an unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude only defendant\u2019s last contention has merit. In this published portion of the opinion, we conclude defendant was properly impeached with a prior conviction for felony vandalism. We shall remand the matter for resentencing on the enhancement and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Factual and Procedural Background*</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Defendant contends he suffered prejudice from the trial court\u2019s ruling that he could be impeached with a 10-year-old prior conviction for felony vandalism. (\u00a7 594.) He asserts first that felony vandalism is not a crime of moral turpitude, and second that even if it is such a crime the trial court should have excluded the evidence of his conviction under Evidence Code section 352 (\u00a7 352). He finally asserts that the error was prejudicial under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>the <em>Watson</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>standard. We conclude the trial court did not err by admitting the prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">A. <em>Moral turpitude.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Under Evidence Code 788, a defendant who testifies may be impeached with a prior conviction of any felony evincing moral turpitude, defined as the \u201cgeneral readiness to do evil.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301, 313-316 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111].) Only if \u201cthe least adjudicated elements of the conviction necessarily involve moral turpitude\u201d is the conviction admissible for impeachment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The \u201cleast adjudicated elements\u201d test means that \u201cfrom the elements of the offense alone\u2014without regard to the facts of the particular <em>violation\u2014one can reasonably infer the presence of moral turpitude.\" (People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 689, 698 [254 Cal.Rptr. 15], italics added; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1299, 1303 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 259]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bautista </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1, 6 [265 Cal.Rptr. 661].) In other words, a court need not determine that a criminal statute could be violated <em>only </em>with evil intent in order to find that a conviction under that statute evinces moral turpitude, because it is possible to imagine a set of circumstances under which almost any statute might be violated without evil intent; only a \u201c <em>\u2018substantial assurance </em>that the credibility of a witness is adversely affected by his having suffered [a] conviction\u2019 \u201d for a given offense is required. <em>(Thomas, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at p. 698, original italics, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Defendant was convicted of felony vandalism in 1983 pursuant to section 594, which provided in relevant part at the time of the offense: \u201c(a) Every person who <em>maliciously </em>(1) defaces with paint or any other liquid, (2) damages or (3) destroys any real or personal property not his own, in cases otherwise than those specified by state law, is guilty of vandalism. [][] (b)(1) If the amount of defacement, damage or destruction is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, vandalism is punishable by imprisonment ... in the county jail, imprisonment in the state prison not to exceed one year and one day, a fine of five thousand dollars ($5,000), or both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Stats. 1982, ch. 1413, \u00a7 3, p. 5402, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">No published case has considered whether a felony conviction under section 594 evinces moral turpitude, as the trial court found. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>trial court\u2019s ruling is supported by the language of the statute and by case law construing analogous statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">As defendant acknowledges, the term \"maliciously,\u201d defining the requisite mens rea of the offense, \u201cimport[s] a wish to vex, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act, established either by proof or presumption of law.\u201d (\u00a7 7.) Moreover, section 594, subdivision (a), which was enacted as section 594 in the original 1872 Criminal Code as a \u201cpreliminary catch-all provision\u201d to what is now title 14 of the Criminal Code, dealing with malicious injury to property (2 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Crimes Against Property, \u00a7 678, pp. 761-762), still follows the language of the original malicious-mischief statutes in specifying \u201cmalice\u201d as the mens rea of the offense.  \u201cIt is generally held that [the term \u2018malice\u2019 in such statutes] calls for more than mere intentional harm without justification or excuse; there must be a wanton and wilful (or \u2018reckless\u2019) disregard of the plain dangers of harm, without justification, excuse or mitigation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 762.) Such a state of mind betokens that \u201cgeneral readiness to do evil\u201d which constitutes moral turpitude. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 314.)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">In arguing to the contrary, defendant first suggests that felony vandalism is not a specific-intent crime. Even assuming that is so, the distinction is irrelevant to the question of moral turpitude.  \u201c. . . [T]he distinction between general[-jintent and specific[-]intent crimes is at bottom founded upon a policy decision regarding the availability of certain defenses.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 1076, 1081 [225 Cal.Rptr. 885]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hood </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 444, 456-457 [82 Cal.Rptr. 618, 462 P.2d 370] [difference between general and specific intent \u201conly a linguistic one\u201d].) It is not based on the premise that specific-intent crimes reveal moral blameworthiness while general-intent crimes do not, since the perpetrator of a general-intent crime may be found morally blameworthy. <em>(Gutierrez, supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d at p. 1084.) Furthermore, numerous general-intent crimes have been held to evince moral turpitude. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>White, supra, </em>4 Cal.App.4th at p. 1301 [\u00a7 246 (shooting at inhabited building)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brooks </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 669, 671 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 570] [\u00a7 273d (corporal punishment of child resulting in trauma)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Zataray </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 390, 400 [219 Cal.Rptr. 33] [\u00a7 207 (simple kidnapping)].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Defendant next asserts that the trial court \u201cset too low a standard to decide whether a crime was one of moral turpitude.\u201d He bases this claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>solely on the trial court\u2019s remark during argument on the issue: \u201cI am going to have a very difficult time defining what crime does not involve moral turpitude, because <em>any crime, anytime somebody even possesses marijuana, that is doing evil. Possessing marijuana is in this Court\u2019s judgment doing evil.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Correctly noting that simple possession of marijuana is not, in fact, a crime of moral turpitude <em>(People </em>v. <em>Valdez </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 680, 697 [223 Cal.Rptr. 149]), defendant apparently construes the trial court\u2019s comment to mean that the court wrongly believed all felonies evince moral turpitude. However, even if the trial court did entertain such a view, it would not compel us to find that the court\u2019s ruling was error: it is axiomatic that we review the trial court\u2019s result, not its rationale. <em>(California Aviation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Leeds </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 724, 730-731 [284 Cal.Rptr. 687].) In any event, the comment quoted out of context by defendant does not support his conclusion. It is clear from the full context of the argument on this issue that the trial court understood the relevant legal standard, but was simply expressing its own feeling that the standard did not give the clearest possible guidance to lower courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Defendant next asserts that one cannot infer moral turpitude from a conviction under section 594 because that statute criminalizes spray-painting graffiti on another person\u2019s property or causing other \u201ctrivial\u201d damage. <em>(In re Trinidad V. </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1077, 1079 [261 Cal.Rptr. 39]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kahanic </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 461, 463, 465 [241 Cal.Rptr. 722].) There are two answers to this contention. First, the desecration of California\u2019s visual landscape by graffiti is not a \u201ctrivial\u201d matter at all. Moreover, the statute under which defendant was convicted required the vandalism to result in at least $1,000 in damage. That amount of damage is not \u201ctrivial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Taking up a suggestion offered in <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra </em>(38 Cal.3d at p. 316, fn. 11), defendant next turns to federal immigration cases which have considered the issue of moral turpitude as to various offenses in the context of deportation proceedings. (See generally, Annot, What Constitutes \u201cCrime Involving Moral Turpitude\u201d Within Meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 212(a)(9) and 241(a)(4) of Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USCS \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(9), 1251(a)(4)), and Similar Predecessor Statutes Providing for Exclusion or Deportation of Aliens Convicted of Such Crime (1975) 23 A.L.R.Fed. 480.) Given that ample California case law considering moral turpitude as to California statutes has arisen since <em>Castro </em>was decided, the usefulness of searching foreign decisions for guidance on this question has diminished.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In any event, defendant cites no immigration cases construing section 594, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>none of the cases he cites which construe foreign statutes apply the standards set forth in <em>Castro </em>and its progeny. Therefore these cases do not assist him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Lastly, defendant cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Mansfield </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 82 [245 Cal.Rptr. 800], which held that felony battery (\u00a7 243, subd. (d)) is not a crime of moral turpitude according to \u201ccommon sense and generally accepted community standards\u201d because \u201c[t]he average person walking down the street would not believe that someone who [merely] pushes another is a culprit guilty of moral laxity or \u2018general readiness to do evil,\u2019 even if the push was willful and results in serious injury.\u201d (200 Cal.App.3d at pp. 88-89.) However, even assuming for the sake of argument the holding of <em>Mansfield </em>is correct, it does not aid defendant because felony battery, unlike felony vandalism, does not require a mens rea of malice. The intent for felony battery is the same as for simple battery\u2014merely to commit an unwanted touching, an intent which need not show readiness to do evil; only the result (serious bodily injury) differs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (200 Cal.App.3d at pp. 87-88.) Since, as we have explained, the mens rea of malice required for any offense under section 594 is sufficient to establish a \u201creadiness to do evil\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 313), felony vandalism is not analogous to felony battery for purposes of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number>For all the above reasons, the trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">B. <em>Evidence Code section 352.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">After ruling that felony vandalism was a crime of moral turpitude, the trial court exercised its discretion under section 352 to allow the prior to be used for impeachment. Citing the four-factor test for the propriety of admitting prior felony convictions for impeachment stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Muldrow </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 636, 644 [248 Cal.Rptr. 891]\u2014\u201c(1) [wjhether the prior conviction reflects adversely on an individual\u2019s honesty or veracity; (2) the nearness or remoteness in time of a prior conviction; (3) whether the prior conviction is for the same or substantially similar conduct to the charged offense; and (4) what the effect will be if the defendant does not testify out of fear of being prejudiced because of impeachment by prior convictions\u201d\u2014defendant asserts that all applicable factors weighed in favor of excluding his prior conviction. He reasons that felony vandalism does not reflect on honesty and \u201conly marginally\u201d reflects on integrity, that the crime occurred 10 years before the trial in this case and defendant had led a \u201clegally blameless life\u201d (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 811, 818-819 [123 Cal.Rptr. 663]) in the interim, and that the conduct in the prior act was similar to that charged herein in that both acts involved \u201cirrationality\u201d or \u201chotheadedness.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Here, none of the three <em>Muldrow </em>factors invoked by defendant works in his favor. First, any felony conviction evincing moral turpitude, as here, \u201chas some \u2018tendency in reason\u2019 (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210) to shake one\u2019s confidence in [a witness\u2019s] honesty.\" <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 315.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Second, although the vandalism conviction was 10 years old, defendant had not led a legally blameless life in the interim: he had been convicted twice for driving under the influence (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)) and once for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1497\">*1497</page-number>driving an unregistered vehicle. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 4000, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Finally, assuming there was any danger that the jury might have perceived a pattern of \u201cirrationality\u201d or \u201chotheadedness\u201d linking the prior conviction and the present charges, this danger was avoided because the jury did not learn the facts underlying defendant\u2019s prior conviction. After the trial court ruled it admissible, defendant\u2019s counsel asked defendant whether he had been convicted of vandalism in 1983; defendant answered \u201cYes\u201d; and the prosecutor asked no questions about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Because defendant has failed to show any grounds on which his prior felony conviction should have been excluded, we need not consider defendant\u2019s claim of prejudice from its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">III-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">The matter is remanded to the trial court for resentencing on the enhancement.

Only two construe statutes which, like section 594, include the term \u201cmalicious\u201d or \u201cmaliciously\u201d in defining the mens rea for the offense. In the earlier case, the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) construed a former Delaware \u201cmalicious mischief\u2019 statute which provided in pertinent part: \u201cWhoever unlawfully, maliciously and mischievously destroys or injures any real or personal property, or any other thing of value.\u201d Relying on its own precedent in the absence of Delaware case law, the Board held that the statute covered both crimes which involved moral turpitude (defined as \u201coffenses . . . which . . . are inherently base and vile\u201d) and those which did not, then applied its own \u201cwell-established rule that we must look to the record of conviction for a determination of whether the crime committed involves moral turpitude.\u201d <em>(Matter of N. </em>(1959) 8 I. &amp; N. Dec. 466, 467-468.) In the later case, the Board followed the same method of analysis in construing a former Florida statute defining \u201cmalicious trespass.\u201d <em>(Matter of E. </em>(1979) 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 659, 661.) Obviously, the approach to moral-turpitude analysis taken in these cases does not involve either the \u201creadiness to do evil\u201d test or the \u201cleast adjudicated elements\u201d test as they have developed in California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">The remaining cases defendant cites are even less to the point, since the statutes construed in those cases defined the target offenses in terms of \u201cunlawful\" or \u201cwillful\u201d conduct, not \u201cmalicious\u201d conduct. <em>(Matter of B. </em>(1947) 2 I. &amp; N.
