The sales tax at issue in this case was imposed by EFA pursuant to an ordinance approved by a majority (but less than two-thirds) of the qualified electors voting on the measure in the City and County of San Francisco, as authorized by Revenue and Taxation Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>section 7286.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court determined the majority vote was insufficient because the tax was subject to the two-thirds voter approval requirements of Proposition 13 (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 4<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) for \u201cspecial taxes\u201d imposed by \u201cspecial districts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">On appeal, SBE contends the trial court erred in failing to require the retailers to join EFA as a defendant and in entering judgment against SBE because SBE did nothing wrong. In an unpublished portion of this opinion, we reject SBE\u2019s contentions. EFA contends summary judgment was improper because the tax was not subject to the supermajority requirements of Proposition 13. In this published portion of the opinion, we reject EFA\u2019s argument. We will therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In September 1991, the Legislature passed the Educational Financing Act (Senate Bill No. 482), codified at section 7286.1 et seq. That act authorizes tiie San Francisco Unified School District and the San Francisco Community College District to create an educational financing authority (EFA) \u201cfor the general purpose of providing financial assistance to each school district within the city and county.\u201d (\u00a7 7286.2, subd. (a).) The act provides that EFA shall be governed by a board of directors which \u201cshall consist of the members of the governing boards of the unified school district and the community college district.\u201d (\u00a7 7286.2, subd. (a).) The act authorizes EFA to impose by ordinance a quarter-cent sales tax in the City and County of San Francisco, subject to voter approval. Section 7286.1 indicates that approval by a mere majority of the electors voting on the measure is sufficient.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">In October 1991, EFA\u2019s board of directors passed an ordinance requesting the City and County of San Francisco to call a special election for the purpose of submitting to the voters a measure for the imposition of a one-quarter of 1 percent transactions and use tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>Pursuant to section 7286.1, an election was held in December 1991, and the ordinance imposing the tax was approved by a majority (but less than two-thirds) of the qualified electors voting on the measure. Shortly thereafter, SBE began collecting the tax and distributing the proceeds to EFA, pursuant to a statutorily mandated contract for SBE to administer the tax (\u00a7\u00a7 7270, 7286.1, subd. (a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The retailers paid the tax and filed claims for refund with SBE on the ground that the tax was unconstitutional under Proposition 13, which requires that special taxes by special districts be approved by two-thirds of the qualified electors voting on the measure. SBE denied the claims on the ground that \u201cArticle III, Section 3.5[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] of the California [] Constitution prohibits [SBE] from declaring a statute unconstitutional, or refusing to enforce a statute, on the grounds that it is unconstitutional unless an appellate court has declared the statute unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">In October 1992, the retailers filed a complaint for refund of the taxes, naming SBE as defendant. (\u00a7 6933.) SBE demurred on the ground that the real party in interest (EFA) was not named as a defendant. The trial court overruled the demurrer. In March 1993, EFA intervened in the action as a defendant, pursuant to stipulation of the parties and approval by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">In April 1993, the retailers moved for summary judgment on the ground the tax was invalid because Proposition 13\u2019s supermajority requirement applies to EFA, which is a \u201cspecial district\u201d within the meaning of California Constitution article XIII A, section 4, because it was created and is controlled by two \u201cspecial districts,\u201d i.e., the San Francisco Unified School District and the San Francisco Community College District. EFA argued inter alia that school districts are not \u201cspecial districts\u201d within the meaning of California Constitution article XIII A, section 4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">The trial court granted the retailers\u2019 motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of the retailers, awarding refunds of $1,126 to Hoogasian Flowers, Inc., $167 to Ace Pharmacy, $186 to Diane O., and $183 to Surf Pharmacy. The trial court also awarded the retailers interest and costs of suit but retained jurisdiction to decide the question of attorney fees until after conclusion of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">I. <em>SBE\u2019s </em>Contentions<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">II. <em>EFA\u2019s Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">\u201cThe power of the Legislature in the area of taxation is paramount . . . any constitutional restriction on that power must be strictly construed against the limitation.\u201d <em>(Franchise Tax Bd. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1343, 1347 [261 Cal.Rptr. 236].) Since statutes are \u201cclothed with a presumption of constitutionality,\u201d the tax \u201cmust be upheld unless it is \u2018clearly, positively and unmistakably\u2019 unconstitutional.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hansel </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1211, 1219 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 888, 824 P.2d 694].) On review of the grant of summary judgment, our review is de novo. <em>(Moerman </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 452, 456 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 329].)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">B. <em>EFA Is a \u201cSpecial District\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">EFA contends it is not a \u201cspecial district\u201d within the meaning of the California Constitution, article XIII A, section 4 (fn. 2, <em>ante) </em>(hereafter, article XIII A, section 4). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">1. <em>The Rider Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">In <em>Rider </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 1 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 490, 820 P.2d 1000], the Supreme Court held the term \u201cspecial districts\u201d in article XIII A, section 4, includes local taxing authorities created and controlled by entities subject to Proposition 13 in order to raise funds to replace revenues lost because of Proposition 13. (1 Cal.4th at p. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">The taxing agency in <em>Rider </em>was the San Diego County Regional Justice Facility Financing Agency, which had been created by the county to circumvent Proposition 13 and raise funds to finance the construction of county justice facilities. (1 Cal.4th at p. 11.) The Supreme Court held the tax invalid for failure to secure the two-thirds voter approval required by article XIII A, section 4. The <em>Rider </em>court began by reiterating that the purpose of article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>XIII A, section 4, is to place restrictions upon the imposition of additional or increased state or local taxes other than property taxes which would counteract the tax savings derived from the operation of the property tax rate and assessment limitations of Proposition 13. (1 Cal.4th at pp. 6-7.) Article XIII A, section 4, is part of an \u201cinterlocking package\u201d to assure effective real property tax relief. (1 Cal.4th at p. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Rider </em>revisited its earlier decision in <em>Los Angeles County Transportation Com. </em>v. <em>Richmond </em>(hereafter <em>Richmond) </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 197 [182 Cal.Rptr. 324, 643 P.2d 941], which held that an agency lacking the power to impose a tax on real property could not be deemed a \u201cspecial district\u201d within the meaning of article XIII A, section 4. The <em>Richmond </em>court determined that \u201cProposition 13 was aimed at property tax relief, and [article XIII A,] section 4 thereof was intended to restrict the ability of local taxing agencies to impose new taxes to <em>replace </em>the loss of property tax revenue arising from the tax rate and assessment restrictions of that measure.\u201d <em>(Rider, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 7, original italics.) The plurality opinion in <em>Richmond </em>reasoned that since only those special districts which levied property taxes could replace revenues lost by Proposition 13, \u201cspecial districts\u201d in article XIII A, section 4, meant districts authorized to levy property taxes. (See <em>Rider, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at pp. 7-8, citing <em>Richmond, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">As noted by the <em>Rider </em>court, the dissenting opinion in <em>Richmond </em>\u201cobserved that the majority\u2019s analysis in <em>Richmond </em>could be used to readily circumvent the supermajority vote requirement of [article XIII A,] section 4 \u2018by the simple creation of a district which is geographically precisely coterminous with a county, but which lacks its real property taxing power .... The majority has cut a hole in the financial fence which the people in their Constitution have erected around their government. Governmental entities may be expected, instinctively, to pour through the opening seeking the creation of similar revenue-generating entities in myriad forms which will be limited only by their ingenuity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rider </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 8, citing <em>Richmond, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 213, dis. opn. of Richardson, J.) In response to the dissent, the <em>Richmond </em>plurality remarked that there was no issue of intent to circumvent Proposition 13 in the case before the court because the taxing agency at issue in <em>Richmond </em>antedated adoption of Proposition 13. (See <em>Rider, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 8, citing <em>Richmond, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 208.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The <em>Rider </em>court turned its attention to the question left open in <em>Richmond </em>regarding the validity of a taxation scheme enacted for the apparent purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>of avoiding the supermajority voter approval requirement imposed by article XIII A, section 4. <em>(Rider </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 5.) <em>Rider </em>determined the San Diego County Regional Justice Facility Financing Agency was a \u201cspecial district\u201d under article XIII A, section 4, despite its lack of power to levy a tax on real property. (1 Cal.4th at p. 10.) \u201cTo hold otherwise clearly would create a wide loophole in Proposition 13 as feared by the dissent in <em>Richmond. . . . </em>[T]he evident purpose of [article XIII A,] section 4 was to \u2018assure effective real property relief\u2019 by imposing restrictions on \u2018additional or increased state or local levies other than property taxes . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] <em>Richmond, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 197, 205-206, makes [article XIII A,] section 4 inapplicable to special taxes levied by local districts which, prior to the passage of Proposition 13, lacked the power to levy real property taxes. The Court of Appeal decision herein [holding the <em>Rider </em>tax valid under <em>Richmond] </em>would extend <em>Richmond </em>to any local district or agency, whenever created, which lacks such power, even if purposefully formed for the sole purpose of circumventing [article XIII A,] section 4. We are convinced the framers of, and voters for, Proposition 13 did not intend that [article XIII A,] section 4 be construed in such a manner.\u201d <em>(Rider, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 10, original italics.) The <em>Rider </em>court continued: \u201cIt seems evident that <em>Richmond's </em>limitation of the term \u2018special district\u2019 to those districts possessing property tax power is unworkable as applied to districts formed after the adoption of Proposition 13, because to our knowledge <em>no </em>such agencies possess that power. With limited exceptions, only <em>counties </em>are empowered to levy the 1 percent maximum property tax allowed by Proposition 13. [Citations.] In other words, as a practical matter, the proposed extension of <em>Richmond </em>to all districts, whenever created, which lack property tax power would read [article XIII A,] section 4\u2019s reference to \u2018special districts\u2019 out of existence as applied to districts formed after 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">\u201c. . . [Article XIII A,] section 4 of Proposition 13 was intended to restrict the ability of local governments to impose new taxes to replace property tax revenues lost under the other provisions of that measure. [Citation.] This intent would be frustrated if cities and counties were nonetheless permitted to arrange for the formation of local taxing districts to finance municipal functions without securing the requisite two-thirds voter approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">\u201cThus, we hold that \u2018special district\u2019 would include any local taxing agency created to raise funds for city or county purposes to replace revenues lost by reason of the restrictions of Proposition 13.\u201d <em>(Rider </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 11, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The <em>Rider </em>court stated that in the case before it the evidence was strong that the taxing agency was created in order to circumvent Proposition 13. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number><em>(Rider </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 11.) The Supreme Court continued on to state that in the absence of evidence of an intent to circumvent Proposition 13, such intent may be inferred from evidence that \u201cthe new tax agency is <em>essentially controlled </em>by one or more cities or counties that otherwise would have had to comply with the supermajority provision of [Proposition 13]. In determining whether such control exists, a variety of considerations may be relevant, including the presence or absence of (1) substantial municipal control over agency operations, revenues or expenditures, (2) municipal ownership or control over agency property or facilities, (3) coterminous physical boundaries, (4) common or overlapping governing boards, (5) municipal involvement in the creation or formation of the agency, and (6) agency performance of functions customarily or historically performed by municipalities and financed through levies of property taxes.\u201d (1 Cal.4th at pp. 11-12, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Thus, <em>Rider </em>limited <em>Richmond </em>to taxing agencies formed before the 1978 passage of Proposition 13 and held that as to taxing agencies formed after passage of Proposition 13, \u201cspecial district\u201d under article XIII A, section 4, includes local taxing authorities created to raise funds to replace revenues lost because of Proposition 13, regardless of whether the taxing agency has the power to levy real property taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">EFA reads <em>Rider </em>too narrowly by arguing it (EFA) is not a special district under the <em>Rider </em>analysis since EFA is not essentially controlled <em>by a city or county. </em>It is true <em>Rider </em>mentioned control by a city or county. However, <em>Rider </em>spoke in terms of municipal control because the creating entity there at issue was a county. We disagree with EFA\u2019s view that under <em>Rider </em>\u201cspecial district\u201d means <em>only </em>taxing entities controlled by a city or county. <em>Rider </em>held \u201cspecial district\u201d <em>includes </em>taxing agencies controlled by a city or county (1 Cal.4th at p. 11); it did not hold \u201cspecial district\u201d means <em>only </em>those agencies. The lesson of <em>Rider </em>is that entities subject to article XIII A, section 4, cannot circumvent the constitutional restrictions through the device of creating new entities to do what the creating entity cannot do. Thus, accepting for the sake of argument that the City and County of San Francisco does not control EFA, we nevertheless do not consider that lack of control dispositive. The material questions are whether EFA was created and is controlled by an entity that is subject to Proposition 13\u2019s supermajority requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">It is undisputed that EFA was created by the San Francisco Unified School District and the San Francisco Community College District. (\u00a7 7286.1, at fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>EFA does not dispute that it is controlled by those two school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>districts. Instead, EFA merely argues that school districts are not \u201cspecial districts\u201d within the meaning of article XIII A, section 4 (fn. 2, <em>ante).</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The term \u201cspecial district\u201d in article XIII A, section 4, is ambiguous. <em>(Richmond, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 205.)  \u201cWhere a provision in the Constitution is ambiguous, a court must ordinarily adopt that interpretation which carries out the intent and objective of the drafters of the provision and the people by whose vote it was adopted.\u201d <em>(Mosk </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 474, 495 [159 Cal.Rptr. 494, 601 P.2d 1030].)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">That Proposition 13 was meant to apply to school districts is clear from the ballot materials presented to the voters. The Ballot Pamphlet\u2019s \u201cAnalysis by Legislative Analyst\u201d told the voters: \u201cUnder existing law cities, counties, <em>schools </em>and special districts are permitted to levy local property taxes.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Tax Limitation Initiative, Analysis by Legis. Analyst, Primary Elec. (Jun. 6, 1978) p. 56, italics added.) With reference to article XIII A, section 4, the legislative analysis told the voters: \u201cThis measure would authorize cities, counties, special districts and <em>school districts </em>to impose unspecified \u2018special\u2019 taxes only if they receive approval by two-thirds of the voters. Such taxes could not be based on the value or sale of real property, [ft] The Legislative Counsel advises us that provisions in the existing Constitution would prohibit general law cities, counties, <em>school districts </em>and special districts from imposing new \u2018special taxes\u2019 without specific approval by the Legislature. Such restrictions limit the ability of these local governments, even with local voter approval, to replace property tax losses resulting from the adoption of this initiative.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 57, 60, italics added; see also <em>Arvin Union School Dist. </em>v. <em>Ross, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d 189, 199 [citing Proposition 13 election materials as support for view that article XIII A, section 4, applies to school districts]<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>.)  The legislative analysis contained in the ballot pamphlet is an accepted source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>from which to ascertain the voters\u2019 intent, because we assume the voters considered it along with other materials in the ballot pamphlet. <em>(San Francisco Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 571, 579 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 245, 828 P.2d 147].)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">EFA cites authorities holding that election materials are helpful but \u201cnot conclusive\u201d in determining the probable meaning of initiative language. (E.g., <em>San Francisco Taypayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 571, 579-580; <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 785, 802-803 [268 Cal.Rptr. 753, 789 P.2d 934]; <em>Carman </em>v. <em>Alvord </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 318, 330 [182 Cal.Rptr. 506, 644 P.2d 192].) However, the cited cases grappled with conflicting evidence of intent within election materials or between election materials and the measure itself. Thus, <em>Carman </em>v. <em>Alvord, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at pages 330-331, rejected a Legislative Analyst\u2019s interpretation contained in a ballot pamphlet because the analyst\u2019s view was contradicted by the measure\u2019s official title and summary which were also contained in the ballot pamphlet. <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pages 802-803, rejected an interpretation inferrable from ballot arguments because that interpretation would conflict with the measure itself. The issue in <em>Delaney </em>was whether the protection of \u201cunpublished information\u201d in the newspersons\u2019 shield law (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2, subd. (b)) included a newsperson\u2019s nonconfidential eyewitness observations of an event in a public place. The ballot arguments, which emphasized confidentiality, supported an inference that the measure was limited to confidential information. <em>(Delaney, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 802-803.) However, the court concluded such an inference would conflict with the measure itself, which protected \u201cany unpublished information.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) San Francisco Taxpayers Assn., supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pages 579-580, rejected a Legislative Analyst\u2019s ballot analysis because it did not take into account a provision of the measure which expressly contradicted the analyst\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Thus, evidence of the meaning of a measure contained in election materials is not conclusive if inconsistent with other evidence.  Here, however, there is no conflict. The only evidence of intent is that article XIII A, section 4, was meant to apply to school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">EFA suggests the Legislative Analyst\u2019s interpretation contained in the ballot pamphlet conflicted with the measure itself, because article XIII A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>section 4, nowhere mentions school districts. The measure specifies only cities, counties, and special districts. Since the Legislative Analyst\u2019s comments referred to \u201cspecial districts <em>and </em>school districts\u201d (italics added), EFA argues the Legislative Analyst was not construing the term \u201cspecial district\u201d but was attempting to change the measure by injecting a new term contrary to the express language of the measure. Otherwise, says EFA, the Legislative Analyst would have said \u201cspecial districts, <em>including </em>school districts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">We believe EFA is asking us to apply rules of construction to the Legislative Analyst\u2019s comments, and such an application is unwarranted. We do not view the legislative analysis as conflicting with the language of the measure or as attempting to change the measure. Rather, we view it as an inartful yet clear message that the ambiguous term, \u201cspecial district,\u201d as used in the measure includes school districts. The critical point is that the voters understood article XIII A, section 4, to apply to school districts. Construing special districts to include school districts gives effect to the voters\u2019 intent in adopting Proposition 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">EFA cites the following dictum in <em>California Bldg. Industry Assn. </em>v. <em>Governing Bd. </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 212 [253 Cal.Rptr. 497]: \u201cThe reference by Legislative Counsel [in the ballot pamphlet] to \u2018school districts,\u2019 as separate and distinct from \u2018special districts,\u2019 raises a question as to whether the latter term embraces the former. Our review of the applicable authorities strongly suggests to us that the terms \u2018special district\u2019 and \u2018district,\u2019 as used in article XIII A and related legislation, do not include the school districts. (See <em>Los Angeles County Transportation Com. </em>v. <em>Richmond </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 197, 205-206 []; Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 21 [formerly art. IX, \u00a7 6 (\u00b6 6)]; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Richards </em>(1926) 79 Cal.App. 1, 8-10 [] [discussing the power of a school district to levy taxes under art. XI, \u00a7 12 (now art.

However, EFA neglects to mention the remainder of the footnote, where the court states: \u201cHowever, neither the parties nor amici have seen fit to raise or discuss this issue in their briefs. Indeed, Building Industry, in response to our postargument inquiry, has conceded that factors are present \u2018which indicate that school districts might be considered \u201cspecial districts\u201d for purposes of Article XIII A.\u2019 In view of such concession and lack of dispute, as well as our resolution of the case on other grounds, we do not reach or further discuss this issue.\u201d (206 Cal.App.3d at p. 223, fn. 11.) Thus, the <em>California Bldg. Industry Assn, </em>court did not decide the issue before us and does not constitute authority on the matter. <em>(Ginns </em>v. <em>Savage </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 520, 524, fn. 2 [39 Cal.Rptr. 377, 393 P.2d 689].) Moreover, we have reviewed the authorities cited in that case and do not locate the source of the \u201cstrong suggestion\u201d noted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>EFA claims to have evidence that the drafters of Proposition 13 intended to exclude school districts from article XIII A, section 4. Thus, EFA points out that article XIIIB (Government Spending Limitations), which was added to the state Constitution a year after adoption of Proposition 13, distinguishes between \u201cspecial district\u201d and \u201cschool district\u201d by specifying that the measure applies to both.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In EFA's view, article XIIIB somehow constitutes a retroactive declaration of drafters\u2019 intent as to article XIII A, and that intent was to exclude school districts from the meaning of \u201cspecial district.\u201d However, even assuming for the sake of argument that the same framers drafted both measures, and even assuming that XIII B demonstrates the drafters\u2019 intent regarding the measure adopted the previous year, we would not consider EFA\u2019s argument persuasive.  An after-the-fact declaration of intent by a drafter of Proposition 13 may deserve some consideration but does not govern the court\u2019s determination as to how the voters understood an ambiguous provision. <em>(Carman </em>v. <em>Alvord, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 331, fn. 10.)  In any event, we do not believe that article XIII B\u2019s express reference to \u201cschool district\u201d as distinct from \u201cspecial district\u201d casts any light on the omission of the term \u201cschool district\u201d from article XIII A, in view of the election materials we have already discussed. That the clear expression of intent to include school districts appears in the text of article XIII B does not detract from the presence of a clear expression of intent to include school districts in article XIII A. As to article XIII A, the intent merely appears in the ballot materials rather than the text of the initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">EFA also cites 69 statutes which define or distinguish between special districts and school districts in a variety of contexts ranging from the Election Code to the Water Code. EFA claims these statutes constitute a legislative interpretation of the meaning of \u201cspecial districts\u201d in article XIII A, section 4, and that this interpretation is entitled to great deference. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">It is true the Supreme Court has said that the Legislature\u2019s interpretation of a constitutional term is relevant to an assessment of the intention of the electorate. <em>(Richmond, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 206.) However, we think this canon of construction must be used with caution when interpreting an initiative measure. The Legislature is not always enamored with initiative measures enacted by the voters. The Legislature ought not to be able to frustrate the intent of the electorate by enacting statutes that frustrate the popular will. Consequently, although we will examine statutes enacted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>light of the subject constitutional provision, we will continue to give greater significance to the will of the electorate itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">In any event, the statutes cited by EFA do not support its position. Most of the cited statutes are unrelated to Proposition 13 and therefore do not help construe the meaning of article XIII A, section 4. \u201c[T]he Legislature has employed the term \u2018special district\u2019 in a number of different ways on different, occasions. No attempt need be made to reconcile them all.\u201d <em>(Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Whittier Union High School Dist. </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 730, 736 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 109].) We therefore consider only those statutes which EFA claims were enacted to implement Proposition 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The only statutes which EFA specifically claims to be related to Proposition 13 are sections 69.5, 95, 2215, and Government Code section 16271, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Section 69.5 allows persons who are disabled or over the age of 55 years to transfer the base-year value of a residence to a replacement dwelling, subject to consultation between the county board of supervisors and all \u201clocal affected agencies.\u201d (\u00a7 69.5, subd. (a)(2).) \u201cLocal affected agency\u201d is defined as \u201cany city, special district, school district, or community college district which receives an annual property tax revenue allocation.\u201d (\u00a7 69.5, subd. (g)(12).) EFA contends that because \u201cspecial district\u201d and \u201cschool district\u201d are discrete items in a disjunctive in section 69.5, \u201cspecial district\u201d in article XIII A, section 4, cannot be construed to include school districts. We disagree. We do not believe section 69.5 creates any conflict with the clear intent inartfully expressed in the election materials for article XIII A, section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The next statute cited by EFA is section 95, which contains definitions for a chapter on allocation of property tax revenues (\u00a7\u00a7 95-100). Section 95 contains a definition of \u201cspecial district\u201d as used in the chapter and provides in part: \u201c \u2018Special district\u2019 does not include a city, a county, a school district or a community college district.\u201d (\u00a7 95, subd. (m).) Contrary to EFA\u2019s position, we cannot conclude that the exclusion of school districts from section 95 casts any light on the meaning of special district in article XIII A, section 4. Section 95 is part of a chapter on allocation of tax revenues. The chapter specifies the manner of calculating the amounts to be allocated to special districts. (E.g., \u00a7\u00a7 97.31-97.32.) However, school districts are subject to a different method of calculation, based on the school district\u2019s average daily attendance. (\u00a7 75.70.) There thus appears to be a basis for excluding school districts from section 95 that is not material to the construction of article XIII A, section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>The next statute cited by EFA is section 2215, which is part of the chapter on reimbursement for costs mandated by the state. (\u00a7\u00a7 2201-2216.) Section 2215 defines \u201cspecial district\u201d as used in the chapter and provides in part: \u201c 'Special district\u2019 does not include a city, a county, a school district or a community college district.\u201d However, the chapter contains provisions regarding state-mandated costs unique to school districts. (\u00a7 2207.5.) Thus, the separate treatment of school districts and special districts in section 2215 does not lead to the conclusion that \u201cspecial districts\u201d in article XIII A, section 4, excludes school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The last statute cited by EFA is Government Code section 16271, subdivision (d). That statute is part of a chapter (\u00a7\u00a7 16270-16279.5) which provided for distribution of a $125 million fund (Gov. Code, \u00a7 16272) for the 1978-1979 fiscal year among special districts, as defined in that chapter, which had the ability to raise revenue through user charges and fees and which lost the ability to raise revenue directly from property taxes by virtue of Proposition 13 (\u00a7 16270). Government Code section 16271, subdivision (d), defines special district and provides in part: \u201c \u2018Special district\u2019 does not include a city, a county, a school district or a community college district.\u201d We cannot conclude that the Legislature\u2019s exclusion of school districts from entitlement to share in that fund constitutes a legislative interpretation of \u201cspecial districts\u201d within the meaning of article XIII A, section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">To the contrary, we agree with the retailers that other statutory provisions reflect the Legislature\u2019s understanding that article XIII A, section 4, applies to school districts. Thus, Education Code sections 43040-43052, address voter-approved special taxes for new school facilities for the Chino Unified School District. Education Code section 43041, subdivision (a)(1), provides: \u201cThe special tax has been approved, pursuant to Section 4 of Article XIII A of the California Constitution, by two-thirds of the voters of the school district voting upon the proposition to authorize the governing board of the school district to levy the special tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">We conclude EFA\u2019s reliance on statutory definitions of \u201cspecial district\u201d is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">We conclude \u201cspecial districts\u201d within the meaning of article XIII A, section 4, includes school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Since article XIII A, section 4, applies to school districts, a taxing agency created and controlled by school districts is subject to article XIII A, section 4. Here, it is clear that EFA was created and controlled by school districts, and EFA makes no argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>We conclude EFA is a \u201cspecial district\u201d within the meaning of article XIII A, section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">2. \u201cRetroactivity\u201d <em>of Rider</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">EFA contends <em>Rider </em>does not apply retroactively to this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">In discussing the applicability of its definition of \u201cspecial district\u201d to taxing agencies created after passage of Proposition 13 but before <em>Rider </em>was decided, the <em>Rider </em>court said: \u201cWe [] leave open the question of a possible prospective application of our holding to agencies other than the Agency involved herein. The issue of prospectivity involves difficult constitutional and policy considerations largely unbriefed in this case.\u201d (1 Cal.4th at p. 13.) In addition, resolution of the prospectivity issue may depend on a variety of case-specific factors, including the degree of hardship or other adverse consequences that would result from a retroactive application of our holding in a particular setting. Under these circumstances, we believe that any blanket pronouncement on the prospectivity issue at this time would be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">In <em>Monterey Peninsula Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>County of Monterey </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1520 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 188], the Sixth District found no impediment to retroactive application of <em>Rider </em>on a case-by-case basis to a taxing agency in existence before <em>Rider </em>became final. (8 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1536-1543.) EFA challenges <em>Monterey Peninsula\u2019s </em>conclusions that <em>Rider </em>had retroactive effect because it merely clarified existing law and was foreseeable. However the <em>Monterey Peninsula </em>court further concluded retroactive application of <em>Rider </em>does not contravene public policy where its application would not impose unexpected and unreasonable hardships apart from those the tax was intended to alleviate. <em>(Ibid.) </em>We agree with the latter conclusion and find it sufficient to dispose of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Here, the sequence of events was: (1) adoption of Proposition 13; (2) creation of EFA; (3) election in which voters approved EFA\u2019s tax; (4) <em>Rider </em>opinion issued (one week after the election); (5) <em>Rider </em>became final; and (6) SBE began to collect the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Since the <em>Rider </em>opinion became final before SBE began collecting the tax, the retailers argue this is not a true question of retroactivity. EFA responds the question of retroactivity turns on whether the tax statute was enacted before <em>Rider, </em>not whether the tax was collected before <em>Rider. </em>We will therefore consider the question of retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>The trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment states: \u201cNo hardship or significant adverse factors exist which might prevent <em>Rider </em>from applying. No employees, structures, or other facilities were hired or commenced in reliance upon the provisions of [] section 7286.1 and 7286.2. The complicity of the Legislature in the attempt to circumvent Proposition 13 does not provide any justification for this tax. More importantly, however, is the fact that the district levied the tax <em>after Rider </em>was decided. This Court concludes, as a matter of law, that the issue of \u2018retroactive application\u2019 need not be addressed under the circumstances of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">We agree with the trial court that no hardship is shown that would preclude application of <em>Rider </em>to this case. Thus, EFA does not dispute that no employees, structures, or other facilities were hired or commenced in reliance on this tax. Instead, EFA argues only that prejudice is shown by the mere fact that school children will not receive the tax money, and the tax money is essential to prevent severe cutbacks in the school system. However, <em>Rider's </em>reference to \u201chardship\u201d must necessarily mean something more than the need for tax money because otherwise the exception would swallow the rule. We agree with the Sixth District that avoidance of a retroactive application of <em>Rider </em>requires a showing that its application would impose unexpected and unreasonable hardships \u201capart from those the tax was intended to alleviate.\u201d <em>(Monterey Peninsula Taxpayers Assn., supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at p. 1542.)</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">We conclude EFA fails to show the requisite hardship to avoid applicability of <em>Rider </em>to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">C. <em>\u201cSpecial Tax\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">EFA next contends that even if it is a special district, the tax at issue in this case is a general rather than a special tax and therefore is not subject to the supermajority requirement of article XIII A, section 4 (fn. 2, <em>ante). </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\"><em>Rider </em>rejected a similar argument by the San Diego County Regional Justice Facility Financing Agency. <em>(Rider </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at pp. 13-14.) The taxing agency there argued its tax was a general tax because its revenues were not earmarked for any special purposes within the agency but were to be placed in the agency\u2019s general fund for \u2018\u201cthe general governmental purposes of the agency ....\u2019\u201d (1 Cal.4th at p. 13, citing Gov. Code, \u00a7 26272.) The Supreme Court disagreed, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-11\">\u201cIn <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Farrell </em>[1982] 32 Cal.3d 47 [184 Cal.Rptr. 713, 648 P.2d 935] <em>(Farrell), </em>we addressed the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>phrase \u2018special taxes\u2019 in [article XIII A,] section 4. The City and County of San Francisco (the City) had imposed a payroll and general receipts tax, the proceeds of which were to be placed in the City\u2019s treasury to be used for general governmental expenditures. Because the tax had been approved by a mere majority of the City\u2019s voters, a question arose as to the application of section 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\">\u201cThe <em>Farrell </em>majority observed that \u2018special taxes\u2019 was an ambiguous term that has been given varying interpretations, but that applying settled interpretive principles (including <em>Richmond' </em>s rule of strict construction), the term as used in [article XIII A] section 4 means \u2018taxes which are levied for a specific purpose rather than, as in the present case, a levy placed in the general fund to be utilized for <em>general governmental </em>purposes.\u2019 (32 Cal.3d at p. 57, italics added.) Because the City\u2019s payroll tax revenues were to be used for general City expenses, the tax was deemed a \u2018general\u2019 one beyond the reach of section 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">\u201cJustice Richardson again dissented, believing the majority \u2018widens still further the hole which they have cut in that protective fence which the people of California thought they had constructed around their collective purse\u2019 by adopting Proposition 13. [Citations.] Justice Richardson observed the <em>Farrell </em>rationale would allow a municipality to recover completely any property tax revenues lost under Proposition 13 merely by enacting an alternative form of taxation, the revenues of which being earmarked for general governmental purposes. [Citation.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">\u201cWe believe the <em>Farrell, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 47, rationale does not extend to limited purpose agencies such as the Agency herein. To hold that a tax cannot be deemed a \u2018special tax\u2019 if revenues thereof are deposited in the taxing agency\u2019s general fund pulls any remaining teeth from [article XIII A] section 4\u2019s restriction on special taxes. . . .\u201d <em>(Rider </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at pp. 13-14.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-7\"><em>Rider </em>also rejected arguments that the San Diego County Regional Justice Facility Financing Agency\u2019s tax was a general tax because the authorizing legislation called it a \u201cgeneral tax\u201d to be used for \u201cgeneral governmental purposes.\u201d <em>(Rider </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at pp. 14-15, citing Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 26251, 26272.) \u201c[T]he Legislature\u2019s designation of the tax as a \u2018general tax,\u2019 ... is of minor importance in light of the realities underlying its adoption and its probable object and effect. [Citation.] The statute at issue was undoubtedly drafted with [article XIII A,] section 4 and Farrell\u2019s <em>(supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 47) holding firmly in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>\u201cNor can we accept defendants\u2019 \u2018general fund\u2019 argument. It is undisputed that if the County had directly adopted the tax in question, earmarking its revenues for the special, limited purpose of financing the County\u2019s justice facilities, it would have been deemed a \u2018special tax\u2019 under <em>Farrell. </em>As plaintiffs observe, it would be anomalous if the \u2018special\u2019 tax of one agency could so readily become the \u2018general\u2019 one of another. Under defendants\u2019 proposed test, the Legislature could readily avoid [article XIII A,] section 4\u2019s supermajority voter approval requirement by simply creating a local taxing agency to accomplish a specific, narrow governmental purpose (e.g., lifeguard towers for county beaches), and provide that tax revenues shall be deposited in the agency\u2019s \u2018general fund\u2019 for the \u2018general governmental purposes\u2019 of that agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">\u201cA more reasonable interpretation of [article XIII A,] section 4, consistent with <em>Farrell's (supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 47) guidelines, is that a \u2018special tax\u2019 is one levied to fund a specific government project or program, such as the construction and financing of the County\u2019s justice facilities. It is true that, under the foregoing principle, every tax levied by a \u2018special purpose\u2019 district or agency would be deemed a \u2018special tax.\u2019 But this interpretation seems most consistent with the probable intent of the framers of Proposition 13.\u201d <em>(Rider </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 15, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Here, EFA challenges the retailers\u2019 assertion that school districts are \u201cby definition\u201d limited purpose districts. EFA argues school districts are not limited purpose districts but are general purpose entities with even greater powers than general law cities. EFA cites Government Code section 34102, which provides: \u201cCities organized under the general law shall be \u2018general law cities.\u2019 \u201d EFA fails to explain how this statute supports its position, since school districts are a type of nonmunicipal public corporation. <em>(Howard Jarvis Taypayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Whittier Union High School Dist., supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 733.) EFA also cites Education Code section 35160, which provides: \u201cOn and after January 1, 1976, the governing board of any school district may initiate and carry on any program, activity, or may otherwise act in any manner which is not in conflict with or inconsistent with, or preempted by, any law and which is not in conflict with the purposes for which school districts are established.\u201d In our view, this statute merely establishes that school districts enjoy broad powers within the scope of their limited purpose of assisting education.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201ca \u2018special tax\u2019 is one levied to fund a specific governmental project or program . . . .\u201d <em>(Rider </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 15.)

Had the school districts not been \u201cspecial districts\u201d within the meaning of article XIII A, section 4, the court would not have needed to reach the issue it decided. Thus, the court\u2019s statement that school districts are \u201cspecial districts\u201d within the meaning of article XIII A, section 4, was not dictum. In any event, our conclusion here is not dependent upon <em>Arvin </em>but on the election materials themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\">California Constitution, article XIII B, section 8 (Definitions), defines \u201cLocal government\u201d to mean \u201cany city, county, city and county, school district, special district, authority, or other political subdivision of or within the State.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b741-8\">We note school districts\u2019 powers are not limited to educational services but extend to noneducational supplemental services.
