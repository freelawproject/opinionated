(The NLRA does not apply to agricultural workers. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3).))</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Prior to <em>Sure-Tan, </em>the immigration status of a worker made no difference in the available remedies under the NLRA. <em>(Local 512, Warehouse &amp; Office Workers </em>v. <em>N.L.R.B. </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 795 F.2d 705, 717-719, collecting cases.) Since <em>Sure-Tan, </em>there has been a split in the federal appellate courts whether NLRB make-whole remedies are available for undocumented workers who are physically present in the United States, even though their presence is illegal or they are not authorized to be employed. (Compare <em>Del Rey Tortilleria, Inc. </em>v. <em>N.L.R.B. </em>(7th Cir. 1992) 976 F.2d 1115, with <em>id. </em>at pp. 1123-1125 (dis. opn. of Cudahy, J.) and <em>E.E.O.C. </em>v. <em>Hacienda Hotel </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 881 F.2d 1504, 1517.)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Before the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (Pub.L. No. 97-470 (Jan. 14, 1983) 96 Stat. 2583, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801 et seq. [MSPA]) took effect, it was settled law in California that agricultural workers actually present in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, could receive backpay as part of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board\u2019s (ALRB or Board) remediation of unfair or discriminatory labor practices. (See <em>Rigi Agricultural Services, Inc. </em>(Nov. 21, 1985) 11 ALRB No. 27, pp. 3, 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">In the present case, we consider whether the INA and MSPA, as they existed at the times here relevant, preempted California\u2019s use of the make-whole remedy to protect 13 Salvadoran refugees from unfair and discriminatory labor practices by their harvesting company employer. We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>the state was empowered to provide this remedy, and we affirm the order of respondent ALRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">On January 31, 1985, after a lengthy disagreement with management about the quality of the grove and the quality of the crew\u2019s work, the members of Gilberto Trevino\u2019s crew refused to harvest oranges unless the bin rate was increased from $9.50 to $12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The next day, petitioner\u2019s supervising employee directed Trevino to fire 13 named crew members, referred to in the record and herein as \u201cthe discriminatees.\u201d Trevino told some members of the crew that the firings were because of the \u201cstrike\u201d the previous day.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The United Farm Workers of America filed charges with the ALRB. After an evidentiary hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found that the discriminatees had been fired because of their concerted activities seeking to improve their wages, protected activity under the Agricultural Labor Relations Act (ALRA) (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1152, 1153). That finding was affirmed by the ALRB, through a three-member panel, in a decision and order filed December 30, 1986. <em>(Phillip D. Bertelsen, dba Cove Ranch Management, supra, </em>12 ALRB No. 27.) Inter alia, the decision and order required petitioner to reinstate the discriminatees and pay them lost wages. Petitioner did not seek judicial review of the ALRB decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">After receiving a letter from petitioner offering reinstatement, each discriminatee appeared for work on March 24, 1986. Petitioner refused to immediately reinstate the discriminatees or pay them back wages because they failed to present documents showing they were authorized to work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">In subsequent proceedings to enforce the ALRB order, an ALJ found that petitioner owed the 13 discriminatees backpay totaling $60,148.03. The ALJ found that the discriminatees were not authorized by the Attorney General to work in the United States; however, petitioner was estopped to rely on that factor. The ALRB affirmed the ALJ order, but not on the estoppel basis. Instead, the ALRB determined that petitioner had not met its burden of proving that the discriminatees were not work authorized. <em>(Phillip D. Bertelsen, Inc., dba Cove Ranch Management </em>(Nov. 29, 1990) 16 ALRB No. 11, at p. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>Petitioner sought review in this court. We determined that petitioner had established prima facie that the workers were not work authorized. We remanded the matter for further proceedings on the merits. <em>(Phillip D. Bertelsen, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 506 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 58].)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">On remand, the parties and the ALRB stipulated that the discriminatees were not work authorized. The ALJ reaffirmed his earlier estoppel-based opinion, and petitioner again filed exceptions with the Board. In its second supplemental decision and order <em>(Phillip D. Bertelsen, Inc., dba Cove Ranch Management </em>(Dec. 9, 1992) 18 ALRB No. 13), the Board determined that, even though the discriminatees were not authorized by the Attorney General to work in the United States during the interval between their firing and their reinstatement, they nevertheless were entitled to backpay under the ALRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Petitioner again filed a timely petition for review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Under the ALRA, it has been the \u201cusual practice\u201d of the ALRB to treat \u201call agricultural employees alike, regardless of their immigration status.\u201d <em>(Rigi Agricultural Services, Inc. </em>(June 14, 1983) 9 ALRB No. 31 at p. 2, fn. 4.) In particular, the ALRB has consistently held that undocumented workers who are present in California are entitled to the same make-whole remedies (backpay and reinstatement) as are other agricultural workers. <em>(Rigi Agricultural Services, Inc., supra, </em>11 ALRB No. 27 at pp. 8-11.) The Legislature has not amended the ALRA to provide that undocumented workers are not entitled to make-whole relief, and no published judicial opinion has addressed the issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Petitioner impliedly concedes that, purely as a matter of state law and interpretation of the ALRA, the Board\u2019s decision represents settled law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>Petitioner argues, however, that in two separate respects the ALRA was preempted by federal law during the relevant times. First, contends petitioner, undocumented workers were not, as a matter of federal law, \u201cavailable\u201d for work during the backpay period, and so are not entitled to backpay under the ALRA. Second, petitioner asserts it is a federally registered farm labor contractor: at the relevant times, it was subject to federal criminal penalties if it reinstated the discriminatees; backpay could not accrue under the ALRA so long as federal criminal law prohibited reinstatement. (See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1851(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">A. <em>Availability for Work.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\"><em>Sure-Tan, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>467 U.S. 883, involved a leather processor who reported his undocumented employees to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) after a union prevailed in a representation election. The employees were arrested in the ensuing INS raid and accepted voluntary departure in lieu of deportation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 887 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 739-740].) After initial NLRB unfair labor practice proceedings, the employer sent letters to the workers in Mexico offering reinstatement provided that such reinstatement \u201cwould not subject Sure-Tan to any violations of United States immigration laws.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">On appeal from subsequent NLRB remediation orders, the Court of Appeals held that \u201c. . . reinstatement would be proper only if the discharged employees were legally present and free to be employed in the United States when they presented themselves for reinstatement.\u201d <em>(Sure-Tan, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 889 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 741].) While the court held that the employees were in fact \u201cunavailable for work\u201d after deportation and prior to lawful reentry, it directed that a minimum backpay order of six-months\u2019 wages would best effectuate the policies of the NLRA. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 890 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 741-742].)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">On certiorari to the Supreme Court, two issues were presented. First, are undocumented aliens \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of the NLRA? Second, if so, are they entitled to make-whole relief? The court\u2019s answers to these questions shed some light on the issues now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>The court first held that the policies of the NLRA would be advanced by including undocumented workers as employees under the NLRA: \u201cIf undocumented alien employees were excluded from participation in union activities and from protections against employer intimidation, there would be created a subclass of workers without a comparable stake in the collective goals of their legally resident co-workers, thereby eroding the unity of all the employees and impeding effective collective bargaining.\u201d <em>(Sure-Tan, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 892 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 743].)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Next, the court found that there was no conflict between this result under the NLRA and the immigration policies of the INA. The INA \u201cevinces \u2018at best evidence of a peripheral concern with employment of illegal entrants.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sure-Tan, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 892 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 743].) Under the INA, hiring an undocumented worker is not illegal; it is not \u201ca separate criminal offense for an alien to accept employment after entering this country illegally.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 893 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 743].)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Thus, \u201c[cjounterintuitive though it may be\u201d <em>(Sure-Tan, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 892 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 743]), NLRA coverage for undocumented workers helps reduce employer incentives to hire illegals, which in turn may create \u201cfewer incentives for aliens themselves to enter in violation of the federal immigration laws.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 893-894 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 743].) Accordingly, the court concluded that the NLRA does cover undocumented workers. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 894 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 744].) Further, when the employer acts with antiunion animus, it is an unfair labor practice \u201cto report [to INS] or discharge an undocumented alien employee.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 896 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 745].)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">As to the second issue before the court, the applicability of make-whole remedies, the court held that such remedies must \u201cbe tailored to the unfair labor practice it is intended to redress.\u201d <em>(Sure-Tan, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 900 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 748].) The remedy \u201cmust be sufficiently tailored to expunge only the <em>actual, </em>and not merely speculative, consequences of the unfair labor practices.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Therefore, a reinstatement order in the case of undocumented workers must be conditioned \u201con the employees\u2019 legal reentry\u201d into the United States, and backpay must be limited if such employees are unavailable for work, i.e., \u201cduring any period when they were not lawfully present.\u201d <em>(Sure-Tan, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 903, fn. 12 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 750].)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Soon after <em>Sure-Tan </em>was decided, the ALRB considered the \u201cavailability for work\u201d issue in <em>Rigi Agricultural Services, Inc., supra, </em>11 ALRB No. 27. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>The Board reviewed the history of employment of undocumented workers in California agriculture and readily concluded that the Legislature intended that undocumented workers were to be protected \u201cagricultural employees\u201d under the Act. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 8-12.) The Board concluded that as a matter of legislative intent there was no difference in remedial relief based on a worker\u2019s immigration status. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The Board then considered whether, under <em>Sure-Tan, </em>federal immigration law preempted the state\u2019s attempt to provide full ALRA protection for undocumented workers. <em>(Rigi Agricultural Services, Inc., supra, </em>11 ALRB No. 27 at p. 12.) In a thorough and well-reasoned analysis, the Board concluded that the ALRA, as interpreted to cover undocumented workers, was not preempted by the INA. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 12-19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In summary, the ALRB has never distinguished between documented and undocumented workers in providing make-whole relief under the ALRA. The ALRB has expressly considered the issue of federal preemption under the INA, as interpreted in <em>Sure-Tan, </em>and has determined that the INA does not preempt make-whole relief for undocumented workers present in California and physically available for work. In the ensuing eight years, the Legislature has not repudiated the Board\u2019s interpretation of the ALRA. Petitioner does not challenge the settled law that make-whole relief for undocumented workers under the ALRA does not conflict with general federal immigration policies as expressed in the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Petitioner does contend, however, that the specific immigration status of these discriminatees renders them \u201cunavailable for work.\u201d (See <em>Phillip D. Bertelsen, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd., supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 510.) Petitioner argues that the discriminatees \u201cwere not permitted to seek employment as a condition of their asylum petitions,\u201d inferentially contending this makes the discriminatees\u2019 \u201cavailability for work\u201d different from that of a worker who simply is illegally present in the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Petitioner had the burden of proof \u201cto establish facts which would negative the existence of liability\u201d for backpay. <em>(Phillip D. Bertelsen, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd., supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 517, discussing <em>Frudden Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 262 [201 Cal.Rptr. 371].) We held in <em>Phillip D. Bertelsen, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd., supra, </em>at page 519 that petitioner had met its initial burden of proof to show that, if petitioner was a farm labor contractor, the discriminatees were not aliens \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d and had \u201cnot been authorized by the Attorney General to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>accept employment\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1816, repealed by IRCA, Pub.L. No. 99-603, 100 Stat. 3372, eff. July 1, 1987; see full discussion of the farm labor contractor issue, <em>post).</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">However, no proof has suggested that there are any limitations on discriminatees\u2019 presence in this country as petitioners for political asylum that place them in a different category of \u201cavailability\u201d than undocumented workers generally. And, as set forth above, general undocumented status does not render workers \u201cunavailable\u201d and ineligible for ALRB backpay relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Petitioner also cites <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Employment Development Department </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1791 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 705], for the proposition that the discriminatees were unavailable for work because of their immigration status. <em>Gutierrez </em>involved the claim for unemployment insurance benefits by a worker lawfully residing in the United States during her period of employment, but lacking work authorization during her claim period. The appellate court affirmed an administrative determination that, the employee was unavailable for work, and not entitled to benefits, because she was not work authorized. <em>Gutierrez </em>differs from the present case in two important ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">First, historically, unemployment benefits have been denied to undocumented workers <em>(see Alonso </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 242, 253-254 [123 Cal.Rptr. 536, 87 A.L.R.3d 678]), while ALRA make-whole relief has been available to undocumented workers during that same historical period (see <em>Rigi Agricultural Services, Inc., supra, 9 </em>ALRB No. 31 at p. 2, fn. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Second, the unemployment benefits system is administered by the states as part of a nationwide program to reduce unemployment, and the nationwide system is coordinated by the United States Department of Labor (DOL). The DOL has promulgated a specific program letter on this subject, stating that \u201c. . . an alien must be legally authorized to work in the United States to be considered \u2018available for work.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Employment Development Department, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at p. 1798.) There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>such federal directive dealing with California\u2019s specific issue of protecting the collective bargaining rights of agricultural workers, many of whom have been natives of Mexico and Central America, throughout the ebb and flood of the tides of \u201cbracero,\u201d \u201camnesty\u201d and other legalization programs. (See <em>Rigi Agricultural Services, Inc., supra, </em>11 ALRB No. 27 at pp. 9-11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Accordingly, we conclude the Board here properly determined that the INA did not preempt make-whole relief for the discriminatees who remained in California after discriminatory discharge from employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">B. <em>Federal Farm Labor Contractor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">We next focus on petitioner\u2019s claim that, although it was not unlawful for ordinary employers to hire undocumented workers during the times relevant to this case, and it was not a crime for undocumented workers to accept employment (see <em>Sure-Tan, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 893 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 743-744]), petitioner, because it was a registered farm labor contractor, would have committed a crime had it hired undocumented workers. (See 29 U.S.C. former \u00a7 1816 and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1851, as amended.) Petitioner contends that as to farm labor contractors, federal criminalization of such hiring preempts any ALRA imprimatur of hiring through reinstatement or backpay orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">At issue is the \u201cdual status\u201d employer: a farmer or grove management company that also provides labor to other growers. The parties agree petitioner is such an entity. It owns and farms some acreage, provides full farm management services for other acreage, and provides only harvesting labor at still other acreage. The discriminatees were employed on a harvesting-only crew. With respect to the discriminatees, was petitioner a farm labor contractor, and therefore forbidden by federal law from complying with the make-whole order?<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Federal labor laws have never covered the <em>collective </em>bargaining rights of agricultural workers. (See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3).) However, federal law for many years has regulated the employment relationship between farmers, labor contractors and individual farm workers. In 1964, Congress passed the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act of 1963 (FLCRA), Public Law No. 88-582 (Sept. 7, 1964) 78 Statutes at Large 920, as amended, 7 United States Code section 2041 et seq. FLCRA broadly defined \u201cfarm labor contractor,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>required licensing of and recordkeeping by such contractors, and prohibited certain employment practices by such contractors. (H.R.Rep. No. 97-885, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 12 (1982), reprinted at 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 4558.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In 1983, Congress enacted MSPA, which replaced FLCRA. In addition to general reforms of the registration and recordkeeping requirements of FLCRA, MSPA contained two provisions of particular relevance here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">(1) The definition of \u201cfarm labor contractor\u201d was significantly restricted, so as to exclude \u201cagricultural employers\u201d from the definition of farm labor contractors. (See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1802(7) [\u201cThe term \u2018farm labor contractor\u2019 means any person, other than an agricultural employer\u201d].) At the same time, many regulations of employment, transportation and housing of migrant and seasonal farm workers that previously had applied only to farm labor contractors, became applicable to all agricultural employers. (H.R.Rep. No. 97-885, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>p. 12, 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 4558.) Petitioner was a registered farm labor contractor under FLCRA, and has maintained that registration through the years involved in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">(2) It became illegal for farm labor contractors to employ undocumented workers. Under FLCRA, a farm labor contractor\u2019s license could be revoked and civil monetary penalties assessed for hiring undocumented workers. <em>(Counterman </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Labor </em>(5th Cir. 1985) 776 F.2d 1247, 1248, fn. 1, quoting 7 U.S.C. former \u00a7 2044(b)(6), repealed by MSPA.) As part of IRCA, which penalizes most employers for employment of undocumented aliens (see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a), MSPA\u2019s specific prohibition on such employment by farm labor contractors (29 U.S.C. former \u00a7 1816) was itself repealed effective July 1, 1987.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">We conclude, based on the unambiguous statutory language, that \u201cdual status\u201d employers are treated in MSPA only as agricultural employers, and are not farm labor contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The relevant provisions of MSPA are clear and unambiguous. (See <em>Mendoza </em>v. <em>Wight Vineyard Management </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 783 F.2d 941, 945.) 29 United States Code section 1802 provides that anyone, <em>except an agricultural employer </em>or an agricultural association, who recruits, solicits, hires, employs, furnishes, or transports any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker is a \u201cfarm labor contractor.\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1802(6)-(7).) An agricultural employer is anyone who \u201cowns or operates a farm, ranch, processing establishment, cannery, gin, packing shed or nursery, or who produces or conditions seed, <em>and who either recruits, solicits, hires, employs, furnishes, or transports </em>any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>migrant or seasonal agricultural worker.\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1802(2), italics added.) Additionally, 29 United States Code section 1803(b) provides that the farm labor contractor portion of MSPA \u201cdoes not apply to any agricultural employer.\u201d Thus, by the plain terms of the statute, one cannot be a farm labor contractor if one is an agricultural employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">This distinction is also noted in federal regulations implementing MSPA. They provide: \u201cAny farm labor contractor, as defined in the Act, is required to obtain a Certificate of Registration issued pursuant to the Act. . . .\u201d (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 500.1(c) (1993).) \u201cAgricultural employers . . . need not obtain Certificates of Registration in order to engage in [labor contracting] activities, even if the workers they obtain are utilized by other persons or on the premises of another.\u201d (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 500.1(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Despite the language of MSPA and the regulations, petitioner contends that an agricultural employer who furnishes to others labor for harvesting only, and not for full farm management, is a farm labor contractor who must register under MSPA. Petitioner relies on an opinion letter of the federal wage-hour administrator, Opinion Letter No. 1575 (WH-522, Apr. 23, 1984) Labor Law Reporter (CCH) paragraph 31,440, at page 43,759.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The letter deals in large part with the definition of \u201cseasonal agricultural worker.\u201d (Opn. Letter No. 1575, <em>supra, </em>Lab. L. Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 31,440 at p. 43,760.) The final, brief section of the letter states that grove care contractors will be considered \u201cagricultural employers\u201d if they \u201cperform all the farming operations required prior to harvest, . . . However, if such a grove care contractor engages in harvesting operations in any grove where he did not perform all the farming operations prior to harvest he will be considered a farm labor contractor and must comply with the registration requirements under MSPA.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 43,761.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">This passage in the opinion letter is impossible to reconcile with the language of MSPA and of DOL\u2019s regulations, quoted above. Further, it is wholly inconsistent with the available legislative history of MSPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">House of Representatives Report No. 97-885, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>notes that under FLCRA \u201c. . . the only entity responsible for either performing a duty or refraining from acting in a certain way is the farm labor contractor.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 2, 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 4548.) Yet, \u201c. . . the Act has created uncertainty about the status of fixed situs employers which has lead [sic] to the mandatory registration of many farmers as farm labor contractors.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cOnce a grower . . . has been found to be covered under [FLCRA] some of the liabilities which attach as a result of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>coverage are ones which were originally designed with the characteristic of the transient crewleader in mind, and which, when applied[] to a stationary employer produce needless paperwork and added administrative expense unnecessary for the effective and purposeful enforcement of the Act.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 3, 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 4549.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The House Report lists several examples \u201cthe Committee has learned of.\u201d One is particularly germane: \u201cThe small local farming operation where the farmer agreed to employ a few migrant workers, whom he had not recruited, for part-time work with provision for housing located on his farm. Since the work was only part-time he permitted such workers to also work for his neighbor but allowed the workers to use his housing with reimbursement from the neighbor. The farmer was consequently found to be a farm labor contractor who had not registered and was not authorized to provide housing\u2014a violation of FLCRA . . . .\u201d (H.R.Rep. No. 97-885, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 4, 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 4550.) While this example was obviously chosen by the report\u2019s authors for its \u201cmom and pop\u201d qualities, the situation presented by petitioner is different only in scope, not in kind, from the example.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The report goes on to explain the definition of farm labor contractor: MSPA \u201cstates specifically that neither an agricultural employer nor his employees ... are to be considered as farm labor contractors for any purposes under this Act.\u201d (H.R.Rep. No. 97-885, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 8, 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 4554.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Finally, the report summarizes the relevant portions of MSPA in terms completely inconsistent with the opinion letter and with petitioner\u2019s position: \u201c[Section 1803(b)] makes clear that Title I [\u2018Farm Labor Contractors\u2019] of this Act [MSPA] does not apply to any agricultural employer .... This is a substantial change from current law. Under FLCRA, any person who by definition was determined to be a farm labor contractor was required to register and meet all the requirements mandated for the issuance of a certificate of registration without regard to the difference between such contractors, both as to the permanency of their operation and as to their mode of doing business. This failure to distinguish created enforcement problems .... The structure of [MSPA] was designed to remedy this situation. Accordingly Title I of this Act which sets forth only the registration and certification requirements[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] covers only farm labor contractors <em>who are not agricultural employers </em>or associations. The Committee wishes, however, to make absolutely clear that such employers and associations are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>subject to the remaining Titles of this Act.\u201d (H.R.Rep. No. 97-885, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 12, 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 4558, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The statutory language and the weight of the interpretive materials overwhelmingly establish that an agricultural employer, such as petitioner, is not a \u201cfarm labor contractor\u201d within the meaning of 29 United States Code former section 1816.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, petitioner, who clearly owns and operates farms, is an agricultural employer, and not a MSPA farm labor contractor.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore nothing in MSPA preempts the ALRB\u2019s make-whole order for the undocumented discriminatees in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The Board\u2019s order is affirmed.

At issue in <em>Mendoza </em>v. <em>Wight Vineyard Management, supra, </em>783 F.2d 941 was whether the vineyard management defendants were required to register as farm labor contractors under MSPA. The employees contended the companies were required to register because they did not \u201cbear the risk of the operation\u201d of the farms, and therefore did not \u201cown or operate\" the farms as \u201cagricultural employers\u201d under MSPA. (783 F.2d at p. 944.) The court determined that the \u201crisk of operation\u201d standard was appropriate only under FLORA, and that the grove management companies clearly \u201coperated\u201d the groves for MSPA \u201cagricultural employer\" purposes. The companies were not dual-capacity entities\u2014i.e., there was no indication the companies simply harvested some vineyards while fully managing others\u2014and the court\u2019s brief discussion of the opinion letter sheds no light on the instant problem. (See 783 F.2d at pp. 944-945.) In particular, the court found \u201creliance upon Opinion No. 522 is unnecessary\u201d to that court\u2019s decision. <em>(Jd. </em>at p. 945.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b493-11\">We note that for situations arising after July 1, 1987, while 29 United States Code section 1816 has been repealed, the dual-capacity employer issue is still alive. Presently, 29 United States Code section 1851 continues to impose penalties on farm labor contractors not imposed on other employers, including \u201cagricultural employers\u201d under MSPA, for violations of IRCA. (Cf. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(e).) Certainly, to qualify for this agricultural employer exemption, the farming operation in question need be legitimate, not merely a sham.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b493-12\"> Retired judge of the Kern Superior Court sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
