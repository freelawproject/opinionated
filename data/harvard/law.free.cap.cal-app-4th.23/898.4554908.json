We also hold, because the insured here did not apply for coverage for her newborn twins until 49 days after their birth, which application was denied by the insurer, New England Mutual Life Insurance Company, on medical grounds, that the trial court properly granted the insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Such motion was brought by the insurer in the underlying action filed against it by Redlands Community Hospital seeking payment for the 35 days the twins remained in the hospital after the \u201ccovered\u201d 31-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">On September 27, 1989, Rebecca Rivas (Rivas) gave birth to premature twins at Redlands Community Hospital (plaintiff). The twins were hospitalized until December 2, 1989. When the twins were born, Rivas was an employee of Dura Plastic Products, Inc. (Dura) in Beaumont, and was insured under a group benefit plan provided by Dura and underwritten and administered by New England Mutual Life Insurance Company (defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">At the time of the birth, the plan provided in relevant part: \u201cCoverage for Sick Newborn [f] If you incur expenses for a Newborn Child for treatment of . . . prematurity: fit] then benefits will be payable under this Plan for 31 days after the birth of the child, even if you do not have Dependent coverage. However, <em>you must submit a written application for Dependent coverage to the Company within 31 days after the birth of the child and make the required contribution for Dependent coverage in order for the coverage to </em>continue.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The plan further provided: \u201cIf you do not make application for Dependent coverage within this 31-day period, then you will have to submit Proof of Good Health for your Dependents to the Company. Coverage for your Dependents will not start until the Company approves the Proof of Good Health for your Dependents. Coverage for your Dependents may be denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>An earlier version of the plan (hereinafter referred to as the first plan), which was in effect until September 1, 1989, 26 days before Rivas gave birth, did not include the foregoing provisions and recited in relevant part: \u201cYou may cover a dependent only by making a written request on the form furnished by the Policyholder for all of your dependents, present and future. <em>The request may be made at any time you have a qualified dependent but, if you elect to cover your dependents more than 31 days after you first acquire a qualified dependent, you may be required to produce, at your own expense, evidence of insurability </em>satisfactory to [defendant] for each dependent you then have.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">A \u201cqualified dependent\u201d was defined in relevant part as an unmarried child from birth to age 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">On November 15, 1989, <em>49 </em>days after she gave birth, Rivas applied for dependent coverage. Defendant declined coverage, \u201cbased on information received from the medical report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Thereafter, plaintiff, as Rivas\u2019s assignee, filed a complaint against Dura for: (1) \u201cHealthcare Reimbursement,\u201d (2) breach of contract, and (3) relief from forfeiture (because of any failure by plaintiff or Rivas, to perform any conditions required by defendant\u2019s alleged agreement to pay for the reasonable value of the twins\u2019 medical care). According to the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s first amended complaint (hereafter referred to as the complaint): (a) plaintiff rendered medical services to Rivas and to her newborn dependents continuously from September 27, 1989, to December 2, 1989; (b) at the time plaintiff rendered such services, the dependents met the applicable requirements for participation in the plan; (c) Dura inappropriately limited payment of plaintiffs and Rivas\u2019s claims for such services to the first 31 days thereof; and (d) Dura was indebted to plaintiff in the total amount of $151,396.64.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">After Dura answered the complaint, plaintiff filed an amendment thereto adding the insurer as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Defendant in turn then answered the complaint, denying its allegations and alleging several affirmative defenses. Among such defenses were that: (1) Rivas had failed to submit a written application for dependent coverage as required by the plan, and (2) plaintiffs claims were preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq. [ERISA]).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">The case being thus at issue, defendant noticed a motion for summary judgment, on the ground that Rivas failed to comply with the relevant terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>of the plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of its motion, defendant submitted the following separate statement of undisputed material facts (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 437c, subd. (b)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">\u201c1. The health plan at issue in this lawsuit is an employee welfare benefit plan (\u2018the Plan\u2019), and is therefore governed by ERISA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">\u201c2. The Plan was self-funded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">\u201c3. The Plan provided that coverage for a newborn child terminated on the 32nd day after birth unless the employee designated the newborn as a dependent and paid the required dependent premiums prior to this date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201c4. The newborn children at issue in this lawsuit were born on September 27, 1989.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">\u201c5. An application for dependent coverage for the newborn children was not submitted to either DURA or [defendant] on or before October 27, 1989.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">\u201c6. The required dependent premiums for the newborn children were not submitted to either DURA or [defendant] on or before October 27, 1989.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">In opposition to the motion, plaintiff denied that defendant\u2019s \u201cfacts\u201d Nos. 2 (the plan was self-funded), 3 (the plan terminated coverage for the newborn on the 32d day after birth unless the employee had designated the newborn as a dependent and paid the required premiums) and 6 (the failure to submit the required premiums) were undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">In addition, plaintiff asserted that the following material facts were disputed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">\u201c1. The group policy in effect at all relevant times was not the policy identified by Defendant in its moving papers .... Instead, the group policy identified as Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 1 [the earlier policy, ante] was the operative policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-13\">\u201c2. The operative group policy ... did not have a time period during which the insured must request dependent coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-14\">\u201c3. At the time the operative group policy . . . was in effect, Defendant . . . acted as an insurer because it was involved with spreading and underwriting risks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>\u201c4. As an insurer, Defendant ... is not protected by ERISA and is subject to the relevant provisions of the California Insurance Code which requires mandatory coverage for newborn[s] during the period that Defendant.. . denied coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">\u201c5. The Plan was insured and <em>not </em>self funded.\u201d (Italics in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In support of plaintiffs opposition, plaintiffs attorney submitted a declaration stating that the case \u201c[was] still in the discovery process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">At the hearing on the motion, the court stated it was ready to grant a continuance to allow plaintiff to engage in further discovery as to which policy applied and as to the relationship between defendant and Dura, in other words, as to whether defendant was acting as an insurer and therefore was subject to section 10119. Defendant\u2019s attorney responded that further discovery was unnecessary, and that he would concede, for the purposes of the motion, that the first plan applied and that section 10119 also applied. The attorney argued that section 10119 did not require the plan to insure newborns \u201cforever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Plaintiffs attorney responded that \u201c[there] are cases here in California that say[] if it\u2019s one continuous treatment or one continuous coverage that\u2019s requested after the moment of birth, then coverage is necessary and should be provided in such instances.\u201d The attorney said she would be \u201cmore than happy to provide ... the applicable cases that interpret [section 10119].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">The trial court took the matter under submission, and then issued a minute order which recited in relevant part: \u201cThe court\u2019s tentative decision on this motion is that even with the concessions made in open court, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment <em>except </em>that the issue raised by plaintiff during the hearing regarding continuous treatment requires additional points and authorities, [f] The court directs each party to furnish points and authorities on the issue of whether or not, because the new[]born twins were receiving continuous treatment from the date of birth, the coverage has to extend as necessary for that treatment without regard to any other requirement of the plan.\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">Thereupon, plaintiff furnished points and authorities in which it argued that hospital benefits were payable \u201cfor injury occurring within the policy period although hospitalization occurred after lapse of the policy,\u201d and that the hospitalization here \u201coriginated . . . during a period of coverage . . . [and] extended beyond the period of coverage.\u201d <em>However, plaintiff did not, as its attorney had promised the trial court, provide the court with any cases relating either to newborns or to section 10119.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>After defendant submitted points and authorities, the trial court issued a minute order which recited in relevant part: \u201cMotion for Summary Judgment is Granted. The court finds that the policy did provide access to insurance coverage, as required by Ins. Code 10119 [citing the first plan] . . . and plaintiff cites to no cases interpreting Ins. Code 10119, that hold[] that the statute is designed to cover extended illnesses of newborns \u2018even though\u2019 [the] insured did not elect coverage within the time specified for insurance coverage without proof of insurability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">A formal judgment reflecting the latter minute order was later entered in favor of defendant and Dura. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In our view, plaintiff in opposing the motion for summary judgment did not raise any triable issues of material fact. Thus our decisional task is to resolve the legal issues presented by the undisputed facts. In reference thereto, plaintiff contends first that Rivas\u2019s application for coverage for the newborns was timely and that the trial court erred in finding that she \u201cdid not request coverage within the required period.\u201d <em>The court made no such finding. </em>What the court did find, as noted, was that Rivas \u201cdid not elect coverage <em>within the time specified for insurance coverage without proof of insurability.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The finding was based on the provision, in the first plan, that, \u201cif you elect to cover your dependents more than 31 days after you first acquire a qualified dependent, you may be required to produce . . . evidence of insurability.\u201d In view of such provision, the trial court\u2019s finding reflected the undisputed facts, and plaintiff\u2019s contention to the contrary is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Without citing any supporting authority, plaintiff contends next that the foregoing requirement to produce \u201cevidence of insurability\u201d in any application made more than 31 days after the acquisition of a qualified dependent violates section 10119, because such requirement constitutes a prohibited \u201climitation of coverage relative to the . . . sickness coverage or insurability of newborn infants of an insured <em>from and after the moment of birth.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 10119, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The key question raised by such contention is the meaning of the phrase \u201cfrom and after the moment of birth.\u201d Plaintiff asserts that it means \u201cfor a prolonged and continuous illness . . . originating <em>from </em>the time of birth\u201d (italics added), and that it applies only to <em>\u201csick newborns.\u201d </em>(Italics in original.) Defendant, on the other hand, asserts that the phrase means \u201c[for] a reasonable 31 day . . . grace period during which the parents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>newbom(s) must take the steps necessary to add the newborn(s) to coverage,\u201d and, inferentially, that it applies to all newborns, healthy as well as sick.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In construing a statute, . a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves, giving to the language its usual, ordinary import and according significance, if possible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose. . . . [Citations.] Where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation. [Citation.] Both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].) \u201cStatements in legislative committee reports concerning the statutory purposes which are in accordance with a reasonable interpretation of the statute will be followed by the. courts. It will be presumed that the Legislature adopted the proposed legislation with the intent and meaning expressed in committee reports.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Paddock </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 355, 359 [95 Cal.Rptr. 652].) \u201cIn considering the words of a statute, an appellate court is required to read the statute in the light of the objective sought to be achieved by it as well as the evil sought to be averted.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carroll </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 581, 584 [83 Cal.Rptr. 176, 463 P.2d 400].)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Plaintiff contends that the language of section 10119 is \u201cplain and unambiguous,\u201d because it \u201cexpressly precludes any limitations relative to the sickness coverage of a <em>newborn </em>infant.\u201d (Italics in original.) According to plaintiff, \u201c[t]he [s]tatute does not require perpetual coverage of <em>any </em>infant. It merely restricts insurance companies such as Respondent from limiting coverage to <em>sick </em>newborns.\u201d (Italics on \u201cany\u201d added; italics on \u201csick newborns\u201d in original.) In other words, the statute requires perpetual coverage of a sick newborn <em>from </em>the moment of birth, but does not require any coverage of a healthy newborn who becomes sick at some undefined time <em>after </em>the moment of birth. However, while such an interpretation addresses the significance of \u201cfrom,\u201d it ignores the significance of \u201cafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Moreover, undesirable consequences would flow from plaintiffs interpretation. For example, an infant who was discharged from the hospital two days after birth and then had to return to the hospital the following day would not be covered, because the sickness was not apparent \u201cfrom the moment of birth,\u201d while an infant whose sickness was apparent at birth and who remained in the hospital for the same three-day period would be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>If we assume that the purpose of the statute was to provide coverage where no coverage existed (see <em>post), </em>and if we further assume that no coverage existed for a three-day-old infant, then the statutory coverage should apply to such an infant whether or not its sickness was apparent from the moment of birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">A further undesirable consequence of applying the statute only to sick newborns is that their parents would have no incentive to apply for coverage, while parents of healthy newborns who did apply for coverage would be unable to obtain it if their newborns became ill before the applications were processed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s interpretation is also undermined by the legislative history of the statute and the historical circumstances of its enactment. Section 10119 originated in 1971 from Assembly Bill No. 643, 1971 Regular Session. Assembly Bill No. 643 provided coverage only for \u201cnewborn infants of an insured,\u201d and did not contain any provisions for coverage of \u201cany minor child placed with an insured for an adoption.\u201d The statute was amended in 1987 (Assem. Bill No. 1822, 1987-1988 Reg. Sess.) to provide for such additional coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest of the original bill, Assembly Bill No. 643, <em>supra, </em>provides no guidance as to the meaning of \u201cfrom and after the moment of birth.\u201d An undated memo, furnished by the Legislative Research Institute and identified by the Institute as an analysis of Assembly Bill No. 643 by the Assembly Committee on Finance and Insurance, states in relevant part: \u201cThere is no law which states that insurers . . . must provide insurance coverage for newborn children of persons who have insurance coverage. <em>As a matter of practice, such coverage is usually offered when the child is one month old, but there is no coverage during his first month of life. </em>[IQ <em>This bill attempts to overcome that problem </em>and provides that any insurance policy for accident and sickness which covers a family and its dependents must also cover the family\u2019s newborn children from its <em>[sic] </em>moment of birth.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">A second undated memo furnished by the Legislative Research Institute and identified as an analysis of Assembly Bill No. 643 by the Senate Committee on Insurance and Financial Institutions states in relevant part: <em>\u201cAs a customary practice, accident and sickness insurance coverage is usually offered after the newborn child is two weeks to one month old, but there is no such coverage provided from the moment of birth.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The foregoing analyses show that the purpose of the bill was to provide coverage for the two-week to one-month period during which no coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>existed, irrespective of when, during such period, the need for coverage arose. Such purpose supports defendant\u2019s position that \u201cfrom and after the moment of birth\u201d refers to a 31-day grace period during which the insureds must apply for coverage of their newborns, and defeats plaintiffs position that the statutory phrase refers to perpetual coverage of any illness which was apparent at the moment of birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Plaintiff relies on a report from the Department of Public Health (the Department) which states in relevant part: \u201cThis legislation promises to make available better care for many newborns who are premature or afflicted with some problem that requires intensive care or prolonged hospitalization.\u201d Plaintiff argues that the foregoing statement shows that the newborns here, who were premature and required prolonged hospitalization, \u201cwere just the type of newborns that the [Ljegislature had in mind when it enacted \u00a7 10119.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">However, while we may and should consider statements in legislative committee reports about what the Legislature had in mind when it enacted the statute, we may not consider any such statement by the Department. (See <em>California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856] [\u201c \u2018In construing a statute we do not consider the motives or understandings of individual legislators who cast their votes in favor of it. [Citations.] Nor do we carve an exception to this principle simply because the legislator whose motives are proffered actually authored the bill in controversy [citation]; <em>no guarantee can issue that those who supported his proposal shared his view of its compass.' </em>\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 699-700, italics added.)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Moreover, even if we could consider the Department\u2019s statement, it would not have the import of the legislative committees\u2019 express and implied statements that the purpose of the bill was to provide coverage for the two-week to one-month period during which no coverage existed. (\u201cA legislator\u2019s statement is entitled to consideration, however, when it is a reiteration of legislative discussion and events leading to adoption of proposed [legislation] rather than merely an expression of personal opinion.\u201d <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 692, 700.))</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">In view of the legislative committees\u2019 statements here, which clearly are \u201ca reiteration of legislative discussion and events leading to adoption of proposed [legislation],\u201d to allow the statutory coverage to continue indefinitely for \u201csick newborns\u201d would defeat the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we hold that the unconditional coverage of a newborn infant in section 10119 extends for 31 days after the birth. We also hold that the provision in defendant\u2019s first plan requiring evidence of insurability in any application made after the 31-day period was not a prohibited \u201climitation of coverage\u201d under the statute. Accordingly, because there were no triable issues of material fact raised in the trial court and because the critical policy provision was valid as a matter of law, the trial court properly granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Defendant contends that it is entitled to attorney fees under ERISA. However, as noted, defendant conceded in the trial court that ERISA did not apply to plaintiff\u2019s claims and that such claims were governed by section 10119. Accordingly, defendant is not entitled to attorney fees under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The judgment is affirmed. Defendant\u2019s request for attorney fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Ramirez, P.
