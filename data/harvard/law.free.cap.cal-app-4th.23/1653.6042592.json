We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">Woodline Furniture Mfg. Co., Inc., which is owned by Yan Kats and his family, employs 131 people to manufacture oak furniture and upholstered chairs, to assemble furniture manufactured by others, and to handle ancillary clerical work. Until May 1992, Woodline\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance was provided by Pacific Rim Assurance Company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In early 1992, however, a dispute arose about Woodline\u2019s failure to pay premiums which Pacific Rim claimed were due and on May 2, 1992, Pacific Rim cancelled Woodline\u2019s coverage. Although Woodline made some efforts to obtain replacement insurance, it is undisputed that it remained uninsured for over six months, from May 3 through November 5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On November 25, State Fund issued a policy to Woodline, with an effective date of November 6, at 5:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1657\">*1657</page-number>Meanwhile, at 11:00 a.m. on November 6, Dennis Daily, an investigator with the Division of Labor Standards of the California Department of Industrial Relations, and Ed Sasaki, an auditor with the California Employment Development Department, went to Woodline for reasons unrelated to Woodline\u2019s compensation coverage. While he was there, Daily asked Kats for evidence of Woodline\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation coverage (as is standard practice whenever anyone from the Division of Labor Standards visits an employer for any reason). Kats said he had applied to State Fund for insurance but admitted he did not, at that moment, have coverage. As required by statute, Daily immediately issued a stop order (\u00a7 3710.1) and a penalty assessment in the amount of $100,000, the maximum allowable under section 3722.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The amount of the penalty was based on a computer printout provided by Kats, showing 131 employees on Woodline\u2019s payroll at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">While Daily was still on the premises, Kats telephoned State Fund to determine the status of his application. Before he left, Daily took the phone and gave the State Fund representative his Fax number, so that State Fund could transmit evidence of insurance if a binder was issued later that day (in which event Daily would lift the stop order and Woodline\u2019s employees could resume work). After Daily left, Kats had a $20,000 cashier\u2019s check delivered to State Fund and obtained telephone or Fax confirmation sufficient to satisfy Daily that State Fund had agreed to issue a policy which, in turn, permitted Daily to lift the stop order\u2014but not the penalty. On November 25, State Fund issued Woodline\u2019s policy, effective as of 5 p.m. on November 6. On December 7, State Fund issued an endorsement, changing the effective time of the policy from 5 p.m. to 12:01 a.m. on November 6. While the endorsement provided retroactive coverage for the hours preceding and including the time of Daily\u2019s November 6 visit to Woodline, it did not cover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1658\">*1658</page-number>or have any effect on the preceding six-month period during which Wood-line was uninsured (May 3 through November 5).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">In response to Woodline\u2019s request to the Director of Industrial Relations (the executive officer in control of the Department of Industrial Relations), a hearing was held on January 19, 1993, to consider Woodline\u2019s objection to the $100,000 penalty. (\u00a7\u00a7 51, 3725, 3727.1.) Kats, Daily and Sasaki testified before a hearing officer who thereafter found that Woodline had no workers\u2019 compensation insurance in effect at the time of Daily\u2019s November 6 visit; that State Fund insurance was obtained later that day; that Kats gave Daily a computer printout showing a total of 131 employees on the payroll as of November 6; and that Sasaki had counted approximately 80 employees actually on the premises during the morning hours of November 6. The hearing officer upheld the $100,000 penalty assessment, concluding the number of employees was properly determined by the information provided by Kats, not by Sasaki\u2019s head count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Woodline filed a petition for a writ of mandate, asking the trial court to set aside the penalty. The trial court denied the petition and Woodline appeals from the judgment thereafter entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Woodline contends the December 7 endorsement (making the State Fund policy effective as of 12:01 a.m. on November 6) relates back to November 6 and that, therefore, the penalty should not have been imposed because Woodline was insured on November 6. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">Under the plain language of the statute, the monetary penalty must be imposed at the time the stop order is issued, \u201cas an additional penalty <em>for being uninsured at that time.\" </em>(\u00a7 3722, subd. (a), italics added; see also \u00a7 3710.1 [the stop order, which is the condition precedent to the monetary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1659\">*1659</page-number>penalty, \u201cshall become effective immediately upon service\u201d].) At the time Daily issued the stop order, Woodline was uninsured\u2014and the subsequently issued endorsement is therefore irrelevant. If the Legislature wanted to permit an employer to avoid a penalty by obtaining retroactive insurance after issuance of a stop order, it would have said so. But it did not, and it is not our function to read into the statute a provision which is not there and which we do not believe the Legislature intended. <em>(In re DeLonnie S. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1114 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 43]; <em>Donald Schriver, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1986) 220 Cal.App.3d 396, 409-410 [230 Cal.Rptr. 620].) Furthermore, there are several additional reasons for rejecting Woodline\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">First, the fact that the effective date of an insurance policy is determined by the parties and can, by agreement, be any date before, at the time of, or after the delivery of the policy (12A Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (1981) Duration of Risk, \u00a7 7171, pp. 1-2), has absolutely nothing to do with a statutory penalty imposed at a time when there was, in fact, no coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Second, acceptance of Woodline\u2019s position would encourage noncompliance with the statute. If retroactive coverage could absolve an employer of responsibility for a previously imposed penalty, employers would have no reason to purchase insurance until their failure to comply with the law was fortuitously discovered and a penalty was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Third, Woodline\u2019s arguments conveniently ignore the fact that the retro-activity endorsement is for 17 hours (the period between 12:01 a.m. and 5 p.m. on November 6), not for the six months Woodline failed to provide coverage for its employees. From an equitable perspective, this would be a different case if there was anything in the record to suggest Woodline had at least tried to obtain retroactive coverage for the six months it was uninsured. As it stands, however, we have no need to decide whether we could base our decision on equitable considerations\u2014Woodline\u2019s failure to do equity resolves the issue in favor of the Division of Labor Standards.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Ephraim </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Trust Co. </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 824, 837 [172 P.2d 501] [he who seeks equity must do equity].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Fourth, the amount of the penalty imposed in this instance is roughly equal to the amount Woodline would have paid for coverage during the six months it was uninsured. When the State Fund policy issued, the estimated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1660\">*1660</page-number>annual premium was over $195,000\u2014which means a fine for half that amount is perfect justice. (See also \u00a7\u00a7 3715, 3716, 3722, subd. (a) [claims by employees injured while working for an uninsured employer are paid, in most instances, by the Uninsured Employers Fund and the $100,000 penalty imposed on Woodline was or will be deposited into that Fund].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Fifth and finally, we must consider the several purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u2014\u201c(1) to ensure that the cost of industrial injuries will be part of the cost of goods rather than a burden on society, (2) to guarantee prompt, limited compensation for an employee\u2019s work injuries, regardless of fault, as an inevitable cost of production, (3) to spur increased industrial safety, and (4) in return, to insulate the employer from tort liability for his employees\u2019 injuries.\u201d <em>(S. G. Borello &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Industrial Relations </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 341, 354 [256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399]; see also Herlick, Cal. Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook (12th ed. 1993) p. viii.) To these ends, section 3202 directs the courts to liberally construe the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cwith the purpose of extending [its] benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.\u201d  To relieve Woodline of its liability for the penalty imposed in this case would not further any purpose of the Act; to the contrary, it would permit Woodline to escape its responsibility for the premiums it should have paid for the six months it was uninsured as well as its responsibility for the penalty properly imposed. That is not an appropriate result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Woodline\u2019s remaining contentions are subject to summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">First, we reject Woodline\u2019s contention that the penalty should have been based on 80 employees (per Sasaki\u2019s head count), not on 131 (per Kats\u2019s computer printout), and thus set at $80,000, not the maximum $100,000. The statute fixes the penalty at $1,000 \u201cper employee employed at the time the order is issued and served\u201d (\u00a7 3722, subd. (a)), not on the number of people present at the time the penalty assessment is imposed. Woodline\u2019s own records showed there were 131 employees \u201cemployed at the time the order [was] issued and served.\u201d No more need be said.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1661\">*1661</page-number>Second, we reject Woodline\u2019s contention that the penalty ought to be set aside because it had done everything it could to obtain coverage, and it was merely through \u201can unfortunate coincidence\u201d that Daily visited Wood-line on November 6. As explained above (fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>Woodline was anything but diligent. Although the Pacific Rim policy was cancelled on May 2, it was not until June 18 that Woodline submitted an application to State Fund, and the application it submitted was wholly inadequate. Furthermore, the claim of \u201cunfortunate coincidence\u201d overlooks the fact that the same penalty could have been imposed on any day during the preceding six-month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">Third, we reject Woodline\u2019s contention that the penalty is so great as to constitute a violation of its due process rights. Woodline\u2019s assertion that a penal statute will be narrowly construed in light of its legislative intent <em>(Hale </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 388, 399 [149 Cal.Rptr. 375, 584 P.2d 512]) ignores the legislative intent of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act explained above. Woodline\u2019s claim that a small business may not be able to survive a substantial penalty ignores the fact that the penalty is no greater than the amount Woodline would have paid for coverage for the six months it was uninsured\u2014and also ignores the fact that an injured employee denied immediate access to no-fault compensation because an employer has violated the law may not be able to survive. In the scheme of things, the penalty fits the crime and there is no due process violation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Spencer, P. J\u201e and Ortega, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">Every California employer which is not permissibly self-insured must carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3700.) Unless otherwise stated, all section references are to the Labor Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">Although Woodline claims it \u201cdiligently and timely sought replacement coverage,\u201d the record suggests otherwise. It was not until June 6 that Kats contacted \u201can insurance person\u201d to inquire about coverage through the State Compensation Insurance Fund and it was not until June 18 that Kats finally submitted an application to the State Fund\u2014and that application was woefully incomplete. For example, Kats listed four categories of employees but failed to answer questions about the number of employees and estimated annual payroll for each category. State Fund had to twice ask for those numbers and for other missing information, including Woodline\u2019s coiporate records, business license number, loss history for the years 1987 through 1991, and so on. Although the record does not disclose when State Fund finally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1657\">*1657</page-number>received the final bit of missing information, it is clear that it wasn\u2019t until sometime after August 17. Insofar as Pacific Rim is concerned, the record discloses that during this same period Woodline attempted to resolve the dispute about how much was owed and by whom\u2014but the only reference to replacing the cancelled insurance policy appears at the end of a June 24 memo from Woodline\u2019s agent to Pacific Rim: \u201cAssuming Mr. Kats pays off the final audit, what will it take to have you re-instate [mc] the policy?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">Under section 3710.1, when an employer has failed to secure the coverage required by section 3700, a stop order must issue to prohibit the use of employee labor until the employer obtains insurance. The stop order is effective immediately upon service. Under subdivision (a) of section 3722, at the same time a stop order issues pursuant to section 3710.1, a \u201cpenalty assessment order\u201d must also be issued and served, requiring the uninsured employer to pay into the Uninsured Employers Fund the sum of $1,000 \u201cper employee employed at the time the order is issued and served, as an additional penalty for being uninsured <em>at that time.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Subdivision (d) of section 3722 sets the maximum penalty at $100,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Under section 460 of the Insurance Code, \u201cevery printed form of insurance contract\u201d is supposed to state an inception hour of 12:01 a.m. of the date upon which it is to be dated. We cannot determine from the record whether the December 7 endorsement was initiated by State Fund to conform to the Insurance Code or whether it resulted from Woodline\u2019s efforts to set the stage for its attack on the penalty. For this reason, we summarily reject Woodline\u2019s suggestion that the issuance of the endorsement by State Fund (which is one of six divisions of the Department of Industrial Relations) somehow estops the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (which is also a division of the Department of Industrial Relations) from ignoring the endorsement for purposes of enforcing the penalty. (\u00a7\u00a7 50, 56, 61; Ins. Code, \u00a7 11775.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Obviously, our decision is based upon the facts before us and we express no opinion about whether the result ought to be the same where, by reason of a retroactive policy, coverage is obtained for the entire period during which an employer was uninsured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">An injured employee of an uninsured employer may bring a personal injury action while at the same time pursuing workers\u2019 compensation benefits by an application to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board for payment by the Uninsured Employers Fund. (\u00a7\u00a7 3706, 3715, 3716.) Winning a lawsuit is not a particularly meaningful victory if the employer is unable to respond in damages, and we would venture a guess that an employer unable or unwilling to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance is more often than not unable to pay damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">We also reject the Division of Labor Standards\u2019 suggestion that Woodline\u2019s writ petition was improperly considered by the trial court because Woodline failed to post the bond required by section 3725 (when the Director of Industrial Relations refuses to set aside a penalty, the employer may file a petition for a writ of mandate in superior court \u201cupon the execution by the party assessed of a bond to the state in double the amount found due and ordered paid by the director\u201d). As permitted by section 995.240 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Woodline filed an application for relief from the bonding requirement. Although the trial court did not sign an order declaring Woodline indigent, the court did reach the merits of Woodline\u2019s claims, thereby effectively exercising its discretion to grant the requested relief. Under the circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
