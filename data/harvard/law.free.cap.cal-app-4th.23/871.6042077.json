Lee of the Los Angeles County Superior Court. In an unpublished memorandum opinion filed on August 24, 1993, this court reversed the judgment, ordering the trial court to enter an order of dismissal against, respondents for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. After this court denied a petition for rehearing, respondents filed a petition for review in the California Supreme Court. The Supreme Court by order filed on December 2, 1993, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>granted review and transferred the case to this court with directions to vacate our decision and to prepare and refile an opinion that meets the requirements of article VI, section 14 of the California Constitution. Accordingly, we vacated our memorandum opinion, granted leave for the parties to file supplemental briefs and set the matter for oral argument on March 3, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The appeal is based on two principal contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">1. No court has jurisdiction to consider the claims of respondents (plaintiffs) while the mandatory administrative claims process of the RTC has yet to be concluded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">2. One principal cannot be held liable by another principal for the torts of their joint agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">The action from which this appeal is taken was instituted by plaintiffs 2974 Properties, Inc., Edward L. Mosqueda and Rosalinda C. Mosqueda against Far West. Far West had made a mortgage loan to plaintiffs, who subsequently defaulted on the loan, and Far West brought foreclosure proceedings. Plaintiffs were the successful bidders at the foreclosure sale, bidding $126,900, well in excess of the unpaid indebtedness to Far West, which had been $85,316 at the time of the sale. Plaintiffs paid the proceeds of the foreclosure sale to Trust Services, Inc. (TSI), an independent contractor which had served as the foreclosure trustee. TSI neither paid Far West the $85,316 owing to it, nor the net proceeds to plaintiffs. TSI and its owners subsequently filed petitions under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">On December 21, 1990, plaintiffs brought an action against TSI and Far West for money had and received. Far West answered the complaint by denying liability, and cross-complained against TSI for conversion, indemnity, money had and received and for declaratory relief. On June 7, 1991, the federal Office of Thrift Supervision declared Far West insolvent, and on that same day, RTC was appointed receiver of Far West.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">Plaintiffs subsequently moved for summary judgment against Far West, arguing that there were no triable issues of fact in the case. RTC, as receiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>of Far West, opposed the granting of summary judgment, arguing that, as TSI was the joint agent of both Far West and plaintiffs, California law is clear that one principal cannot hold another liable for the acts of joint agents. RTC also contended that the entire action should have been dismissed because the plaintiffs had failed to file an administrative claim with the RTC, and that, pursuant to 12 United States Code, sections<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1441a(b)(4), 1821(d)(4), and 1821(d)(13), no court had jurisdiction to adjudicate plaintiffs\u2019 claim at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">On February 27, 1992, the court entered an order granting summary judgment against RTC in the amounts of $2,960.30, $465.32 and $39,260.57, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\n<em>Plaintiffs Failed to Exhaust Their Administrative Remedies, and Therefore the Court Below Did Not Have Jurisdiction to Decide Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">1. <em>The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery And Enforcement Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Congress created the RTC in 1989 in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, Public Law No. 101-73, 103 Statutes at Large 183 et seq. (FIRREA), as part of a comprehensive legislative response to the crisis that existed at that time in the savings and loan industry. (See \u00a7 1441a(b)(1).) One of the major functions of the RTC is to serve as receiver for a failed savings institution, with the power to liquidate its assets and pay the claims of depositors and creditors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">To provide a mechanism for resolving the claims of creditors of a failed financial institution as promptly and efficiently as possible, Congress enacted a mandatory administrative claims procedure, which is set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>section 1821(d)(3)-(d)(13).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute requires claimants to submit their claims first to the RTC, in its capacity as receiver for the failed institution, and, if the receiver disallows the claim, in whole or in part, the statute provides for de novo judicial review of the receiver\u2019s decision in the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The requirement to file an administrative claim applies in the case of pending litigation as well,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the filing of the claim either requires the dismissal or staying of the litigation until the administrative process is exhausted. No court, state or federal, has jurisdiction to adjudicate any claim against the RTC as conservator or receiver until after the RTC has reviewed the claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, and only thereafter, if the RTC has denied the claim, in whole or in part, does any court have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. In the interim, any pending lawsuit cannot go forward and must be dismissed as to RTC or at least stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In this case, plaintiffs, despite having received notice of the requirement to file such a claim, have not yet filed any administrative claim with the receiver. Because Congress, in section 1821(d)(13)(D), withdrew jurisdiction from all courts to hear claims against the RTC as receiver until after the claimant has exhausted the mandatory administrative claims process, and further, because Congress, in section 1821(d)(6)(A), restricted jurisdiction over suits in which claims have been denied to the United States District Court with jurisdiction over the principal place of business of the failed depository institution<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, plaintiffs may not pursue their claims in either the superior court or this court, and those claims must be dismissed as to RTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">2. <em>Congress Has Enacted a Comprehensive and Mandatory Scheme to Centralize the Resolution of Claims Against a Failed Financial Institution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">In FIRREA, Congress enacted a comprehensive and mandatory statutory scheme to enable the RTC, when acting as receiver for a failed financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>institution, to carry out its fundamental functions of conserving and preserving the assets of the failed institution, and ultimately making pro rata distributions of those assets to the creditors of the institution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In general, under sections 1821(c)(2)(A)(ii) and 1821(d)(2)(E), the receiver is responsible for the liquidation of the failed institution\u2019s assets.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The receiver must also prioritize the claims of depositors and creditors and make pro rata distributions of the proceeds of the liquidation, subject to the maximum liability provisions set forth in section 1821(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Further, to implement the substantive statutory provisions governing the validity, priority and amounts of creditor claims, Congress created a mandatory statutory procedure for the orderly and efficient processing of those claims. The administrative claims process, set forth in section 1821(d)(3)-(d)(13), provides a centralized mechanism for consideration and resolution of the bulk of claims against insolvent thrifts without the delay and expense of litigation, by requiring that all claims be submitted to the receiver within a finite time period, and by allowing the receiver the initial opportunity to review and resolve the claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The centralized claims procedure must be followed as a condition precedent to the maintenance and/or further pursuit of an existing judicial action by any failed depository institution\u2019s creditors and contingent creditors, and it is mandatory, irrespective of whether those claims arose or action thereon was commenced either prior to or after the institution of the receivership. \u201c[T]he overriding purpose for establishing these administrative procedures is to \u2018enable[] [the RTC] to dispose of the bulk of claims against failed financial institutions expeditiously and fairly.\u2019 [Citation.] Congress has determined that those administrative procedures are the most efficient way to resolve the hundreds of claims with which a receiver might be confronted.\u201d <em>(Tuxedo Beach Club Corp. </em>v. <em>City Federal Sav. Bank </em>(D.N.J. 1990) 737 F.Supp. 18, 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>3. <em>Because Plaintiffs Failed to Exhaust Their Administrative Remedies, the Courts Lack Jurisdiction to Consider Their Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Since plaintiffs have not filed a proof of claim with the receiver as of the date hereof, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs\u2019 claims; this is because section 1821(d)(13)(D) denies jurisdiction to any court, state or federal, to consider claims <em>except </em>in accordance with section 1821(d), and because section 1821(d) grants jurisdiction to certain courts only, and then in only two cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">a. Judicial review of the receiver\u2019s determination of the claimant\u2019s appeal if it seeks administrative review (\u00a7 1821(d)(7)(A)); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">b. Over suits filed or continued by a claimant following the receiver\u2019s denial of a claim, or the expiration of 180 days after the filing of a claim. (\u00a7 1821(d)(6)(A).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">By enacting section 1821(d)(13)(D), Congress <em>withdrew jurisdiction from all courts </em>to hear claims against the RTC as receiver, except as otherwise provided elsewhere in section 1821(d). That section provides, insofar as is here relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">\u201c(D) Limitation on judicial review. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, <em>no court </em>shall have jurisdiction over\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">\u201c(i) <em>any claim or action for payment from, </em>or any action seeking a determination of rights with respect to, the assets of any depository institution for which the Corporation [RTC] has been appointed receiver, including assets which the Corporation may acquire from itself as such receiver; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\">\u201c(ii) any claim relating to any act or omission of such institution or the Corporation as receiver.\u201d (Italics added.) (\u00a7 1821(d)(13)(D).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">The exhaustion of administrative remedies is mandatory when, as here, Congress imposes an exhaustion requirement by statute. <em>(Weinberger </em>v. <em>Salfi </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 749, 766 [45 L.Ed.2d 522, 539, 95 S.Ct. 2457]; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Corp. </em>(1938) 303 U.S. 41, 50-51 [82 L.Ed. 638, 643-645, 58 S.Ct. 459].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">Further, the relevant case law interpreting section 1821(d) confirms that completion of the claims process is a mandatory prerequisite to judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>review. (See <em>Meliezer </em>v. <em>Resolution Trust Co. </em>(5th Cir. 1992) 952 F.2d 879, 882; <em>Resolution Trust Corp. </em>v. <em>Elman </em>(2d Cir. 1992) 949 F.2d 624,; <em>FDIC </em>v. <em>Shain, Schaffer &amp; Rafanello </em>(3d Cir. 1991) 944 F.2d 129, 136; <em>Resolution Trust Corp. </em>v. <em>Mustang Partners, supra, </em>946 F.2d 103, 106 (per curiam).)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">As the Third Circuit found in <em>Shain, Schaffer, </em>\u201cCongress <em>expressly withdrew jurisdiction </em>to resolve claims to a failed bank\u2019s assets <em>from all courts, </em>except as provided in 12 U.S.C., \u00a7 1821(d). <em>See </em>12 U.S.C., \u00a7 1821, subd. (d)(13)(D). Thus, we have no jurisdiction to determine the status of [the defendant\u2019s] claim. Second, we noted recently that the administrative procedure exhaustion requirement of FIRREA is statutory, not judicial. [Citation.] We are therefore not at liberty to ignore the statutory command.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(FDIC </em>v. <em>Shain, Schaffer &amp; Rafanello, supra, </em>944 F.2d, at p. 136.) Finally, relevant case law confirms that exhaustion of the administrative claims process is required under section 1821(d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, unless a claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>has exhausted the administrative claims process, no court has jurisdiction to hear the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">In light of the foregoing, it is clear from both the express language of section 1821(d)(13)(D), and the cases interpreting it, that courts must not interfere in receivership claims until after the claimant has exhausted the administrative process. Adjudication by the trial court of plaintiffs\u2019 claim before that claim had been taken through the administrative process directly contravened the express provisions of federal law which mandate that the receiver evaluate a claim in the first instance without parallel jurisdiction being exercised in the courts. Until the administrative claims procedure is complied with, the trial court was without jurisdiction to act. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s granting of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment was erroneous and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In view of our opinion that the courts lack subject matter jurisdiction until plaintiffs comply with the mandatory exhaustion of administrative remedies under FIRREA, we do not decide the second principal contention on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The judgment granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court with directions to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>an order of dismissal against plaintiffs for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Costs on appeal are awarded to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Lillie, P. J., and Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 31, 1994, and respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 26, 1994. Mosk, J\u201e was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-11\">Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to 12 United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-12\">The legislative history states that the statutory powers granted in FIRREA were \u201cdesigned to give the FDIC [and RTC] power to take all actions necessary to resolve the problems posed by a financial institution in default.\u201d (H.R.Rep.
