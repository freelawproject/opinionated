He asserts the case must be remanded for resentencing because the trial court failed to state reasons for imposing consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">Jatindergit Singh testified that on February 15, 1992, he was working at a Quik Stop Store on Lei and Road in Pittsburg. He stated that two men\u2014one African-American, one Latino\u2014came into the store and took beer from the cooler. When Singh asked for money, the African-American man displayed a gun and asked, \u201c[y]ou want money or you want. . . .\u201d The men then left the store without paying. Singh identified appellant as one of the men. The incident was videotaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">Air\u00f3n Gauff testified that he too was robbed by an African-American man and a Latino man while working in a store on February 15, 1992. He testified that he was suspicious the men were attempting to steal beer and was watching them. Appellant came up behind Gauff, pulled out a gun and said, \u201cGive me the money.\u201d As the men left, appellant warned, \u201c[i]f you call anybody or if you come after me, I\u2019m going to get you.\u201d This incident also was videotaped; Gauff viewed the videotape at trial and identified appellant as the Latino man who robbed the store that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">The jury convicted appellant of two counts of robbery. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211-212.5.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury also found true the allegations that appellant personally used a firearm in connection with count 2 (\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)) and was armed in connection with count 1 (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">At sentencing, the court noted at the outset that it had read and considered the probation report, and that apart from two letters on an unrelated topic, it had not received any other matter relating to the sentencing. The probation report reflected that defendant had a criminal record dating to 1984, when a juvenile court petition alleging he had committed a burglary was sustained. In 1985, he was committed to a boys\u2019 ranch after a misdemeanor stolen property charge was sustained. Also, in 1985, he escaped from the facility. In April 1988, he was charged as an adult with burglary, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor burglary charge, was placed on three years\u2019 probation, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1683\">*1683</page-number>ordered to serve 120 days in county jail. In August 1988, in connection with an incident in which he repeatedly rammed another car at high speed until that car went into a ditch, he was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and drunk driving. He pleaded guilty to drunk driving. In February 1990, he pleaded guilty to resisting a police officer, and was sentenced to 220 days in jail. In March 1991, he was charged with battery, spousal battery, brandishing a firearm, possessing a concealed weapon, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery, and was sentenced to 75 days in jail. In March 1992, under unspecified circumstances, he was convicted of felony drunk driving, placed on four years probation, and ordered to serve four months in county jail. Defendant was on probation for this offense when he committed the robberies that led to the charges in this case. The probation officer noted that defendant, then 25 years old, had \u201ca well-established record of violent acting out behavior and continuous substance abuse,\u201d and noted that \u201c[ujnless he is restrained he will continue to be a danger to himself and to others.\u201d The probation officer noted defendant\u2019s poor performance on probation, and that defendant had been in frequent violation of court orders as a juvenile. The probation officer recommended a state prison sentence, but did not recommend any particular term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">At the sentencing hearing, after reaching agreement with the parties that defendant\u2019s use of a gun precluded probation, the court heard argument. The prosecutor asked the court to select aggravated terms on all counts, and to order those terms served consecutively, for the maximum possible sentence of 11 years. As had the probation officer, the prosecutor noted defendant\u2019s long criminal history and the increasing seriousness of the offenses he committed. In response, defendant argued for a lesser term based on defendant\u2019s dependence on alcohol and on the fact that defendant\u2019s accomplice had received a sentence of four years after pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">At the conclusion of argument, the court noted that defendant\u2019s offenses were serious, especially because he had used a gun, and stated that in view of those factors, defendant was not \u201centitled to any special leniency.\u201d The court then referred to defendant\u2019s criminal record, and though noting his record was not as serious as some, the court stated that \u201cthis man really does seem out of control.\u201d The court then said that its \u201csense under the circumstances is that this is not a man who deserves an aggravated term because this isn\u2019t an aggravated offense, but there isn\u2019t a whole lot of evidence by which a Court could find mitigation either.\u201d The court then sentenced defendant to the midterm on count 2 robbery, remarking that it was a \u201cgarden-variety\u201d robbery. With respect to the enhancement based on defendant\u2019s use of a firearm in the offense, the court imposed the midterm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1684\">*1684</page-number>sentence, noting that the offense appeared to be a \u201cgarden-variety-type, no mitigation, no aggravation-type use of the weapon.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the second robbery charge, the court imposed the midterm, and ordered that term served consecutively, but without specifying its reason for doing so. Finally, with the remark that it was at least \u201cone area of grace of discretion that I should give you in this particular case,\u201d the court struck an additional enhancing allegation under section 12022.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Section 1170, subdivision (c), provides that the court \u201cshall state the reasons for its sentence choice on the record at the time of sentencing.\u201d The decision to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences is a \u201csentence choice\u201d within the meaning of this section. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bejarano </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 693, 704 [173 Cal.Rptr. 71]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Reiley </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1487, 1489 [238 Cal.Rptr. 297].) An express statement of reasons is required to support such a choice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Whitehouse </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 479, 486 [169 Cal.Rptr. 199].) However, where the sentencing court fails to state such reasons, remand for resentencing is not automatic; we are to reverse the sentence only if \u201cit is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the [defendant] would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Avalos </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 216, 233 [207 Cal.Rptr. 549, 689 P.2d 121]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1634, 1639 [278 Cal.Rptr. 748].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">Appellant complains that, although the court generally discussed some of the factors relevant to its sentence choice, it failed to indicate which of these reasons was used to support its decision to impose a consecutive term for the robbery charged in count 1. Respondent concedes that the court \u201cdid not specifically designate any particular factor to support the imposition of a consecutive term,\u201d but contends the court\u2019s discussion of its reasoning was sufficient to support the one sentence choice (the consecutive sentence on count 1) that required a statement of reasons. Though we agree the court erred by failing to state a separate reason for consecutive sentencing, in view of defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history as set out in the probation report, we find it is not reasonably probable that the result would have been different had the court been reminded to state its reasons, and accordingly, we conclude there is no basis for reversal. However, before directly addressing that question, we treat defendant\u2019s claim that the <em>Watson </em>test for reversible error should not apply to a trial court\u2019s failure to state sufficient reasons for its sentencing choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1685\">*1685</page-number>Defendant suggests we should follow <em>People </em>v. <em>May </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 836, 839 [270 Cal.Rptr. 690], in which the court held that the \u201cappropriate harmless error test\u201d for failure to state adequate reasons for consecutive terms was whether \u201c[there is] a reasonable possibility that a statement of reasons would have altered the trial judge\u2019s conclusion or revealed reversible error.\u201d We decline the suggestion because in our view, <em>May\u2019s </em>adoption of that standard was based on an unthinking and mistaken reading of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">The vast majority of cases that apply an explicit harmless error standard for procedural error in the selection and statement of reasons for sentencing choices hold that an appellate court should not remand for resentencing unless \u201c ' \u201c \u2018it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of error.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 1638; <em>People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 492 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Avalos, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 233; <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 75, 79 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 572]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McLeod </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 585, 590 [258 Cal.Rptr. 496]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1090, 1096 [246 Cal.Rptr. 406]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 380, 392 [242 Cal.Rptr. 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Porter </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 34, 39 [239 Cal.Rptr. 269].) However, in a few cases, courts have stated the test for such error in the terms defendant suggests, that the appellate court should find the error harmless only if it appears there is no \u201c \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 \u201d the result would have been more favorable to the defendant if the error had not occurred. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1643-1644 (conc. opn. of Kline, P. J.); <em>People </em>v. <em>May, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 839; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1989) 209 Cal. App.3d 1075, 1086 [257 Cal.Rptr. 658]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Preyer </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 568, 577 [210 Cal.Rptr. 807].) Defendant relies on the latter group to support his claim we should apply a reasonable possibility standard here. However, we believe the courts that have expressed the standard in those terms have mistakenly adopted a test for prejudice which was devised for capital cases, and which is equivalent to the \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard applicable to deprivations of federal constitutional rights. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].) Because we find that standard inappropriate to cases involving ordinary sentencing error, we reject defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">It is established beyond question that with few exceptions, an ordinary criminal judgment may not be reversed for nonconstitutional error unless it is reasonably probable the result would have been more favorable to the defendant had the error not occurred. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13; see, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1686\">*1686</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Cahill </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 478, 487-493 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 582, 853 P.2d 1037].)  As we have pointed out, that standard has almost universally been applied to a trial court\u2019s failure to either select or articulate proper reasons for a noncapital sentence. Application of that standard to such error is appropriate; as one court put it in an oft-quoted phrase, courts are \u201cunwilling to engage in idle gestures or reach ridiculous results by slavish adherence to ritualistic form.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Blessing </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 835, 839 [155 Cal.Rptr. 780].) Where, as in this case, it is improbable that a lower court\u2019s sentencing choice would have been different if it had been reminded to state a proper reason, the constitutional provision forbidding reversal for insubstantial errors should apply, a conclusion which is reinforced by our Supreme Court\u2019s endorsement of that principle in <em>People </em>v. <em>Price, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at page 492 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Avalos, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at page 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">In contrast, on review of error occurring in the penalty phase of a capital case, a jury\u2019s judgment of death will be reversed if it is \u201creasonably possible\u201d that the jury might have reached a different result had a given error not occurred. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 432, 446-448 [250 Cal.Rptr. 604, 758 P.2d 1135] [rejecting specific challenge to reasonable possibility standard]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ashmus </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 932, 983 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 112, 820 P.2d 214]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 105, 136-137 [32 Cal.Rptr. 4, 383 P.2d 412]; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Crew </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1591, 1606 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 755].) The reasons for applying that stricter standard were explained at length in <em>Brown, supra, </em>in response to a specific claim that absent federal constitutional error, the proper standard for determining prejudice should be that announced in <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at page 836. <em>(Brown, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at pp. 446-447.) The <em>Brown </em>court pointed out that a capital jury does more than find facts in the penalty phase; it \u201crender[s] an individualized, <em>normative </em>determination about the penalty appropriate for the particular defendant\u2014i.e., whether he should live or die.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 448.) The court reasoned that \u201c[w]hen the \u2018result\u2019 under review is such a normative conclusion based on guided, individualized discretion, the <em>Watson </em>standard of review is simply insufficient to ensure \u2018reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In later cases, the \u201creasonable possibility\u201d inquiry has been equated with the \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d test applicable to cases involving deprivation of federal constitutional rights. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Heishman </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 147, 201 [246 Cal.Rptr. 673, 753 P.2d 629]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crew, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1605-1606; and see <em>Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. at pp. 22-24 [17 L.Ed.2d at pp. 709-711] [stating that there is little if any difference between the inquiry whether there is a reasonable possibility an error contributed to a verdict and requiring the beneficiary of the error to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1687\">*1687</page-number>prove it harmless beyond a reasonable doubt].) Such a standard is appropriate where sentence choice under review is between life or death. <em>(Caldwell </em>v. <em>Missisippi </em>(1985) 472 U.S. 320, 329 [86 L.Ed.2d 231, 239, 105 S.Ct. 2633] [\u201c \u2018the qualitative difference of death from all other punishments requires a correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capital sentencing determination\u2019 \u201d].) However, there is no basis in either the reasoning or the holdings of these cases for application of that standard in review of noncapital sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">In our view, the few cases which have applied the \u201creasonable possibility\u201d standard to such error are mistaken, probably because those courts failed to recognize any distinction between the two tests. <em>People </em>v. <em>May, supra, </em>illustrates the point. As here, the defendant in <em>May </em>contended the trial court had erred by failing to state proper reasons for consecutive sentencing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>May, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 838.) Without discussion, reasoning, or explanation, the court cited <em>People </em>v. <em>Heishman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 147, 201, for the proposition that the defendant was entitled to reversal if there was a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d the result would have been different had proper reasons been stated. <em>(May, supra, </em>at pp. 839-840.) However, <em>Heishman </em>is one of the many examples of the application of the reasonable possibility test to error occurring in the penalty phase of a capital trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the reasons we have stated, we find such cases do not support the proposition for which <em>Heishman </em>was cited in <em>May, </em>and a fortiori, that <em>May's </em>reliance on <em>Heishman </em>was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">For similar reasons, we also disapprove the few other cases we have found in which ostensibly apply the reasonable possibility standard to error arising out of a failure to select or state reasons for sentence choices. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Preyer, supra, </em>164 Cal.App.3d at page 577, the court announced that a failure to state proper reasons for a sentencing choice was harmless because \u201cthere [was] no reasonable possibility\u201d the sentence would be different on remand, but immediately cited <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at page 836 as authority for the proposition. <em>Watson </em>does not adopt the reasonable possibility test; accordingly, we believe the <em>Preyer </em>court did not intend the dis tinction it appears to make. <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at page 1086, quotes the passage from <em>Preyer </em>without additional reasoning, and therefore suffers from the same defect. Finally, because we do not agree that in every case, \u201c. . . there will always appear to be at least an even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1688\">*1688</page-number>chance that the court would have imposed the same sentence even without the error,\u201d we also decline to follow the reasoning of the concurring opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Guitierrez, supra. </em>(227 Cal.App.3d at p. 1643 [arguing that application of the <em>Watson </em>standard \u201ceviscerate[s] a legislative safeguard central to the DSL\u201d].) Unlike the choice between life and death, there is no quality of ordinary sentencing choices which would require us to ignore the constitutional command that we are to reverse a judgment only where there has been a miscarriage of justice, or in other words, where it is \u201creasonably probable\u201d the error affected the outcome. (Watson, <em>supra, </em>at p. 836.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">In sum, we conclude that those cases which have stated that a sentencing error in a noncapital case should be reversed if there is a reasonable possibility the result would be more favorable to the defendant on remand are mistaken. The correct test for harmless error in such cases is that announced in <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at page 836.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With that conclusion in mind, we return to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">As we have discussed, the court failed to give any specific reason for its decision to impose consecutive sentences. However, in view of the contents of the probation report, we find it improbable the result would have been different had the court been reminded to state its reasons for consecutive sentencing. Taken in context, the court\u2019s statements that defendant did not deserve the aggravated term and that the robberies were \u201cgarden variety\u201d appear to be explanations why it chose not to follow the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation for the aggravated terms, not evidence it would not have imposed a consecutive sentence had it been reminded to state its reasons. Given defendant\u2019s long criminal history, his execrable performance on probation, the escalating seriousness of his offenses, and the probation officer\u2019s and the court\u2019s observations that the defendant was out of control and a danger to the community, we conclude the court would not have sentenced defendant differently if reasons had been stated. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 425(b) [court may refer to \u201c[a]ny circumstances in aggravation or mitigation\u201d in deciding whether to impose consecutive sentences]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Bravot </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 93, 98 [227 Cal.Rptr. 810] [different result not reasonably probable where choice of consecutive sentence was supported by the record and consistent with court\u2019s view that defendant was a \u201c \u2018sociopath\u2019 \u201d and a \u201c \u2018menace to society\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1689\">*1689</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">Smith, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">Retired Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, First District, sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">All subsequent statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">A consecutive sentence on this firearm enhancement was required by statute.

This grudging conception of the role of appellate courts in the criminal sentencing process cannot be squared either with the determinate sentence law or the due process clauses of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">In my concurring opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1634, 1641 et seq. [278 Cal.Rptr. 748], I explained at length why a trial court\u2019s failure to state reasons for a sentence choice requires a remand for resentencing \u201cif there is a \u2018reasonable possibility that a statement of reasons would have altered the trial judge\u2019s conclusion or revealed reversible error.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1645, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>May </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 836, 839 [270 Cal.Rptr. 690], review den.) I need not reiterate that explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">My colleagues dispute my analysis on the ground that the cases I rely upon \u201chave mistakenly adopted a test for prejudice which was devised for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1690\">*1690</page-number>capital cases, and which is equivalent to the \u2018harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 standard applicable to deprivations of federal constitutional rights.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante </em>at p. 1685, citing <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].) The majority\u2019s distinction is both irrelevant and inaccurate. First, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the \u201cno reasonable possibility\u201d standard depends neither on the holdings in capital cases nor on the federal <em>Chapman </em>standard, but on a commonsense recognition that it is subversive of justice and substantive policy to sanction a class of error which, by its nature, insulates itself from appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">The majority commits a further mistake when it implies that the rule applied in capital cases is inappropriate for noncapital sentencing because of the obvious difference in the severity of the penalty and the nature of the rights affected by the outcome. The severity of the penalty is analytically unimportant because it cuts both ways. In civil cases involving no deprivation of liberty whatsoever, let alone the death penalty, the failure to provide a statement of decision where such an explanation is required is reversible per se. <em>(Miramar Hotel Corp. </em>v. <em>Frank B. Hall &amp; Co. </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 1126, 1129-1130 [210 Cal.Rptr. 114].) This strict rule is justified not only by the importance of the requirement that reasons be stated, both to the parties and reviewing courts, but because appellate insistence upon adherence to the legislative mandate that reasons be stated \u201cimpose[s] no substantial burden upon trial courts.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1129.) No reason appears why appellate courts should be more indulgent of the failure to state reasons for lengthening a prison term than they are for the failure to explain a ruling in a slip-and-fall case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">The majority wanders still further afield in its reliance upon cases involving review of a <em>jury\u2019s </em>decision to impose the death penalty. (Maj. opn. <em>ante, </em>at p. 1686.) A better analogy is presented by cases in which a capital defendant challenges the trial <em>court\u2019s </em>failure to state reasons for denying an automatic motion to modify the jury\u2019s penalty verdict. As noted in <em>Gutierrez, </em>however, those cases are inconclusive in the present context both because they reach inconsistent results and because the sentencing procedure in death cases is markedly different from that in noncapital cases. (227 Cal.App.3d at p. 1647, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Sheldon </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 935, 962-963 [258 Cal.Rptr. 242, 771 P.2d 1330]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1247, 1263-1264 [248 Cal.Rptr. 817, 756 P.2d 204], revd. on other grounds in <em>California </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 538 [93 L.Ed.2d 934, 107 S.Ct. 837]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Heishman </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 147, 200-201 [246 Cal.Rptr. 673, 753 P.2d 629]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 792-795 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1691\">*1691</page-number>As I pointed out in <em>Gutierrez, </em>the imposition of limits and controls on trial court discretion is one of the chief purposes of the determinate sentencing law. The requirement that the trial court state reasons for its \u201csentence choice\u201d is one of several statutory mechanisms for controlling judicial discretion in sentencing. <em>(.People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 1641.) \u201cThe Legislature undoubtedly believed that such a statement would (1) help to ensure meaningful review; (2) act as a guard against careless decisions; (3) encourage the trial judge to make sentencing choices systematically, in full recognition of the applicable considerations; and (4) \u2018presence] public confidence in the decision-making process by helping to persuade the parties and the public that the decision-making is careful, reasoned and equitable.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1641-1642.) The majority relieves trial judges of the need to comply with the statutory mandate on the basis of a highly speculative and subjective assessment as to whether compliance would likely result in a more lenient sentence, an issue unrelated to the reasons the Legislature required a statement of reasons. Compelling a trial judge to discharge the statutory responsibility to state reasons for a sentence choice may be thought unjustified where it would not likely make a difference in the sentence; but doubts about the effect of trial court compliance with the law cannot be resolved against the defendant without frustrating or compromising important legislative goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">I believe it is neither fair nor wise to speculate whether the trial judge in this case would impose a lesser sentence if the matter were remanded, and I have no opinion whether he ought to do so. It is enough for me that a lesser sentence is possible, in that (1) the offenses described in counts 1 and 2 were committed on the same day, suggesting a \u201csingle period of aberrant behavior\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 425(a)(3); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 609, 614 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 88], review den. [remand required where facts suggested single period; error not \u201cclearly harmless\u201d]); (2) the court stated that \u201cthis isn\u2019t an aggravated offense\u201d; (3) the court described at least one of the offenses as a \u201cgarden variety\u201d robbery; and (4) the court indicated an intent to be lenient; though, as the court was seemingly unaware, the enhancement the court purported to strike was statutorily proscribed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1692\">*1692</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">The majority\u2019s restrictive standard is problematical not only because it defeats the purpose of the sentencing statutes and conflicts with the better reasoned cases interpreting those laws, but because it creates a constitutional problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">The imposition of penal sanctions clearly implicates rights protected under the due process clauses of the California Constitution (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a); <em>id., </em>\u00a7 15). The California Supreme Court has held \u201cthat the due process safeguards required for protection of an individual\u2019s statutory interests must be analyzed in the context of the principle that freedom from arbitrary adjudicative procedures is a substantive element of one\u2019s liberty. [Citation.] This approach presumes that when an individual is subjected to deprivatory governmental action, he always has a due process liberty interest both in fair and unprejudiced decision-making and in being treated with both respect and dignity. Accordingly, it places front and center the issue of critical concern, i.e., what procedural protections are warranted in light of governmental and private interests.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 260, 268 [158 Cal.Rptr. 316, 599 P.2d 622].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">\u201c[Identification of the dictates of due process generally requires consideration of (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action, (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards, (3) the dignitary interest in informing individuals of the nature, grounds and consequences of the action and in enabling them to present their side of the story before a responsible governmental official, and (4) the governmental interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. [Citations.]\u201d (25 Cal.3d at p. 269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">Applying the foregoing principles, the Supreme Court had little difficulty in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>in holding that the Director of Corrections could not exclude an inmate from the California Rehabilitation Center, which resulted in a state prison sentence, without, among other things, providing the inmate a statement of the grounds for excluding him, \u201caccess to the information the Director considered in reaching his decision, and notice of the right to respond.\u201d (25 Cal.3d at p. 275, fn. omitted.) Similarly, in <em>In re Jackson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 501 [233 Cal.Rptr. 911, 731 P.2d 36], the court upheld prison procedures for administratively adjudicating disciplinary charges based on confidential information because Department of Corrections regulations required a hearing officer to personally make a finding on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1693\">*1693</page-number>the informant\u2019s reliability and truthfulness. The court observed, however, that due process requirements were met only if the disciplinary record \u201ccontain[s] information (confidential or otherwise) from which a reviewing court can conclude the hearing officer <em>actually made </em>a reliability and truthfulness determination, and that the determination is supported by evidence. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 516, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">If due process dictates that a state prison inmate excluded from the California Rehabilitation Center (CRC) or subjected to discipline must be provided a statement of reasons\u2014even though such a statement is not required to be given by statute\u2014how can an individual be denied a statement of the reasons for a consecutive sentence imposing additional prison time\u2014 which <em>is </em>required by statute? The private interest affected, personal liberty, is of the highest order. The risk of erroneous deprivation of that interest is bound to be diminished if the court is required to reveal the basis of the deprivation; a requirement that does not necessitate \u201cadditional or substitute procedural safeguards,\u201d but merely rigorous appellate enforcement of an existing statutory requirement. The \u201cdignitary interest\u201d in informing a criminal defendant of the reasons for his sentence should be obvious. \u201c \u2018The very essence of arbitrariness is to have one\u2019s status redefined by the state without an adequate explanation of its reasons for doing so. . . . [T]he respect for individual autonomy that is at the foundation of procedural due process imposes a distinct obligation upon the government to explain fully its adverse status decision.\u2019 [Citation].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 276.) Finally, no governmental interest is served by permitting a trial judge to dispense with the need to state reasons for a \u201csentencing choice.\u201d On the contrary, enforcement of this requirement is essential not only to permit meaningful judicial review and prevent careless sentencing, but to preserve public confidence that criminal sentencing is \u201ccareful, reasoned and equitable.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 437, 450 [229 Cal.Rptr. 131, 722 P.2d 905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">It is irrelevant to the due process analysis adopted by our Supreme Court whether imposition of the duty to provide a statement of reasons will likely result in a more favorable determination. As stated in <em>Ramirez, </em>even in cases in which giving the inmate a statement of the grounds for excluding him or her from CRC and an opportunity to respond \u201cis unlikely to affect the outcome of the decision, it nevertheless promotes important dignitary values that underlie due process. . . . \u2018Only through [oral] participation can the individual gain a meaningful understanding of what is happening to her and why it is happening. Moreover, providing the opportunity to react\u2014to register concern, dissatisfaction, and even frustration and despair\u2014is the best method to promote the feeling that, notwithstanding the substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1694\">*1694</page-number>result, one has been treated humanely and with dignity by one\u2019s government.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 275.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">I agree with my colleagues that the judgment of conviction must be affirmed.
