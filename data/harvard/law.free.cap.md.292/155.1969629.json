Vol., 1981 Cum. Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 640, a defendant convicted of a crime where property has been taken or damaged can, without his consent, be ordered to make restitution, not only to the owner of the property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>but also to a third party payor such as the owner\u2019s insurer, a private insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">On 25 June 1979, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, the appellant, Joseph Wesley Montgomery (defendant), pleaded guilty to one count of storehouse breaking. On 15 November 1979, he was sentenced to a term of five years. Execution of sentence was suspended and the defendant was released on probation for a period of five years. The defendant was ordered to pay restitution, in the amount of $862.30, to the Potomac Iron Works (owner), the owner of the property taken or damaged. In addition, the order said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">\"Restitution to Maryland Casualty Insurance Company Lowner\u2019s insurer] will remain open until proof of loss is presented to the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">On 13 May 1980, the State filed a \"Motion for a Restitution Hearing.\u201d The defendant filed a \"Motion Ne Recipiatur\u201d on the ground, among others, that the insurer was not a \"victim\u201d entitled to restitution under Art. 27, \u00a7 640. That motion was denied. On 7 July 1980, after a hearing, the trial court entered an \"Order for Restitution\u201d requiring that the defendant pay restitution, in the amount of $11,595.19, to the owner\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The defendant appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We issued a writ of certiorari before consideration by that Court. We shall affirm the judgment of the trial court except as to the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The relevant provisions then applicable of Md. Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol., 1980 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 640 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\"(b) . . . <em>Upon conviction for a crime where property of another has been stolen, converted, unlawfully obtained, or its value substantially decreased as a direct result of the crime, </em>or where the victim suffered actual medical expenses, direct out of pocket losses, or loss of earning as a direct result of the crime, <em>the court may order the defendant to make restitution </em>in addition to any other penalty provided for the commission of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">\"(c) ... When an order of restitution has been entered pursuant to subsection (b), <em>compliance with the order may be made as a sentence or condition of probation or parole.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">\"(d) ... (1) Restitution is made by the defendant to the division of parole and probation of the county in which he was convicted under the terms and conditions of the order for restitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">\"(2) The Division shall keep records of any payments or return of property in satisfaction of the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">\"(3) <em>The Division shall forward any property or payments to the victim of the crime.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">\"(e) ... <em>When a defendant fails to make restitution </em>as ordered, the Division shall notify the court. <em>The court may hold a hearing to determine if the defendant is in contempt of court or has violated the terms of the probation or parole.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\">\"(f) ... <em>An order of restitution may not preclude the owner of the property </em>or the victim who suffered personal physical or mental injury or out of pocket loss of earnings or support <em>from proceeding in a civil action to recover damages from the defendant. </em>A civil verdict shall be reduced by the amount paid under the criminal restitution order.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">While \u00a7 640 (b) establishes in part that under certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>circumstances the trial court may order restitution, it does not expressly designate the class of persons to whom restitution should be made where property has been taken or damaged. Section 640 (d) (3), however, specifies that property or payments made in satisfaction of an order of restitution shall be forwarded to \"the victim of the crime.\u201d Although the term \"victim\u201d is not expressly defined, there can be no question that an owner of property taken or damaged is a \"victim of the crime\u201d and, therefore, entitled to restitution. In the absence of an express definition of the term \"victim,\u201d whether the owner\u2019s insurer is \"a victim of the crime\u201d entitled to restitution remains unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the actual intent of the Legislature. In determining this legislative intent, the court may consider the statute\u2019s legislative history and should construe together and harmonize all statutory provisions relating to the same subject matter. In addition, the court must consider the statute\u2019s purpose. <em>State v. Loscomb, </em>291 Md. 424, 429, 435 A.2d 764, 767 (1981); <em>Unnamed Physician v. Commission on Medical Discipline, </em>285 Md. 1, 10, 400 A.2d 396, 401, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 868, 100 S.Ct. 142 (1979); <em>Frazier v. Warfield, </em>13 Md. 279, 301-02 (1859).</p>\n<p id=\"AE1\">A review of the legislative history of Art. 27, \u00a7 640 indicates that its purpose was to accord restitution exclusively to the owners of property taken or damaged. As early as 1809, the Legislature enacted Chapter 136 of the Laws of Maryland that provided that persons convicted of certain crimes \"shall restore the thing taken to the owner or owners thereof, or shall pay him, her or them, the full value thereof....\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That statute additionally provided two methods of enforcement in cases where immediate restoration or reparation was not fully made \"to the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>injured.\u201d The court could issue execution on the convicted person\u2019s property for the estimated value of the property taken,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the injured party could maintain a civil action for the recovery of the property or its value. Thus, the statutory scheme as originally enacted establishes that, in cases involving property taken or damaged, restitution was intended to be paid exclusively to the owner of the property who was the \"injured party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Essentially this same statutory scheme is still in effect today. For example, a person convicted of robbery \"shall restore the thing robbed or taken to the owner, or shall pay to him the full value thereof.\u201d Md. Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 486. Similarly, a person convicted of theft \"shall restore the property taken to the owner or pay him the value of the property and services.\u201d Md. Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol., 1981 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 342.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, until 1977, the mechanisms of enforcement remained the same. If restitution was not made to the \"party injured,\u201d the court could issue execution and the injured party could maintain a civil action for the recovery of the property or its value. Md. Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 637. In the absence of any expression of legislative intent to broaden the definition of the terms \"owner,\u201d or its contextual synonym \"party injured,\u201d the present statutes, like their predecessors, establish that the Legislature intended restitution to be made exclusively to the owner of the property taken or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>damaged, who is the \"party injured,\u201d and not to third party payors, such as private insurance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Section 640 of Art. 27, enacted in 1977 by Chapter 581 of the Laws of Maryland, effective 1 July 1977, expanded the applicability and enforcement of the previously existing law. This section was enacted \"for the purpose of providing that a court may order a criminal defendant to make restitution of certain losses sustained by a victim or certain property owned by a victim.\u201d It expanded the applicability of the statutory scheme by empowering the court to order restitution for losses, not only where property had been taken or damaged, but also where the victim had suffered physical injury. It expanded the enforcement of the statutory scheme by enabling the trial court to order restitution, not only as a part of the sentence, but also as a condition of probation or parole. In addition, upon a failure to make restitution, the court was authorized, not only to issue execution, but also to hold the convicted defendant in contempt of court or in violation of the terms of probation or parole. The right of the \"victim\u201d to proceed in a civil action to recover damages from the defendant remained unimpaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Although the addition of \u00a7 640 expanded the scope of the previously existing law, it did not alter the basic statutory scheme with respect to restitution for losses resulting from the taking or damaging of property. Indeed, the crimes for which restitution may be ordered where property is taken or damaged under \u00a7 640 are of essentially the same character as those for which restitution could be ordered under previously existing law. In the absence of an express definition of the term \"victim,\u201d and in the absence of any expression of legislative intent to broaden the definition of the term \"owner,\u201d or its contextual synonym, \"party injured,\u201d we can only conclude that the term \"victim,\u201d in the statute applicable here, is limited exclusively to the owner of the property taken or damaged and does not include third party payors, such as private insurance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">This conclusion is supported by the most recent amendment to \u00a7 640, enacted by Chapter 160 of the 1981 Laws of Maryland, effective 1 July 1981. That section, as amended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>expands the applicability of the statute by authorizing the court to order restitution \"if as a direct result of the crime, the victim incurred medical expenses that were paid by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene or any other governmental entity....\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">This amendment, in which the Legislature expressly differentiated between a \"victim\u201d and a third party payor, constitutes the only occasion upon which the Legislature has authorized courts to order restitution to a third party payor. It is important to note that in enacting this amendment, the Legislature did not authorize courts to order restitution to third party payors for payments made where property was taken or damaged, but limited restitution to third party payors for payment of medical expenses incurred as a result of personal injury. In addition, the class of third party payors to which restitution could be made was limited to governmental entities and did not include other classes of third party payors, such as private insurance companies. Under these circumstances, the maxim <em>\"expressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d </em>\u2014 the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another \u2014 applies. <em>Gay Inv. Co. v. Comi, </em>230 Md. 433, 438, 187 A.2d 463, 466 (1963). Stated another way, when a statute designates the parties granted a right, only such parties as are designated have the right and all omissions should be understood as exclusive. American <em>Sec. &amp; Trust Co. v. New Amsterdam Cas. Co., </em>246 Md. 36, 41, 227 A.2d 214, 216-17 (1967); <em>Thanhauser v. Savins, </em>44 Md. 410, 414 (1876); 2A, Sutherland, <em>Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 47.23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>(4th ed. C.Sands 1973). Thus, this amendment supports the conclusion that under \u00a7 640 the Legislature intended restitution for loss resulting from the taking or damaging of property to be made exclusively to the owner of the property and not to third party payors, such as private insurance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We now hold that under Art. 27, \u00a7 640 a defendant convicted of a crime cannot be ordered to make restitution to a third party payor such as the insurer of an owner of property taken or damaged. Such a result is consonant with the legislative history and purpose of \u00a7 640. Courts in some other jurisdictions that have considered the same or similar question under similar statutes agree. <em>See, e.g., People v. Grago, </em>24 Misc.2d 739, 204 N.Y.S.2d 774, 777-78 (Oneida County Ct. 1960); <em>State v. Stalheim, </em>275 Or. 683, 688-90, 552 P.2d 829, 832 (1976); <em>State v. Rose, </em>45 Or.App. 879, 609 P.2d 875, 876-77 (1980); <em>State v. Getsinger, </em>27 Or.App. 339, 341-42, 556 P.2d 147, 148 (1976). <em>But see, e.g., People v. Alexander, </em>182 Cal.App.2d 281, 6 Cal.Rptr. 153, 160-61 (1960); <em>People v. Bond, </em>99 Mich.App. 86, 87-89, 297 N.W.2d 620, 621 (1980); <em>State v. Green, </em>29 N.C.App. 574, 577-79, 225 S.E.2d 170, 173-74 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Here the trial court erred in entering the order of 7 July 1980 imposing the requirement, without the defendant\u2019s consent, that he pay restitution to the owner\u2019s insurer. Accordingly, we shall affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment except as to the sentence imposed and remand the case for resentencing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\n<em>Judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County affirmed except as to the sentence imposed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\n<em>Sentence vacated and case remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Prince George\u2019s County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-10\">.

I suspect strongly from some prior experience in such matters that there is a policy provision here specifically providing that upon payment to the assured of the damages which he has sustained, his claims against the culprit are assigned to his insurance company. If there is any doubt about this, the case could be remanded to determine that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">As recently as when the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund was created by Ch. 836 of the Acts of 1957, the failure to exclude subrogees was interpreted by bench and bar generally as permitting subrogation.

We have no similar exclusionary provision here. In the absence of such, I am of the view that the common sense understanding of the term \"victim\u201d would include an insurance company to whom the claim has been assigned by right of subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">I am authorized by Judge Digges to say that he concurs in the views here expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
