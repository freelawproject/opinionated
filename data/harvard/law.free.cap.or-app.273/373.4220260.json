Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a curative instruction regarding the prosecutor\u2019s opening remarks that \u2014 defendant contends on appeal\u2014 drew the jury\u2019s attention to defendant\u2019s invocation of her right to remain silent in violation of her rights under both the Oregon and United States constitutions. Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence that the arresting officer asked defendant questions about methamphetamine use, because defendant initially responded by invoking her right to silence. We conclude that the trial court correctly denied the motion <em>in limine </em>and that defendant did not preserve the argument she now makes regarding a curative instruction. We accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">After stopping defendant for traffic violations, Officer Smith became suspicious that defendant was driving under the influence of methamphetamine. On three occasions during the traffic stop, Smith asked defendant if she had used drugs that night. Each time, defendant explicitly asserted her constitutional right to remain silent, twice replying, \u201cI do not have to answer that,\u201d and the third time replying, \u201cI\u2019m exercising my right to remain silent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Before trial, defendant moved <em>in limine </em>to \u201cexclude three statements that [defendant] made to the officers,\u201d specifically identifying the statements quoted above. The prosecutor conceded that the statements were inadmissible, and the trial court granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The trial court and the parties also discussed other statements that defendant made later in the stop, after being taken into custody and read her <em>Miranda </em>rights. Those included the statements, \u201cThis was my last time, I won\u2019t do it again [,]\u201d and, \u201cJust give me a life lesson and let me take my car home, I\u2019ve learned my lesson.\u201d Defendant did not object to admission of those later statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Defendant objected, however, that the prosecutor\u2019s opening statements described defendant\u2019s later statements in a way that suggested a false chronology \u2014 that defendant made her inculpatory statements immediately after Smith asked his questions about drug use. Defendant proposed a curative instruction on that point, but the trial court denied the request. Defendant assigns error to that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying a curative instruction because the prosecutor\u2019s comment improperly \u201chighlighted\u201d defendant\u2019s initial silence when asked about methamphetamine use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That is not the nature of the objection and need for curative instruction that defendant asserted at trial, however. The opening comment that prompted defendant\u2019s objection was the prosecutor\u2019s statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\u201cOfficer Smith asked her point-blank, \u2018Did you use meth?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\u201cDefendant responded, \u2018Just give me a life lesson and let me take my car home. I learned my lesson.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">\u201cYou may be thinking to yourself, if someone [inaudible] under the influence for driving under the influence of methamphetamine is told that and asked, \u2018Did you use meth?\u2019, the right answer would be \u2018no.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Defendant objected during the statement and, after opening statements, explained that her objection was to the \u201cmischaracterization\u201d of the chronology:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">\u201cI believe that it is inaccurate to portray that her answer was that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">\u00absf; \u00edj\u00ed ij: <em>% </em>sf:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">\u201cThat was not her answer. Her answer was, \u2018I\u2019m exercising my right to remain silent.\u2019 She then just spontaneously asked that. So I believe that I am objecting to that as a mischaracterization of what the evidence \u2014 I believe the evidence is going to show, and that\u2019s not \u2014 we need to figure out a way to elicit that testimony * * * from Officer Smith in a way that actually is accurate of the conversation those two had.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The trial court understood that defendant was objecting to the suggestion of a false chronology and responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">\u201cI think the easy way to do that is just simply to say that [defendant] volunteered the statement, because it does infer that the answer was responsive to the question whether or not you used methamphetamine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Defense counsel agreed with the court\u2019s proposal for handling the testimony but requested \u201csome sort of\u201d a curative instruction because \u201cthe way that it was phrased in opening was that that was her response, and that just was not her response.\u201d The trial court declined to fashion a specific curative instruction, concluding that defendant\u2019s concern would be addressed effectively by the general instruction that \u201copening statements and closing arguments of the lawyers are not evidence * *</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Defendant does not argue on appeal that she was entitled to a specific curative instruction regarding the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cmischaracterization\u201d of the chronology, and she did not argue below that the opening statement warranted a curative instruction regarding her constitutional right to remain silent. Nor does defendant suggest that we should review for \u201cplain error\u201d the court\u2019s failure to give such an instruction <em>sua sponte. </em>We do not reach the unpreserved claim of error. <em>See State v. Ardizzone, </em>270 Or App 666, 673, 349 P3d 597 (2015) (\u201c[W]e ordinarily will not proceed to the question of plain error unless an appellant has explicitly asked us to do so because fit is incumbent upon the appellant to explain to us why an error satisfies the requisites of plain error and, further, why we should exercise our discretion to correct that error.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>State v. Tilden, </em>252 Or App 581, 589, 288 P3d 567 (2012).)).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Defendant also assigns error to the \u201cdenial of her motion <em>in limine\u201d </em>As set out above, the trial court <em>granted </em>defendant\u2019s pretrial motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude defendant\u2019s \u201cstatements.\u201d Defendant argues, however, that she \u201cclarified\u201d her motion <em>in limine </em>during the colloquy following the opening statements and that the trial court erroneously denied that expanded motion. After a detailed discussion with the judge about how the prosecutor should elicit Smith\u2019s testimony to avoid either suggesting a false chronology or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>disclosing defendant\u2019s initial statements invoking her right to silence, defendant argued that the evidence of Smith\u2019s questions should also be excluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">\u201cI just don\u2019t even think that they can \u2014 if the State asks, Did you ask [defendant] if she had [used] methamphetamine? Yes. And I just think * * * it\u2019s going to be too difficult to differentiate for the jury that she \u2014 that statement was unrelated to it. * * * Her response to it is inadmissible, to all three times the question was asked. * * * And so I just don\u2019t even know how the question even comes in, because it leaves too much for the jury to speculate on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The state responded that the officer\u2019s question provided relevant context for defendant\u2019s later, voluntary statements because it shows that those statements were made after having been \u201crepeatedly confronted with the officer\u2019s suspicion about methamphetamine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cI understand your objection clearly. And I\u2019m concerned about that statement in isolation, in the awkward way in which I\u2019m allowing the State to introduce the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u201cBut from my perspective * * * I think that the officer needs to be able to say, and the State has a right to say that the officer at that point in the investigation believed that the controlled substance was methamphetamine. * * * [T]he state needs to be able to demonstrate that the officer at that point believed that, and the way they demonstrate that is by * * * introducing the officer\u2019s statement that [she] asked [defendant] whether or not she was under the influence of methamphetamine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201cNow, having said that, because the next statements are redacted by the Court as an invocation, as long as it\u2019s made clear to the jury that the next statement that\u2019s admissible, that volunteered statement, was clearly a volunteered statement, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s unduly prejudicial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">That is the ruling defendant challenges as a denial of her motion <em>in limine.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Defendant correctly emphasizes that both the Oregon Constitution and the United States Constitution preclude a prosecutor from drawing the jury\u2019s attention to a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to remain silent. <em>State v. White, </em>303 Or 333, 340-41, 736 P2d 552 (1987) (citing <em>State v. Wederski, </em>230 Or 57, 61-62, 368 P2d 393 (1962) (stating rule under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution) and <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 US 609, 615, 85 S Ct 1229, 14 L Ed 2d 106 (1965) (stating same rule under United States Constitution)). \u201cWhether a prosecutor improperly comments on a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent is a question of law that we review for legal error.\u201d <em>State v. Reineke, </em>266 Or App 299, 307, 337 P3d 941 (2014) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Defendant relies on our decision in <em>State v. Ragland, </em>210 Or App 182, 149 P3d 1254 (2006), to argue that the trial court should have granted her \u201cclarified\u201d motion <em>in limine. </em>In <em>Ragland, </em>during an investigation for DUII, the defendant invoked her right to counsel, which also implicated her right to remain silent. 210 Or App at 184, 187. On direct examination, the defendant testified that she had consumed beer in an area off the highway, left some beer in the woods, and then returned to the car to sleep, which is where the investigating officer found her. <em>Id. </em>at 184. During cross-examination of the defendant, the prosecutor emphasized that the defendant failed to tell those details to the investigating officer. <em>Id. </em>at 185. Defense counsel repeatedly objected to that line of questioning on Fifth Amendment grounds, and the trial court overruled the objections. <em>Id. </em>at 185-86. Finally, during closing argument, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201cWouldn\u2019t a reasonable person, if there was an alternative explanation for what was going on that night, <em>especially after you were told you were being arrested </em>for Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants, say, \u201cHey, there\u2019s also some beer about 30 feet over there. If you go look, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been drinking.\u2019\u201d\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 186 (emphasis in <em>Ragland). </em>The defendant objected, and the trial court overruled the objection. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">We reversed because, \u201cby posing questions about why defendant had not told the officer certain information [,] \u2018especially after you were told you were being arrested,\u2019 the prosecutor indirectly commented on defendant\u2019s post-invocation silence and invited the jury to draw prejudicial inferences from that silence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187-88. Defendant argues that here, as in <em>Ragland, </em>telling the jury that Smith questioned defendant about methamphetamine use indirectly told the jury that defendant refused to answer those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In <em>Ragland, </em>however, we emphasized that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s comment on defendant\u2019s silence was not merely incidental. Rather, the reference to defendant\u2019s post-invocation silence \u2014 and the concomitant invitation to draw a prejudicial inference from that silence \u2014 were the striking points of the prosecutor\u2019s credibility attack on defendant\u2019s account at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191. We contrasted the prosecutor\u2019s questioning and comments regarding the defendant\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d in <em>Ragland </em>with other cases in which a prosecutor commented upon what a defendant \u201csaid\u201d after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Id. </em>at 190 (citing <em>State v. Attebery, </em>39 Or App 141, 591 P2d 409, <em>rev den, </em>286 Or 449 (1979); <em>State v. Pickett, </em>37 Or App 239, 586 P2d 824 (1978)). Here, the state relies upon that same distinction and points out that the prosecutor proposed to elicit evidence as to what defendant said after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and not her invocation of silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">We agree with the state. In <em>Attebery, </em>the defendant told investigating detectives that he had an alibi, but provided no details of the alibi. 39 Or App at 144. During trial, in order to suggest that the defendant\u2019s alibi was concocted later, the prosecutor commented on the defendant\u2019s failure to provide any detail about the alibi to the investigating officers. <em>Id. </em>at 146. We concluded the prosecutor made the comment for a legitimate purpose \u2014 to provide context for the defendant\u2019s suggestion that he had provided an alibi from the outset \u2014 and that the comment emphasized what the defendant said when he talked rather than an exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the constitutional privilege not to talk. <em>Id. </em>at 147. Here, as <em>in Attebery, </em>the state proposed to describe Smith\u2019s questions about methamphetamine use as a way to provide context for what defendant said when she decided to talk.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Moreover, we have held that even a prosecutor\u2019s reference to a defendant\u2019s exercise of the constitutional right to remain silent does not necessarily deny a fair trial if the context is \u201csuch that the jury\u2019s attention is directed away from the adverse inference of guilt based on the invocation.\u201d <em>State v. Veatch, </em>223 Or App 444, 456, 196 P3d 45 (2008); <em>see also State v. Smallwood, </em>277 Or 503, 505-06, 561 P2d 600, <em>cert den, </em>434 US 849 (1977) (\u201cThere is no doubt that it is usually reversible error to admit evidence of the exercise by a defendant of the rights which the constitution gives him if it is done in a context whereupon inferences prejudicial to the defendant are likely to be drawn by the jury.\u201d). The trial court correctly concluded that the evidence had relevance apart from suggesting an inference of guilt and could be presented without drawing the jury\u2019s attention to an adverse inference that defendant initially asserted her right to remain silent. <em>See Veatch, </em>223 Or App at 456; <em>Attebery, </em>39 Or App at 147. The court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion and admitting the statements for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u2022Nevertheless, by denying her motion <em>in limine, </em>defendant argues, the trial court allowed the prosecutor to highlight defendant\u2019s silence in ways that prejudiced her right to a fair trial. Specifically, defendant identifies the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal examination of Smith and a comment during closing argument that, even if unintended, could be interpreted as commenting on defendant\u2019s initial silence \u2014 as opposed to simply describing the context for defendant\u2019s later voluntary statements. Defendant did not separately object to either the rebuttal examination or the closing argument, however, and assigns error only to the denial of her motion <em>in limine. </em>That procedural posture frames our inquiry, and \u201cthe scope of the record on review is limited to the record before the trial court when it made the challenged ruling.\u201d <em>State v. Beauvais, </em>357 Or 524, 532, 354 P3d 680 (2015) (citations omitted). At the point when the trial court made the ruling that defendant challenges here, defendant had objected to evidence of the three statements defendant made when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>she asserted her right to silence and to evidence that Smith asked defendant if she was under the influence of methamphetamine. The court\u2019s rulings as to that evidence were not in error. To the extent defendant now challenges comments during trial as independently objectionable or beyond the scope of the motion <em>in limine </em>ruling, that challenge is not preserved. <em>See State v. Williams, </em>322 Or 620, 630 n 14, 912 P2d 364 (1996) (\u201cOn review, defendant may not expand the scope of his objection at trial to make it apply to another portion of the prosecutor\u2019s argument.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-12\"> We do not address whether the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement is susceptible to that interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-11\"> We consider this assignment of error adequately preserved because it appears the trial court understood that defendant believed evidence of the officer\u2019s questions should be inadmissible under the same law that made defendant\u2019s silence inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\"> With respect to a prosecutor\u2019s comments on defendant\u2019s invocation of the right to silence, the analysis under the state and federal constitutions appears identical, and defendant does not argue otherwise. <em>See State v. Larson, </em>325 Or 15, 22-23, 933 P2d 958 (1997) (applying similar principles under the state and federal constitutions to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comment on defendants failure to testify was improper).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
