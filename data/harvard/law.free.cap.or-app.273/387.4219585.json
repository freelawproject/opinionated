ORS 813.010. On appeal, defendant claims, and the state concedes, that the trial court committed plain error by imposing court-appointed attorney fees because the record contains no evidence that defendant \u201cis or may be able\u201d to pay the fees. <em>See </em>ORS 151.505(3) (\u201cThe court may not require a person to pay costs under this section unless the person is or may be able to pay the costs.\u201d); ORS 161.665(4) (\u201cThe court may not sentence a defendant to pay costs under this section unless the defendant is or may be able to pay them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We agree with the parties that the trial court committed plain error by imposing the fees. <em>See State v. Coverstone, </em>260 Or App 714, 716, 320 P3d 670 (2014) (holding that a trial court commits plain error by imposing court-appointed attorney fees where the record is silent as to the defendant\u2019s ability to pay the fees). We further conclude that, for the reasons articulated in <em>Coverstone, </em>it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
