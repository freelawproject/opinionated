Petitioner claimed that his plea was not voluntary because the prosecutor had threatened \u2014 if petitioner did not enter a guilty or no-contest plea \u2014 to prosecute petitioner\u2019s family members for witness tampering and to secure a judgment against petitioner\u2019s daughter for the $150,000 security amount associated with petitioner\u2019s release. The post-conviction court denied relief after determining, first, that petitioner had not proved that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct and, second, that petitioner\u2019s plea was \u201cknowing and volunt[ary], not coerced.\u201d On appeal, petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred in denying relief because he \u201conly accepted the plea offer to protect his family from prosecution\u201d and to avoid subjecting his daughter to a $150,000 judgment. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the post-conviction court did not err in determining that petitioner\u2019s plea was not impermissibly coerced. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u201cWe review post-conviction proceedings for legal error\u201d and \u201care bound by the post-conviction court\u2019s findings of fact if there is evidence in the record to support them.\u201d <em>Clark v. State of Oregon, </em>267 Or App 544, 549, 340 P3d 757 (2014), <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 143 (2015). When the post-conviction court has not made explicit findings resolving all of the parties\u2019 factual disputes, we presume that the court implicitly resolved those facts \u201cconsistently with its ultimate conclusion,\u201d so long as the implicit factual findings are supported by the record. <em>Pereida-Alba v. Coursey, 356 Or 654, </em>670-71, 342 P3d 70 (2015). We describe the pertinent facts in accordance with those standards of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">A. <em>Events leading up to petitioner\u2019s no-contest plea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">One morning in October 2006, ML, the victim in the underlying criminal case, called police to report that petitioner had held her against her will, in her bedroom, from early the previous evening until daybreak that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>morning, when she had escaped. ML described a prolonged and severe physical attack that included beating with fists, a belt, and a table leg, as well as strangulation to the point of unconsciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrested petitioner the next day. After being read his <em>Miranda </em>rights and acknowledging that he understood them, petitioner said that he \u201cwasn\u2019t there,\u201d was not \u201ceven in town\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t touch her.\u201d During an interview the following day, petitioner again denied that he had been at ML\u2019s home on the night of the reported assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In December 2006, ML told a deputy sheriff that petitioner \u201chad called her from jail requesting she call the District Attorney and say the assault never happened.\u201d She also asserted that petitioner\u2019s family members had \u201ccalled numerous times trying to get her to drop charges so [petitioner] could get out of jail.\u201d The deputy then listened to recordings of two phone calls that petitioner had made to ML from the jail on one day in November. In one call, petitioner asked ML \u201cseveral times to call or write the District Attorney and state the assault never happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Petitioner subsequently was indicted on multiple felony and misdemeanor charges associated with the October 2006 attack. At some point, the court set a security amount of $150,000, and petitioner was released after his daughter posted a $15,000 deposit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties engaged in plea negotiations in the months leading up to the July 2007 trial; the prosecutor made at least two offers, but the parties did not reach any agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">During a conference with the lawyers on the first day of trial, the court indicated its understanding that the state planned to file a \u201ctampering with a witness\u201d charge against petitioner. The prosecutor, Forster, said that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>not yet filed that charge, but that the state was preparing for petitioner to be arraigned on the charge later that day.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Before the jury was seated, Forster moved the court for an order holding ML as a material witness. Forster asserted that, although ML had cooperated with detectives up until the Friday before the date set for trial, she had refused to cooperate with the state since then. The court explained the state\u2019s request to ML, who was present at the courthouse. ML said that she wanted to \u201camend [her] story\u201d and asked the court if that would result in her going to jail. The court explained that the district attorney, not the court, would decide whether ML should be arrested if she changed her story. The court indicated that it would appoint counsel for ML and told her to remain in the courthouse until her attorney arrived. <em>Voir dire </em>took up the remainder of that court day.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In their opening statements, both Forster and petitioner\u2019s defense attorney, Scales, discussed how ML\u2019s description of the October 2006 events had changed over time. The state then began its case by playing a recording of a 9-1-1 call that had been made immediately following the alleged assault. Next, the state called a witness who testified that she had seen ML crying and barefoot on the morning after the attack, saying that \u201cshe needed to call the cops because [petitioner] was beating on her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The state\u2019s next witness was ML, who acknowledged that she did not want to be in court and was appearing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>response to a subpoena. After questioning ML about various events that occurred between the October incident and the start of trial, Forster asked ML about her initial reports to police about the attack. ML testified that she had then \u201cadded more to the story than what really did happen\u201d between her and petitioner. Forster asked ML if she had \u201cadded on\u201d the part about petitioner beating her with a belt, and ML said no, and she implicitly acknowledged that petitioner had done that. ML then testified that petitioner had put his hands over her nose and mouth, and said that she had not exaggerated that part of her report to police. Similarly, ML testified that she had not been exaggerating when she reported that petitioner hit her all over her head and body many times; nor had she exaggerated when she reported that petitioner wrapped a bandana around her neck, tried to choke her, kicked her, and said that he was going to kill her. But ML testified that petitioner had not beaten her with a table leg. She said that she initially had accused petitioner of that because she \u201cwanted him to hurt like [she] hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The court took a lunch recess after ML gave that testimony. Scales then informed the court that the parties had reached a plea agreement. The court was presented with a signed plea petition in which petitioner pleaded no contest to charges of attempted murder, first-degree kidnapping, and second-degree assault. The court read the petition and asked petitioner whether he had had a chance to review it with his attorney. Petitioner said that he had. The court reiterated the rights that petitioner was waiving by entering a no-contest plea, and petitioner indicated his understanding. Petitioner also responded, \u201cNo,\u201d when asked whether anybody had made \u201cany threats or promises to [him] other than this negotiation to enter this plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">At that point, the court indicated that some promises had been made that would be placed on the record. Forster agreed and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">\u201c [T]he agreement at this point is that * * * [petitioner] agrees to waive any right to appeal. The State has agreed that we will dismiss all other charges that are currently pending against [petitioner]. We will also dismiss [proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>against defendant in other cases]. We will agree not to file any other charges against [petitioner] with regards to Tampering or anything like that. * * * We\u2019re agreeing to the ones that are charged or anything relating to this incident and this victim, [ML]. Um, we have agreed with [petitioner] that we will not proceed with any charges against [petitioner\u2019s sister, daughter, mother], or anybody else involved in this case that was involved in tampering with [ML]. * * * We will not be requesting a judgment against [petitioner\u2019s daughter] for the $135,000 balance on the bail that was posted by [her].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">After engaging in further colloquy with petitioner, the court accepted petitioner\u2019s no-contest plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">B. <em>The post-conviction proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Petitioner challenged the voluntariness of his plea in a post-conviction proceeding that he initiated in 2009. In his second amended petition for post-conviction relief, petitioner alleged, among other things, that he had entered a \u201ccoerced plea\u201d because the state had threatened witnesses. Specifically, he claimed that prosecutors had threatened to arrest members of petitioner\u2019s family for witness tampering if petitioner did not plead guilty; he also claimed that Forster had threatened to \u201cgo after\u201d petitioner\u2019s family members \u201cfor the full amount of the $150,000 bail.\u201d Petitioner presented evidence in support of that claim during the post-conviction proceeding, including testimony from his mother, who asserted that Forster had threatened petitioner\u2019s family members with arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">In response, defendant superintendant argued that Forster had not threatened ML or petitioner\u2019s family members, but had \u201cmerely informed witnesses that they could face perjury charges if they lied under oath at petitioner\u2019s criminal trial.\u201d The superintendent submitted a transcript of Forster\u2019s deposition testimony, in which she took care to distinguish between, first, conversations she acknowledged having had with potential witnesses about the consequences of perjury and, second, any threats of bringing tampering-with-witness charges against petitioner\u2019s family members \u2014 which she denied having made. Forster acknowledged that she believed that petitioner\u2019s family members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>had committed witness tampering and that she still could \u201cproceed against that family for tampering with the witness\u201d if she wanted to.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She also acknowledged that she had told Scales as much. However, Forster emphasized that her decision whether to charge petitioner\u2019s family members \u201chad nothing to do with [petitioner] pleading.\u201d Thus, Forster specifically denied petitioner\u2019s claims that she had threatened to charge his family members with witness tampering if petitioner \u201cdidn\u2019t plead\u201d; she also denied having \u201cma[d]e it known\u201d that she would have petitioner\u2019s family members arrested for witness tampering unless defendant entered a guilty or no-contest plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">With respect to the $150,000 security agreement, Forster acknowledged that she had told petitioner\u2019s daughter that she would petition the trial court for forfeiture of the full $150,000 in security \u201cbecause [petitioner] had violated the [release agreement] by tampering while he was in jail.\u201d If Forster filed a witness-tampering charge against defendant based on that action, she explained further, she \u201ccould ask for forfeiture on the bail.\u201d Forster acknowledged having explained to petitioner\u2019s daughter that any judgment for the forfeited security amount would have been entered as a judgment against her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201c[Petitioner\u2019s daughter] had posted that bail. Her grandmother took her over there and had her post the bail. Grandma gave her the money to post the bail, and so that young girl \u2014 because grandma didn\u2019t want to be on the hook when they violated, so she put that young girl on the hook for $150,000. Grandma did that to her. Because grandma didn\u2019t want a judgment for 150 against her, so she thought, we\u2019ll do it to the granddaughter, because they don\u2019t have anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201cQ. Well, the little daughter there wouldn\u2019t even understand the concept \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u201cA. She wouldn\u2019t, and grandma took advantage of her; and I was explaining that to her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>The post-conviction record also includes evidence about the circumstances in which petitioner entered his plea. Scales said that petitioner had been \u201cpretty confident that [ML] was not going to show up for trial,\u201d and that petitioner\u2019s \u201cposition changed drastically when she first showed up for trial.\u201d Scales himself was \u201cvery shocked\u201d at the testimony that ML delivered, which he described as \u201cvery believable, very credible.\u201d Scales thinks that petitioner probably pleaded \u201cno contest\u201d after hearing ML\u2019s testimony because he was concerned about what was going to happen with his family members. When the parties met following ML\u2019s testimony, Scales asserted, Forster was \u201cpretty aggressive\u201d with petitioner, telling him that he could take an offer for a 180-month sentence or leave it. Forster also said that she could bring charges against petitioner\u2019s family members, and agreed to forgo prosecution \u201cas part of the agreement on the plea offer.\u201d After Forster left the room, Scales discussed the offer with petitioner and \u201cdetermined that for precisely these reasons, that he is doing this voluntarily\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">\u201cAnd * * * I told him, \u2018What is going on with your mom or your sister or your daughter, those are threats. They are not \u2014 they are not related to your case.\u2019 Um, he still wanted to go forward with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Scales did not \u201cthink there was going to be any possibility of a plea until she \u2014 she came in, and * * * [ML] is the one who out-gamed us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">After taking the case under advisement, the post-conviction court entered a judgment denying petitioner post-conviction relief. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">\u201cProsecutor was zealous, but insufficient evidence of misconduct. She did tell a number of witnesses that if they did not tell the truth, she would charge them with perjury. The only such witness who had a chance to at least start testifying was the named victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\u201cPlea was knowing and voluntary], not coerced. Petitioner had already rejected 2 prior offers, so knew it was up to him. He knew he could go to trial since he was already in trial when he took the deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">\u201cPetitioner rejected all plea offers until after [ML] began testifying. He then decided to take a deal which cleared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>all of his cases and kept all family members from being charged with tampering etc. Sentence was stipulated and had to be immediate while all trial witnesses still available if necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">It is that judgment from which petitioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">II. THE PARTIES\u2019 ARGUMENTS ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Petitioner makes three narrow arguments on appeal, each related to his general contention that his plea was impermissibly coerced. First, petitioner makes a statutory argument, citing ORS 136.425, which provides that coerced confessions and admissions \u201ccannot be given in evidence\u201d against a criminal defendant, ORS 135.390, which requires courts to determine that defendants\u2019 guilty or no-contest pleas are \u201cvoluntary and intelligently made\u201d before accepting those pleas, and two statutes that guide prosecutorial decisions regarding plea agreements (ORS 135.405 and ORS 135.415). Under those statutes, petitioner argues, \u201cthe plea bargain in this case was improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Second, petitioner argues that, because his no-contest plea was improperly coerced, he \u201cdid not voluntarily waive the various rights guaranteed to a criminal defendant\u201d under Article I, sections 11 and 12, of the Oregon Constitution. Third, petitioner argues that his plea was involuntary and, therefore, obtained in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">With respect to both of those constitutional claims, petitioner argues that the plea was involuntary because it was coerced through what he characterizes as the \u201cprosecutor\u2019s threat to prosecute [petitioner\u2019s] family and to seek a $150,000 judgment from his daughter.\u201d The argument is narrow. Petitioner does not rely on any case-specific circumstances associated with the claimed \u201cthreats.\u201d Rather, he appears to argue categorically that a plea that is \u201cbased on considerations completely external to [the defendant\u2019s] culpability\u201d and that is related to threats against a defendant\u2019s family members is involuntary as a matter of law. Thus, petitioner asks this court to hold that \u201ca prosecutor should be forbidden to threaten to prosecute third parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>or to level sanctions against them, as an inducement to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">In response, the superintendent first argues that petitioner\u2019s contentions cannot form a basis for post-conviction relief because petitioner \u201creasonably could have asserted \u2014 prior to entry of judgment in his criminal case\u2014 that the prosecutor\u2019s purported threats entitled him to withdraw his plea.\u201d Alternatively, the superintendent argues that petitioner\u2019s statutory claim is unpreserved and, in any event, cannot form a basis for post-conviction relief. With respect to petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims, the superintendent argues that petitioner did not prove that the prosecutor\u2019s actions deprived petitioner of due process or violated other constitutional principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">We begin by addressing the superintendent\u2019s contention that petitioner\u2019s involuntary-plea claim cannot form the basis for post-conviction relief. We reject that proposition. Under ORS 138.530(l)(a), a petitioner is entitled to post-conviction relief if he or she establishes a \u201csubstantial denial in the proceedings resulting in [the] petitioner\u2019s conviction * * * of [the] petitioner\u2019s rights under the Constitution of the United States, or under the Constitution of the State of Oregon, or both, * * * which denial rendered the conviction void.\u201d The Supreme Court has interpreted that statute to include a qualification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">\u201cWhen a criminal defendant fails to raise an issue at trial that the defendant reasonably could have been expected to raise, the defendant cannot obtain post-conviction relief on that ground unless the defendant alleges and proves that the failure to raise the issue was due to one (or more) of a few narrowly drawn exceptions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\"><em>Palmer v. State of Oregon, </em>318 Or 352, 358, 867 P2d 1368 (1994). Perhaps the most common exception to what is sometimes called \u201cthe <em>Palmer </em>bar\u201d is the claim \u201cthat the failure to object constituted inadequate assistance of trial counsel.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Significantly, the <em>Palmer </em>rule does not bar those claims that \u201ccould conceivably have been made but could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>not reasonably have been expected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357 (citation omitted). In our view, that category includes claims that a plea was not voluntary because it was unlawfully coerced, that is, \u201cinduced by fraud or improper threats.\u201d <em>Kinkel v. Lawhead, </em>240 Or App 403, 414-15, 246 P3d 746, <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 408 (2011). If a person has pleaded guilty or \u201cno contest\u201d only because he or she has been defrauded or unlawfully threatened, that person cannot reasonably be expected to promptly seek to withdraw the plea in the course of the same criminal proceeding. Indeed, in providing examples of claims that conceivably could have been raised at the criminal trial, yet still can form the basis for post-conviction relief, the Supreme Court identified those situations \u201cwhere duress <em>or coercion </em>prevented assertion of the right.\u201d <em>Palmer, </em>318 Or at 357 (citation omitted; emphasis added). We conclude that <em>Palmer </em>does not bar petitioner\u2019s post-conviction claim that his plea was impermissibly coerced and, therefore, involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">We turn to the merits. As noted above, petitioner first argues that the prosecutor violated various Oregon statutes by, in petitioner\u2019s view, coercing petitioner\u2019s no-contest plea. That statutory claim was not included in petitioner\u2019s second amended petition for post-conviction relief. Accordingly, we do not address the argument further, except to note that petitioner has not explained how a claim based on a purely statutory violation could form the basis for post-conviction relief. <em>See </em>ORS 138.530 (specifying grounds for post-conviction relief, which do not include statutory violations); ORS 138.550(3) (any grounds for relief not asserted in a petition for post-conviction relief \u201care deemed waived\u201d unless the court finds that they \u201ccould not reasonably have been raised\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">That brings us to petitioner\u2019s constitutional arguments. In his second amended petition for post-conviction relief, petitioner claimed that his plea was impermissibly coerced in two ways: through Forster\u2019s threats to prosecute members of petitioner\u2019s family for witness tampering if petitioner did not enter a guilty or no-contest plea, and through Forster\u2019s threats to pursue a judgment against petitioner\u2019s daughter \u201cfor the full amount of the $150,000 bail\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the same circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, petitioner argues that those threats rendered his plea involuntary under both the state and federal constitutions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the outset, we emphasize what petitioner did <em>not </em>argue below and does not argue to this court. Petitioner acknowledges Forster\u2019s stated belief that she would have been entitled to pursue a $150,000 judgment against petitioner\u2019s daughter if she could establish that petitioner violated the terms of his release by tampering with witnesses. Petitioner does not contend either that Forster was incorrect in believing that she could have pursued such a judgment or that she somehow acted in bad faith when she explained that possibility to petitioner\u2019s daughter. Petitioner also does not challenge Forster\u2019s assertion that she properly could have pursued witness-tampering charges against petitioner\u2019s family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Rather, with respect to his federal due process claim, petitioner advocates for a general rule that would <em>always </em>deem a guilty or no-contest plea involuntary when it is induced by what petitioner calls \u201cextrinsic\u201d threats, that is, a prosecutor\u2019s threats that do not relate directly to the criminal prosecution itself, but instead are threats to take action against third parties if the defendant does not accept the prosecutor\u2019s plea offer. In support of that argument, petitioner relies exclusively on the following footnote in <em>Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 US 357, 98 S Ct 663, 54 L Ed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>2d 604 (1978), in which the Court explicitly reserved judgment on that question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">\u201cThis case does not involve the constitutional implications of a prosecutor\u2019s offer during plea bargaining of adverse or lenient treatment for some person <em>other </em>than the accused, * * * which might pose a greater danger of inducing a false guilty plea by skewing the assessment of the risks a defendant must consider.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 364 n 8 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">As far as we are aware, no federal court of appeals has held, since <em>Bordenkircher </em>was decided, that a defendant\u2019s guilty plea must <em>always </em>be deemed \u201cinvoluntary\u201d if it was induced by a prosecutor\u2019s threat to take action against third parties unless the defendant entered that plea. To the contrary, each court that has addressed the question has held that \u201cthere is no \u2018intrinsic constitutional infirmity\u2019 in promising leniency to a third party in exchange for a guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. McElhaney, </em>469 F3d 382, 385 (5th Cir 2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Nuckols, </em>606 F2d 566, 569 (5th Cir 1979)); <em>see also, e.g., Miles v. Dorsey, </em>61 F3d 1459, 1468 (10th Cir 1995), <em>cert den, </em>516 US 1062 (1996) (\u201c[A] plea is not per se involuntary if entered under a plea agreement that includes leniency for a third party.\u201d); <em>United States v. Marquez, </em>909 F2d 738, 741-42 (2nd Cir 1990), <em>cert den, </em>498 US 1084 (1991) (agreeing with \u201call of the other circuits that [had then] considered the issue * * * that a plea is not invalid if entered (1) under a plea agreement that includes leniency for a third party or (b) in response to a prosecutor\u2019s justifiable threat to prosecute a third party if the plea is not entered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Rather than imposing a blanket ban on such pleas, federal courts generally have held that a plea may be considered voluntary so long as the prosecutor engaged in plea negotiations in good faith and had a proper basis for the threatened action against third parties. <em>See, e.g., McElhaney, </em>469 F3d at 386 (\u201cWhere the prosecution has a good-faith basis to threaten charges against a third party, a defendant\u2019s election to \u2018sacrifice himself for such motives\u2019 is not a basis to challenge the voluntariness of the plea.\u201d). That is true even when the third party is the defendant\u2019s family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>member. Thus, \u201cso long as the government has prosecuted or threatened to prosecute a defendant\u2019s relative in good faith, the defendant\u2019s plea, entered to obtain leniency for the relative, is not. involuntary.\u201d <em>Miles, </em>61 F3d at 1468. Here, as explained above, petitioner has not challenged the prosecutor\u2019s asserted entitlement to pursue a judgment against petitioner\u2019s daughter for the $150,000 security amount based on her belief that petitioner violated the terms of his release agreement by tampering with witnesses before trial. Nor has he asserted that the prosecutor could not have pursued witness-tampering charges against petitioner\u2019s family members. Finally, he has not asserted that the prosecutor acted in bad faith.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In sum, we have found no support for petitioner\u2019s categorical argument that plea agreements always must be deemed involuntary for due process purposes when they are induced by promises of leniency toward third parties or by threats to take actions against those parties if the plea offer is refused. We conclude that the post-conviction court correctly rejected petitioner\u2019s claim that his plea was impermissibly coerced in violation of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">We reject petitioner\u2019s state constitutional argument for similar reasons. In arguing that the Oregon Constitution prohibits prosecutors from using threats against third parties to induce a defendant to enter a guilty plea, petitioner relies primarily on <em>Lyons v. Pearce, </em>298 Or 554, 560, 694 P2d 969 (1985), in which the Supreme Court explained that a defendant who pleads guilty must \u201cunderstand the rights he is waiving and * * * waive them free from coercion.\u201d Petitioner asserts that his plea was impermissibly coerced because plea bargaining that involves a prosecutor\u2019s threat to seek a civil judgment from a third party \u201ccould extract \u2018a confession of guilt from one who is in fact innocent.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>State v. Nunn, </em>212 Or 546, 553, 321 P2d 356 (1958).) In petitioner\u2019s view, pleas entered under such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>circumstances always must be deemed involuntary because a prosecutor\u2019s \u201cextrinsic\u201d threats against third parties are likely to coerce an innocent defendant into pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Petitioner offers no support for that categorical argument, and we are aware of none. As an initial matter, we observe that petitioner may implicitly be suggesting that <em>any </em>guilty plea is involuntary if made under circumstances that <em>could have </em>induced an innocent person to enter that plea. We reject any such suggestion. Many factors may influence a defendant\u2019s decision whether to enter a guilty or no-contest plea, such as the desirability of being convicted of fewer crimes than were charged, obtaining a lesser sentence than might be imposed following trial, avoiding the airing of facts that the defendant may wish to keep private, or of preventing vulnerable victims from having to testify. Depending on the circumstances, a defendant may feel that the benefits associated with those \u201cintrinsic\u201d factors present compelling reasons to plead guilty. And that may be true, in some cases, even when the defendant is innocent of the crimes charged. But that unsettling reality is inherent in the plea-negotiation process, which has been deemed \u201ccrucial to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system.\u201d <em>State v. Heisser, </em>350 Or 12, 21, 249 P3d 113 (2011). Accordingly, it cannot be the case that a trial court can never accept a plea under circumstances in which it is <em>possible </em>that the defendant decided to accept the prosecutor\u2019s plea offer despite being innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">As we understand petitioner\u2019s remaining argument, it rests on two premises. First, petitioner contends that plea-negotiation considerations that are \u201cextrinsic\u201d to the defendant\u2019s prosecution \u2014 like the possibility that a prosecutor will pursue a judgment against a defendant\u2019s family member for a security amount, or seek to prosecute a defendant\u2019s family members \u2014 are <em>always </em>more likely to induce an innocent defendant to plead guilty than are the myriad of \u201cintrinsic\u201d factors that defendants routinely weigh when deciding whether to accept the state\u2019s plea offers. Second, petitioner necessarily \u2014 if implicitly \u2014 argues that the alleged increased likelihood that an innocent person will plead guilty is sufficient, standing alone, to render the person\u2019s plea involuntary when it is induced by \u201cextrinsic\u201d threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Because we reject the first necessary premise of petitioner\u2019s argument, we need not address the second. We perceive no basis on which we could conclude, as a categorical matter, that \u201cextrinsic\u201d threats always are more likely than \u201cintrinsic\u201d threats to induce an innocent person to plead guilty. As discussed above, even an innocent defendant could find that \u201cintrinsic\u201d factors \u2014 such as receiving a much lighter sentence than might be imposed after trial \u2014 present compelling reasons to plead guilty. And, depending on the circumstances, such a defendant might not be moved at all by various \u201cextrinsic\u201d considerations, for example, by a prosecutor\u2019s promise not to pursue charges against one of the defendant\u2019s relatives whom (unbeknownst to the prosecutor) the defendant detests. Because of the varied and nuanced considerations that inform any criminal defendant\u2019s decision whether to accept a prosecutor\u2019s plea offer, we decline to hold, as a matter of law, that extrinsic considerations are always more likely than intrinsic considerations to induce an innocent defendant to plead guilty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">In this case, petitioner does not rely on any case-specific factors to support his argument that his plea was involuntary. Rather, as explained above, his appeal rests entirely on his contention that \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 a prosecutor\u2019s \u201cextrinsic\u201d threats or promises made during the plea-negotiation process always will render a resulting guilty or no-contest plea involuntary. Because we have rejected that categorical proposition, petitioner\u2019s appeal presents no reason for us to disturb the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-8\"> Over the course of the underlying criminal proceedings, the court set different security amounts in association with various charges against petitioner. For purposes of this opinion, only one of those security arrangements matters: petitioner\u2019s release pursuant to an agreement that set a security amount of $150,000, and that allowed petitioner to be released after 10 percent of that amount had been posted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\"> In her post-conviction deposition, Forster explained that she \u201chad a bunch of counts\u201d of witness tampering with which she could charge petitioner, based on recorded jail calls in which he told people to \u201cgo talk to\u201d ML. The post-conviction record also includes evidence showing that the criminal trial court had been prepared to allow the state to introduce recordings of calls that petitioner made from jail, including one in which ML asked petitioner why he did what he did to her, he responded that he \u201cwas just mad,\u201d and then said that he wanted to marry ML. The court also would have allowed the state to introduce defendant\u2019s recorded statement that he was going to be sentenced to \u201calmost 70 years in prison,\u201d ML\u2019s response that petitioner was \u201cnot gonna do any time\u201d and that she was going to help him. Moreover, Scales, petitioner\u2019s criminal-defense attorney, asserted that he had listened to a call from petitioner to one of his daughters (not the one who posted security for him) in which petitioner said \u201csomething along the lines of: You\u2019ve got to tell [ML] not to come to court.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s daughter replied \u201csomething along the lines that she was not going to do that.\u201d Petitioner was upset by that response.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\"> The post-conviction record includes material supporting Forster\u2019s belief that petitioner\u2019s family members had committed witness tampering. Forster asserted that the family members \u201cwere threatening\u201d ML and \u201cwere keeping her dog.\u201d In Forster\u2019s view, \u201c[t]hey were tampering with her every which way they could.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b126-5\"> On appeal, petitioner also alludes to Forster having stated that she would prosecute petitioner\u2019s family members for perjury if they lied on the stand. (Forster acknowledged in her deposition that she had told Scales, petitioner, and petitioner\u2019s family members who were potential witnesses that, \u201c[i]f [the family members] lied on the stand, * * * they would be prosecuted for perjury.\u201d She also told petitioner that, if those witnesses did not lie, \u201cwe\u2019ve got no problems.\u201d) Petitioner did not claim below that his plea was involuntary because Forster threatened to prosecute potential witnesses if they lied. Accordingly, we do not address that issue further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\"> In her deposition, Forster acknowledged that she had threatened to pursue a judgment against petitioner\u2019s daughter for the full $150,000 in security associated with petitioner\u2019s release, if petitioner did not plead guilty or \u201cno contest.\u201d However, she denied that she had threatened to prosecute petitioner\u2019s family members for witness tampering in those circumstances. The post-conviction court did not make an express finding about whether, in fact, Forster threatened to prosecute petitioner\u2019s family members if petitioner did not enter a guilty or no-contest plea. We need not decide whether the post-conviction court <em>implicitly </em>found that no such threat occurred because \u2014 as explained in the body of this opinion \u2014 petitioner has not established that'the post-conviction court erred in denying him relief, even assuming that the prosecutor <em>did </em>make such a threat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\"> In addition, some courts have expressed the view that threats or promises related to third parties might induce defendants to enter false guilty pleas and, therefore, have concluded that courts must take \u201cspecial care\u201d to ensure that the pleas are voluntary. <em>E.g., Harman v. Mohn, </em>683 F2d 834, 837 (4th Cir 1982). Here, however, petitioner has not claimed that the circuit court should have taken additional steps to ensure the voluntariness of his plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\"> As we have already noted, <em>see 273 </em>Or App at 110 n 6, some courts have opined that, because \u201cextrinsic\u201d threats <em>could </em>induce defendants to enter false guilty pleas, courts must be particularly careful in ensuring the voluntariness of pleas entered under those circumstances. That is far different from holding, as a matter of law, that <em>every </em>extrinsic threat renders a plea involuntary because it is likely to induce an innocent defendant to plead guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
