For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by rejecting defendant\u2019s plea solely on that basis. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Defendant stole $26.51 worth of merchandise from Walmart in Coos Bay. When confronted by store security personnel, defendant admitted the theft and returned the items. The responding officer noted that defendant \u201cappeared to be very remorseful for [her] actions.\u201d Defendant was subsequently charged with theft in the third degree, ORS 164.043, a Class C misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">At a hearing in May 2013, defense counsel explained to the trial court that defendant wished to plead guilty to a lesser charge, pursuant to a plea agreement, and the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The negotiation with [the prosecutor] is that she plead guilty to the lesser-included offense of Attempted Theft Third.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: What does that make it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It makes it a violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: *** [W]e\u2019re not doing that over here. I\u2019m not \u2014 we\u2019re not taking pleas to violations in this Court. So, \u2014 and that was made clear in a letter.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-13\">\u201cSo, she either pleads guilty as charged, or we go to Trial, or you dismiss it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-14\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: We\u2019re not going to dismiss it, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: (Interposing) I beg your pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: We\u2019re not going to dismiss it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Does she have a record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: None at all. None, whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I\u2019ve been generally fining people, * * * \u2014 that\u2019s generally what I\u2019ve done in these cases.

Defendant noted that \u201cthe parties have reached this settlement of the case after discussion and negotiation, and there is no constitutional or statutory ground that would prevent this settlement.\u201d Defendant also noted that the prosecutor took \u201cno position on this Motion\u201d and requested \u201ca hearing and oral argument\u201d on the motion. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion without comment in a written order.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>In June 2013, at a hearing before a different judge,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defense counsel again broached the plea agreement issue, and the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m assuming that the Court is not going to revisit the previous ruling made without a Hearing on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: (Interposing) No, I\u2019m not \u2014 I mean, we don\u2019t allow negotiations from criminal charges to violations.

Great.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The court then conducted a bench trial and, based on stipulated facts, found defendant guilty of third-degree theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Defendant now appeals the resulting judgment of conviction, challenging the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow her to plead guilty to attempted third-degree theft, a violation, as a matter of policy. On appeal, both parties note that a trial court\u2019s discretion to accept or reject a plea resulting from a plea agreement derives from ORS 135.432. <em>See State v. Armstrong, </em>44 Or App 219, 223, 605 P2d 736, <em>rev den, </em>289 Or 45 (1980) (citing ORS 135.432 and stating that \u201cthe trial court is granted discretion to accept or reject a plea agreement\u201d). ORS 135.432(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201cWhen a plea of guilty or no contest is tendered or received as a result of a prior plea agreement, the trial judge shall give the agreement due consideration, but notwithstanding its existence, the trial judge is not bound by it, and may reach an independent decision on whether to grant sentence concessions under the criteria set forth in ORS 135.415.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">ORS 135.415, in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201cIn determining whether to engage in plea discussions for the purpose of reaching a plea agreement, the district attorney may take into account, but is not limited to, any of the following considerations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u201c(1) The defendant by the plea of the defendant has aided in insuring the prompt and certain applications of correctional measures to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">\u201c(2) The defendant has acknowledged guilt and shown a willingness to assume responsibility for the conduct of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">\u201c(3) The concessions made by the state will make possible alternative correctional measures which are better adapted to achieving rehabilitative, protective, deterrent or other purposes of correctional treatment, or will prevent undue harm to the defendant from the form of conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">\u201c(4) The defendant has made public trial unnecessary when there are good reasons for not having the case dealt with in a public trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\u201c(5) The defendant has given or offered cooperation when the cooperation has resulted or may result in the successful prosecution of other offenders engaged in equally serious or more serious criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">\u201c(6) The defendant by the plea of the defendant has aided in avoiding delay in the disposition of other cases and thereby has increased the probability of prompt and certain application of correctional measures to other offenders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Defendant asserts that \u201c [t]he trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant to plead guilty to attempted theft in the third degree.\u201d More specifically, defendant argues that \u201c[t]he trial court abused its discretion when it refused to allow defendant to plead guilty to a violation!,] based solely on its policy of not permitting criminal defendants to plead guilty to violations.\u201d First, based on the second clause of ORS 135.432(4), defendant argues that a trial judge cannot properly exercise discretion without giving a plea agreement \u201cdue consideration.\u201d Second, based on the fifth clause of ORS 135.432(4), defendant argues that a trial judge \u201cmust decide whether to follow the agreement based upon the criteria set forth in ORS 135.415.\u201d Thus, defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in this case when it rejected her guilty plea without giving \u201cdue consideration\u201d to the terms of her particular plea agreement and without considering the case-specific factors set forth in ORS 135.415.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In response, the state appears to argue that a court may satisfy its obligation to \u201cgive the agreement due consideration\u201d by making a categorical determination that it will not accept pleas resulting from a certain class of agreements, such as it did in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, during oral argument, the state suggested that it would not be improper for a court to categorically refuse to accept <em>any </em>pleas resulting from plea agreements, as a matter of policy. The state further responds that a court is not required to consider the factors set forth in ORS 135.415 before rejecting a guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>or no-contest plea, because, according to the state, ORS 135.432(4) applies only to consideration of the sentencing portion of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u201cSince 1973, an Oregon prosecutor\u2019s authority to enter into plea negotiations and plea agreements has been formally organized and controlled by statute.\u201d <em>State v. Heisser, </em>350 Or 12, 22, 249 P3d 113 (2011) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). As the Oregon Supreme Court explained in <em>Heisser:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">\u201cAs part of a plea agreement, the prosecutor may give concessions to the defendant in exchange for a plea of guilty or no contest. ORS 135.405(3). Those concessions can include, among others, agreeing to seek dismissal of other charges if a defendant pleads guilty to a charged offense; <em>agreeing to seek dismissal of the charged offense if defendant pleads guilty to another reasonably related </em>offense; and agreeing to make favorable recommendations on sentencing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted; emphasis added); <em>see also </em>ORS 135.405(3) (providing a nonexclusive list of concessions that the prosecutor may agree to). The record indicates that the concession offered by the prosecutor in this case was the second type of concession described by the court in <em>Heisser </em>\u2014 that is, the prosecutor agreed to seek dismissal of the charge of third-degree theft in exchange for defendant\u2019s agreement to plead guilty to the reasonably related offense of attempted third-degree theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The statutory scheme governing plea agreements contemplates not only different types of concessions, but also \u201cdifferent kinds of agreements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the Oregon Supreme Court explained in <em>Heisser,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">\u201cUnder certain plea agreements the trial judge must give the plea agreement \u2018due consideration,\u2019 but is not bound by the agreement as to sentencing and may make an independent determination as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed. ORS 135.432(4). However, in other plea agreements approved by the trial court, the court is required to \u2018impose sentence as provided in the agreed disposition recommendation\u2019 provided for in the plea agreement. ORS 135.390(4)(a). In that kind of agreement, should the judge conclude that the sentencing concessions in a plea agreement are inappropriate, \u2018the [judge] shall so advise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>parties and allow the defendant an opportunity to withdraw the plea.\u2019 ORS 135.390(4)(b); <em>see also </em>ORS 135.432(3) (to the same effect when the trial judge has been informed of the nature of the agreement prior to the plea being tendered and originally concurred in the outcome).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 22-23 (brackets in original). As the parties note, the issue in this case is governed by ORS 135.432(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Thus, as set forth above, the issue that we must resolve is whether the trial court abused its discretion by rejecting defendant\u2019s guilty plea resulting from a plea agreement that involved reducing a misdemeanor charge to a violation, based solely on the court\u2019s policy of not permitting defendants charged with misdemeanors to plead guilty to violations. To resolve that issue, we must interpret ORS 135.432(4). When interpreting a statute, our goal is to discern legislative intent by considering the text and context, and, where helpful, the legislative history of the statute. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">We begin with the statutory text. <em>See PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993) (stating that \u201cthe text of the statutory provision itself is the starting point for interpretation and is the best evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent\u201d). As noted, ORS 135.432(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">\u201cWhen a plea of guilty or no contest is tendered or received as a result of a prior plea agreement, the trial judge shall give the agreement due consideration, but notwithstanding its existence, the trial judge is not bound by it, and may reach an independent decision on whether to grant sentence concessions under the criteria set forth in ORS 135.415.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">We first address defendant\u2019s argument based on the second clause of ORS 135.432(4), which provides that \u201cthe trial judge shall give the agreement due consideration.\u201d We note that \u201cthe agreement\u201d referred to in the second clause refers back to the \u201cprior plea agreement\u201d referenced in the first clause. We also note that \u201cthe agreement\u201d referred to in the second clause is the indirect object of the phrase \u201cdue consideration.\u201d Accordingly, it is \u201cthe agreement\u201d between the parties, resulting in the guilty or no contest plea, that must receive \u201cdue consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>We further note that the second clause employs the term \u201cshall\u201d rather than the term \u201cmay.\u201d Generally, \u201cthe word \u2018shall\u2019 implies that the legislature intended to create an obligation; in contrast, \u2018may\u2019 generally implies that the legislature intended to create only the authority to act.\u201d <em>Doyle v. City of Medford, </em>347 Or 564, 570-71, 227 P3d 683 (2010). As the Oregon Supreme Court has explained, there can be \u201csituations in which the context demonstrates that, although the legislature used the word \u2018shall,\u2019 it intended to create a permissive statute!,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 571, but \u201cwhatever the possibility for confusion or ambiguity that might exist when either word appears alone in a statute, regulation, or other directive, when both words appear side by side in the same section of a document, our normal interpretive principles dictate that we presume that different meanings are intended!,]\u201d <em>Friends of Columbia Gorge v. Columbia River (S055915), </em>346 Or 415, 426-27, 212 P3d 1243 (2009). Thus, the plain text of the statute indicates that a trial judge is <em>obligated </em>to give a plea agreement \u201cdue consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\">The phrase \u201cdue consideration\u201d is not statutorily defined, so we turn to dictionary definitions to assist us in determining its meaning. <em>See Gaines, </em>346 Or at 175 (using dictionary definitions to discern the plain, natural, and ordinary meaning of terms); <em>State v. Dickerson, </em>356 Or 822, 829, 345 P3d 447 (2015) (when defining legal terms, \u201cwe give those terms their established legal meanings, consulting legal dictionaries as an aid in determining those meanings\u201d). As relevant to this case, the plain meaning of the term \u201cconsideration\u201d may be defined as \u201ccontinuous and careful thought\u201d; \u201cthoughtful regard\u201d; \u201ca result of reflecting or pondering\u201d; or \u201cthe act of regarding or weighing carefully.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>484 (unabridged ed 2002). The plain meaning of the term \u201cdue\u201d may be defined as something that is \u201crequisite or appropriate in accordance with accepted notions of what is right, reasonable, fitting, or necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699. In addition, as a legal term, the phrase \u201cdue consideration\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he degree of attention properly paid to something, as the circumstances merit.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>574 (9th ed 2009). Those definitions suggest that a plea agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>must be carefully or thoughtfully regarded with attention given to what is right, reasonable, fitting, necessary, or proper, according to the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">We now turn to the statutory context of ORS 135.432(4), which includes \u201cother provisions of the same statute and other related statutes.\u201d <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611. Defendant points to other related statutes as context to support her argument that \u201cdue consideration\u201d means individualized consideration. Defendant notes that, before the court may accept a plea of guilty or no contest, the court must \u201cfirst address [] the defendant personally and determin[e] that the defendant understands the nature of the charge!,]\u201d ORS 135.385(1); \u201cdetermin[e] that the plea is voluntary and intelligently made[,]\u201d ORS 135.390(1); and \u201csatisfy [itself] that there is a factual basis for the plea[,]\u201d ORS 135.395. The state responds that those statutes govern circumstances in which a court might lack discretion to <em>accept </em>a plea, \u201c[b]ut nothing in those or any other statutes defendant cites otherwise limits when or why a trial court can <em>reject </em>a guilty plea.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) While we agree with the state that the statutes defendant cites do not specifically limit when or why a trial court may reject a guilty plea, we nevertheless agree with defendant that the cited statutes provide context that supports our understanding that, generally, guilty pleas are to be individually considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Finally, we consider legislative history. The law codified as ORS 135.432(4) was enacted in 1973 by the Oregon Criminal Law Revision Commission as part of the Oregon Criminal Procedure Code Revision, and was modeled on the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards, section 3.3 (amended 1967). Or Laws 1973, ch 836, \u00a7 173; <em>see also </em>Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Procedure Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 266,162 (Nov 1972). Although we have reviewed published commentary to both the Oregon Criminal Procedure Code Revision and the ABA Standards, and minutes from discussions within the Oregon Criminal Law Revision Commission, we have found no comments in those sources, nor have the parties pointed us to any, that specifically address whether a court may properly reject a plea resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>a plea agreement solely as a matter of policy or clarifies the intended meaning of the phrase \u201cdue consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">We briefly summarize our analysis up to this point, involving the second clause of ORS 135.432(4), which provides that \u201cthe trial judge shall give the agreement due consideration.\u201d First, it is \u201cthe agreement\u201d between the parties, resulting in the guilty or no contest plea, that must receive \u201cdue consideration.\u201d Because the clause employs the term \u201cshall,\u201d the text indicates that a judge is obligated to give a plea agreement \u201cdue consideration.\u201d Dictionary definitions suggest that the phrase \u201cdue consideration\u201d means careful consideration with attention given to the degree that is right, reasonable, fitting, necessary, or proper, according to the circumstances. In addition, other related statutes suggest that individualized consideration is required for a judge to accept a plea agreement. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the requirement in ORS 135.432(4) that the trial judge give a plea agreement \u201cdue consideration\u201d means that the judge must consider the particular plea agreement reached between the parties before deciding whether to accept or reject the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Having determined that a trial judge is obligated to consider the particular plea agreement reached between the parties, we now address defendant\u2019s second argument\u2014 that the court \u201cmust decide whether to follow the agreement based upon the criteria set forth in ORS 135.415.\u201d Thus, defendant contends, the fifth clause of ORS 135.432(4), which provides that a trial judge \u201cmay reach an independent decision on whether to grant sentence concessions under the criteria set forth in ORS 135.415,\u201d controls the trial judge\u2019s consideration of a plea agreement. As previously discussed, the term \u201c\u2018may\u2019 generally implies that the legislature intended to create only the authority to act.\u201d Doyle, 347 Or at 570-71. Because the fifth clause employs the term \u201cmay\u201d rather than the term \u201cshall,\u201d that clause indicates that a trial judge is authorized, but not obligated, to make an independent decision on whether to grant concessions under the criteria set forth in ORS 135.415. Setting aside the question whether the fifth clause applies to concessions other than those related to sentencing, we conclude that, because there is no statutory obligation for a trial judge to make an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>independent decision on whether to grant concessions under the criteria, the court did not abuse its discretion by failing to consider the criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Applying the principles derived from our analysis to the issue in this case, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by rejecting defendant\u2019s proffered guilty plea based solely on the court\u2019s policy of not permitting defendants charged with misdemeanors to plead guilty to violations. Although the court was not required to consider the criteria set forth in ORS 135.415, the court was required to give the agreement \u201cdue consideration,\u201d meaning that the court was required to consider the particular plea agreement reached between the parties before deciding whether to accept or reject the plea. Because the court did not do that in this case, but instead rejected defendant\u2019s plea based solely on the court\u2019s policy of not permitting defendants charged with misdemeanors to plead guilty to violations, the court failed to properly exercise its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-15\"> After the parties argued this case to this court, the state informed us in a letter that, according to the Coos County District Attorney, \u201calthough the [trial] court has adopted a no-plea policy for violations, that policy is not memorialized in any letter or other document, despite the trial court\u2019s comments in this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-21\"> The trial judge who presided over the May hearing and denied defendant\u2019s motion in a written order was Judge Richard L. Barron. The trial judge who presided over the June hearing and signed defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction was Judge Michael J. Gillespie.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\"> Specifically, during oral argument, the state argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\u201cIt may be that the court should have to give due consideration to agreements, [but] whether due consideration requires a case by case analysis, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s nothing that prohibits the court from doing what it did here, in making a categorical determination, that in this kind of case, we\u2019re just not going to do that. I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s not due consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
