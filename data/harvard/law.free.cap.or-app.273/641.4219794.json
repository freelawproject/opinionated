He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence of his inculpatory statements to police made in the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. He argues that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required because the circumstances of the interview were \u201ccompelling.\u201d Without such warnings, he contends, evidence of his statements violated his rights under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review whether the totality of circumstances was \u201ccompelling\u201d for legal error. <em>State v. Northcutt, </em>246 Or App 239, 245, 268 P3d 154 (2011). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">\u201cWe state the facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s factual findings and its decision denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d <em>State v. Shaff, </em>343 Or 639, 641, 175 P3d 454 (2007). In October 2011, Medford Detective Kirkpatrick spoke with M, a fourteen-year-old, about a report from the Department of Human Services about her fight with her mother. M mentioned that defendant, her stepfather, had sexually abused her \u201cprobably back in 2006.\u201d M told the detective that she awoke one night when defendant had his hand under her clothing. She said that he had touched her vagina and, within two minutes, left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">On October 14, 2011, Kirkpatrick conducted an initial interview with defendant at the police station for 45 minutes. The detective confronted defendant with M\u2019s allegation. Defendant was not given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Defendant offered an innocent account of the event and denied having touched M\u2019s vagina. Kirkpatrick, however, stated multiple times during the interview that he believed that M was telling the truth about sexual abuse. To resolve the issue, Kirkpatrick offered to set up a polygraph test \u201cwith our polygrapher \u2014 not our polygrapher, but the guy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>that we use ***. He does work for the police department * * * \u201d Defendant agreed to take the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">The next day, defendant drove himself to the office of the private polygraph examiner. The examiner was Strickland, who had been a Medford police officer. Kirkpatrick drove separately, arriving in plain clothes with his gun, badge, police radio, and handcuffs. Strickland brought defendant into a testing office, and Kirkpatrick watched a video monitor in another room. Before beginning the test, Strickland told defendant that he was not in custody, that he was free to leave, and that everything in the testing office was being video recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The preparation and examination lasted about two hours. The preparation included detailed questions about defendant\u2019s sexual history and use of pornography. After the polygraph test concluded, defendant waited about 10 minutes in the office reception area, while Strickland scored the test. Strickland told Kirkpatrick that defendant was \u201cconclusively and clearly deceptive\u201d as to the questions pertaining to the sexual abuse of M.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Strickland brought defendant back into the testing room along with Kirkpatrick for a final interview that was to last about 50 minutes and would culminate in defendant\u2019s admission to touching M\u2019s vagina. Like the day before, defendant was not advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. During the interviews, Strickland and Kirkpatrick did not raise their voice, threaten defendant, or apply any physical restraints.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And, defendant did not ask to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Defendant sat on a couch, opposite to Strickland and Kirkpatrick, who sat side-by-side behind Strickland\u2019s desk. The door was closed for approximately half of the interview and thereafter remained partially open. Strickland began by explaining that he had scored the polygraph test and that defendant \u201cclearly and conclusively [was] not telling the truth to the relevant questions\u201d about M. Strickland said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>that there were \u201ctwo groups of people [:] * * * the pedophiles, and * * * the opportunistic folks.\u201d He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">\u201cWhen I see reactions like this, it\u2019s one of two reasons: either the person is a fixated lover of children, and a pedophile, and have lots of victims, and lots of really terrible sexual acts to them, to children, or it\u2019s a person that\u2019s in the opportunity group, and it\u2019s not a normal pattern of behavior for them, and they have *** a [conscience], and they are upset at themselves *** so it\u2019s maybe [they] made a mistake in judgment due to stress, or alcohol, something like that, and it was a one-time event short lived.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Strickland emphasized that he hoped defendant was part of the latter group rather than \u201csome deep dark sinister * * * person, who isolates and takes advantage of kids\u201d as a pattern of behavior. Strickland told defendant that, \u201cwithout any explanation from [defendant], we have to always assume the worst\u201d but that he thought \u201cthis is just a spur of the moment mistake [defendant] made in judgment, it lasted briefly, just a one-time deal.\u201d Strickland posed a series of questions to defendant, seeking an admission as to which of two \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 pedophiles or opportunistic individuals \u2014 defendant belonged. Defendant replied, \u201cNo,\u201d after each question. When defendant denied sexually touching M, Strickland responded, \u201cWrong. You\u2019re not telling the truth to that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Concurring with Strickland, Kirkpatrick opined that it was \u201cobvious\u201d to him that the sexual touching had occurred. He contended that \u201cpeople\u201d would want to know \u201cwhy this happened\u201d and that they would need an explanation. Kirkpatrick reiterated Strickland\u2019s theme that there are \u201ctwo kinds of criminal offenders\u201d and that he wanted to know why defendant had touched M. Kirkpatrick explained, again,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">\u201cWe know what happened. What we\u2019re trying to figure out was why. What people need to understand is why this happened, that it was a one-time occurrence, and that * * * it\u2019s not something that\u2019s gone on for years and years and years. <em>'* </em>* * There\u2019s * * * a story behind this, and if it\u2019s a onetime mistake, people can understand that, but they can\u2019t understand saying deception [unintelligible] continue to lie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>about \u2014 about what\u2019s going on *** we need to get to the bottom of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Strickland added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">\u201cI mean, sometimes the person under-reports, so the fact is it happened 10 times, and there was intercourse, and oral sex, and all this terrible \u2014 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case here. I think you just made [a mistake], like I said, for whatever reason back then, it\u2019s a different time [unintelligible] five years before. You\u2019re a different guy. For whatever reason you made a mistake in judgment * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Strickland, however, reasoned that, if the polygraph test had been contaminated by lying, he could not be sure that defendant was not a pedophile. At that point, defendant admitted that he looked underneath M\u2019s underwear, but he denied having touched her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Strickland suggested that defendant\u2019s failure to disclose looking under M\u2019s underwear could have contaminated the polygraph results. Using defendant\u2019s partial admission, Strickland said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">\u201c[I]f you\u2019re going to tell the truth, don\u2019t tell part of it, because then that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s called criminal thinking, and I don\u2019t want to think you\u2019re * * * a person that\u2019s a criminal, so if you\u2019re going to tell us the truth, tell us the whole truth. * * * If you truly do have a [conscience] then, you know, be honest. You know, just tell \u2014 tell us what it is. I\u2019m thinking you * * * put your hand there, and touched, and then \u2014 and then you were done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Taking the same tack, Kirkpatrick repeated that it was \u201cvery important\u201d to discuss \u201cthe whole thing.\u201d Kirkpatrick emphasized that he, Strickland, and defendant \u201call know that * * * picking up her pajamas, and looking, and [leaving], is not the whole story[.]\u201d Kirkpatrick said that \u201cit doesn\u2019t work for us to tell half-truths [.]\u201d He thought that defendant was trying to \u201cminimize\u201d the events, that defendant was not being forthcoming with the truth, and that an assertion that M had lied about being sexually abused did not \u201cmake any sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">As the interview progressed, Kirkpatrick asked defendant whether he \u201cfelt coerced in any way like someone\u2019s made [him] say these things.\u201d Defendant responded that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>was \u201cnot sure.\u201d Kirkpatrick then asked whether any promises or threats had been made to him. Defendant responded, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say you made any promises or any threats * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Strickland next suggested that defendant write an apology letter to M, so that M \u201cunderstands that * * * [defendant is] not calling her a liar[.]\u201d Defendant was noncommittal. After further prompting to tell \u201cthe whole truth,\u201d defendant admitted that he had touched M\u2019s vagina. Kirkpatrick again asked defendant whether he would be willing to write the apology letter to M. Defendant declined, explaining that he did not want to write the letter because \u201cit kind of feels like * * * I\u2019m writing down something, and putting my name to it to be used against me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">At the conclusion of the interview, Kirkpatrick asked defendant whether he had come to the testing office and took the polygraph test voluntarily and whether he had felt free to leave \u201cthis whole time.\u201d Defendant nodded in response to those questions. Immediately thereafter, Kirkpatrick arrested defendant in the testing office.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">After defendant was charged with first-degree sexual abuse, he moved to suppress his statements during the final October 15 interview. He argued that he had not been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, in violation of Article I, section 12. The state responded that no <em>Miranda </em>warning was required in this case because there were not compelling circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The trial court determined that the circumstances were not compelling. The court found that the testing office \u201clooked very comfortable [,]\u201d that \u201c[n]o promises or threats were madef,]\u201d and that the interview \u201cwas more of a question and answer, a free flowing conversation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court ruled,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>\u201c[Biased on all those statements [in the recorded interview], the location of the interview, the size of the room, the items in the room, the idea the defendant was not * * * prevented from leaving, there [were] no promises or coercion on behalf of the detectives, defendant drove himself there * * * based on all that, I find that under the totality of the circumstances, there was no coercion * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-3\">Defendant entered a conditional plea agreement in which he pleaded no contest to first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The law that governs this appeal is familiar. \u201cTo protect a person\u2019s right against compelled self-incrimination under Article I, section 12, \u2018before questioning, police must give <em>Miranda </em>warnings to a person who is in full custody or in circumstances that create a setting which judges would and officers should recognize to be compelling.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Ford, </em>244 Or App 289, 294, 260 P3d 637, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>245 Or App 500, 263 P3d 1110 (2011) (quoting <em>State v. Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or 631, 638, 136 P3d 22 (2006)). \u201cWhether compelling circumstances exist for purposes of Article I, section 12, necessarily depends on the particular circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>State v. Shirley, </em>223 Or App 45, 49, 195 P3d 457 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In determining whether circumstances are compelling, we consider four, nonexclusive factors: \u201c(1) the location of the encounter; (2) the length of the encounter; (3) the amount of pressure exerted on the defendant; and (4) the defendant\u2019s ability to terminate the encounter.\u201d <em>Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or at 640-41 (internal citations omitted). Those factors are not exhaustive, \u201cnor are they to be applied mechanically.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 641. For instance, we have considered additional factors, including \u201cthe number of officers and police cars at the scene, the demeanor of the investigating officer, and the use of physical force or confinement during questioning.\u201d <em>State v. Nunez, </em>243 Or App 246, 253, 259 P3d 941, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 216 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, we inquire \u201cwhether the officers created the sort of police-dominated atmosphere that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were intended to counteract.\u201d <em>Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or at 641. We are mindful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>that \u201cwhether the circumstances were compelling does not turn on either the officer\u2019s or the suspect\u2019s subjective belief or intent; rather, it turns on how a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood his or her situation.\u201d <em>Shaff </em>343 Or at 645. Ultimately, \u201cwhat matters is not whether evidence of guilt was apparent to the suspect; rather, it is whether the officers used that evidence in a coercive manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">In this case, the first three of four factors suggest compelling circumstances, and they do so especially with regard to the third factor, upon which we will focus. The fourth factor favors the state, but it alone cannot be dispositive. We address each factor in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">As to the first factor, the location of the encounter, the state argues that the setting was \u201cneutral\u201d because (a) defendant drove himself to the office during an ordinary hour of the day, (b) the interview took place in \u201ca typical private office,\u201d and (c) the office was \u201ccomfortable\u201d and reasonably-sized. <em>See Northcutt, </em>246 Or App at 249 (the defendant\u2019s motel suite was \u201cneutral\u201d as it was neither \u201cfamiliar\u201d to the defendant nor \u201cakin to a police station or custodial facility\u201d). The record supports the trial court\u2019s findings to the extent that the testing office was not part of a police station and to the extent that the testing office was comfortable in size and furnishings. Yet, even accepting those findings, those facts do not mean that this site was \u201cneutral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Defendant was not at home or seated in \u201ca typical private office\u201d that would be \u201cfamiliar\u201d to him. <em>Cf. Shaff, </em>343 Or at 646 (explaining that the \u201cfact that the interview occurs in familiar surroundings [such as the suspect\u2019s home] diminishes the police-dominated atmosphere\u201d). Defendant was seated in an unfamiliar office while being subject to a polygraph examination and being video-recorded almost continuously for three hours. Although the office was not a police station, defendant knew that Strickland \u201cdoes work for the police department\u201d and was \u201cthe guy that [the police] use\u201d for polygraph examinations. The location was integrally associated with police activity, and it carried the stress inherent in polygraph testing. This case contrasts with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>officer\u2019s \u201c\u2018casual\u2019 conversation\u201d with a suspect while seated at a table in the suspect\u2019s own home or other familiar location. <em>Nunez, </em>243 Or App at 255. Considering the polygraph testing equipment, the video recording, and the association between the location and former police activity, the circumstances that relate to the first factor support defendant\u2019s claim of compelling circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">The second factor, the duration of the encounter, likewise favors defendant. This incriminating evidence was derived in the final 50-minute interview, but it was part of an experience, including a polygraph examination, that lasted nearly three hours, and was preceded by the initial interview on the day before. In itself, the duration of a police interview is rarely a dispositive factor. We have observed that this factor\u2019s role in the determination of compelling circumstances depends not on the quantity of time but rather on the quality of that time. <em>Northcutt, </em>246 Or App at 250 (explaining that \u201cany consideration of the durational factor is necessarily dependent on the character or quality of the interaction\u201d). \u201cExcept in an otherwise close case in which duration may serve as a sort of tie-breaker, the principal emphasis is properly on the qualitative dynamics addressed in the third and fourth of the * * * factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Considering the pressured quality of the time, as explored in the next factor, we find that the duration of the encounter favors the view that circumstances were compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">As for the third factor, the amount of pressure exerted on a suspect, we conclude that this factor most strongly indicates compelling circumstances. In considering the pressure on a suspect, the focus of our inquiry is on \u201cthe use of aggressive and coercive police interrogation practices, especially including, but not limited to, those explicitly predicated on assumptions of a suspect\u2019s guilt or calculated to contradict a suspect\u2019s assertions of innocence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">This inquiry is illustrated in another case. In <em>State v. Machain, </em>233 Or App 65, 225 P3d 75 (2009), the defendant was interviewed at a sheriffs office for two and one-half hours, regarding a fatal shooting of her nephew and a theft from the safe in his home. Officers in that case interviewed the defendant three times within 24 hours and questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the defendant about \u201csensitive topics not directly related to the shooting,\u201d including the defendant\u2019s sexual activity. <em>Id. </em>at 69. They discussed sending the defendant for polygraph testing and ultimately told the defendant that \u201ca polygrapher had been called in already\u201d because they \u201cknew\u201d that she had lied. <em>Id. </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">During the final interview, the officers were confrontational about inconsistencies in the defendant\u2019s explanations and \u201cdirected her to look at them\u201d while she was talking about the shooting. The officers repeatedly stated that they would be able to find out what had actually happened and asked questions that implicitly assumed that the defendant was guilty. <em>Id. </em>An officer \u201cannounced that she might be about to receive more information from the crime lab,\u201d precipitating the defendant\u2019s admission that she had tried to break into the safe. <em>Id. </em>The defendant ultimately admitted that she was present when the victim was shot. <em>Id. </em>at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Given the totality of the circumstances, we concluded that the circumstances were compelling. <em>Id. </em>at 76. In reaching this conclusion, we emphasized that unlike in cases in which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">\u201cofficers confronted the defendants with evidence of guilt briefly and noncoercively, the detectives here repeatedly told defendant that they would be able to disprove any falsehood, that they knew that she was lying, and that she needed to tell the truth and \u2018be honest now.\u2019 The detectives, who had told defendant that they would be able to figure out \u2018everything\u2019 and that \u2018we know what happened now,\u2019 repeatedly asked questions that assumed defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 75-76. <em>But see Shaff, </em>343 Or at 646-47 (circumstances not compelling where police detained the defendant for a brief period of time in his own home and the interview did not involve coercive interrogation); <em>State v. Saunders, </em>221 Or App 116, 119-20, 188 P3d 449, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 416 (2008) (circumstances not compelling where the police interviewed the defendant in his own home and confronted him with incriminating evidence in a noncoercive manner).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>In this case, the state argues that \u201cthe discussion was neither aggressive nor coercive.\u201d The state contends that the interview proceeded in a \u201cfairly open-ended and, as the trial court found, Tree-flowing\u2019 manner.\u201d Although the detective and polygraph examiner expressed little doubt about their opinion, the state argues that they \u201chad very little evidence of guilt\u201d \u2014 -just the polygraph test \u2014 and even that evidence \u201clost any ability to support defendant\u2019s guilt\u201d when he admitted to lifting M\u2019s underwear without any touching. The civil nature of the interview supports the state\u2019s point, but the lack of useful evidence does not mean that the accusations of the examiner and detective were less convincing or put less pressure on defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">This case resembles <em>Machain. </em>Strickland and Kirkpatrick did much more than simply confront defendant with adverse evidence. From the beginning of the interviews, Strickland and Kirkpatrick confronted defendant with unqualified assertions of his guilt, despite his repeated denials of wrongdoing. Presenting an unwinnable dilemma, Strickland and Kirkpatrick persisted in telling defendant that he should identify himself as either a pedophile or an \u201copportunistic\u201d individual. They said that they hoped he was just an \u201copportunistic\u201d individual who had made a \u201conetime\u201d error or \u201cmistake in judgment,\u201d but they stressed that they would have to \u201cassume the worst\u201d in the absence of his confession. Throughout the interview, Kirkpatrick repeatedly leveraged the inadmissible polygraph results as dispositive evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. The detective admonished defendant to tell him whether it was a \u201cone-time occurrence\u201d or \u201csomething that\u2019s gone on for years and years and years.\u201d By so doing, Kirkpatrick demonstrated a clear intent to build pressure on defendant to confess to the \u201cless-serious\u201d criminal behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In light of the purported results of the polygraph, both Strickland and Kirkpatrick repeatedly insisted that they knew \u201cwhat happened,\u201d that defendant was lying, and that defendant should \u201cbe honest\u201d so that they could identify whether he posed a future threat. Their insistence reflected the use of repetitive and coercive police interrogation practices \u201cexplicitly predicated on assumptions of a suspect\u2019s guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>[and] calculated to contradict a suspect\u2019s assertions of innocence.\u201d <em>Northcutt, </em>246 Or App at 250. Although Strickland and Kirkpatrick maintained a professional demeanor, a pleasant and conversational tone of voice does not permit the type of coercive police practices that are impermissible in the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The third factor favors defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">As to the fourth factor, the suspect\u2019s ability to end the encounter, we conclude that this factor supports the state. Defendant disagrees that he could have left, because \u201ca reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would have understood [himself or] herself to be compelled to answer the detectives\u2019 questions during the interview.\u201d <em>Machain, </em>233 Or App at 76. The state notes that defendant traveled voluntarily to Strickland\u2019s office in his own vehicle, the door to the testing room remained partially open during part of the interview, and Strickland had initially advised defendant that he was free to leave and was not in custody. Moreover, defendant agreed, in response to an inquiry just before his arrest, that he felt free to leave. Kirkpatrick\u2019s question came just before his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">As to this factor, the trial court determined that defendant \u201cwas not prevented from leaving\u201d and that defendant would have been able to end the interview. That was true until he acknowledged sexually abusing M. Because the record contains evidence sufficient for the trial court\u2019s findings on this factor, we agree with the state. <em>See Nunez, </em>243 Or App at 255. Even so, this one of four factors does not overcome the otherwise compelling circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In the totality of the circumstances, the exertion of this pressure on defendant through several interviews in unfamiliar surroundings with the seemingly objective confirmation of the polygraph comprises compelling circumstances. The detective and examiner \u201ccreated the sort of police-dominated atmosphere that <em>Miranda </em>warnings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>were intended to counteract.\u201d <em>Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or at 641; <em>Machain, </em>233 Or App at 76. The trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the challenged evidence from the final interview. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\"> Article I, section 12, provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o person shall be *** compelled in any criminal prosecution to testify against himself.\u201d That constitutional provision \u201cis an independent source for warnings similar to those required under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as described in <em>Miranda v.
