The trial court sentenced defendant to a total of 280 months in prison and 20 years of post-prison supervision (less time served). The two kidnapping counts merged.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court should have granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charges of kidnapping and unlawful sexual penetration because the state failed to prove necessary elements of those offenses. Defendant held the victim in a bedroom at defendant\u2019s home for approximately two days, during which time he committed a series of violent sex acts against her, including penetrating her anus with a baseball bat. As to the kidnapping conviction, defendant argues that the state failed to prove that defendant \u201csecretly confine [d] the person in a place where [she] [was] not likely to be found,\u201d ORS 163.225(l)(b), because other people were present at the house at various times and knew that the victim was there. As to the charge of unlawful sexual penetration, defendant argues that the state failed to prove \u201cforcible compulsion.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we disagree with both of defendant\u2019s arguments and conclude that the evidence was sufficient to allow a rational factfinder to find the elements of both crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The nature of defendant\u2019s arguments requires us to recount the facts in detail. Although defendant challenges the sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence on narrow grounds discussed later in this opinion, the following facts are not disputed. On April 28, 2011, defendant attended a sporting event with his cousin, Longshore. When defendant returned home, his roommate, Burgoon, was there, but he soon left for the evening. Meanwhile, Longshore went to the victim\u2019s hotel room; they drank at a bar, where the victim became heavily intoxicated, and then went to defendant\u2019s house, where the victim fell asleep on a couch. The record reflects that the victim and defendant were acquainted because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>defendant was the victim\u2019s drug dealer and that they shared several mutual acquaintances.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The victim awoke on the couch in defendant\u2019s house when defendant punched her in the face and said, \u201cbitch, get in the room.\u201d Longshore was also \u201cright there.\u201d The victim went to defendant\u2019s bedroom. She later testified that she was intermittently conscious and that defendant continued to punch her and hit her with a baseball bat. When asked by the prosecutor to describe \u201cthe first thing\u201d the victim remembered, she recalled being on the floor, and defendant was hitting her in the face and telling her to \u201csuck his dick.\u201d The victim was screaming and refused. Defendant inserted his penis into her mouth. The victim also testified that defendant was \u201creally, really angry,\u201d and that he had urinated on her and had inserted a baseball bat into her anus, but she could not recall how many times. Defendant did not tell the victim that she could not leave, but she believed that she could not leave. She was \u201churt really bad\u201d and could \u201cbarely lift up [her] head\u201d and did not want to anger defendant again. Defendant later apologized, cried, and held the victim. The victim said defendant told her that she was \u201cgoing to stay [t]here for a couple days\u201d to \u201cheal\u201d or \u201cget better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Burgoon returned to the house the next day, April 29. He saw defendant, the victim, and Longshore there. He testified that the victim\u2019s face was bruised and swollen and that she looked beaten up to the point that Burgoon \u201cbarely\u201d recognized her. Defendant told Burgoon that he \u201ctook it to\u201d the victim. The victim was in defendant\u2019s room. Blood was on the floor and in the hallway. Burgoon considered calling an ambulance but did not. He did not stay at the house that night. When Burgoon returned to the house again around noon on April 30, the victim was still there.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">That same day, around 4:00 p.m., Portland Police Officer Kraner received a call regarding a welfare check on a person by the victim\u2019s name. According to Kraner\u2019s trial testimony, the caller reported that a woman with the victim\u2019s first name was being \u201cheld against her will in a home\u201d in North Portland, that she was being held by a man with defendant\u2019s first name, that she had been \u201cseverely beaten\u201d and \u201cwas not allowed to leave the location.\u201d The caller also informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Kraner that defendant \u201cand his associates\u201d who lived at the house in question were \u201clow[-]level drug dealers *** armed with baseball bats.\u201d Police took the caller in a patrol car to identify the house in question, which was defendant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">At 5:00 p.m., Kraner and four other officers arrived at defendant\u2019s house. Kraner observed someone in the house close the front door. Burgoon was standing on the sidewalk outside of the house. Kraner testified that Burgoon\u2019s \u201chands were shaking\u201d and that he \u201crepeatedly was glancing towards the house, very nervously.\u201d Officers then took him into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Inside the house, defendant told the victim and Sonia, a friend of the victim\u2019s who had just arrived, to be quiet, and he covered the victim, including her face, with bedding materials. Police commanded that the door of the house be opened; after getting no response, Kraner forced entry into the home. Kraner then saw defendant and Sonia, who both looked to be \u201cextremely surprised and in shock.\u201d Officers removed defendant and Sonia from the house and placed them into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In one of the bedrooms, Kraner saw a pile of bedding with \u201ctwo hands sticking straight up\u201d out of the pile. Kraner identified himself as a police officer, and he heard \u201csomeone faintly calling out for help.\u201d Kraner found the victim \u201cswaddled * * * [and] wrapped really tightly\u201d in the bedding. Upon uncovering the victim\u2019s face, Kraner testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">\u201c[h]er head was extremely swollen. Her eyes were purple, swollen completely shut. Her head was like the size of a basketball; it was that swollen. I noticed that her hairline was actually \u2014 her scalp was swollen, which caused her hair to be pushed straight up off of her head. Her lips were swollen. I could see kind of inside of her mouth, and it seemed like the inside portion of her mouth was swollen. I pulled back the bedding even more and exposed parts of her body, like her arms and her legs, and the exposed portions that I could see were covered in dark purple bruises, anywhere on her body that I could * * * see.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The victim told Kraner that \u201c[defendant] did this to me\u201d and wanted to make sure he was no longer at the house. Paramedics transported the victim to a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>At the hospital, the victim was treated by a sexual assault nurse, Anderson. At trial, Anderson testified that the victim was \u201cin and out of consciousness,\u201d had \u201cdifficulty controlling her pain,\u201d and provided information in \u201cbits and pieces\u201d rather than in \u201cone continuous narrative.\u201d The victim told Anderson that defendant was \u201cmad because he broke a bong,\u201d refused to let the victim leave the house, and that defendant kept \u201chitting * * * and hitting\u201d her. At some point, a woman named \u201cTrish\u201d knocked on the bedroom door, defendant answered it, and when the victim said \u201cplease let me leave,\u201d defendant kept hitting her and then \u201cthrew\u201d her. The victim later clarified, at trial, that, although \u201cTricia\u201d and another person, \u201cCorey,\u201d had stopped by the home, neither person was \u201callowed to see\u201d her and \u201cdidn\u2019t even know [she] was there.\u201d Anderson testified that, while at the hospital, the victim had said that her recollection was \u201creally blurry,\u201d and that she did not \u201cremember what happened,\u201d but that the victim had told her that \u201c[defendant] fucked me up. He hit me with a bat. He stuck the bat inside me. Now my butt and crotch hurt me.\u201d The victim further explained to Anderson that defendant had \u201cpeed on [her],\u201d penetrated her mouth with his penis, and \u201cmaybe\u201d put a bat in her vagina and anus. The victim also told Anderson that defendant said, \u201csit the fuck down, you\u2019re not leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Police found three baseball bats at the scene that tested positive for blood. The bats had DNA that was consistent with both defendant\u2019s and the victim\u2019s DNA. Blood stains on the floor of the home also contained the victim\u2019s DNA. The victim\u2019s DNA was also found to be present on defendant\u2019s penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the charges of first-degree kidnapping and first-degree unlawful sexual penetration. Defendant argued that the victim was seen by \u201cnumerous people in and out of the house. It was in a residence where there was obviously substantial traffic, and there was nothing that suggests that she was in a place where she was not likely to be found.\u201d Defendant also argued that, even assuming that the victim had been anally penetrated with a bat, there was no evidence that that act occurred \u201cunder forcible compulsion.\u201d The trial court denied the motion. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>appeal, defendant reprises his arguments to the trial court regarding the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal to determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found that the state proved all of the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Magel, </em>246 Or App 725, 729, 268 P3d 666 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">We begin with defendant\u2019s challenge to his conviction for kidnapping. ORS 163.235 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of kidnapping in the first degree if the person violates ORS 163.225 with any of the following purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201c(c) To cause physical injury to the victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">\u201c(d) To terrorize the victim or another person[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">ORS 163.225, the statute incorporated by reference above, sets out the elements of second-degree kidnapping. As pertinent to this case, that statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of kidnapping in the second degree if, with intent to interfere substantially with another\u2019s personal liberty, and without consent or legal authority, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">\u201c(b) Secretly confines the person in a place where the person is not likely to be found.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">The state charged defendant with first-degree kidnapping under the \u201csecret confinement\u201d theory set forth in ORS 163.225(1)(b). Thus, the state was required to prove that defendant \u201csecretly confine [d] [the victim] in a place where [she was] not likely to be found.\u201d In determining whether a person was secretly confined in a place where the person is not likely to be found, we must \u201ctake into account the circumstances of the place, the victim, and the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>State v. Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 343, 211 P3d 262 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Defendant highlights the following facts: Longshore was with the victim when she first arrived at defendant\u2019s home on April 28; Burgoon saw the victim there on each of the next two days; at one point, the victim\u2019s friend, Sonia, was in the house; and defendant, the victim, and other persons who were intermittently present all knew each other. Thus, defendant reasons, other people knew where the victim was and were \u201caware of where she probably and likely would be found if they searched for her\u201d \u2014 a fact that was confirmed when the anonymous caller led the police to the victim\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Defendant analogizes this case to <em>Parkins. </em>In that case, the defendant, a friend of the victim\u2019s family, visited their home and ended up alone at the house with the victim (an 11-year-old girl) and her older sister. <em>Parkins, </em>346 Or at 335-36. The victim saw her sister smoking a cigarette and asked where she got it. The sister said that she got it from the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 336. The victim found the defendant in a bedroom. After the victim entered the bedroom, the defendant locked the bedroom door, forced the victim onto a bed, climbed on top of her, threatened her when she tried to scream, and then struck her face and made sexual contact. <em>Id. </em>The victim escaped when her \u201csister rattled the doorknob to the locked bedroom[,]\u201d the \u201c[defendant let [her] up, and she unlocked the door and ran out of the room.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The issue on appeal, as in this case, was whether, within the meaning of ORS 163.225(l)(b), the defendant had secretly confined the victim in a place where she was \u201cnot likely to be found.\u201d The Supreme Court held that he had not. The court explained that the statutory phrase means that \u201ca person is held or restrained in a place where it is not probable that the person will be located, either accidentally or through searching. Both the words and their meaning are straightforward.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342. The court also observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">\u201cHere, the key words in the phrase at issue are \u2018secretly,\u2019 \u2018likely,\u2019 and \u2018found.\u2019 The dictionary defines \u2018secret\u2019 as \u2018kept from knowledge or view\u2019 and \u2018concealed.\u2019 \u2018Likely\u2019 means probable or \u2018having a better chance of existing or occurring than not.\u2019 \u2018Found\u2019 is the past tense of\u2018find,\u2019 which means \u2018to come upon accidentally\u2019 and \u2018to come upon * * * by searching or effort.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 342 n 2 (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>(unabridged ed 2002)) (citations omitted; alteration in <em>Parkins). </em>The court concluded that, although the evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant had \u201csecretly confined\u201d the victim (by locking the bedroom door, pinning her down, and threatening her), <em>id. </em>at 343, the evidence was insufficient to prove that the confinement had occurred in a place where the victim was not likely to be found. That was so because the victim\u2019s sister \u201ceither knew that the victim had gone to [the] bedroom, or at least would have thought that she had done so,\u201d and thus \u201cit also was probable, and thus <em>likely, </em>that the sister would have found the victim through searching.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Defendant argues that this case is materially indistinguishable from <em>Parkins </em>because, although defendant may have taken steps to \u201csecretly confine\u201d the victim, other people were aware at all times that the victim was in defendant\u2019s house and that she would likely be found there if they looked for her. The state counters by taking a different view of the record. Although defendant asserts that \u201cseveral people\u201d knew the victim\u2019s whereabouts, the state points out that the record demonstrates such knowledge by only two people (in addition to defendant): Longshore and Burgoon. Three other individuals are mentioned in the record: \u201cTrish\u201d (or Tricia), Corey, and Sonia, the victim\u2019s friend, who was in the house when police arrived. But, although Trish and Corey visited the house, a factfinder could find that neither of them was aware that the victim was present and the victim testified that Sonia arrived at the house just \u201ctwo minutes\u201d before the police did. Thus, we agree with the state that a rational factfinder could have concluded that, during the victim\u2019s two-day confinement, none of those three people had knowledge that the victim was at defendant\u2019s house or was likely to be found there.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The question thus reduces to whether Longshore\u2019s and Burgoon\u2019s knowledge of the victim\u2019s presence at defendant\u2019s house is sufficient to defeat a conclusion that the victim was \u201cnot likely to be found\u201d there for purposes of the kidnapping statute. The state argues, in essence, that just because two of defendant\u2019s friends (one of whom was a roommate) happened to know that the victim was confined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>defendant\u2019s house does not mean that she was \u201clikely to be found\u201d there. That is particularly so, reasons the state, because one could infer from the record that either Longshore or Burgoon, or both of them, were accomplices to defendant\u2019s crimes \u2014 or, at a minimum, were not inclined to help the victim or disclose her location to others. In the state\u2019s view, the statute cannot mean that \u201csecret confinement\u201d must occur in \u201ca place where the person is not likely to be found\u201d <em>by </em>anyone; otherwise, a person could evade the coverage of the statute simply by keeping an accomplice informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">We agree with the state. Although the statute does not specify <em>by whom </em>a person must be likely to be found, our charge is to construe the statute in a manner that effectuates its purpose and intent. <em>See State v. J. L. S., </em>268 Or App 829, 834, 343 P3d 670 (2015) (\u201cWhen interpreting a statute, our goal is to discern legislative intent.\u201d (Citing <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).)); <em>see also PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993) (explaining that the statutory text is \u201cthe best evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent\u201d). The text and context make it clear that the purpose of the statute is to prohibit the confinement of a person in a place where she is not likely to be found <em>by those who could reasonably be expected to assist her.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Such a reading of the statute was implicit in <em>Parkins. </em>In that case, the victim\u2019s sister had knowledge of where the victim had gone \u2014 to seek out the defendant inside the house. Under those circumstances, the victim\u2019s sister did not need to search for the victim, nor would she have come across her accidentally, as she was wholly aware of the victim\u2019s whereabouts. That knowledge was confirmed when the sister later attempted to open the bedroom door. <em>Parkins, </em>346 Or at 344. The court, therefore, did not need to consider whether the victim would have been \u201cunlikely to be found\u201d if the sister had not been prepared to come to her aid. Here, in contrast, Burgoon and Longshore knew where the victim was, knew that she had been badly injured by defendant, and took no steps to assist her.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Additionally, we have held that a victim may be \u201cnot likely to be found\u201d even in an obvious place, if assailants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>take steps to conceal the victim\u2019s whereabouts. <em>See State v. Montgomery, </em>50 Or App 381, 386, 624 P2d 151 (1981). In <em>Montgomery, </em>we held that the bathroom of the victim\u2019s own home was not a place the victim was \u201clikely to be found\u201d because the defendant and his brother had \u201cmade a calculated effort\u201d to ensure that police \u201cwould not find the victim in his own apartment and they succeeded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387. In doing so, the defendant held a knife to the victim\u2019s throat and told the victim that the defendant would cut the victim\u2019s throat if he made a sound when police came to the apartment door and inquired as to the victim\u2019s whereabouts, and the defendant\u2019s brother told police that the victim had left the premises. <em>Id. </em>at 383. Under those circumstances, we concluded, \u201cthe jury was entitled to find that defendant confined the victim in a place where he was not likely to be found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Likewise, here, defendant\u2019s actions demonstrated a \u201ccalculated effort\u201d to ensure that the victim would not be found by any observer who would help her. Defendant had concealed the victim in a bedroom over the course of two days, covered her in bedding when police arrived, and drawn the curtains and locked the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In short, it would be contrary to the statutory purpose to allow knowledge of a victim\u2019s location by a third party to defeat operation of the statute as a matter of law, regardless of that third party\u2019s identity, circumstances, and motives. <em>Parkins, </em>346 Or at 343 (\u201c[Determining whether a person was secretly confined in a place where the person is not likely to be found must take into account the circumstances of the place, the victim, and the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d). Additionally, calculated efforts to conceal a confined victim from individuals who may <em>actually </em>render aid bolsters the unlikelihood that the victim will be found. Under the circumstances of this case, therefore, it was proper for the fact-finder to decide whether defendant\u2019s bedroom was a location where the victim was \u201cnot likely to be found.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the kidnapping charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We turn next to the charge of unlawful sexual penetration. The state sought to convict defendant under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>theory that he forcibly compelled the victim to engage in sexual penetration by way of either physical force or implied threat. ORS 163.411 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">\u201c[A] person commits the crime of unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree if the person penetrates the vagina, anus or penis of another with any object other than the penis or mouth of the actor and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">\u201c(a) The victim is subjected to forcible compulsion [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">Forcible compulsion, as defined in ORS 163.305(2), means to compel by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">\u201c(a) Physical force; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">\u201c(b) A threat, express or implied, that places a person in fear of immediate or future death or physical injury to self or another person, or in fear that the person or another person will immediately or in the future be kidnapped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Thus, to prove that charge, the state had to prove not only that defendant penetrated the anus of the victim with an object but that he compelled the victim to submit to that act by way of either physical force or express or implied threats. Defendant argues that the state failed to prove either.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">We first address the \u201cphysical force\u201d prong of ORS 163.305(2)(a). To prove that a defendant used forcible compulsion by way of physical force, the state must prove: (1) that a causal connection exists between the physical force at issue and the alleged contact; and (2) that the physical force used by defendant \u201cwas greater in degree or different in kind from the simple movement and contact that is inherent in the act of touching\u201d and that that force was \u201csufficient to compel the victim to submit or engage\u201d in the alleged contact \u201cagainst the victim\u2019s will.\u201d <em>State v. Marshall, </em>350 Or 208, 227, 253 P3d 1017 (2011) (discussing forcible compulsion in the related context of first-degree sexual abuse). Any forcible compulsion alleged must result in the \u201cparticular\u201d contact at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 219 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">In <em>Marshall, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed a finding that the defendant forcibly compelled the victim, to, among other things, touch the defendant\u2019s erect penis, where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u201c[t]he state presented evidence that defendant had \u2018forced\u2019 the victim\u2019s hand down inside defendant\u2019s pants and against his erect penis, and that the victim had \u2018pulled\u2019 or \u2018jerked\u2019 her hand away. Although the sexual touching was the victim\u2019s hand touching the defendant\u2019s penis, the \u2018physical force\u2019 was defendant\u2019s use of his own hands to cause the victim to engage in that sexual contact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">350 Or at 227. In that case, however, the court rejected, the state\u2019s argument that the defendant had also forcibly compelled the victim to submit to the defendant\u2019s touching of her buttocks because \u201cnothing in the record suggests that the * * * touching itself involved any greater or different force than was inherent in that particular sexual contact\u201d when it lasted \u201ca few seconds\u201d and the defendant \u201cimmediately removed his hand\u201d when the victim said \u201cno.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228. Further, the court concluded that that \u201cforce did not restrain, trap, or physically coerce the victim in order to cause her to submit to defendant\u2019s later touching.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Turning next to the \u201cexpress or implied threat\u201d prong of ORS 163.305(b), we have explained that the plain meaning of the term \u201cthreat,\u201d in this context, means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">\u201cT: an indication of something impending usu. undesirable or unpleasant * * * a: an expression of an intent to inflict evil, injury, or damage on another usu. as retribution or punishment for something done or left undone *** b: an expression of an intention to inflict loss or harm on another by illegal means and esp. by means involving coercion or duress of the person threatened * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-9\"><em>Magel, </em>246 Or App at 730 (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2382) (boldface in <em>Webster\u2019s). </em>To prove that a defendant used forcible compulsion by way of express or implied threats, \u201cthere must be some kind of communication by the defendant to the victim of intent to inflict harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThat communication may be express, that is, directly and distinctly stated or expressed rather than implied or left to inference: not dubious or ambiguous * * * [or] [i]t may also be communicated or conveyed not by a direct, forthright statement but by allusion or reference likely to lead to [a] natural inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>We have held that a defendant\u2019s \u201cextended episode of violence directed at [a] victim\u201d may communicate \u201can intent to inflict harm on the victim that was sufficient to compel [him or] her to submit to the sexual contact at issue.\u201d <em>State v. Jimenez, </em>247 Or App 738, 745, 270 P3d 405 (2012). In <em>Jimenez, </em>the defendant was the victim\u2019s boyfriend, who, upon learning that she was spending time with a male friend, punched her in the face and kicked her while she was on the ground, among other assaultive behaviors, over the course of a day. <em>Id. </em>at 740-41. The defendant had been violent towards the victim in the past. <em>Id. </em>at 740. The defendant, during a second violent encounter on that same day, became angry with the victim, threw a drink at her, and forced her to perform oral sex on him. <em>Id. </em>at 742. After apologizing, the victim \u201cassented\u201d to having sex with the defendant, who was later convicted of first-degree rape, which includes a \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d element. <em>Id. </em>The defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal. He claimed that the state had failed to prove any forcible compulsion and instead argued that the victim had consented to sex; his motion was denied. <em>Id. </em>at 742. In affirming defendant\u2019s conviction on appeal, we reasoned that the \u201cdefendant communicated an intent to inflict harm on the victim that was sufficient to compel her to submit to the sexual contact at issue,\u201d and that \u201c[a] rational factfinder could conclude that that extended course of conduct constituted an implied threat which communicated, by natural inference, that [the] defendant would harm the victim if he was angry or if she did not comply with his demands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">In this case, defendant acknowledges that the evidence \u201csupports a finding that he inflicted a grievous assault on the victim.\u201d He contends, however, that the state failed to prove that he used forcible compulsion to commit the crime of unlawful sexual penetration because there is no evidence that indicates \u201cwhether or how that assaultive behavior related to the penetrative act.\u201d Defendant contends that the victim\u2019s testimony establishes only \u201cevidence of physical force\u201d that was \u201cfollowed, at some point, by the act of penetration.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>defendant urges, \u201crequires more than evidence that one thing followed the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>The state responds that evidence in the record supports a finding that defendant used either physical force or threats, or both, to forcibly compel the victim into the penetrative act at issue. We agree with the state that, under either theory, the record in this case is sufficient to establish forcible compulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Here, notwithstanding the victim\u2019s inability to reconstruct all that occurred in chronological detail, the record is sufficient to show that defendant committed the penetrative act in the course of an \u201cextended episode of violence,\u201d <em>Jimenez, </em>247 Or App at 745, in which the victim was threatened and severely beaten, and her freedom of movement was restrained. Defendant began his attack with physical violence, and, when the victim told defendant to stop or refused to comply with his demands, defendant engaged in additional violence, permitting a factfinder to infer a \u201ccausal connection\u201d between defendant\u2019s assaultive behavior and the penetrative act at issue. <em>Marshall, </em>350 Or at 225. The factfinder could also infer that defendant\u2019s rampant violence was \u201cgreater in degree and different in kind\u201d than the \u201cminimal force\u201d required to commit the penetrative act. <em>Id. </em>A factfinder could also rationally infer that defendant\u2019s violent conduct leading up to the penetrative act \u201cconstituted an implied threat which communicated, by natural inference, that defendant would harm the victim if he was angry or if she did not comply with his demands.\u201d <em>Jimenez, </em>247 Or App at 745. In short, a rational factfinder could determine that the penetrative act was \u201cforcibly compelled\u201d by either the physical violence that preceded it or the threat of more to come.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
