ORS 138.060(l)(c). The evidence was obtained after the police observed defendant and a companion, Jacobs, \u201cbent over a bag\u201d in front of a restaurant; initiated contact with them; implicitly denied defendant\u2019s request to go to the bathroom; asked defendant and Jacobs for identification; said \u201chang on there, or hang on a second\u201d; ran a records check that revealed an outstanding warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest; arrested defendant on the warrant; and searched defendant incident to that arrest. We conclude that the evidence was obtained after defendant was unlawfully seized in violation of his rights under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, and that the state failed to prove attenuation \u2014 that is, the state failed to prove, under the totality of the circumstances, that the violation of defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, had such a tenuous factual link to the disputed evidence that the unlawful police conduct cannot be properly viewed as the source of that evidence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact as long as there is constitutionally sufficient evidence to support them. State <em>v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 74-75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). In the absence of express factual findings, we presume that the trial court decided the disputed facts in keeping with its ultimate conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 75. On appeal, \u201c[o]ur function is to decide whether the trial court applied legal principles correctly to those facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We state the facts consistently with those standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Officer Lemons, who worked for the East Precinct street crimes unit, was on daytime patrol in Portland when he saw defendant and Jacobs, \u201cbent over a bag\u201d in front of a restaurant. Lemons was \u201cnot real sure what was going on there,\u201d so he \u201c[c]ircled back around\u201d in his patrol vehicle, \u201cintend [ing] to contact the two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">As soon as defendant and Jacobs saw Lemons circling back around, \u201cthey started walking away.\u201d In Lemons\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>experience, when people see the police and \u201cavoid police contact, something is * * * usually up.\u201d Thus, Lemons\u2019s suspicion was raised \u2014 he wondered, \u201cwhy leave the area just because of me?\u201d However, at that point, Lemons did not believe that he had \u201creasonable suspicion to actually stop [defendant] for a crime.\u201d In fact, Lemons \u201cdefinitely [did not] think [he had] a crime.\u201d Rather, he had a \u201chunch,\u201d and he wanted \u201cto know who these folks [were] and why they [were] wanting to leave the area because [Lemons was] there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Lemons parked his patrol vehicle, got out of the vehicle, and began walking toward defendant and Jacobs. During his approach, Lemons said something to the effect of, \u201c\u2018Hey, what\u2019s going on, guys?\u201d\u2019 As Lemons continued to walk toward defendant and Jacobs, defendant and Jacobs came back toward Lemons. Lemons then asked the men \u201cwhat they were up to\u201d and \u201casked what was in the bag.\u201d The men responded that the bag contained cans, and, although Lemons did not open the bag, he had \u201cno reason to doubt\u201d that the bag contained cans. Defendant then told Lemons that \u201che ha[d] to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Lemons did not directly respond to defendant\u2019s request to go to the bathroom; instead, Lemons asked defendant and Jacobs for identification. Defendant, who did not have an identification card, told Lemons his name and date of birth, and Lemons apparently wrote that information down in a notebook. Jacobs handed Lemons an identification card, which Lemons retained. Lemons then told defendant and Jacobs to \u201chang on there, or hang on a second.\u201d Lemons returned to his patrol vehicle to run a records check. While Lemons was at his patrol vehicle running the records check, Officer Slyder and another officer arrived as backup. At some point, Officer Edwards arrived as backup, apparently along with his partner, Officer Strawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The records check revealed an outstanding warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest. Lemons did not know about the warrant before he ran the records check, and he did not later recall what the warrant was for. If Lemons had not discovered the outstanding warrant, he would have \u201clet [defendant] go on his way\u201d \u2014 that is, he \u201cwould have let him know that he was free to leave\u201d because he \u201chad no reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>to arrest him.\u201d Instead, Slyder informed defendant that he would be taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Defendant was asked whether there was anything on him that Lemons was going to find, and defendant said that he \u201cmight have\u201d marijuana or \u201ccrystal\u201d on him. Lemons advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, searched a \u201ccoin pocket\u201d on defendant\u2019s jeans, and found a folded piece of paper containing a substance that later tested positive for methamphetamine. Defendant was subsequently charged with unlawful possession of methamphetamine, in violation of ORS 475.894(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">As the case proceeded to trial, defendant moved to suppress the \u201cevidence discovered subsequent to the illegal detention [,]\u201d arguing that the evidence was obtained in violation of his rights under Article I, section 9, and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically, defendant argued that he was unlawfully seized when Lemons conducted a records check on him and that the discovery of the outstanding warrant did not \u201c \u2018purge the taint\u2019 \u201d of the unlawful seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">At a hearing on the matter, the state responded that defendant was not seized and alternatively argued that, even if defendant was seized, suppression was not warranted because the discovery of the outstanding warrant \u201ccreate [d] an attenuation.\u201d To support its attenuation argument, the state relied upon <em>State v. Dempster, </em>248 Or 404, 408, 434 P2d 746 (1967), in which the Oregon Supreme Court concluded that the lawful arrest of the defendant on an outstanding warrant \u201cpurged the search incident thereto of the taint of any illegality in the detention of defendant prior to that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Relating to seizure, the trial court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">\u201c[U]nder these facts and circumstances, the officer did not have a reasonable suspicion or probable cause. And I would find that walking up to these gentlemen, making this inquiry, taking identification, going back to the car leads me to a reasonable assumption with him saying hang on there, or hang on a second that he is being stopped and he is not free to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u201cThere\u2019s other officers showing up. No reasonable person, I would find under the totality of circumstances, would feel free to leave. And, in fact, I don\u2019t think he was free to leave because had he started walking off, I\u2019ll bet you the officer would have grabbed him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\">\u201cSo I\u2019m comfortable this was an unlawful stop by the police officers and he was stopped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The trial court then reviewed both state and federal case law, commenting on both state and federal constitutional theories of suppression. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">\u201cNothing stops a police officer from having contact with citizens and talking to them and asking questions. It only becomes an issue when the police use some illegality by requiring a person to do something that they have a lawful right not to do. And then when they intend to use that evidence as \u2014 as a result of exploitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201cSo the question for me is do I think that the Courts are moving towards excluding tainted evidence or moving towards allowing more tainted evidence in so that people that have warrants out or commit a crime should be punished for what they did?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">After noting that the \u201ctrend of the law is moving towards excluding this evidence [,]\u201d the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">\u201cAnd I would find that, based on the evidence and circumstances that I\u2019ve heard, that the State has not met its burden and convinced me that this evidence is not tainted and I think because of the illegality, they exploited an illegal stop of the defendant and I am going to suppress the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">The state now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">On appeal, the state essentially reprises its arguments under both Article I, section 9, and the Fourth Amendment. Thus, we must first determine whether defendant was seized in violation of his constitutional rights. If we conclude that a constitutional violation occurred, we must then consider whether the state proved attenuation \u2014 that is, whether the state proved that the violation of defendant\u2019s rights had such a tenuous factual link to the disputed evidence that the unlawful police conduct cannot be properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>viewed as the source of that evidence. We consider questions of state law first. <em>See State v. Kennedy, </em>295 Or 260, 262-63, 666 P2d 1316 (1983) (court considers and disposes of questions of state law before reaching federal law claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Article I, section 9, provides that the people have the right \u201cto be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure!.]\u201d When construing Article I, section 9, the Oregon Supreme Court \u201chas identified three categories of encounters along the continuum of meetings between law enforcement officers and citizens!.]\u201d <em>State v. Holmes, </em>311 Or 400, 407, 813 P2d 28 (1991). Those categories are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201c(1) a mere conversation or noncoercive encounter that involves no restraint of liberty and, therefore, is not a seizure that requires any justification; (2) a stop, which is a type of seizure that occurs when an officer temporarily restrains a person\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement, that must be justified by reasonable suspicion of criminal activity; and (3) an arrest, which also is a type of seizure, that must be justified by probable cause to believe that the person arrested has committed a crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\"><em>State v. Toevs, </em>327 Or 525, 534-35, 964 P2d 1007 (1998) (citing <em>Holmes, </em>311 Or at 407).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The Oregon Supreme Court has also acknowledged that, \u201cin practice, the line between a mere encounter and something that rises to the level of a seizure does not lend itself to easy demarcation.\u201d <em>State v. Backstrand, </em>354 Or 392, 399, 313 P3d 1084 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). On the one hand, police officers are \u201cfree to approach persons on the street or in public places, seek their cooperation or assistance, request or impart information, or question them without being called upon to articulate a certain level of suspicion in justification if a particular encounter proves fruitful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400 (citing <em>Holmes, </em>311 Or at 410). Thus, \u201c[t]he fact that the citizen is discomforted by an officer\u2019s approach and request for assistance or information \u2014 either because / the officer is a known police officer, or because the encounter otherwise involves \u2018inconvenience or annoyance\u2019 \u2014 does not make the contact a seizure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Holmes, </em>311 Or at 410).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>On the other hand, a seizure occurs only if the officer\u2019s conduct would be \u201creasonably perceived as coercive in the sense that it would cause [a] citizen to reasonably believe that the officer is intentionally restraining the citizen\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement in a significant way \u2014 that is, in a way that exceeds the bounds of ordinary social encounters between private citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a \u201cshow of authority\u201d that gives rise to a seizure in the constitutional sense, a person must have \u201ca reasonable perception that [the] officer is exercising his or her official authority to restrain\u201d \u2014 that is, a seizure occurs when an officer conveys, either explicitly or implicitly, \u201cto the person with whom he is dealing, either by word, action, or both, that the person is not free to terminate the encounter or otherwise go about his or her ordinary affairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401 (internal quotation marks omitted). The test is an objective one, and is determined under the totality of the circumstances: \u201cWould a reasonable person believe that a law enforcement officer intentionally and significantly restricted, interfered with, or otherwise deprived the individual of his or her liberty or freedom of movement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">In <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 10, 115 P3d 908 (2005), an officer saw the defendant walking along a street, stopped his vehicle next to the defendant, and then motioned with two fingers for the defendant to approach him. When the defendant approached, the officer got out of his vehicle and asked the defendant if he had any personal identification. <em>Id. </em>The defendant handed the officer an identification card, which the officer used to run a warrant check. <em>Id. </em>The officer returned the identification card to the defendant \u201cbefore he had received back any information [.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Noticing that the defendant appeared to be carrying something inside his jacket, the officer then asked the defendant if he was carrying any weapons, knives, or illegal drugs, and the defendant, after replying in the negative, consented to a patdown search, during which the officer discovered a controlled substance. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The Oregon Supreme Court determined that the meeting at issue in <em>Hall </em>began as a noncoercive encounter between the defendant and the officer but then evolved into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>a seizure. <em>Id. </em>at 19. As the court explained, the officer\u2019s \u201cinitial actions of stopping his vehicle next to defendant and then gesturing for defendant to approach him did not intrude upon defendant\u2019s liberty of movement, because, even if [the officer] inconvenienced defendant, his actions did not constitute a show of authority involving conduct significantly beyond that accepted in ordinary social intercourse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). But the court concluded that \u201cthe consensual nature of that encounter dissipated\u201d when the officer took the defendant\u2019s identification card and radioed for a warrant check. <em>Id. </em>The court acknowledged that the officer promptly returned the defendant\u2019s identification card, but maintained that, at that point, the defendant was aware that he was the subject of a pending warrant check and, because of that fact, it was \u201cdifficult to posit\u201d that a reasonable person would have felt free to leave \u201cwhen that person is the investigatory subject of a pending warrant check.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The court in <em>Hall </em>further observed that the officer \u201cdid nothing to dispel what would have been an objectively reasonable belief that defendant was restrained from leaving until [the officer] had received the results of the warrant check.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When later commenting on its seizure analysis in <em>Hall, </em>the court stated that \u201cnone of the officer\u2019s actions (hailing defendant, asking for identification, checking that identification, asking about weapons and drugs, asking for consent) individually was sufficient to amount to a stop. In combination, however, *** those actions crossed over the line and transformed what began as a mere encounter into a stop.\u201d <em>State v. Highley, </em>354 Or 459, 473, 313 P3d 1068 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In <em>Backstrand, </em>a deputy was monitoring a \u201c \u2018triple-X\u2019 \u201d store that sold adult sexual materials while the defendant and his girlfriend were inside shopping. 354 Or at 394-95. The deputy thought that the defendant looked \u201c\u2018pretty young\u2019\u201d and believed he might be under the posted 18-year minimum age to be in the store, and so he approached the two and asked their ages. <em>Id. </em>at 395. After the defendant answered that he was 22, the deputy asked both the defendant and his girlfriend if they had any identification, and they gave him their driver licenses. <em>Id. </em>The deputy called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>dispatch to verify the validity of the licenses, and, after having the licenses for 10 to 15 seconds, returned the licenses to the defendant and his girlfriend. <em>Id. </em>The deputy then left the store and continued to monitor the store from outside, while the defendant and his girlfriend continued to shop inside. <em>Id. </em>The deputy, who had not asked dispatch to check on anything other than the validity of the licenses, was then advised by dispatch that the defendant\u2019s license was suspended and the defendant was on probation in another county. <em>Id. </em>After the defendant later drove away from the store, the deputy initiated a traffic stop and arrested the defendant for driving with a suspended license. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The Oregon Supreme Court determined that the encounter at issue in <em>Backstrand </em>was not a seizure. <em>Id. </em>at 413-16. Regarding a request for identification, the court stated that \u201c[a]sking a citizen to identify himself or herself and to show police a formal piece of identification is a form of cooperation and involves the kind of information that, as a general proposition, police are free to request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412. However, the court noted that \u201cwhen the content of the questions, the manner of asking them, or other actions that police take (along with the circumstances in which they take them) would convey to a reasonable person that the police are exercising their authority to coercively detain the citizen, then the encounter rises to the level of a seizure, the lawfulness of which must be analyzed as such.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Regarding verification of identification, the court stated that the verification of a citizen\u2019s identification does not, in and of itself, elevate a mere encounter into a seizure, because there was \u201cno principled basis for concluding that, when an officer checks the validity of a proffered identity or piece of identification, such an action <em>per se </em>conveys to a reasonable person \u2014 who is not otherwise restrained and who has willingly tendered the information to the officer that the officer is now exercising his or her authority to coercively restrain the person\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Applying those principles to the circumstances presented in <em>Backstrand, </em>the court stated that asking a person his or her age in an age-restricted store \u201cwould not cause a reasonable person to believe that the officer had <em>significantly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>restricted his or her liberty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414 (emphasis in original). The court then stated that \u201cthere was nothing distinctive about the content of [the deputy\u2019s] questions\u201d or the manner of his request that caused his mere inquiries to amount to a seizure. <em>Id. </em>at 415-16. The court further stated that there was nothing in the record \u201cto suggest that [the deputy] was overbearing, intimidating, or coercive in his demeanor or behavior\u201d and that the deputy \u201cmerely asked for, and defendant complied with, his request for identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">With the circumstances of those cases in mind, we return to the facts of this case. Under the principles articulated in <em>Backstrand, </em>the mere fact that Lemons requested defendant\u2019s identification does not, by itself, indicate that defendant was seized, nor does the fact that Lemons ran a records check. However, that conclusion does not end our analysis; under <em>Backstrand, </em>we must analyze whether \u201cthe content of the questions, the manner of asking them, or other actions that police [took] (along with the circumstances in which they [took] them) would convey to a reasonable person that the police [were] exercising their authority to coercively detain the citizen [.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">When analyzing the circumstances in this case, we first note that Lemons\u2019s initial conduct \u2014 approaching defendant and Jacobs while saying something to the effect of, \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on, guys?\u201d and then asking \u201cwhat they were up to\u201d and \u201cwhat was in the bag\u201d \u2014 did not effectuate a seizure because, even if Lemons inconvenienced defendant by changing his direction of travel, Lemons\u2019s initial conduct would not cause a citizen to reasonably believe that Lemons was exercising his authority to coercively detain the citizen or intentionally restrain the citizen\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement in a significant way \u2014 that is, in a way that exceeded the bounds of ordinary social encounters between private citizens. <em>See Hall, </em>339 Or at 19 (concluding that the officer\u2019s \u201cinitial actions of stopping his vehicle next to defendant and then gesturing for defendant to approach him did not intrude upon defendant\u2019s liberty of movement, because, even if [the officer] inconvenienced defendant, his actions did not constitute a show of authority involving conduct significantly beyond that accepted in ordinary social intercourse\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>However, under all the circumstances surrounding the encounter as it developed in this case, we conclude that defendant was unlawfully seized by the time that Lemons told defendant and Jacobs to \u201chang on there, or hang on a second.\u201d Arguably, the trial court reasonably could infer that the encounter had lost its consensual nature even before then \u2014 that is, when Lemons requested defendant\u2019s identification. That is so because, by that point, defendant had sent Lemons a signal that he did not wish to have a police encounter by walking away from Lemons; returned and complied with Lemons\u2019s request for information about contents of the bag; and then sent Lemons a more explicit signal that he wanted to leave by stating, directly, that he needed to go to the bathroom. Because Lemons did not address defendant\u2019s request to go to the bathroom but, instead, responded by asking defendant for identification, perhaps the trial court could reasonably have inferred from those circumstances that Lemons had restrained defendant\u2019s liberty by means of a show of authority \u2014 that is, by implicitly denying defendant\u2019s request to go to the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">We need not determine whether defendant was unlawfully seized when Lemons requested defendant\u2019s identification, however, because \u2014 even if he was not \u2014 the trial court reasonably could infer that the encounter evolved into a seizure when Lemons took additional actions that culminated in a communication that the trial court described as \u201chang on there, or hang on a second.\u201d As we understand the trial court\u2019s finding, it is that Lemons conveyed, through his words and actions, that defendant and Jacobs should remain until Lemons could return after checking the identification. By that point in time, the police conduct (approaching defendant and Jacobs while they were walking away from Lemons in an attempt to avoid police contact; asking for information about the contents of the bag; after receiving information about the contents of the bag, implicitly denying defendant\u2019s request to go to the bathroom; asking defendant for identification after defendant had communicated a need to go to the bathroom; recording defendant\u2019s identifying information in a notebook and retaining a companion\u2019s identification card; telling defendant and Jacobs to \u201chang on there, or hang on a second\u201d; and running a records check while as many as two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>additional patrol vehicles and four additional police officers were arriving on the scene) would have communicated to a reasonable person that the person was not free to terminate the encounter or decline when Lemons communicated that the person should \u201chang on there, or hang on a second.\u201d In other words, we conclude that a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would not feel free to leave and that defendant was seized in violation of his rights under Article I, section 9, because the actions of the police, when viewed in light of the trial court\u2019s findings, \u201ccrossed over the line and transformed what began as a mere encounter into a stop.\u201d <em>Highley, </em>354 Or at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">When the state has obtained evidence following the violation of a defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, we presume \u201cthat the evidence was tainted by the violation and must be suppressed.\u201d <em>State v. Jackson, </em>268 Or App 139, 151, 342 P3d 119 (2014) (citing <em>State v. Unger, </em>356 Or 59, 84, 333 P3d 1009 (2014)). The state may rebut that presumption by proving, as relevant here, that the police did not exploit the unlawful police conduct to obtain the challenged evidence\u2014 that is, that the unlawful police conduct was \u201cindependent of, or only tenuously related to\u201d the disputed evidence. <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 35; <em>see Unger, </em>356 Or at 84 (adhering to that requirement, as stated in <em>Hall). </em>Stated another way, the evidence in this case must be suppressed unless the state proves attenuation \u2014 that is, that the violation of defendant\u2019s rights had such a tenuous factual link to the disputed evidence that the unlawful police conduct cannot be properly viewed as the source of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">At the suppression hearing, when arguing that the evidence need not be suppressed, the state relied upon the <em>per se </em>rule of attenuation set forth in <em>Dempster, </em>248 Or at 404. In <em>Dempster, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court concluded, under the Fourth Amendment, that the lawful arrest of the defendant on an outstanding warrant \u201cpurged the search incident thereto of the taint of any illegality in the detention of defendant prior to that time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408. We later applied <em>Dempster </em>in <em>State v. Snyder, </em>72 Or App 359, 695 P2d 958, <em>rev den, </em>299 Or 251 (1985), and the <em>\u201cDempster/Snyder </em>rule\u201d became the basis for determining, under Article I, section 9, the legal effect of the discovery and execution of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>outstanding arrest warrant in cases involving prior unlawful police conduct. <em>See, e.g., State v. Langston, </em>223 Or App 590, 594-95, 196 P3d 84 (2008) (\u201c [a]pplying the Dempster/<em>Snyder </em>rule to [the] case,\u201d and concluding, under Article I, section 9, that \u201cthe discovery and execution of the outstanding warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest purged the taint of, any prior unlawful stop\u201d); <em>State v. Allen, </em>222 Or App 71, 78-79, 191 P3d 762, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 503 (2008) (citing <em>Dempster </em>and <em>Snyder </em>and concluding, under Article I, section 9, \u201cthat the intervening and independent event of the discovery of the outstanding arrest warrants operated to attenuate the taint of the prior unlawful arrest\u201d); <em>State v. La France, </em>219 Or App 548, 557-59, 184 P3d 1169 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 664 (2009) (setting forth the <em>Dempster </em>and <em>Snyder </em>principle \u201cthat the existence of an outstanding arrest warrant can serve to attenuate the link between a police illegality and evidence discovered thereafter [,]\u201d and concluding, under Article I, section 9, that the record was \u201cinadequate for us to apply the rule <em>o\u00ed Dempster </em>and <em>Snyder\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">However, after the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress in this case, the Oregon Supreme Court disavowed its holding in <em>Dempster, </em>stating that <em>\u201cDempster\u2019s per se </em>rule is inconsistent with the subsequent development of the Fourth Amendment attenuation exception set out in <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 US 590, 95 S Ct 2254, 45 L Ed 2d 416 (1975), where the United States Supreme Court rejected such an approach.\u201d <em>State v. Bailey, </em>356 Or 486, 488, 338 P3d 702 (2014). Rather than applying <em>Dempster\u2019s per se </em>rule of attenuation, the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>Bailey </em>applied <em>Brown\u2019s </em>three-factor test to determine, under the Fourth Amendment, whether the causal connection between the unlawful police conduct and the challenged evidence was sufficiently attenuated so as to purge the taint of the illegality. <em>Id. </em>at 505-06. Those factors are (1) the temporal proximity between the unlawful police conduct and the discovery of the challenged evidence; (2) the presence of intervening circumstances; and (3) the purpose and flagrancy of the unlawful police conduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">To resolve this case under Article I, section 9, we must first decide whether our holding in <em>Snyder </em>can still be considered good law. In <em>Snyder, </em>the defendant appealed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence that was obtained after the defendant was taken to the police station and arrested on an outstanding warrant. 72 Or App at 363. The trial court had denied the motion, in part, on the ground that the discovery of the outstanding warrant \u201cpurged the evidence of taint from prior illegality, if any.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agreed with the trial court on that ground and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">\u201cUnder <em>State v. Dempster, </em>248 Or 404, 434 P2d 746 (1967), [the officer\u2019s] discovery of the arrest warrant and his arrest of defendant under the warrant\u2019s authority purged the evidence from the taint of prior illegality. The Supreme Court in <em>Dempster </em>assumed that the police may have unlawfully taken the defendant to the police station. While the defendant was there, an officer discovered a bench warrant for his arrest. The officer then conducted a search incident to the arrest and found narcotics and related paraphernalia on the defendant\u2019s person. The court held that the intervening discovery of the bench warrant dissipated the taint of the illegal detention because \u2018when the sergeant found the warrant he was bound to obey its command and arrest defendant.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 364 (quoting <em>Dempster, </em>248 Or at 407). We then rejected the defendant\u2019s attempts to distinguish <em>Dempster. Id. </em>at 364-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Our review of <em>Snyder </em>demonstrates that in <em>Snyder </em>we did not consider or evaluate <em>Dempster\u2019s </em>animating principles, and we did not separately analyze whether <em>Dempster\u2019s per se </em>attenuation rule should be applied in the context of Article I, section 9. Rather, we merely cited <em>Dempster </em>and, without stating whether we were conducting a state or federal constitutional analysis, agreed with the trial court\u2019s conclusion, under <em>Dempster, </em>that the discovery of an outstanding \u201cwarrant purged the evidence of taint from prior illegality, if any.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363-64. Accordingly, <em>Snyder </em>does not rely on its own analysis, but relies solely on <em>Dempster, </em>which has now been disavowed. Because our holding in <em>Snyder </em>cannot stand without <em>Dempster, </em>its decisional precedent, we conclude that our holding in <em>Snyder </em>can no longer be considered good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Having concluded that our holding in <em>Snyder </em>can no longer be considered good law, we must now address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>parties\u2019 arguments as to whether it is appropriate to apply <em>Bailey </em>or <em>Unger </em>in the context of Article I, section 9. The state argues that, although <em>Bailey </em>is a Fourth Amendment case, the attenuation analysis set forth in <em>Brown </em>and adopted by <em>Bailey </em>is similar or identical under Article I, section 9, apparently suggesting that we should apply the three-factor <em>Brown </em>test to resolve this case: the temporal proximity between the unlawful police conduct and the discovery of the challenged evidence; the presence of intervening circumstances; and the purpose and flagrancy of the unlawful police conduct. Defendant argues that the Article I, section 9, attenuation analysis should be conducted under the exploitation test established by <em>Hall </em>and modified by <em>Unger, </em>contending that we should consider the totality of the circumstances, with reference to five considerations: the temporal proximity between the unlawful police conduct and the discovery of the challenged evidence; the presence of mitigating circumstances; the presence of intervening circumstances; the purpose and flagrancy of the unlawful police conduct; and the nature and extent of the constitutional violation. <em>See Unger, </em>356 Or at 86 (summarizing considerations that are relevant to the exploitation inquiry). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that it is appropriate to apply the exploitation analysis portion of the <em>Unger </em>test to determine, under the totality of the circumstances, the legal effect of the discovery and execution of an outstanding warrant on prior unlawful police conduct under Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">First, as the Oregon Supreme Court has explained, \u201cthe overarching inquiry\u201d in <em>Unger </em>was \u201cwhether the evidence that the state [sought] to introduce must be suppressed because that evidence was obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d Id. at 85. Thus, although <em>Unger </em>involved the question whether evidence must be suppressed following a defendant\u2019s consent to search, rather than the question whether evidence must be suppressed following the discovery and execution of an outstanding arrest warrant, the overarching inquiry in <em>Unger </em>is the same as the overarching inquiry in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Second, the totality of the circumstances test, as expressed in <em>Hall, </em>has long served as the legal foundation for determining whether the discovery of an outstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>warrant operates to attenuate the taint of the prior illegality under Article I, section 9, and the <em>Dempster!Snyder </em>rule has been applied within its framework. <em>Allen </em>is exemplary. In <em>Allen, </em>\u201c[t]he state appeal [ed] the trial court\u2019s pretrial order under Article I, section 9, * * * granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress all evidence obtained by the police resulting from a contact with defendant that ended with his arrest on outstanding arrest warrants, including items seized after the search of his jacket.\u201d 222 Or App at 73. When addressing the suppression issue in <em>Allen, </em>we first noted that, \u201c [i] n <em>Hall, </em>the [Oregon Supreme C]ourt explained how Oregon\u2019s exclusionary rule operates in these circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77. We then framed the issue as whether \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances, the state ha[d] carried its burden under <em>Hall </em>to prove that the preceding violation of defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, ha[d] such a tenuous factual link to the disputed evidence that the unlawful police conduct cannot be viewed properly as the source of that evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78. When conducting that totality of the circumstances inquiry, we considered the state\u2019s \u201ccontention that the discovery of the arrest warrants purged the taint of the unlawful arrest\u201d based on <em>Dempster </em>and <em>Snyder, </em>\u201cwhere we and the Supreme Court held that the existence of an outstanding arrest warrant can serve to attenuate the link between a police illegality and evidence discovered thereafter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78-79. We ultimately concluded, \u201cas we did in <em>Snyder, </em>that the intervening and independent event of the discovery of the outstanding arrest warrant operated to attenuate the taint of the prior unlawful arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Although the test that we apply in this case must be modified to reflect recent changes in the law, including <em>Unger\u2019s </em>partial disavowal and modification of <em>Hall </em>and our conclusion that our holding in <em>Snyder </em>can no longer be considered good law, as well as the specific context of this case, we see no reason to deviate from our established analytical framework, which was developed under Article I, section 9, and designed to serve its aims. <em>See Hall, </em>339 Or at 24 (stating, while developing its two-part suppression test, that \u201cthe aim of the Oregon exclusionary rule is to restore a defendant to the same position as if the government\u2019s officers had stayed within the law\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>We thus apply the exploitation analysis portion of the <em>Unger </em>test to determine whether the state proved, under the totality of the circumstances, that the violation of defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, had such a tenuous factual link to the disputed evidence that the unlawful police conduct cannot be properly viewed as the source of that evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The underlying question in the exploitation inquiry is \u201cwhether police \u2018exploited\u2019 or \u2018took advantage of or \u2018traded on\u2019 their unlawful conduct\u201d to obtain the challenged evidence, or \u2014 stated another way \u2014 whether the challenged evidence was \u201c\u2018tainted\u2019 because it was \u2018derived from\u2019 or was a \u2018product of the unlawful conduct.\u201d <em>Unger, </em>356 Or at 80. In this case, we focus on the temporal proximity between the unlawful police conduct and the discovery of the challenged evidence; the presence of mitigating circumstances; the presence of intervening circumstances; the purpose and flagrancy of the unlawful police conduct; and the nature, extent, and severity of the constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">We first consider temporal proximity. <em>See id. </em>at 86 (identifying temporal proximity as a consideration in the exploitation analysis). In this case, although the state presented no direct evidence as to how much time elapsed between the unlawful seizure of defendant and the discovery of the challenged evidence, it appears that those two events occurred in close proximity to one another. After Lemons unlawfully conveyed, through his words and actions, that defendant and Jacobs should remain until Lemons could return, Lemons walked back to his patrol vehicle, ran the records check, and returned with Slyder, who placed defendant under arrest. Thus, the first consideration \u2014 temporal proximity \u2014 suggests that there was no extended temporal break that may have served to attenuate the factual link between the unlawful seizure and the discovery of the evidence, and the first consideration weighs in favor of suppression. <em>See State v. Clemons, </em>267 Or App 695, 701, 341 P3d 810 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>(2014) (concluding under the Fourth Amendment that the first factor \u2014 temporal proximity \u2014 weighed in favor of suppression because little or no time had elapsed between the unlawful extension of a traffic stop and the discovery of the evidence at issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">We next consider the existence of any mitigating circumstances. <em>See Unger, </em>356 Or at 86 (identifying mitigating circumstances as a consideration in the exploitation analysis). In this case, the state does not argue that any mitigating circumstances occurred between the unlawful police conduct and the discovery of the evidence and presented no evidence of any mitigating circumstances. For example, defendant was not told that he was not required to remain while Lemons ran a records check or that he was free to go to the bathroom, as he had requested. <em>See State v. Kuschnick, </em>269 Or App 198, 211, 344 P3d 480 (2015) (applying <em>Unger </em>and stating that the parties agreed that there were no mitigating circumstances to separate the defendant\u2019s \u201cconsent from the unlawful police conduct: Defendant was not told that he could simply remain in the car or that he could refuse to consent to the search\u201d). Thus, the second consideration \u2014 the absence of any mitigating circumstances \u2014 weighs in favor of suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We next consider the existence of any intervening circumstances. <em>See Unger, </em>356 Or at 86 (identifying intervening circumstances as a consideration in the exploitation analysis). The posited intervening circumstance here is the discovery of the arrest warrant, which provided a lawful basis for defendant\u2019s arrest and subsequent search incident to arrest and, under the <em>Dempster/Snyder </em>rule, would have independently operated to purge the taint of the unlawful police conduct. Now that the <em>Dempster I Snyder </em>rule is no longer good law, we are left to consider the significance of the discovery of the warrant as an intervening circumstance case by case.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">When considering how to view the strength of the causal connection between an unlawful seizure and the challenged evidence in the context of Article I, section 9, we apply the reasoning of the Oregon Supreme Court, in the context of the Fourth Amendment, that \u201cthe weight assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>to the discovery of the arrest warrant depends on the degree to which it was the direct consequence or objective of the unlawful detention.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>356 Or at 505-06. We reiterate the facts that defendant initially attempted to walk away from Lemons \u2014 that is, to \u201cavoid police contact\u201d \u2014 and then later, after returning to answer Lemons\u2019s question about the contents of the bag, stated that he had to go to the bathroom. Thus, viewing the record in keeping with the trial court\u2019s findings, if Lemons had not taken actions that culminated in a communication that the trial court described as \u201chang on there, or hang on a second,\u201d defendant would have terminated the encounter with Lemons. Accordingly, the discovery and execution of the outstanding warrant was the direct consequence of the unlawful detention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, although it does not appear that the discovery of the warrant was a specific objective of the unlawful detention, as Lemons did not know of the existence of the warrant before running the records check, the discovery of the arrest warrant was a general objective of the unlawful detention because, as we discuss below, the nature of the unlawful detention was investigatory. Thus, the third consideration \u2014 the presence of intervening circumstances \u2014 weighs in favor of suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">We next consider the purpose and flagrancy of the unlawful police conduct. <em>See Unger, </em>356 Or at 86 (identifying \u201cthe purpose and flagrancy of the misconduct\u201d as a consideration in the exploitation analysis). Our task is to objectively evaluate the circumstances, focusing on \u201cstatements made by the [officers] and the undisputed facts surrounding the contact with defendant,\u201d rather than their \u201csubjective intent or motivations.\u201d <em>Unger, </em>356 Or at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In this case, the trial court made no express factual finding as to the purpose of the unlawful police conduct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>However, while the prosecutor was arguing that defendant had not been seized, the trial court and the prosecutor engaged in the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And then the next question is whether or not the officer\u2019s request that he stay there, would that convert this to a stop. And I don\u2019t believe that, as the officer has termed this, that would amount to a significant enough show of authority that a reasonable person would feel that they were stopped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>What other purpose would there be to</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\"><em>getting his name and address and going back to his car? </em>If you can think of one, I\u2019d appreciate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201c [PROSECUTOR]: I don\u2019t know \u2014 I think I\u2019d be speculating. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d have to ask the officer. We could call him back if you\u2019d like to hear more about that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, no. I was just thinking maybe you thought there was another reason he might do that. <em>The only reason I can think of is that he was going to run a records check </em>and that\u2019s what the defendant probably thought. I\u2019m just assuming that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">(Emphases added.) Thus, the trial court inferred that the purpose of the unlawful police conduct was to run a records check \u2014 a process that is, by nature, investigatory. That inference is reasonable in this case, because Lemons told defendant and Jacobs to \u201chang on there, or hang on a second,\u201d conveying, through his words and actions, that defendant and Jacobs should remain until Lemons could return after checking the identification. We therefore conclude that the purpose of the unlawful seizure was investigatory \u2014 that is, it was a \u201c\u2018shot in the dark\u2019\u201d to see what might turn up. <em>See State v. Musser, </em>356 Or 148, 159, 335 P3d 814 (2014) (as part of an analysis leading to the conclusion that \u201cthe police improperly exploited their unlawful stop of defendant to obtain her consent to [a] search,\u201d applying the purpose factor under Article I, section 9, and deciding that the purpose of the unlawful stop \u201capparently was a \u2018shot in the dark\u2019 to check for criminal activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">Further, Lemons\u2019s unlawful seizure of defendant may be characterized as flagrant, in the sense that it was a fishing expedition that occurred after defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>communicated a need to go to the bathroom and while Lemons felt, as he later affirmed, that there was no basis \u201cto investigate an actual crime.\u201d Lemons\u2019s conduct here is analogous to the conduct of the officer in <em>Clemons, </em>who \u201cwas engaged in a purposeful and flagrant fishing expedition\u201d in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment, when he unlawfully extended a traffic stop without probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe that a crime had been committed. 267 Or App at 702. Thus, the fourth consideration \u2014 the purpose and flagrancy of the unlawful police conduct \u2014 weighs in favor of suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Finally, we consider the nature, extent, and severity of the constitutional violation. <em>See Unger, </em>356 Or at 86 (identifying \u201cthe nature, extent, and severity of the constitutional violation\u201d as a consideration in the exploitation analysis). In <em>Unger, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court explained that \u201c [i] f the conduct is intrusive, extended, or severe, it is more likely to influence improperly a defendant\u2019s consent to search. In contrast, where the nature and severity of the violation is limited, so too may be the extent to which the defendant\u2019s consent is \u2018tainted.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81. As we recently explained in <em>Kuschnick, </em>three recent cases decided by that court\u2014 <em>Unger, State v. Lorenzo, </em>356 Or 134, 335 P3d 821 (2014), and <em>Musser </em>\u2014 \u201cilluminate [a] qualitative, fact-intensive distinction\u201d involved in the consideration of the \u201cnature, extent, and severity of the constitutional violation\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\u201cIn both <em>Unger </em>and <em>Lorenzo, </em>the court concluded that the police misconduct was limited rather than severe. In <em>Unger, </em>four officers, who were investigating a complaint about drug activity, unlawfully trespassed on the defendant\u2019s property when they followed a path around to the defendant\u2019s back door, where the defendant eventually consented to their entry. The court reasoned that, although the officers had conducted an unlawful \u2018search\u2019 to reach the back door, they had interacted with the defendant \u2018just as they would have at the front door,\u2019 their conduct \u2018did not rise to the level of an unlawful arrest or stop,\u2019 and they \u2018did not unlawfully enter [the] defendant\u2019s home or ignore any gates or no trespassing signs.\u2019 <em>Unger, </em>356 Or at 89, 92. In <em>Lorenzo, </em>an officer, who was concerned for the defendant\u2019s safety, opened the defendant\u2019s apartment door and reached in to knock on a bedroom door in order to contact the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>defendant, who later consented to the officer\u2019s entry. The officer\u2019s unlawful search, the court explained, \u2018was limited in time and severity\u2019 \u2014 it ended before the officer requested consent to enter the apartment \u2014 and \u2018did not demonstrate any effort to control or direct [the] defendant.\u2019 <em>Lorenzo, </em>356 Or at 143-44.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">\u201cThe court contrasted those minimal intrusions with more severe police misconduct in <em>Musser. </em>There, an officer saw the defendant walking at night in a high-crime area behind a shopping center, and the officer, without reasonable suspicion, called out to her, stopped her, and later requested to search her purse during the stop. The court observed that, in <em>Musser, </em>\u2018the police order to [the] defendant to return and talk to the police, rather than to continue in the direction she was heading, clearly indicated to [the] defendant that she had no choice but to respond to the order, bringing her significantly under the control of the police.\u2019 <em>Musser, </em>356 Or at 157. That unlawful stop \u2018was a more severe violation of [the] defendant\u2019s rights than the violation in <em>Unger, </em>which was a daytime trespass onto the defendant\u2019s property that allowed the police to contact the defendant at his back door, or the similar conduct in <em>Lorenzo, </em>where the officer reached into the defendant\u2019s apartment to knock on the defendant\u2019s bedroom door in an effort to contact him because of concern for his safety.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 156.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">269 Or App at 213-14 (some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Based on our analysis of <em>Unger, Lorenzo, </em>and <em>Musser </em>in <em>Kuschnick, </em>we believe that the unlawful police conduct in this case is more accurately characterized as intrusive or severe, rather than limited. A court, when analyzing the nature of unlawful police conduct preceding a defendant\u2019s consent to search, may consider whether that conduct was merely incidental to the later consent, as in <em>Unger, </em>where the unlawful trespass to the defendant\u2019s back door \u201callowed the police to interact with the defendant and request consent in the same way they would have if they acted lawfully by using the front door[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215. Furthermore, a court may consider whether the unlawful police conduct may have occurred because the officer \u201cwas concerned for the defendant\u2019s safety\u201d; whether that conduct \u201cdid not demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>any effort to control or direct [the] defendant\u201d; and whether that conduct had ended before the request for consent. <em>Id. </em>at 214 (analyzing those considerations when discussing the nature, extent, and severity of the constitutional violation in <em>Lorenzo </em>(internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">None of those considerations are present in this case. First, the unlawful police conduct was not incidental to the subsequent discovery and execution of the warrant, but rather the cause of it. Further, there is no evidence that Lemons or another officer was concerned for defendant\u2019s safety; the unlawful police conduct demonstrated an effort to exercise control over defendant\u2019s physical person by directing defendant\u2019s movements; and that conduct had not ended by the time that the evidence was discovered. Indeed, the police control over defendant was increasing as the encounter developed; as the trial court found, other officers were \u201cshowing up\u201d as Lemons was running the records check\u2014 that is, as many as two additional patrol vehicles and four additional police officers were arriving on the scene. Rather, the unlawful police conduct in this case is more akin to the more severe conduct in <em>Musser, </em>where the officers\u2019 actions reasonably conveyed to the defendant \u201cthat she had no choice but to respond to the order, bringing her significantly under the control of the police.\u201d <em>Musser, </em>356 Or at 157. Thus, the fifth consideration \u2014 the nature, extent, and severity of the constitutional violation \u2014 favors suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">To conclude our analysis, we briefly review the totality of the circumstances presented by this case. As noted, Lemons approached defendant and Jacobs after they had started walking away from Lemons in an apparent attempt to \u201cavoid police contact.\u201d After defendant and Jacobs returned to answer Lemons\u2019s question about the contents of the. bag, defendant told Lemons that \u201che ha[d] to go to the bathroom.\u201d Lemons did not respond to defendant\u2019s request to go to the bathroom; rather, he asked defendant and Jacobs for identification, which they provided. Lemons then told defendant and Jacobs to \u201chang on there, or hang on a second,\u201d conveying, through his words and actions, that defendant and Jacobs should remain until Lemons could return after checking the identification. While Lemons was running the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>records check that revealed the outstanding warrant, as many as two additional patrol vehicles and four additional police officers were arriving on the scene. Defendant was then arrested on the warrant, and the search incident to arrest yielded evidence of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">When analyzing those circumstances, we note that Lemons unlawfully seized defendant without reasonable suspicion and that the discovery of the challenged evidence occurred shortly after the unlawful seizure. Further, despite defendant\u2019s attempt to avoid and then to terminate the encounter, Lemons did not inform defendant that he was free to leave. Further still, the unlawful police conduct placed defendant at a distinct disadvantage \u2014 because defendant was required to remain in a place that he had twice attempted to leave and apparently would have left if not for the police show of authority, the police were able to achieve the investigatory purpose of discovering and then executing the warrant, which directly led to the discovery of the challenged evidence. Finally, the circumstances do not suggest that Lemons was concerned for defendant\u2019s safety; the police exercised control over defendant\u2019s physical movements; and police control over defendant increased as the encounter developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the state failed to prove attenuation \u2014 that is, the state failed to prove, under the totality of the circumstances, that the violation of defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, had such a tenuous factual link to the disputed evidence that the unlawful police conduct cannot be properly viewed as the source of that evidence. Rather, the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that the police \u201c\u2018exploited\u2019 or \u2018took advantage of or \u2018traded on\u2019 their unlawful conduct\u201d to obtain the challenged evidence. <em>Unger, </em>356 Or at 80. Thus, the state failed to rebut the presumption that the evidence of methamphetamine must be suppressed, and the trial court did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-5\"> In Unger, the Oregon Supreme Court explained that, when unlawful police conduct \u201cpreceded a consent to search,\u201d a court\u2019s \u201cinquiry has two prongs.\u201d 356 Or at 85. \u201cFirst, the court must assess whether the consent was voluntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSecond, even if the consent is voluntary, the court must address whether the police exploited their prior illegal conduct to obtain the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86. Because, in this case, the unlawful police conduct did not precede a consent to search, we need not consider the first prong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\"> During oral argument, the state noted that Lemons had already obtained defendant\u2019s identifying information by the time that he told defendant and Jacobs to \u201chang on there, or hang on a second,\u201d and suggested that Lemons could have discovered the warrant even if defendant had walked away at that point. However, the state did not argue to the trial court that, because Lemons obtained defendant\u2019s identification part way through the encounter that became a seizure, the court should consider only the circumstances that existed when Lemons obtained defendant\u2019s identification to evaluate whether the discovery of the relevant evidence \u2014 the methamphetamine in defendant\u2019s pocket \u2014 was attenuated from the unlawful seizure. Accordingly, any such argument is unpreserved, and we do not address that possibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
