As explained below, we conclude that petitioner\u2019s argument on appeal is unpreserved and that petitioner has not established plain error by the post-conviction court. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The following facts are undisputed. Petitioner and four minors were drinking alcohol at a park alongside a river. While there, petitioner climbed a tree and fell from approximately 10-12 feet into shallow water and struck his head on rocks. As a result, he had an \u201cegg-sized kno[t]\u201d on his forehead and appeared to have difficulty \u201ccontrolling his limbs.\u201d Petitioner then got into a car with the four minors and began driving to leave the park. He ultimately hit a pedestrian, and later crashed the car, killing one of the minors, Hart. At the time of the crash, petitioner\u2019s blood-alcohol content was .273. Petitioner was charged with eight counts, including first-degree manslaughter. At trial, petitioner testified that he had purchased and consumed alcohol, and driven a car afterwards, but he could not recall hitting a pedestrian or anything about the crash that led to the death of Hart. He was convicted on all counts and was sentenced to 19 years in prison and 36 months of post-prison supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Petitioner appealed his convictions, and we affirmed without written opinion. <em>State v. Schultz, </em>230 Or App 431, 215 P3d 128, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 259 (2009). Petitioner sought post-conviction relief, alleging inadequate assistance of trial counsel. He claimed, in relevant part, that his trial counsel failed to present mitigating evidence at sentencing (claim three) and failed to call an expert witness to testify regarding the effect of the head injury that petitioner sustained from falling into the river (claim four). With respect to claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>four, petitioner alleged that his attorney \u201c[flailed to present expert witness testimony to show that Petitioner\u2019s reckless behavior was the result of the medical and mental effects upon the Petitioner as the result of a concussion he suffered rather than a result of alcohol consumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Defendant moved to dismiss petitioner\u2019s claims on the ground that petitioner had failed to satisfy the attachment requirements of ORS 138.580 by neglecting to attach any evidence to his petition that supported his claims for relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In response to defendant\u2019s motion, petitioner submitted the affidavit of a witness, Lewis, who had been at the river with petitioner. Although he did not claim to be a medical expert, Lewis stated that he saw petitioner fall and hit his head. He also opined that petitioner was \u201cvery affected by the head injury.\u201d In his response brief, petitioner argued that the Lewis affidavit \u201cestablishes Petitioner\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case with regard to Petitioner\u2019s <em>claim </em>3.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The response also argued that petitioner \u201cshould be permitted to proceed with <em>claims 1, 2, and 3 </em>* * * and Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss <em>claim 3 </em>in his First Amended Petition for Post-Conviction Relief should be denied.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Petitioner\u2019s response did not argue that he should be allowed to proceed on claim 4. Instead, it mentions that he \u201ccontinues to investigate his claim 4\u201d but that he \u201cpossesses no documentary evidence at this time.\u201d At a hearing on the motion, defendant withdrew its motion to dismiss claim three.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">With regard to petitioner\u2019s fourth claim \u2014 that his trial counsel failed to call an expert witness regarding petitioner\u2019s head trauma \u2014 defendant argued that ORS 138.580 \u201crequires that affidavits, records or other documentary evidence supporting the allegations of the petition shall be attached to the petition. It is not a \u2014 the statute is not a statute that gives leeway to petitioner. He must attach some. The statute says he shall attach some.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The court asked petitioner\u2019s counsel whether he had any response to defendant\u2019s argument as to the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>claim for relief. Petitioner\u2019s counsel responded that he had \u201cno evidence to support [his] allegation at this time.\u201d The post-conviction court dismissed the fourth claim. Petitioner appeals, assigning error to the post-conviction court\u2019s dismissal of his fourth claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">We begin with defendant\u2019s argument that petitioner failed to preserve his assignment of error. Generally, an issue not preserved in the trial court will not be considered on appeal. <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 341, 15 P3d 22 (2000); <em>see also </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court.\u201d). Preservation requires a party to \u201cprovide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>Wyatt, </em>331 Or at 343. For the purposes of preservation, there are \u201cdistinctions between raising an <em>issue </em>at trial, identifying a <em>source </em>for a claimed position, and making a particular <em>argument. </em>* * * The first ordinarily is essential, the second less so, the third least.\u201d <em>State v. Hitz, </em>307 Or 183, 188, 766 P2d 373 (1988) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Here, petitioner not only failed to advance an argument below about why he should be allowed to proceed on his fourth claim, he failed to do anything to oppose defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss that claim. Petitioner\u2019s response to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss all four of his claims argued only that petitioner \u201cshould be permitted to proceed with claims 1, 2, and 3.\u201d Petitioner mentioned his fourth claim only in the context of conceding that he \u201cpossessed no documentary evidence at this time.\u201d During the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, petitioner similarly made no attempt to oppose the dismissal of his fourth claim. After defendant spoke in favor of the motion to dismiss the fourth claim, petitioner again acknowledged that he had \u201cno evidence to support that allegation at this time.\u201d On appeal, petitioner now argues that ORS 138.580 does not require the attachment of supporting evidence if none exists. But petitioner did not make that argument to the post-conviction court. The state pointedly argued below that \u201cORS 138.580 *** emphatically states that petitioner \u2018shall\u2019 attach these documents, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>making this a mandatory requirement not subject to equivocation or exception.\u201d If petitioner disagreed with that assertion, he was obliged to inform the post-conviction court. He did not. Thus, to the extent that petitioner now argues that he should have been allowed to proceed on the fourth claim despite the lack of any supporting evidence, his argument is unpreserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Petitioner also advances an argument that the dismissal of the fourth claim is reviewable as plain error. He argues that he, in fact, <em>did </em>comply with ORS 138.580 when he submitted the Lewis affidavit. Petitioner, however, specifically offered that affidavit in support of his third claim, which concerned whether his counsel had failed to present mitigating evidence at sentencing. Petitioner now argues that, although he \u201cdid not make the assertion at the time, this same affidavit also supports [his fourth] claim for relief\u2019 and that the trial court plainly erred in dismissing his fourth claim in light of that affidavit. Petitioner\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The plain error doctrine applies when three requirements are met: (1) the error is an error of law, (2) the legal point is obvious and not reasonably in dispute, and (3) the record is sufficiently well-developed that a court \u201cneed not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences\u201d to address the error. <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). Even still, should we conclude that an error is plain, we must next weigh whether to exercise our discretion to correct it. <em>See Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991) (explaining that this court\u2019s decision to correct plain error is discretionary).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">It is not \u201cobvious and not reasonably in dispute\u201d that the post-conviction court should have concluded that the Lewis affidavit was supportive of petitioner\u2019s fourth claim for relief. Petitioner expressly offered that affidavit in support of the third claim for relief and, moreover, acknowledged that he had \u201cno evidence\u201d in support of his fourth claim. He asked the court to allow him to proceed on the first, second, and third claims, not the fourth claim. In addition, the fourth claim concerned trial counsel\u2019s failure to call an <em>expert </em>witness to testify as to petitioner\u2019s medical condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>at the time the crimes occurred. Petitioner offers no reason why the post-conviction court should have concluded that the affidavit of Lewis, a nonexpert, had any bearing on that claim. For all of those reasons, the post-conviction court did not plainly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\"> The post-conviction court ultimately denied relief on petitioner\u2019s remaining claims, and petitioner does not challenge those rulings on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\"> ORS 138.580 requires that \u201c[affidavits, records or other documentary evidence supporting the allegations of the petition shall be attached to the petition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
