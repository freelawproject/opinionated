The insurer of a subcontractor rejected the tender of the defense of the general contractor on the grounds that the homeowners\u2019 complaint did not identify the subcontractor, allege any improper work by the subcontractor, or specify that damages occurred during the subcontractor\u2019s ongoing operations for the general contractor. In this subsequent action, the trial court determined on summary judgment that the subcontractor\u2019s insurer breached its duty to defend the general contractor. The insurer appeals. We review for legal error, <em>Bresee Homes, Inc. v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>353 Or 112, 293 P3d 1036 (2012), and conclude that the complaint triggered the insurer\u2019s duty to have defended the general contractor. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">West Hills Development Company (West Hills) was the general contractor for the construction of the Arbor Terrace townhomes. West Hills hired L&amp;T Enterprises, Inc. (L&amp;T) as a subcontractor to install porch columns. L&amp;T was insured under a general liability policy issued by Oregon Automobile Insurance Company (Oregon Auto). Under the policy, Oregon Auto agreed that it would pay all sums that an insured became legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage and that the insurer would defend an insured against any suit seeking such damages. The policy identified L&amp;T as the named insured. An endorsement amended the policy to include West Hills as an additional insured. The endorsement stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">\u201cSection II - Who Is an Insured is amended to include as an insured [West Hills], but only with respect to liability arising out of [L&amp;T\u2019s] ongoing operations performed for that insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">(Boldface omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">In December 2009, the Arbor Terrace Homeowners Association (homeowners) filed a complaint against West Hills alleging a number of defects that caused extensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>weather-related damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The homeowners alleged that West Hills was negligent in several ways, including supervision of its subcontractors. They alleged that West Hills was negligent in \u201c[flailing to properly coordinate, schedule, oversee, inspect, and supervise contractors, subcontractors, and other workers[,]\u201d and in \u201c[providing improper plans, specifications, instruction, and direction to contractors and subcontractors * * * \u201d The homeowners alleged a number of damages, including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">\u201cdefects in the building envelope and other components of each building * * *, which have resulted in water intrusion and property damage to, among other things, siding, trims, sheathing, framing, and interior finishes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The homeowners identified \u201cspecific deficiencies\u201d in the construction of the townhomes due to \u201cfaulty workmanship, improper or defective materials, noncompliance with applicable building codes, industry standards, or manufacturer specifications and guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Of particular relevance to the appeal, the homeowners\u2019 complaint alleged, among other specific deficiencies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">\u201cInsufficient Weatherproofing. There is insufficient weatherproofing in some areas, <em>such </em>as at roof-to-wall transitions, and at <em>wood posts </em>supporting the soffits, which terminate on concrete grade topping without weatherproofing protection, all of which violate [provisions of the Oregon Structural Specialty Code].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">(Boldface omitted; emphases added.) The complaint indicated certain remedies would be required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">\u201cRemediation of the above-listed deficiencies will include but is not limited to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">\u201c(f) Re-clad <em>columns </em>with moisture tolerant assemblies [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>(Emphasis added.) The complaint added that, \u201c[w]hen the [individual homeowners] purchased their units ***, they did not know that the deficiencies in the building envelope and other components existed and <em>had already started to cause property damage!\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">On April 5, 2010, West Hills tendered the defense of the homeowners\u2019 action to Oregon Auto, asserting that West Hills was an additional insured under the insurer\u2019s policy with L&amp;T. The tender letter included a copy of the homeowners\u2019 complaint and reported that L&amp;T was involved in the construction of Arbor Terrace. The letter explained, \u201cSpecifically, your insured installed the front porch columns. The Complaint implicates work performed by your insured at Arbor Terrace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In September 2010, Oregon Auto wrote a letter declining the tender of defense. West Hills\u2019 attorney denies receiving the letter. The letter advised that Oregon Auto refused to defend West Hills because the insurer read the complaint to mean that the damages had occurred after L&amp;T had completed its work, not during L&amp;T\u2019s \u201congoing operations,\u201d as the insurer believed that the endorsement required.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">With its tender denied or thought to be ignored, West Hills filed a third-party complaint against L&amp;T within the homeowners\u2019 case in May 2010, alleging that, if West Hills were proved liable to the homeowners, then L&amp;T should be liable to West Hills for those construction defects due to L&amp;T\u2019s negligent workmanship.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Oregon Auto defended L&amp;T against West Hills\u2019 claims and eventually contributed to the settlement of L&amp;T\u2019s liability to the homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">In November 2010, while the homeowners\u2019 action was being litigated, West Hills filed an action against Oregon Auto, seeking a declaration that the insurer had breached its contractual obligation to defend West Hills. The general contractor sought to recover $28,884.42 as one-eighth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the cost it incurred in defending against the homeowners\u2019 action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Before this coverage case was concluded, the homeowners amended their complaint in the underlying case twice. On January 24, 2011, the second amended complaint added a more specific allegation about defective construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">\u201cImproperly Constructed Porch Columns. Horizontal and projecting trims on porch columns are not flashed, resulting in elevated moisture content and organic growth. The cladding and wood trims are not jointed in a weatherproof manner and are installed in direct contact with concrete flatwork. The end cuts of the wood trim are not primed or painted. The back framing is inadequately secured to prevent racking, twisting and displacement. The column posts are embedded in the concrete flatwork.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">(Boldface omitted.) West Hills did not repeat its tender of the defense by sending a copy of the newest complaint to Oregon Auto. Nevertheless, in the meantime, Oregon Auto maintained a claim file for its defense of L&amp;T in the homeowners\u2019 litigation. The same adjuster, who had denied West Hills\u2019 tender, managed the defense of the claim against L&amp;T and, according to West Hills, would have become aware of the later amendments to the homeowners\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The trial court was to conclude that Oregon Auto had breached its duty to defend West Hills. The court first ruled that West Hills was an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy. The court determined that the complaint included allegations that West Hills negligently supervised subcontractors and that damage was caused by improperly constructed porch columns, among other things. In its letter opinion, the court referenced the original and later complaints of the homeowners. Because L&amp;T was the subcontractor that worked on the porch columns, the court reasoned that \u201cthere is a possibility from the complaint that West Hills could be liable for work performed on the porch columns by [L&amp;T].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Rejecting the insurer\u2019s view that the damage must occur during L&amp;T\u2019s ongoing operations, the court adopted West Hills\u2019 argument that, because the endorsement\u2019s limitation is ambiguous, the endorsement covers liability arising out of the subcontractor\u2019s work even if damage occurred later. The court entered judgment on coverage in favor of West Hills.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">On appeal, Oregon Auto insists that it had no duty to defend West Hills in the homeowners\u2019 action. The insurer contends that, under the homeowners\u2019 original complaint and the policy, there is no possibility that the complaint alleged a liability against West Hills that the policy covered. Oregon Auto stresses that the original complaint did not identify L&amp;T as a subcontractor, did not mention improperly constructed porch columns, and did not assert that the damage to townhomes occurred during L&amp;T\u2019s work on the project. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u201cAn insurer has a duty to defend an action against its insured if the claim against the insured stated in the complaint could, without amendment, impose liability for conduct covered by the policy.\u201d <em>Ledford v. Gutoski, </em>319 Or 397, 399-400, 877 P2d 80 (1994). We examine just two documents to determine whether an insurer has a duty to defend an action against its insured: the insurance policy and the complaint in the action against the insured. <em>Oakridge Comm. Ambulance v. U.S. Fidelity, </em>278 Or 21, 24, 563 P2d 164 (1977). Considering those two documents, \u201cif the injured claimant can recover under the allegations of the complaint upon any basis for which the insurer affords coverage,\u201d we conclude that the insurer is obligated to defend the insured. <em>Casey v. Northwest Security Insurance Company, </em>260 Or 485, 489, 491 P2d 208 (1971). \u201cAny ambiguity in the complaint with respect to whether the allegations could be covered is resolved in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Ledford, </em>319 Or at 400 (citing <em>Blohm et al v. Glens Falls Ins. Co., </em>231 Or 410, 416, 373 P2d 412 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Generally, the determination of the duty .to defend is confined to the complaint and the policy, but the rule has an exception. In <em>Fred Shearer &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Gemini Ins. Co., </em>237 Or App 468, 476, 240 P3d 67 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 602 (2011), we noted that extrinsic evidence could be used to address \u201cthe preliminary question: whether the party seeking coverage was actually an <em>insured </em>within the meaning of the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476 (emphasis in original). The reasons for such an exception are that \u201can insured\u2019s relationship with its insurer may or may not be relevant to the merits of the plaintiffs case in the underlying litigation [,]\u201d and the plaintiff is not required to plead facts to \u201cestablish the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to some other party or to an insurance company in order to prove its claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477. We rejected a rigid application of the so-called four-corners rule, which looks only to the four corners of the two documents to determine whether a party is an insured. <em>Id. </em>at 478 (treating as \u201canalytically distinct\u201d the inquiries into \u201c(1) whether [the plaintiff] was an \u2018insured\u2019 within the meaning of the policy and (2) if so, whether the alleged conduct falls within the scope of coverage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Although we affirm, our explanation differs somewhat from that of the trial court. To make matters simpler, we do not need to decide the issues related to the second amended complaint, such as whether West Hills should have renewed its tender with a copy of the homeowners\u2019 second amended complaint or whether possession of the second amended complaint by the same claims representative handling the West Hills tender and the L&amp;T defense made a repeated tender unnecessary, because we conclude that the original complaint triggered a duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">To trigger the duty to defend, a complaint needs only to make allegations with which a claim covered by the policy may be proven. The insurer is charged with the responsibility to recognize the insured\u2019s exposure that the complaint presents. <em>See Ledford, </em>319 Or at 400 (finding duty to defend generally); <em>see also Abrams v. General Star Indemnity Co., </em>335 Or 392, 67 P3d 931 (2003) (finding duty to defend a case due to potential conversion claim, despite intentional conduct alleged). The original complaint alleged that West Hills negligently supervised its contractors. It alleged that defects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>resulted from negligent supervision by \u201c[flailing to properly coordinate, schedule, oversee, inspect, and supervise contractors, subcontractors, and other workers.\u201d Consequently, the original complaint alleged facts which, if proved, could subject West Hills to liability for work by a subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">L&amp;T was a subcontractor. It did not need to be identified in the complaint for the insurer to recognize its responsibility. In accord with <em>Shearer, </em>extrinsic evidence could be considered in order to identify West Hills as an additional insured. 237 Or App at 476. West Hills reported to Oregon Auto that L&amp;T, the policy\u2019s named insured, was West Hill\u2019s subcontractor on the same property that was the subject of the complaint. In its tender letter, West Hills reported, \u201cSpecifically, your insured [L&amp;T] installed the front porch columns. The Complaint implicates work performed by your insured at Arbor Terrace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Oregon Auto argues that the tender letter should not be considered as extrinsic evidence, nor, seemingly, as pointing toward extrinsic evidence. Oregon Auto contended in the trial court that a \u201cperson who claims to be insured must submit evidence to the insurer\u201d to establish that the \u201cperson qualifies as an additional insured under a policy.\u201d According to the insurer,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">\u201cDespite this rule, the tender by West Hills to [Oregon Auto] was limited to self-serving representations in the tender letter, and the allegations of the Complaint in the Liability Suit. Neither constitutes extrinsic evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">\u00ab\u00edJ\u00ed &gt;f\u00ed ij?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">\u201cWest Hills\u2019 tender letter represented that L&amp;T was involved in the Project. Again, that representation is not evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">On appeal, Oregon Auto elaborated, relying on a uniform jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">\u201c[T]here is no extrinsic evidence in this case. When plaintiff tendered the complaint to defendant, it tendered only the complaint. The cover letter included some argument by plaintiff\u2019s lawyer about why defendant should accept the tender. But, of course, argument isn\u2019t evidence, as jurors are instructed every day in the courtrooms of this state. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>See </em>UCJI 5.01 (\u2018The lawyers\u2019 opening statements and closing arguments are not part of the evidence.\u2019)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">(Emphasis and record citations omitted.) The issue, however, is not the admissibility under the Oregon Evidence Code of the information provided to the insurer, as if the insurer were a court. The function of the tender letter is to invoke the insurer\u2019s duty to defend; the insurer then can readily verify its information, whether by reference to its declaration pages, a telephone call to its named insured, or, upon reasonable inquiry, a review of the subcontract between West Hills and L&amp;T. Indeed, the role of L&amp;T in the project has never been disputed, then or now. As such, the allegation of negligent supervision of contractors, together with the reported involvement of L&amp;T, informed Oregon Auto that its duty to defend was at issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The more serious question was whether the complaint alleged damage for which L&amp;T was responsible. \u201cThe insurer has a duty to defend if the complaint provides <em>any basis </em>for which the insurer provides coverage.\u201d <em>Ledford, </em>319 Or at 400 (citing <em>Nielsen v. St. Paul Companies, </em>283 Or 277, 280, 583 P2d 545 (1978) (emphasis in original)). West Hills noted that the original complaint about \u201cInsufficient Weatherproofing\u201d implicated L&amp;T\u2019s work on the porch columns and posed a threat of liability covered under the policy. As noted above, that allegation asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">\u201cInsufficient Weatherproofing. There is insufficient weatherproofing in some areas, such as at roof-to-wall transitions, and at wood posts supporting the soffits, which terminate on concrete grade topping without weatherproofing protection, all of which violate [provisions of the Oregon Structural Specialty Code].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>(Boldface omitted.) The original complaint was not intended to be an exclusive list of defects. The homeowners alleged that \u201c[t]here are defects in the building envelope <em>and other components of each building </em>* * *, which have resulted in water intrusion and property damage to, <em>among other things, </em>siding, trims, sheathing, framing, and interior finishes.\u201d (Emphases added.) In requesting remediation of defects, the homeowners\u2019 complaint added that remedies \u201cwill include but is not limited to the following: * * * Re-clad <em>columns </em>with moisture tolerant assemblies.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Taken together, those allegations of the original complaint fairly apprised Oregon Auto that the columns constructed by L&amp;T could become a basis for the liability of West Hills. Unless a policy limitation ruled out coverage, the homeowners\u2019 complaint posed a duty to defend West Hills.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">From the outset, Oregon Auto has insisted that its duty to defend does not arise because coverage is limited by the terms of the additional insured endorsement. Most of the debate focused on the endorsement\u2019s paragraph A, containing the \u201congoing operations clause,\u201d but the debate included reference to paragraph B, home of an exclusion. In relevant part, the two paragraphs of the endorsement provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">\u201cA. Section II - Who Is An Insured is amended to include as an insured the person or organization shown in the Schedule [i.e., West Hills], <em>but only with respect to liability arising out of </em>[L&amp;T\u2019s] <em>ongoing operations performed for that insured.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\u201cB. With respect to the insurance afforded to these additional insureds, the following exclusion is added:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">\u201c2. Exclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">\u201cThis insurance does not apply to \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 occurring after:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">\u201c(1) All work, including materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work, on the project (other than service, maintenance or repairs) to be performed by or on behalf of the additional insured(s) at the site of the covered operations has been completed [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">(Boldface omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The parties dispute whether \u201cliability arising out of [L&amp;T\u2019s] ongoing operations\u201d required damages to have occurred while the subcontractor was still on the job. Oregon Auto reads \u201cliability\u201d to presuppose the occurrence of damages and \u201congoing operations\u201d to mean \u201cduring\u201d operations for the additional insured \u2014 that is, for West Hills. West Hills argues that \u201carising out of\u2019 is a phrase of broader meaning than \u201cduring\u201d and that \u201congoing operations\u201d means simply \u201coperations.\u201d In the view of West Hills, coverage is provided for liability that arises from, or because of, the subcontractor\u2019s operations, which were at the time ongoing, even if the damage occurs after the subcontractor\u2019s work is done.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">West Hills adds that the exclusion in paragraph B would become unnecessary, superfluous, or at least confusing if \u201cthe ongoing operations\u201d clause in paragraph A required damage that occurs <em>during </em>L&amp;T\u2019s work. West Hills reasons that paragraph A would provide a shorter period of coverage than the exclusion in paragraph B. West Hills explains that paragraph B\u2019s exclusion denies insurance for damage occurring after \u201call work\u201d done by the \u201cadditional insured\u201d is done. Because the \u201cadditional insured\u201d is the general contractor, the exclusion would not operate until the entire project is complete \u2014 not just the subcontractor\u2019s part of it. By contrast, paragraph A\u2019s term, according to the insurer, would end coverage sooner when the subcontractors \u201congoing operations\u201d cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The trial court found the endorsement to be ambiguous, but the dispute is another one that we do not need to resolve. This case involves only the duty to defend, and enough is alleged to have triggered the duty to defend \u2014 without resolution of the construction of this additional insured endorsement. The original complaint pleaded the possibility of damage occurring even within the narrower coverage Oregon Auto understands. The original complaint would permit proof of damages before L&amp;T finished its work.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Oregon Auto is correct that the homeowners\u2019 complaint did not specify when the damage to the townhomes occurred. Like any plaintiffs, they may have had no motivation to be specific or to plead matters significant to insurance coverage, especially when pleading broadly may help them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>to implicate policy years of multiple insurers. Nonetheless, the original complaint stated, \u201cWhen the [homeowners] purchased their units at Arbor Terrace Townhomes, they did not know that the deficiencies in the building envelope and other components <em>existed and had already started to cause property damage.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We concur with West Hills in reading the allegation to permit proof at trial that the possibility that damages occurred before one or more of the homeowners purchased units and before L&amp;T had finished its work. The complaint does not <em>rule out </em>the possibility that damage occurred before L&amp;T finished.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">In <em>Bresee Homes, Inc., </em>the Supreme Court confronted a similar situation involving ambiguous pleadings and the duty to defend. A contractor sought a defense against a construction-defect claim brought by the homeowners. 353 Or at 114-15. The insurer denied the defense, contending that coverage was precluded by an exclusion from coverage for damages arising out of completed operations. <em>Id. </em>In an action for breach of contract and declaratory judgment, the contractor contended that the homeowners\u2019 complaint could be reasonably construed to include a covered loss \u2014 that is, that the property damage occurred before the completion of construction. The Supreme Court considered the uncertain allegation in the homeowners\u2019 complaint. It found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">\u201cSome aspects of [the homeowners\u2019] complaint are noteworthy. The allegations do not state whether the claimed damages * * * occurred before or after the completion of [the contractor\u2019s] work. From all that appears from a reading of the complaint, the described property damage occurred, or could have occurred, when [the contractor\u2019s] work was neither completed nor \u2018deemed complete\u2019 under the [coverage exclusion].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 122. The insurer, like Oregon Auto, argued that the allegation should be read to say damages occurred after the contractor finished its work, but the court was not persuaded. Nothing in the complaint foreclosed the possibility of damage during coverage. The insurer, like Oregon Auto, argued that the contractor bore the burden of demonstrating that the work was <em>not </em>completed when the damage occurred, but, again, the court was unpersuaded. With the duty to defend, the contractor had no burden to come forward with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>facts beyond those alleged in the complaint. Accordingly, the court concluded that summary judgment for the insurer was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">That case guides our decision here. The homeowners\u2019 suit does not allege when the property damage occurred, but it does indicate that, when the homeowners bought their units, the alleged deficiencies \u201cexisted and had already started to cause property damage.\u201d Given the ambiguity of that statement, and given that any ambiguity in the complaint relating to coverage must be resolved in favor of the insured, <em>Ledford, </em>319 Or at 400, we conclude that the complaint contains allegations that could allow for proof at trial that the damages occurred during L&amp;T\u2019s ongoing operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">For these reasons, we concur with the trial court, albeit on narrower grounds. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment recognizing Oregon Auto\u2019s duty to have defended West Hills in the Arbor Terrace litigation. Nor did the trial court err in entering judgment for the recovery of the proportionate share of defense costs incurred in West Hills\u2019 defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-11\"> The homeowners also sued Arbor Terrace, LLC, the limited liability company that controlled and managed the activities and operations of the Arbor Terrace Townhomes prior to the turnover to the homeowners on July 1, 2006. That company\u2019s participation in the lawsuit is not relevant to this appeal, and we do not discuss it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\"> Contrary to Oregon Auto\u2019s description, the third-party complaint did not assert that L&amp;T was liable while West Hills was not liable to the homeowners. <em>See </em>ORCP 22 C (a defending party, as third-party plaintiff, may serve a complaint upon a third party for all or part of the original claim for which the defendant, now third party plaintiff, may also be liable to the original plaintiff).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\"> The total defense cost was $231,075.32. West Hills tendered its defense to eight insurers in all. Later, two insurers, Quanta Specialty Lines Insurance Company and Risk Retention Group, respectively, ratified West Hills\u2019 claim under ORCP 26 and assigned a contribution claim to West Hills so that West Hills could pursue this claim against Oregon Auto.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b179-6\"> Thereafter, the trial court entered a supplemental judgment that awarded West Hills its attorney fees. That judgment is not at issue in this case but is the subject of a separate appeal that is currently under advisement in this court, <em>West Hills Development Company v. Chartis Claims, Inc. </em>(A154695).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\"> Before the trial court, Oregon Auto argued that West Hills was obligated but failed to offer (to the insurer) extrinsic evidence to show the insurer\u2019s coverage of West Hills. On appeal, Oregon Auto argues instead that L&amp;T is <em>barred </em>from offering (to the court) certain extrinsic evidence to show coverage; that is, the insurer contends that extrinsic facts relating to the duty to defend cannot be considered when they also relate to the underlying liability. Whatever the validity of that new twist on the old idea that the court does not decide liability when deciding the duty to defend, we do not address the argument, because it was not presented to the trial court and was not preserved for consideration on appeal. <em>See Miller v. C. C. Meisel Co., Inc., </em>183 Or App 148, 171-72, 51 P3d 650 (2002) (argument on appeal different from argument to trial court).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
