Defendant asserts, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred: (1) in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal (MJOA) as to Count 4, on the ground that the state failed to adduce evidence of the \u201cphysical injury\u201d element of fourth-degree assault; (2) in the event that the conviction on Count 4 is affirmed, by failing to merge Count 3 and Count 4 into a single fourth-degree assault conviction; and (3) in denying his MJOA as to Count 7, for coercion, because there was insufficient evidence that defendant caused the victim to alter her course of conduct. With respect to the first assignment, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence of physical injury, and, therefore, that the trial court did not err in denying the MJOA as to Count 4. We further conclude, with respect to merger, that the trial court correctly entered separate convictions for Counts 3 and 4. Finally, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying the MJOA on the coercion charge. Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction as to coercion (Count 7), and remand for resentencing, <em>see </em>ORS 138.222(5)(b), but otherwise affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of an MJOA, we view the evidence adduced at trial in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den, </em>514 US 1005 (1995); <em>State v. Schneider, </em>229 Or App 199, 201, 211 P3d 306 (2009). Consistently with that standard, the facts material to our review are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">In January 2011, defendant and the victim, E, were in a relationship and living together in a house owned by defendant. From early January 15 through the morning of January 17, defendant engaged in an alcohol-fueled course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>of bizarre and threatening conduct towards E. At various points, defendant would chant phrases including \u201cDie bitch\u201d and \u201cDie cunt\u201d for prolonged periods; shout other profanities, threats, and orders at E; and blast music so loud that she could not sleep or study. E had moved into a separate bedroom, just down the hall from the bedroom that she had previously shared with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">Under those circumstances, defendant attacked E several times; specifically, as pertinent to our review, during the very early morning on January 17, defendant was chanting and yelling from his bedroom. E, unable to sleep, had gone to the front room to try to study. After the chanting grew louder, E went to the doorway of defendant\u2019s bedroom and asked him to stop. Defendant, who was lying down on the bed, jumped up and lunged at E with a pillow. When he reached her, defendant covered E\u2019s face with the pillow for about a second, momentarily cutting off her breathing. E pushed defendant and broke away. Defendant, still wielding the pillow, came at E again. This time he forcefully covered her face with the pillow for about five seconds, simultaneously pinning her to the wall. During that five-second period, E could not breathe. \u201cIn survival mode\u201d and fearing \u201che was going to kill [her],\u201d E struck defendant and \u201cgot him away from [her] face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">E then attempted to return to the living area. She wanted to retrieve her study materials and then retreat to the bedroom. On her way to the living area, E told defendant, who was still in or near the hallway, that she wanted her books. As she was attempting to pass, defendant grabbed her and began pummeling her, striking her head \u201cover and over and over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">E, apparently able to extricate herself from defendant\u2019s grasp, made her way to the living area. She grabbed her books, and headed back down the hallway towards her bedroom. At that point, defendant intercepted her again. E tried to stab defendant with a pencil but missed, accidently stabbing herself. He began to push her towards the bedroom, cussing at her and ordering her to get into the bedroom. According to E, as defendant was \u201cshoving\u201d her into the bedroom: \u201cHe was on my back, telling me to get into my \u2014 get into my bedroom where I belong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>E eventually called 9-1-1. Defendant, who was arrested later that morning, was charged with multiple offenses. As relevant here, based on the allegations relating to his covering E\u2019s face with a pillow, the state charged him with both strangulation, ORS 163.187 (Count 3), and fourth-degree assault, ORS 163.160 (Count 4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant was also charged with a single count of coercion, ORS 163.275 (Count 7); the indictment did not specify the predicate conduct for that charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">At trial, once the state had presented its case-in-chief, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the assault and coercion counts. With respect to the operative fourth-degree assault charge, defendant asserted that there was no proof that E had suffered \u201cphysical injury,\u201d within the meaning of ORS 163.160, as a result of the pillow attack. The state countered that any \u201cimpairment of the ability of the body to function in a normal manner for any amount of time\u201d was sufficient \u2014 and that not being able to breathe \u201cfor any amount of time\u201d constituted such impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">As to coercion, defendant argued that there was \u201cno act that a jury [could] settle on * * * that [the victim] lawfully had a right to do but she abstained from doing.\u201d Defendant further argued that his conduct (described above) in ordering and pushing E into her bedroom did not constitute coercion because she was going there on her own volition anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The trial court denied the MJOA as to both counts. It agreed with the state that the \u201cphysical injury\u201d component of fourth-degree assault has no durational requirement and that the victim\u2019s testimony provided sufficient evidence of impairment. As to coercion, the trial court reasoned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the evidence of defendant\u2019s actions and words during the bedroom incident was sufficient to show that \u201che was compelling her to go someplace that she had a right not to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">Near the end of the trial, the parties submitted their proposed jury instructions. The state requested Uniform Criminal Jury Instruction (UCrJI) 1433, relevant to coercion that occurs when a defendant causes another <em>\u201cto abstain from engaging in conduct\u201d </em>that he or she has the right to engage in. ORS 163.275(1) (emphasis added). We note \u2014 because it is highly significant to our review of the denial of the MJOA on the coercion count \u2014 that the state did not request that the jury be instructed under UCrJI 1432, which relates to the species of coercion that occurs when a defendant \u201ccompels or induces another person <em>to engage in conduct </em>from which the other person has a legal right to abstain.\u201d ORS 163.275(1) (emphasis added). Neither party excepted to the jury instructions. Accordingly, the jury was instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-5\">\u201cIn this case, to establish the crime of Coercion, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following four elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-6\">\u00abHi Hi Hi Hi *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-7\">\u201c3. [Defendant] intentionally <em>compelled or induced [E] to abstain from engaging in conduct that [E] had a legal right to engage in.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-8\">\u201cAnd 4. This compelling or inducing was accomplished by means of instilling in [E] that if [she] refrained from the conduct or engaged in the conduct contrary to the compulsion or inducement, * * * defendant would unlawfully cause physical injury to some person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">The jury found defendant guilty of all charges except one count of fourth-degree assault (Count 2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At sentencing, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s request that the guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>verdicts on Count 3 (strangulation) and Count 4 (fourth-degree assault) be merged into a single conviction. The trial court acknowledged that Counts 3 and 4 were \u201cbased on the exact same conduct,\u201d but explained that they \u201cclearly don\u2019t merge\u201d because \u201ceach statutory provision requires proof * * * of elements that the other doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">As noted, on appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his MJOAs as to one count of fourth-degree assault and the single count of coercion, as well as its entry of separate convictions for strangulation and fourth-degree assault based on the same predicate conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">We begin with defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the state\u2019s proof of fourth-degree assault, which we review for whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cunningham, </em>320 Or at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Defendant renews his argument that \u201c[interfering with a person\u2019s breathing by blocking the person\u2019s nose and mouth for one to five seconds does not, without more, constitute physical injury.\u201d Relying on case law \u2014 which, according to defendant, stands for the proposition that \u201cminor impairment of a body part for a short amount of time is not sufficient impairment\u201d \u2014 defendant equates \u201cmomentarily\u201d impeding breathing with an inconspicuous, quick-healing \u201cslight scrape or cut\u201d and \u201cblows and kicks that did not result in bruises or swelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">The state defends the trial court\u2019s approach, emphasizing that there is no durational requirement for the \u201cimpairment of physical condition\u201d variant of \u201cphysical injury\u201d at issue here. It asserts that \u201cthe involuntary cessation of breathing \u2014 a vital bodily function\u201d \u2014 in and of itself constitutes the requisite impairment, because defendant\u2019s action (pushing a pillow over the victim\u2019s face and holding it there), \u201cresulted in a reduction of the victim\u2019s ability to use her respiratory system for a period of time, even though that time was not protracted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">We agree with the state. As amplified below, based on the totality of the circumstances, including that E, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>a result of defendant\u2019s conduct, was completely unable to breathe for a period of time, causing her to fear for her survival, a jury could reasonably infer that she suffered an \u201cimpairment of physical condition,\u201d fulfilling the state\u2019s obligation to prove the \u201cphysical injury\u201d element of fourth-degree assault. In explaining that conclusion, we describe the pertinent statutes, discuss the definition and contours of the \u201cimpairment of physical condition\u201d variant of \u201cphysical injury,\u201d and identify various considerations, which, depending on the circumstances, may or may not be material to that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">ORS 163.160(1) establishes the crime of fourth-degree assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-5\">\u201cA person commits the crime of assault in the fourth degree if the person * * * [ijntentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes <em>physical injury </em>to another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">(Emphasis added.) The \u201cphysical injury\u201d requirement limits the sweep of ORS 163.160(1) to those circumstances where \u201csome form of external violence *** produces a harmful effect upon the body\u201d; that is, circumstances which involve \u201cthe infliction of actual physical injury\u201d \u2014 but not \u201c[p]etty batteries not producing injury.\u201d <em>State v. Capwell, </em>52 Or App 43, 47 n 3, 627 P2d 905 (1981); <em>see State v. Sallinger, </em>11 Or App 592, 597-99, 504 P2d 1383 (1972) (comparing various assault provisions with \u201cphysical injury\u201d component to harassment statute requiring only \u201coffensive physical contact\u201d); <em>see also State v Lindsey, </em>45 Or App 607, 609-10, 609 P2d 386 (1980) (where the victim\u2019s only \u201cinjury\u201d was a torn shirt, reversing for insufficient evidence of physical injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">ORS 161.015(7), in turn, defines the term \u201cphysical injury\u201d as meaning \u201cimpairment of physical condition or substantial pain.\u201d Thus, evidence establishing <em>either </em>an impairment of a physical condition <em>or </em>substantial pain will support an assault conviction. <em>State v. Poole, </em>175 Or App 258, 261, 28 P3d 643 (2001). Here, only the former is at issue. Consequently, the inquiry narrows to whether the circumstances here \u2014 a complete traumatic preclusion of breathing for five seconds, causing E to fear for her survival\u2014 constitutes an \u201cimpairment of physical condition\u201d and, hence, \u201cphysical injury\u201d for purposes of ORS 161.015(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\u201cImpairment of physical condition\u201d is not defined by statute. However, in <em>State v. Higgins, </em>165 Or App 442, 446-47, 998 P2d 222 (2000), we construed that term, employing the methodology prescribed in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). Based on a textual analysis, we first noted that the legislature intended the term to mean \u201charm to the body that results in a reduction in one\u2019s ability to use the body or a bodily organ.\u201d <em>Higgins, </em>165 Or App at 446. We then addressed, by reference to the definition of \u201cserious physical injury,\u201d ORS 161.015(8), and negative inference, the durational aspect of the requisite \u201cimpairment.\u201d Specifically, we noted that \u201cserious physical injury\u201d included, in part, physical injury that \u201ccauses <em>protracted </em>loss of health or <em>protracted </em>loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ,\u201d ORS 161.015(8)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (emphasis added), and determined that \u201cphysical injury\u201d embraced the universe of other (i.e., non-\u201cprotracted\u201d) impairment of a bodily organ. Accordingly, we concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-4\">\u201cimpairment of physical condition means harm to the body that results in a reduction in one\u2019s ability to use the body or a bodily organ for less than a protracted period of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 446-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Thereafter, in <em>State v. Hart, </em>222 Or App 285, 291, 193 P3d 42 (2008), in holding that a half-inch gash on the back of the victim\u2019s neck constituted a \u201cphysical injury,\u201d we clarified that <em>Higgins\u2019s </em>construction encompasses not only impairment to voluntary \u201cuses\u201d of the body but also impairment to the ordinary (and involuntary) functioning of a body part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-7\">\u201c[T]he ability to \u2018use\u2019 one\u2019s body refers not only to the ability to put the body into action, * * * but also to the ability of the body to function in a normal manner. * * * [0]ur statement that \u2018impairment of physical condition means harm to the body that results in a reduction in one\u2019s ability to use the body or a bodily organ,\u2019 should be understood to include not only impairment of voluntary use of a body part, but also of the ordinary <em>function </em>of a body part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 291 (internal citations omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>Higgins, </em>as amplified in <em>Hart, </em>represents an admirable effort to bring some coherence to our assessment of the legal sufficiency of proof of \u201cphysical injury.\u201d In truth, there was an unsatisfying \u201cnot-too-hot; not-too-cold\u201d quality to many of our decisions; others were starkly conclusory, verging on the \u201cwe know it when we see it\u201d genre.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Still, Higgins\u2019s formulation, while identifying and distilling salient principles, is not \u2014 and was never intended to be \u2014 inflexibly literal and categorical. Rather, as we at least implicitly acknowledged in <em>Hart, </em>ongoing explication and refinement is not only appropriate, but inevitable. That is so for at least two interrelated reasons. <em>First, </em>Higgins\u2019s formulation does not exist in a vacuum. Rather, it will invariably be invoked, as it is here, in the context of an MJOA \u2014 which, in turn, can implicate a variety of case-specific circumstances, many (obviously) never anticipated, much less addressed, in <em>Higgins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\"><em>Second, Higgins\u2019s </em>construction is \u2014 at least at its margins \u2014 imprecise, with the imprecision that inheres in the limitations of language. Consequently, \u201cbright-line\u201d certitude is a delusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To be sure, in the generality of cases, the meaning and application of Higgins\u2019s formulation will be straightforward. But \u201cclose\u201d or idiosyncratic cases reveal and highlight interstitial gaps and ambiguity. In such cases, rote, mantra-like resort to the text of the \u201ctemplate\u201d is an exercise in question-begging: A result cloaked in the fig leaf of a formulaic label. Conversely, ultimately principled consideration must acknowledge and engage with ambiguity and nuance by reference to the considerations that underlie the formulation and that have at least implicitly informed its precedential application.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Two common and consistent principles characterize our \u201cphysical injury/impairment of physical condition\u201d precedents \u2014 both those that antedated <em>Higgins </em>and those that have since applied its construct: (1) The impairment must be material, and not merely <em>de minimis', </em>and (2) materiality is a function of a variety of case-specific circumstances, including the character, degree, and duration of the asserted impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">The first principle is manifest in our case law relating to cuts, scratches, and scrapes. A wound that breaks the skin and causes bleeding can compromise and impair\u2014 however momentarily and minimally \u2014 the skin\u2019s function of \u201cprotecting] the inner body from infection.\u201d <em>Hart, </em>222 Or App at 291. Nevertheless \u2014 including in <em>Higgins </em>itself \u2014 we have consistently distinguished between minor lacerations and others that are more acute and take longer to heal. <em>Compare Higgins, </em>165 Or App at 444-47 (\u201cfour to six red scrape marks\u201d to a victim\u2019s neck and arm, which occurred after the defendant \u201cslapped and clawed\u201d him, were too \u201cslight\u201d to constitute impairment); <em>State v. Rice, </em>48 Or App 115, 117, 616 P2d 538, <em>rev den, </em>289 Or 741 (1980) (\u201cslight cut\u201d to the cheek did not constitute an impairment of physical condition), <em>with State v. Jones, </em>229 Or App 734, 736-38, 212 P3d 1292, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 446 (2009); <em>Hart, </em>222 Or App at 291-92 (reasoning that a \u201cheavy scrape, approximately an inch and a half wide, maybe four inches long,\u201d and a bloody \u201chalf inch gash\u201d on back of victim\u2019s head could disrupt the skin\u2019s ability to \u201cprotect the inner body from infection\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Higgins </em>itself contradicts a categorical understanding that <em>any </em>\u201creduction in [the] ability to use * * * a bodily organ,\u201d however minimal and momentary that reduction, is an actionable \u201cimpairment\u201d within the meaning of ORS 161.015(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The distinction between legally insufficient <em>de minimis </em>effect and actionable impairment may depend on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>combination of variables. Consider, for example, the difference between a slight five-second decrease in hearing and a total five-second cessation of cardiac function. Or the difference between a moderate five-second reduction in hearing and a moderate reduction of hearing over a period of hours or days. The nature of the affected bodily function or organ, the degree of effect, and its duration may all properly bear on the assessment of legally sufficient impairment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">With those principles and considerations reiterated, we return to the circumstances of this case. Specifically, the proof, viewed most favorably to the state, established that defendant forcibly held a pillow over E\u2019s mouth and nose, preventing her from breathing for up to five seconds and causing her to fear for her life. Were those circumstances legally sufficient to permit a jury to determine that defendant had caused \u201cphysical injury\u201d by \u201cimpairment of a physical condition\u201d \u2014 specifically material impairment of E\u2019s respiratory function? We conclude that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Our conclusion rests on the combination of the character of the affected bodily function, the degree of impairment, and the duration of the impairment. The respiratory function \u2014 like the cardiac function in one of the rhetorical ruminations above \u2014 is, literally, existential. Further, the impairment was total, not partial: E could not breathe at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Thus, the question reduces to whether, notwithstanding the combination of the first two considerations, the durational aspect was so brief as to preclude, as a matter of law, a reasonable juror from finding the requisite material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>impairment of bodily function. Obviously, completely, forcibly preventing someone from breathing for a minute would be sufficient \u2014 but for a matter of seconds? We cannot, and will not, pretend to pronounce a \u201cprincipled\u201d distinction between one second \u2014 or three seconds \u2014 or five. However, we can, and do, hold that where, as here, the duration of complete preclusion of breathing was sufficient to cause the victim to fear for her survival, a reasonable juror could find that the duration of defendant\u2019s conduct was sufficient to have materially impaired the victim\u2019s bodily function. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the MJOA, and we affirm defendant\u2019s conviction on Count 4 for fourth-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">We turn to whether the guilty verdicts on Counts 3 and 4 should have merged into a single conviction. We review the trial court\u2019s decision to not merge those verdicts for legal error. <em>State v. Watkins, </em>236 Or App 339, 345, 236 P3d 770, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 480 (2010). As appellant, defendant bears the burden of demonstrating, as a matter of law, that the trial court so erred. For the reasons below, we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Under, ORS 161.067(1),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the \u201canti-merger\u201d statute, a single criminal act gives rise to multiple convictions if three conditions are satisfied: \u201c(1) defendant must have engaged in acts that are the same criminal conduct or episode; (2) defendant\u2019s acts must have violated two or more statutory provisions; and (3) each statutory provision must require proof of an element that the others do not.\u201d <em>State v. Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 348, 211 P3d 262 (2009) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The parties do not dispute that the first two conditions are met. Only the third condition is at issue. To that end, defendant argues that the strangulation and fourth-degree assault charges, as pleaded in this case, are not separately punishable because strangulation qualifies as a lesser-included variant of fourth-degree assault. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>to defendant, \u201call elements of the crime of strangulation are subsumed within the elements of the crime of fourth-degree assault,\u201d because, as a practical matter, \u201cit is not possible to commit the former crime without also committing the latter.\u201d The state responds that that argument is unavailing because it is premised upon the factual circumstances of any particular case \u2014 and not on the statutory elements of the offenses as pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Our analysis is governed by well-settled principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">\u201cThe question is whether * * * each of the statutory provisions requires proof of an element that the other does not. Generally, only the statutory elements of the offenses are compared; the facts as alleged in the indictment or found by the factfinder are not relevant. However, when a statute contains alternative forms of a single crime * * * we will look to the indictment to determine which form is charged, and we use the elements of the charged version in the merger analysis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-6\"><em>State v. Alvarez, </em>240 Or App 167, 171, 246 P3d 26 (2010), <em>rev den, 350 Or 408 (2011) </em>(citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Baker, </em>265 Or App 500, 502, 336 P3d 547 (2014) (\u201cIn considering whether two counts merge *** what matters is whether all <em>elements </em>of one offense are subsumed within the elements of the other offense, and not whether other facts, like the \u2018underlying factual circumstances of the crime,\u2019 might overlap to that degree.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Based on the superseding indictment, <em>see </em>273 Or App at 5 n 2, the state was required to prove, as to strangulation, that defendant (1) knowingly (2) impeded the victim\u2019s normal breathing or circulation of the blood (3) by applying pressure on the victim\u2019s throat or neck or blocking her nose or mouth. As to fourth-degree assault, the state was required to prove that defendant (1) recklessly (2) caused (3) physical injury to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The verdicts do not merge. We reject defendant\u2019s contention that, as pleaded here, strangulation is the \u201clesser-included\u201d of fourth-degree assault, because the former requires proof not required by the latter. The two offenses have different requisite culpable mental states \u2014 and a crime that requires proof of a knowing mental state cannot be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u201clesser-included\u201d of a crime with a reckless mental state.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The state alleged a knowing mental state as to strangulation and a reckless one as to assault. That knowing mental state elementally requires different proof than is required to prove recklessness. <em>Compare </em>ORS 161.085(8) (\u201c\u2018Knowingly\u2019 * * * means that a person acts with an awareness that the conduct of the person is of a nature so described or that a circumstance so described exists.\u201d), <em>with </em>ORS 161.085(9) (\u201c\u2018Recklessly,\u2019 *** means that a person is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.\u201d); <em>cf. State v. Noe, </em>242 Or App 530, 532, 256 P3d 14 (2011) (\u201c[Unauthorized use of a vehicle] requires proof of an element that [possession of a stolen vehicle] does not have: knowledge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">In addition, the elements of strangulation, which require proof of engaging in a specific means (applying pressure on the throat or neck or blocking the nose or mouth) toward a specific end (impeding normal breathing or circulation), require different proof than the elements of fourth-degree assault, the elements of which contemplate a vast array of actions resulting, either directly or indirectly, in physical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The question of whether the verdicts should nevertheless be merged thus reduces to whether fourth-degree assault requires proof of an element not required for strangulation. The resolution of that question depends, in turn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>on whether the \u201cphysical injury\u201d element of fourth-degree assault \u2014 specifically as construed here to require a material impairment of physical condition \u2014 necessarily encompasses the \u201cimpeding the normal breathing or circulation of the blood\u201d element of strangulation. As noted, it was, and is, incumbent on defendant, as appellant, to establish that premise. Defendant has not done so. Beyond a single conclusory assertion, defendant develops no cogent argument as to why, given the context and legislative history of the strangulation statute, ORS 163.187 \u2014 which was enacted long after the fourth-degree assault statute, ORS 163.160<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 its textually unique \u201cimpeding the normal breathing or circulation of the blood\u201d element is qualitatively and functionally embraced within the \u201cphysical injury\u201d element of fourth-degree assault. Accordingly, we decline to consider that inadequately developed contention.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Beall Transport Equipment Co. v. Southern Pacific, </em>186 Or App 696, 700 n 2, 64 P3d 1193, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>187 Or App 472, 68 P3d 259 (2003) (\u201c[I]t is not this court\u2019s function to speculate as to what a party\u2019s argument might be. Nor is it our proper function to make or develop a party\u2019s argument when that party has not endeavored to do so itself.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The only remaining issue is the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s MJOA as to coercion. On appeal, the parties substantially reprise their arguments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, focusing on two incidents: (1) when defendant seized and pummeled E in the hallway, as she attempted to retrieve her study materials from the living room; and (2) when he shoved E into her bedroom while verbally ordering her to go there. <em>See </em>273 Or App at 3-4. We conclude that, on this record, there was insufficient evidence from which a rational jury could, consistently with the instructions in this case, find defendant guilty of coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">ORS 163.275(1) embraces two circumstantially distinct alternative variants of coercion: A person commits the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>crime of coercion by compelling or inducing another person either (a) \u201cto engage in conduct from which the other person has a legal right to abstain\u201d or (b) \u201cto abstain from engaging in conduct in which the other person has a legal right to engage.\u201d Here, as noted, the jury was instructed \u2014 at the state\u2019s request \u2014 in such a way as to limit its consideration solely to the latter. <em>See </em>273 Or App at 5-6. Specifically, the jury was instructed that, in order to find defendant guilty of coercion, it had to find that defendant \u201cintentionally compelled or induced [E] <em>to abstain from engaging in conduct that [E] had a legal right to engage in\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, our review of the sufficiency of the evidence of coercion is \u201ccircumscribed\u201d by that instruction. <em>See Northwest Natural Gas Co. v. Chase Gardens, Inc., </em>333 Or 304, 310, 39 P3d 846 (2002) (\u201c[O]ur review of the record is circumscribed by the case actually presented to the jury through pleadings, evidence, and jury instructions.\u201d); <em>cf. Hill v. Mayers, </em>104 Or App 629, 632, 802 P2d 694 (1990), <em>rev den, </em>311 Or 187 (1991) (\u201c[W]hen a case has been heard on a particular theory in the trial court, on appeal the parties are restricted to the theory on which the case was tried.\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Thus, the state was required to prove: (1) defendant intentionally compelled or induced the victim to abstain from doing something (2) that the victim had a right to do, (3) by making the victim afraid that if she did not comply, physical injury would result. <em>State v. Pedersen, </em>242 Or App 305, 311, 255 P3d 556, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 254 (2011); <em>State v. Phillips, </em>206 Or App 90, 95, 135 P3d 461, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 548 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Here, the only even colorable circumstantial predicate for coercion consonant with the jury instructions was defendant\u2019s grabbing and pummeling E in the hallway, the details of which are discussed in greater detail below. Nevertheless \u2014 and regardless of defendant\u2019s other criminal culpability for that violent conduct<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 that circumstance was legally insufficient to establish that defendant intentionally, by threatening physical injury, compelled or induced E \u201cto abstain from engaging in conduct in which [she had] a legal right to engage.\u201d That is so for either of two independently sufficient reasons. First, the evidence, viewed most favorably to the state, does not establish, even by way of a non-speculative inference, that defendant possessed the requisite intent. Second, the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that E abstained from any conduct in which she was legally entitled to engage as a result of some threat of physical injury by defendant. <em>See Pedersen, </em>242 Or App at 313 (\u201cThe essence of coercion is fear-induced compliance, <em>i.e., </em>the victim complies <em>because he or she is afraid\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>110 Or App 362, 363, 822 P2d 153 (1991) (\u201cCoercion requires proof that the victim was actually compelled or induced to abstain from engaging in the conduct in which she had a right to engage or not to engage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Again, the evidence viewed most favorably to the state was that defendant grabbed E in the hallway, as she was on her way to the living room to retrieve some books, and beat her in the head repeatedly. Defendant, heavily intoxicated, was swinging wildly and indiscriminately. In E\u2019s words: \u201cHe was just kind of waling. Just trying to hit wherever he could hit, wherever he can get it.\u201d E also described her own mental state: \u201cIt just seemed like it wasn\u2019t going to stop.\u201d \u201cI tried to go somewhere else. I didn\u2019t want to deal with it. I just tried to find a different, peaceful \u2014 I just\u2014 just wanted to go somewhere else. I just didn\u2019t want to deal with it.\u201d The record does not disclose exactly how the attack ended, but E continued on to the living area immediately thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>That record does not permit a legally sufficient, nonspeculative inference that defendant intended to keep E from engaging in identifiable legally privileged conduct. It simply establishes that defendant assaulted E. There is no evidence probative of defendant\u2019s specific intent, if any, in engaging in that assaultive conduct. For example, there is no evidence of what, if anything, defendant said to E; nor is there evidence of some expressive gesture or act that might reasonably be said to imply that defendant assaulted E to compel her to abstain from engaging in any conduct in which she had \u201ca legal right to engage.\u201d ORS 163.275(1). Certainly, nothing in E\u2019s testimony suggests that she perceived or understood defendant\u2019s conduct to be so actuated and calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Further \u2014 and perhaps concomitantly \u2014 the above-described circumstances were legally insufficient to establish that E abstained from doing anything, much less that she did so as a result of fear induced by an express or implied threat of physical injury. To be sure, as a purely <em>physical </em>matter, defendant\u2019s assaultive conduct obstructed and delayed E\u2019s movement, but nothing in the record, including E\u2019s testimony, suggests that, in any event, she acted as a result of \u201cfear-induced compliance.\u201d <em>Pedersen, </em>242 Or App at 313.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">In sum, the evidence was legally insufficient to support a conviction on the sole theory submitted for the jury\u2019s consideration as to Count 7.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying the MJOA on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Conviction on Count 7 reversed; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b21-7\"> Defendant also contends that the trial court erred in denying his MJOA as to unlawful use of a weapon (Count 6), arguing that the state was required, and failed, to adduce evidence of intent to physically injure the victim with a weapon.
