He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence that a police officer discovered after defendant consented to a search for weapons. Defendant argues that his consent was given only after the officer unlawfully stopped him. We conclude that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to stop defendant and, therefore, the officer violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We further conclude that the state failed to prove that the evidence was nonetheless admissible. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress for errors of law, and are bound by the trial court\u2019s factual findings if there is constitutionally sufficient evidence in the record to support them. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). Where the trial court did not make express findings and there is evidence from which the trial court could have found a fact in more than one way, we will presume that the facts were decided in a manner consistent with the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">On the morning in question, Officer Moffitt was on patrol duty. He received a call from dispatch to respond to a disturbance at a home where a woman named Jennifer Velek resided. Velek\u2019s mother had called the police and reported that Velek had called her and said that someone named Antwon Wilson was at her house and was threatening to break things. Velek\u2019s mother reported that she could hear a lot of yelling in the background when she was speaking to her daughter, and she requested that the police go to Velek\u2019s home. Moffitt knew Velek, had been to her home on numerous occasions, and was familiar with the layout of the residence. Corporal Welsh, an officer who also responded to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>call, believed that the behavior Velek\u2019s mother had reported could constitute menacing, assault, or criminal mischief.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Ten minutes after Velek\u2019s mother called the police, Moffitt and Welsh arrived to investigate the disturbance. They parked a few houses away and walked on the sidewalk toward Velek\u2019s home. When they were near the home, they saw defendant walking down Velek\u2019s driveway. Based on his knowledge of the layout of Velek\u2019s home, Moffitt was certain that defendant had come from the home. Defendant, who did not see the two officers, reached the sidewalk and turned in the direction away from the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Moffitt believed that defendant might have been involved in the disturbance at Velek\u2019s home, and he called out to defendant and asked to speak with him. Defendant looked toward the officers, put his hands in his pockets, and continued to walk away from them. Moffitt \u201cbegan to address [defendant] more[,]\u201d identifying himself as a police officer, and directing defendant to \u201ccome back\u201d and speak to the officers. Defendant stopped and turned toward the officers, and Moffitt instructed defendant to take his hands out of his pockets. Defendant took his hands out of his pockets, and then he began to walk a little bit faster back towards the house, putting his hands in his pockets again.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Defendant\u2019s actions led Moffitt to believe that defendant might have a weapon and that he would barricade himself inside Velek\u2019s home. Moffitt called out to defendant at least three more times, and defendant finally stopped at the front porch of Velek\u2019s home. The officers approached defendant, and Moffitt asked defendant if he had any weapons. When defendant denied that he had any weapons, Moffitt asked if he could search him, and defendant said that he could. Moffitt had defendant turn and face away from him and interlace his fingers behind his back. Moffitt took hold of defendant\u2019s fingers and asked defendant if he had any weapons or drugs. Defendant said that he did not. Moffitt again asked defendant if he could search him, and defendant said that he could.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Moffitt searched defendant and felt a methamphetamine pipe in his front pocket. Defendant admitted to Moffitt that the pipe had methamphetamine residue in it. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>told Moffitt that he had taken the pipe and a scale that was located in his other pocket from Velek, who was inside the house. At that point, Moffitt determined that he had probable cause to arrest defendant. Moffitt handcuffed defendant and then turned his attention to the two other individuals he could now see were also outside the home. One of those individuals was Velek, and the other was Wilson, the person who was the subject of the disturbance call.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The officers eventually questioned defendant, who gave them a false name and a false birth date. The officers also discovered a Mexican-issued identification card with the same false name in defendant\u2019s wallet. Based on the false identification information that defendant provided, as well as the methamphetamine pipe, the methamphetamine residue, the scale, and defendant\u2019s intention to remove those items from Velek\u2019s house, the state indicted defendant for identity theft, unlawful possession of methamphetamine, giving false information to a police officer for a citation, and tampering with physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Defendant moved to suppress all of the evidence derived from Moffitt\u2019s search, arguing that the officers had stopped him without reasonable suspicion that he had committed a crime, thereby violating his rights under Article I, section 9, and under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a hearing on the motion, the trial court concluded that the officers stopped defendant when, after defendant saw the officers and continued to walk away, Moffitt called out to him a second time and directed him to return to the officers. Nevertheless, the trial court concluded that the stop was lawful because the officers had reasonable suspicion to believe that a crime had been committed and that defendant had committed it. The trial court further concluded that, once the officers lawfully stopped defendant, they could search him pursuant to the officer-safety exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court correctly concluded that the officers stopped him, but he asserts that the trial court erred in determining that the officers had reasonable suspicion to justify the stop. Defendant first asserts that the initial disturbance call to the police was unreliable, and, thus, could not support an objectively reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed. Next, defendant argues that the call did not necessarily \u201cindicate criminal activity.\u201d Finally, defendant argues that the officers did not have objectively reasonable suspicion that defendant was the one involved in the disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The state concedes that \u201cMoffett stopped defendant when he called out for defendant to stop so that the officers could speak with him[,]\u201d but it argues that the stop was supported by reasonable suspicion. The state asserts that the disturbance call was sufficiently reliable to establish reasonable suspicion. Additionally, the state argues that \u201calthough Velek\u2019s mother did not specifically report that [Wilson] was committing a crime inside her daughter\u2019s residence, it was reasonable for Moffitt to believe that a crime of some sort had occurred or was about to occur.\u201d Finally, the state contends that, because Moffitt \u2014 based on his previous visits to Velek\u2019s home \u2014 was certain that defendant had just left the home and because defendant avoided the officers, there was reasonable suspicion that defendant was the one who had caused the disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u201cArticle I, section 9, requires the police, before stopping an individual, to have reasonable suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal activity. In the absence of reasonable suspicion (or some other permissible concern, such as officer safety), the individual has the right to be free from police interference and may terminate an encounter with police at will.\u201d <em>State v. Unger, </em>356 Or 59, 71, 333 P3d 1009 (2014). \u201cReasonable suspicion has a subjective and an objective component: an officer has reasonable suspicion when the officer subjectively believes that the person has committed a crime and that belief is objectively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Moore, </em>264 Or App 86, 89, 331 P3d 1027 (2014) (citing <em>Ehly, </em>317 Or at 79). To be objectively reasonable, an officer\u2019s suspicion must be based on specific and articulable facts. <em>Ehly, </em>317 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>at 80. Reasonable suspicion does not require that the facts conclusively indicate illegal activity but, rather, \u201conly that those facts support the reasonable inference that a person has committed a crime.\u201d <em>State v. Hammonds/Deshler, </em>155 Or App 622, 627, 964 P2d 1094 (1998) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u201cWhen reasonable suspicion is based solely on a citizen informant\u2019s report, that report must contain some indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>State v. Villegas-Varela, </em>132 Or App 112, 115, 887 P2d 809 (1994). There are three factors for determining the reliability of a citizen informant\u2019s report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\u201cOne is whether the informant is exposed to possible criminal and civil prosecution if the report is false. That factor is satisfied if the informant gives his or her name to law enforcement authorities or if the informant delivers the information to the officer in person. The second factor is whether the report is based on the personal observations of the informant. An officer may infer that the information is based on the informant\u2019s personal observations if the information contains sufficient detail that it is apparent that the informant had not been fabricating the report out of whole cloth and the report is of the sort which in common experience may be recognized as having been obtained in a reliable way. The final factor is whether the officer\u2019s own observations corroborated the informant\u2019s information. The officer may corroborate the tip either by observing the illegal activity or by finding the person, the vehicle and the location substantially as described by the informant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). However, even if the second factor is not satisfied, the reliability of the report is not necessarily undermined. <em>See State v. Mitchele, </em>240 Or App 86, 93, 251 P3d 760 (2010). For example, in <em>Mitchele, </em>an informant reported information to the police that he had learned from his wife, including that a suspicious individual was \u201ccasing\u201d homes in the informant\u2019s neighborhood for possible burglaries and a description of the individual and his clothes. <em>Id. </em>at 88. Officers responded to the call and encountered the defendant in the informant\u2019s neighborhood. The defendant was wearing clothes that matched the informant\u2019s description and he tried to \u201ctuck\u201d himself into nearby foliage as the officers approached. <em>Id. </em>at 88-89. On appeal, we determined that, while the second factor was not satisfied because the report was not based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>on the informant\u2019s first-hand observations, the report was nonetheless reliable because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">\u201c [t]he report\u2019s details, including the description of defendant\u2019s clothing, location, and actions, are sufficient to show that neither the caller nor the caller\u2019s wife had fabricated the report. Further, defendant fail[ed] to present a reason why either the caller or the caller\u2019s wife would fabricate the information, and their spousal relationship suggests that the caller would and did believe the source of the information and that the information had been reliably obtained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Here, because Velek\u2019s mother provided her name to the police when making her report, defendant concedes that the first factor is satisfied. <em>See id. </em>at 91-92. As for the second factor, defendant points out that \u201cthe tip in this case was not based entirely on [Velek\u2019s mother\u2019s] own personal observations [,]\u201d and, the tip \u201cdid not provide a detailed description of the alleged perpetrator or * * * the alleged criminal activity.\u201d Defendant concedes that \u201cthe second-hand nature of the information did not trouble the court in <em>Mitchele\u201d </em>but he asserts that \u201cthis case is distinguishable\u201d because, as compared to the \u201chighly detailed\u201d report in <em>Mitchele, </em>\u201cwhich supported an inference that it was based on personal observations [,] [h]ere, *** the information supplied to [Velek\u2019s mother] by [Velek] * * * indicated only that someone named [Wilson] was yelling and threatening to break things.\u201d For its part, the state simply asserts that Velek\u2019s mother based her report on Velek\u2019s \u201cself-report to her, as well as her own corroborating personal observations made while speaking with Velek.\u201d Lastly, as for the third factor, defendant argues that Moffitt\u2019s observations at Velek\u2019s home \u201ccontradicted the tip\u201d because defendant \u201cdid not seem * * * as if he had been involved in a disturbance [,]\u201d and, initially, he did not \u201cseem hurried or like he was trying to run away[.]\u201d The state counters that, \u201calthough Moffitt did not observe defendant engage in any other notable behavior, given the information provided and defendant\u2019s presence at Velek\u2019s residence, [Moffitt] reasonably inferred that [defendant] was the subject who had been threatening to break Velek\u2019s belongings ten minutes earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Despite the parties\u2019 focus on Velek\u2019s mother\u2019s report, we need not determine whether the report was sufficiently reliable, because, even assuming that it was, the facts known to the officers at the time of the stop \u2014 including the information from Velek\u2019s mother \u2014 were not sufficient to support an objectively reasonable conclusion that a crime had occurred. On this point, <em>Moore, </em>264 Or App 86, is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">In <em>Moore, </em>a landowner whose property was in a rural and densely wooded area contacted the police to report that two \u201csuspicious\u201d individuals had \u201cparked a vehicle on her property.\u201d The landowner described the individuals\u2019 vehicle and license plate to the police dispatcher but did not report that she had told the individuals that they were on her property or that she had asked them to leave. Rather, she reported that she had asked them if they needed help; they had declined and told her they were working at a nearby Christmas tree farm. <em>Id. </em>at 87. A deputy responded to the call and found the defendant\u2019s car \u2014 which matched the landowner\u2019s description \u2014 on the shoulder of a paved, public road. The deputy could not determine whether the vehicle was on the landowner\u2019s property. <em>Id. </em>at 87-88. Shortly after the deputy arrived, the defendant walked out of some nearby woods and returned to the car. When questioned, the defendant told the deputy that he had been hunting mushrooms on the property and that he had permission from the owner \u2014 someone other than the landowner who initiated the report \u2014 to be there. The deputy proceeded to stop the defendant and ultimately obtained the defendant\u2019s consent to search him for weapons. During the search, the deputy found drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The defendant moved to suppress all evidence from the search, and the trial court denied the motion. <em>Id. </em>at 88-89. Similar to this case, the defendant argued on appeal that (1) the landowner\u2019s report was not sufficiently detailed to be reliable; (2) the deputy\u2019s observations did not sufficiently corroborate the report; and (3) the report and the deputy\u2019s observations did not establish the elements of the offense of trespassing. We concluded that the defendant\u2019s third argument was correct, and did not address the first two. <em>Id. </em>at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>We examined the elements of criminal trespass, noting that the crime requires an individual \u201c\u2018[t]o enter or remain in or upon premises when the premises, at the time of such entry or remaining, are not open to the public or when the entrant is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting ORS 164.205(3)(a)). We stated that \u201cproperty is open to the public \u2014 and not subject to criminal trespass \u2014 when some characteristic of the property objectively would cause a reasonable person to believe he or she is free to enter or remain on the property without permission, even if the owner intends the property to be private and requires permission to be there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Against that backdrop, we first noted that the location of the defendant\u2019s vehicle on the side of the road did not support a reasonable belief that the defendant was trespassing, because it was customary for vehicles to park on the shoulder of the road and there were no characteristics of the shoulder that might have communicated to a reasonable person that it was private property instead of part of the public road. <em>Id. </em>at 91-92. We then stated that the landowner\u2019s description of the individuals as \u201csuspicious\u201d and as refusing help did not make it any more likely that the defendant was trespassing. Finally, we stated that there was nothing in the record that indicated that the woods from which the defendant had emerged were part of the landowner\u2019s property or that the defendant was not privileged to be there. <em>Id. </em>at 92-93. Accordingly, we concluded that \u201cthe facts known to [the deputy] at the time of the stop were not sufficient to support an objectively reasonable conclusion that defendant was trespassing!,]\u201d and, thus, the stop was unlawful. <em>Id. </em>at 93. <em>See also State v. Musser, </em>253 Or App 178, 183-84, 289 P3d 340 (2012), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>356 Or 148, 335 P3d 814 (2014) (officer did not have reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant for trespassing because there were no apparent restrictions on public access to the elevated walkway where the officer first encountered the defendant and the walkway was physically distinct from the areas where there were restrictions); <em>State v. Morton, </em>151 Or App 734, 739 n 4, 951 P2d 179 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 521 (1998) (stating that, \u201ceven if the evidence could give rise to a reasonable suspicion that [the defendant] was under the influence of marijuana, it is not a crime to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>possess less than an ounce of marijuana; it is only a violation[,]\u201d and thus the facts did not \u201cgive rise to a reasonable inference that defendant had committed a crime\u201d (emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In this case, Welsh believed that the disturbance could involve the crimes of menacing, assault, or criminal mischief. We examine each crime in turn. A person commits the crime of menacing \u201cif by word or conduct the person intentionally attempts to place another person in fear of imminent serious physical injury.\u201d ORS 163.190. However, Velek\u2019s mother did not report that Wilson had placed Velek or anyone else in fear of physical injury; rather, she reported that Wilson was threatening to break Velek\u2019s belongings. For an individual to commit any degree of assault, the individual must cause physical injury to another person. <em>See </em>ORS 163.160; ORS 163.165; ORS 163.175; ORS 163.185. But Velek\u2019s mother did not report any violence, physical injuries, or any imminent violence. Finally, for a person to commit any degree of criminal mischief, the person must damage, interfere, or tamper with in some way the property of another. <em>See </em>ORS 164.365; ORS 164.354; ORS 164.345. Thus, without more, Wilson \u201cthreatening\u201d to break things and yelling could not constitute criminal mischief. Additionally, the officers did not observe anything that would lead to a reasonable inference that menacing, assault, or criminal mischief was occurring or had recently occurred. For example, they did not witness any violence, encounter any injured people, hear items breaking, or observe broken objects. As such, similar to <em>Moore, </em>although the officers had received a call from an identified person, the information that the caller provided, in context with the circumstances that the officers observed, was insufficient to give rise to an objectively reasonable suspicion that defendant had committed any of the crimes Welsh mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The state itself does not identify any crimes for which reasonable suspicion existed at the time of the stop. The state asserts that the officers had reasonable suspicion that defendant may have committed a \u201cnumber of possible crimes [,]\u201d and that \u201calthough Velek\u2019s mother did not specifically report that [Wilson] was committing a crime inside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>her daughter\u2019s residence, it was reasonable for Moffitt to believe that a crime of some sort had occurred or was about to occur [,]\u201d but the state does not identify what crime or crimes the officers could have reasonably suspected.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The cases the state cites to support its argument that Moffitt had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant are distinguishable because, unlike the facts presented here, in each of those cases, the officer had information that the defendant had committed a specific crime. <em>See State v. Belt, </em>325 Or 6, 13, 932 P2d 1177 (1997) (reasonable suspicion of prostitution, ORS 167.007); <em>Mitchele, </em>240 Or App at 94 (reasonable suspicion of attempted burglary, ORS 164.215, ORS 161.405); <em>State v. Goss, </em>219 Or App 645, 652, 184 P3d 1155, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 94 (2008) (reasonable suspicion of driving under the influence of intoxicants, ORS 813.010); <em>Hammonds/Deschler, </em>155 Or App at 626-27 (reasonable suspicion of prostitution, ORS 167.007); <em>State v. Crites, </em>151 Or App 313, 316, 948 P2d 757 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 82 (1998) (reasonable suspicion of transporting special forest products without a permit, ORS 164.813).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that, even assuming that Velek\u2019s mother\u2019s report was reliable, the report did not give rise to an objectively reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed. Given that conclusion, we need not address whether the officers reasonably suspected that defendant was the one who had engaged in the reported conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Our determination that defendant was unlawfully stopped for purposes of Article I, section 9, means that the evidence must be suppressed unless the state proves \u201cthat the consent was voluntary and was not the product of police exploitation of that illegality.\u201d <em>State v. Musser, </em>356 Or 148, 150, 335 P3d 814 (2014) (citing <em>Unger, </em>356 Or at 74-75). The state argues that, even if the officer\u2019s stop of defendant was illegal, the evidence obtained as a result of the stop is admissible because defendant\u2019s consent was voluntary. But the state has not argued, either in the trial court or on appeal, that defendant\u2019s consent was not the product of police exploitation of the illegal stop. Instead, the state\u2019s position on appeal is that \u201cno \u2018exploitation\u2019 analysis should be necessary.\u201d The Supreme Court rejected that position in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 115 P3d 908 (2005), and <em>Unger, </em>356 Or 59. Because the state, which bears the burden of proving the admissibility of evidence derived from unlawful police conduct, has failed to argue \u2014 at trial or on appeal \u2014 that defendant\u2019s consent was not the product of police exploitation of the illegal stop, the trial court erred by denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See State v. Kimmons, </em>271 Or App 592, 602, 352 P3d 68 (2015) (concluding that the trial court erred lay denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, because, \u201cdespite the fact that it bears the burden of proving that defendant\u2019s consent to the search of her car was sufficiently attenuated from any illegal police conduct, * * * the state offers no reasoned explanation * * * as to why, in the totality of the circumstances of this case, suppression is not required\u201d); <em>State v.
