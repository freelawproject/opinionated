On appeal, he challenges his sexual abuse conviction, raising three assignments of error. We reject the third without discussion and write to address the first two. In his first assignment, defendant contends that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal. He argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his sexual abuse conviction because the three-year-old victim was too young to have a subjective belief that her hips and legs were \u201cintimate parts,\u201d an element of what constitutes \u201csexual contact\u201d as determined in <em>State v. Woodley, </em>306 Or 458, 760 P2d 884 (1988). In his second assignment, related to his first, defendant argues that the trial court erred when it excluded defendant\u2019s proffered expert testimony regarding the capacity of three-year-old children for understanding intimacy and intimate parts. We conclude that there was evidence sufficient to support the conclusion that the victim had the necessary subjective belief and that the trial court did not err in excluding the proffered expert testimony. Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s sexual abuse conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u201cWe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational trier of fact, making reasonable inferences, could have found that the state proved the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Turley, </em>202 Or App 40, 48, 120 P3d 1229 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 157 (2006) (citing <em>State v. Hall, </em>327 Or 568, 570, 966 P2d 208 (1998)). So viewed, the facts are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The incident occurred when the victim, C, was three years old. Her father, Dixon, left her in a room in their house watching a cartoon. She was wearing a two-piece bathing suit. Dixon came back into the room to check on his daughter two or three minutes later, and she was no longer there. He walked into the backyard through a door in the room, came around the corner of the house, and saw defendant kneeling in front of C. Defendant, a complete stranger to C and her family, had been riding his bicycle in the alley behind the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>house and had seen C in the backyard and stopped. Dixon saw defendant\u2019s hands touching the side of C\u2019s legs and holding the bottom of her bathing suit, which had been pulled down just above her knees. (The state posits, and defendant assumes for purposes of the appeal, that, because defendant pulled C\u2019s swimsuit down, he touched C\u2019s hips.) When Dixon discovered him, defendant let go of C and began to run. When Dixon chased after defendant, C pulled up her pants and went inside the house. Dixon tackled defendant, restrained him, and instructed Arthur, C\u2019s mother, to call the police. At the time of the incident, C was potty-trained and only pulled down her pants in order to use the toilet. She was not in the habit of pulling her pants down in public; Arthur and Dixon taught her that doing so was \u201cnot right.\u201d Indeed, Arthur testified that she and Dixon had taught C that exposing her \u201cprivate places\u201d or where her bathing suit covers, is \u201csicko.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Defendant sought to have a child psychologist, Dr. Dragovich, testify \u201cregarding child development and whether a three-year-old understands the concept of intimacy which was outlined by the State and is described in <em>[State v. Meyrovich, </em>204 Or App 385, 129 P3d 729, <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 673 (2006)] on page 391 where it describes the type of relationship, perhaps, that would exist to be \u2014 and in those relationships where the person would only let that type of person touch that part.\u201d The proposed testimony, according to defendant, would assist the jury, under OEC 702,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to understand that C could not regard the areas that defendant had touched as \u201cintimate parts,\u201d and, thus, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>not satisfy the subjective part of the test in <em>Woodley, </em>306 Or at 463, set forth by the Oregon Supreme Court to determine what constituted \u201csexual contact\u201d by touching \u201cother intimate parts.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ORS 163.305(6). The term \u201cintimate parts\u201d is not defined in ORS 163.305(6).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Following that offer of proof, the trial court declined to admit the testimony, offering this explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">\u201cWell, I think the crux of the issue obviously has to do with is what issues can experts testify to, and there\u2019s some very obvious areas that experts can testify to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cBut this isn\u2019t just an issue of whether or not the expert testimony may help the jury make a decision. It is the issue of whether or not an expert can testify as to a mental state; whether or not an expert can say, \u2018Based on my training and expertise, this is what\u2019s going on in this child\u2019s head, and so she could not have considered certain areas to be an intimate part or not an intimate part.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s permissible. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s permissible if the State were attempting to do that in proving some level of mental state required in the crime, and I don\u2019t think it comes back the other way around.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s the jury\u2019s domain to determine whether or not this, within society, that that is considered an intimate part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\u201cThe first part of that test which is specifically referenced as subjective, the first part of that test, the state has to prove that as well, regarding subjective, and the state can do that with circumstantial evidence, with indirect evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">\u201cBut I do not believe that expert testimony is appropriate when it deals with a subjective state of mind in determining what a person\u2019s subjective state of mind is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201cSo I\u2019m not going to allow expert testimony on that issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">After the jury deliberated, the trial court allowed defendant to make a further offer of proof as to what Dragovich\u2019s testimony would have been. Dragovich, who had neither met nor interviewed C, testified to a three-year-old\u2019s ability to form a conception of \u201cintimacy.\u201d The testimony primarily consisted of her opinion that a normal three-year-old does not regard various parts of her body as intimate because, at that age, her language development is limited. When asked whether a three-year-old normally views various parts of his or her body as intimate, Dragovich responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201cNo, in terms of language development that starts later in the first year and continues to the second year and into the third year, at least in terms of basic intelligence testing of young children, they\u2019re mostly learning nouns, names of things. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">\u201cSo their language development is in terms of labeling, naming different things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">\u201cAnd for three-year-olds, they have \u2014 well depending on how precocious or smart they are, they would have a couple of word sentences or a little bit longer, but they\u2019re still in a time of acquiring language to apply to different parts of their environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">\u201cAnd the idea of an intimate part, they wouldn\u2019t know what that was or think about that. It\u2019s part of later teachings that would come from parents and school and society but not at age three.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">Dragovich added, when asked at what age children start to understand the concept of intimacy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u201cIn basic child protective education, I think when they are about age four or in preschool, they\u2019re introduced to the idea of bad-touch/bad-touch, secret touch; and secret touch refers to places on the body that are typically covered by a bathing suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">\u201cBut children at that age don\u2019t understand the concept of intimacy. They\u2019re still getting labels for different body parts and they\u2019re getting information from the people teaching them, very basic kind of good-bad level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201cSo that would be more like at age four * * * to five-ish where they\u2019re being taught about going from labeling a body part to function: What\u2019s the function of a body part? What does this body part do? What do you use this for.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">And when defendant asked Dragovich if it matters that a parent had instructed their child to keep their clothes on, she replied that that concerned modesty or protection from the sun and that if you asked a three-year-old what the word \u201cintimate\u201d means, \u201cYou\u2019d just get a blank stare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Defendant\u2019s challenges to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal and to the exclusion of Dragovich\u2019s testimony concern the test set out in <em>Woodley. </em>306 Or at 463. There, the defendant was convicted of attempted second-degree sexual abuse for \u201ctouching the thigh area and between [the victim\u2019s] breasts\u201d without her consent. <em>Id. </em>at 460. The court reversed our decision, <em>State v. Woodley, </em>88 Or App 493, 746 P2d 227 (1987), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>306 Or 458 (1988), in which we held that, as a matter of law, intimate areas do not include the thigh and between the breasts. We did so in the process of addressing an argument that the term \u201cintimate parts\u201d is unconstitutionally vague. <em>Id. </em>at 497. The Supreme Court concluded that it was not the intent of the legislature for us to be \u201cdeciding for [ourselves] whether parts of the body are or are not \u2018intimate\u2019 as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Woodley, </em>306 Or at 462-63.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>To solve the problem of vagueness and to prevent the appellate courts from deciding as a matter of law which body parts are considered intimate, the court formulated a two-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">\u201cFirst, because the object of the statute is to protect persons from unwanted intimacies, the part must be regarded as \u2018intimate\u2019 by the person touched. This is a subjective test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201cSecond, if an accused touched this part knowing that the touched person regarded it as intimate and did not consent, the accused violates the statute if the requisite sexual purpose is proved. If the accused, regardless of his or her private purpose, did not know that the part was \u2018intimate\u2019 to the person touched, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused should have recognized it to be an \u2018intimate part.\u2019 The latter is an objective test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 463. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\u201cIn other words, the part must be subjectively intimate to the person touched, and either known by the accused to be so or to be an area of the anatomy that would be objectively known to be intimate by any reasonable person. A court may decide that no reasonable jury could find a particular part of the body to be objectively \u2018intimate,\u2019 but the court may not, in a criminal case, instruct the jury that any part is objectively \u2018intimate,\u2019 other than breasts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">We also addressed the issue of what is considered an \u201cother intimate part\u201d in <em>Meyrovich. </em>There, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the basis that a neck is not \u201cintimate.\u201d 204 Or App at 387. The defendant had gained access to the victim\u2019s dwelling and then forcibly kissed her on the neck, and argued that the second, objective, prong of <em>Woodley </em>\u2014 requiring that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the defendant know that the victim regards the body part as intimate or should have recognized it to be an \u2018intimate part\u2019 \u2014 was not met. <em>Id. </em>We readily concluded that, because the victim testified that she \u201cregarded defendant\u2019s actions in putting his mouth on her neck as touching an intimate part,\u201d the first, subjective, prong of <em>Woodley </em>was met. <em>Id. </em>at 390. We looked to the common meaning of \u201cintimate\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">\u201cwhen the legislature used the term \u2018intimate part[]\u2019 in ORS 163.305(6), it intended to mean a body part that the person ordinarily allows to be touched only by other people with whom the person has an intimate relationship, that is, a \u2018very close personal relationship[]\u2019 marked by \u2018love, *** ardent liking, *** or mutual cherishing.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 391. Using that definition, we held that \u201ca reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that, when defendant put his mouth on the victim\u2019s neck, he knew or should have known that she considered it, under the circumstances, to be an \u2018intimate\u2019 part.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">As noted, defendant contends that the state\u2019s evidence was insufficient for the jury to find that C regarded her hips and legs as intimate parts. In defendant\u2019s view, Arthur\u2019s testimony \u2014 that C was not a child who would pull her pants down because C knew that \u201cit\u2019s not right to be pulling your pants down outside or in public\u201d and that Arthur had had talks with C that it was not appropriate \u201cto show your private part,\u201d and that it is \u201csicko\u201d to do so \u2014 does not establish that the victim subjectively \u201cbelieved that any body part, covered by her swimming suit or not, was \u2018intimate.\u2019\u201d Rather, according to defendant, Arthur\u2019s testimony only demonstrated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>C had been taught not to expose her \u201cprivate parts\u201d and did not establish that C understood that term to include anything other her crotch and buttocks, <em>i.e., </em>C only regarded her crotch and buttocks as intimate parts, not her legs and hips. Thus, in defendant\u2019s view, the evidence could not establish that C considered her hips and legs to be intimate parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Defendant also contends that the fact that C pulled up her swimsuit bottom after her father discovered defendant with her is not sufficient evidence either because the victim exhibited \u201cno signs of trauma or fear.\u201d Defendant points to <em>State v. Stacy, </em>113 Or App 141, 830 P2d 624 (1992), in which a defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree sexual abuse for touching the buttocks of two girls, aged seven and eleven, at a department store. In that case, in which we reviewed the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, we concluded that the girls\u2019 surprised reactions \u2014 one described the contact as \u201cyucky\u201d and the other described her mental state as \u201cquite excited, nervous and scared\u201d \u2014 were sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found that the victims subjectively considered their buttocks to be intimate body parts. <em>Id. </em>at 144. Defendant contends that, unlike the victims\u2019 surprised reactions in <em>Stacy, </em>the victim pulling up her pants in this case was not indicative of anything, but rather was made in response to her father telling her to go inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The state remonstrates that defendant\u2019s proffered definition of \u201cintimate\u201d \u2014 that C did not regard her hips and legs as \u201csexually intimate\u201d parts of her body \u2014 is too narrow.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>We agree. The victim\u2019s subjective belief must be that she regarded as \u201cintimate\u201d her hips and legs where defendant touched her with a sexual purpose. Here, we rely on our definition of \u201cintimate\u201d for purposes of \u201csexual contact,\u201d which is \u201ca body part that the person ordinarily allows to be touched only by other people with whom the person has an intimate relationship, that is, a \u2018very close personal relationship[]\u2019 marked by \u2018love, * * *, ardent liking, * * * or mutual cherishing.\u2019\u201d <em>Meyrovich, </em>204 Or App at 391. Accordingly, the subjective belief prong of <em>Woodley </em>is met here if C regarded her upper legs and hips as areas of her body that are ordinarily to be touched by those close to her, such as her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">To prove subjective belief, the state need not rely on the victim\u2019s testimony; it may rely on circumstantial evidence. <em>See State v. McCapes, </em>139 Or App 426, 912 P2d 419, <em>rev den, </em>324 Or 176 (1996) (circumstantial evidence that the defendant cross-dressed could be used to determine that he considered his breast an intimate part). The state adduced such evidence \u2014 that is, testimony by C\u2019s parents that she had been taught not to expose the area covered by her bathing suit bottoms and that C reacted after defendant was discovered by pulling up her bathing suit bottom \u2014 which, viewed in the light most favorable to the state, was sufficient for a jury to conclude that C considered the areas touched by defendant to be intimate parts. Moreover, so can the other evidence: that C had a habit of undressing inside and behind closed doors and that she had been potty trained. Consequently, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">We turn to defendant\u2019s assignment of error challenging the trial court\u2019s exclusion of his expert\u2019s proposed opinion testimony regarding the ability of a three-year-old to understand the meaning of \u201cintimate part\u201d for purposes of the subjective part of the <em>Woodley </em>test. Under OEC 702, an expert\u2019s testimony is admissible where, \u201cif believed, [it] will be of help or assistance to the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Stringer, </em>292 Or 388, 391, 639 P2d 1264 (1982). We review the exclusion of expert testimony under OEC 702 for legal error and, if a correct application of law permits more than one outcome, for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Nichols, </em>252 Or App 114, 119, 284 P3d 1246 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>On appeal, defendant argues that \u201cthe trial court appears to have excluded the testimony based on its legal conclusion that an expert could not testify about a person\u2019s state of mind\u201d and that that conclusion was incorrect under <em>State v. </em>Gherasim, 329 Or 188, 985 P2d 1267 (1999), and <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 657 P2d 1215 (1983), two cases that applied OEC 702\u2019s requirement that testimony \u201cwill be of help or assistance to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In <em>Middleton, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the admissibility of expert testimony regarding whether the behavior of a sex abuse victim \u2014 a 14-year-old girl who recanted her allegation that her father had raped her \u2014 was typical of the behavior of child victims of familial sex abuse. 294 Or at 432. In addition to holding that the testimony was not an impermissible comment on the victim\u2019s credibility, the court held that such testimony would be helpful to the jury: \u201cIf a qualified expert offers to give testimony on whether the reaction of one child is similar to the reaction of most victims of familial child abuse, and if believed this would assist the jury in deciding whether a rape occurred, it may be admitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437. Likewise, in <em>Gherasim, </em>the court held that a psychiatrist\u2019s testimony concerning his diagnosis of dissociative amnesia would have been helpful to a jury in a case in which the victim of an assault had difficulty remembering the details of her attack. 329 Or at 198. That is, it would have been helpful to the jury to know that the victim\u2019s \u201ccondition affected her capacity to remember what had occurred on the night that she was assaulted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Middleton, </em>294 Or at 436).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We pause to note that the proffered testimony, both as explained during trial and as expressed in the further offer of proof made after the jury\u2019s deliberation, concerned whether a three-year-old understands the <em>concept </em>of intimacy. Dragovich explained that the inability of a three-year-old (or any child under the age of eight, for that matter) to understand the concept of intimacy depends on her language development, or lack thereof. Namely, she testified that children of that age cannot understand what the term intimacy means because they are \u201cmostly learning nouns, names of things.\u201d According to her, the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>\u201cintimate\u201d is incomprehensible to a three-year-old: If asked about what \u201cintimate\u201d means, the child would respond with a \u201cblank stare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">On appeal, in arguing that the trial court correctly excluded Dragovich\u2019s testimony under OEC 702, the state does not advance the trial court\u2019s basis for the exclusion of the proffered evidence \u2014 that expert testimony is inappropriate if it concerns a person\u2019s subjective state of mind \u2014 but instead posits that Dragovich testified to standards of language development that are inapposite to what the subjective-belief prong of <em>Woodley </em>requires. That is, we understand the state\u2019s argument to be that defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s ruling fails because <em>Woodley </em>and <em>Meyrovich, </em>204 Or App at 391, require a determination that C regarded her hips and thighs as an intimate part \u2014 \u201ca body part that the person ordinarily allows to be touched only by other people with whom [she] has an intimate relationship\u201d \u2014 which is a determination qualitatively distinct from the view expressed by Dragovich.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We agree with the state that Dragovich\u2019s testimony would not be of assistance to the jury for its task of finding whether C subjectively regarded her hips and legs as \u201cintimate parts.\u201d Whether a child abstractly understands the concept of intimacy in terms of language acquisition is a different inquiry than the one required for assessing subjective belief as set out in <em>Woodley </em>and <em>Meyrovich. </em>What is required is a determination that the person regards parts of her body as those parts she allows to be touched only by those people with whom she has an intimate relationship; an \u201cintimate\u201d relationship is a very close relationship marked by love, ardent liking, or mutual cherishing. <em>Meyrovich, </em>204 Or App at 391. Dragovich\u2019s testimony, however, did not address a three-year-old\u2019s capacity to understand that only those persons close to her, like a parent, could touch certain parts of her body. That understanding does not require the ability to conceptualize intimacy in the manner about which Dragovich opined. Put differently, Dragovich did not testify that a three-year-old does not have the capacity to distinguish strangers from those persons close to her or to regard parts of her body as off-limits to those persons not close to her. Dragovich\u2019s testimony did not provide information to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the jury that would assist it in determining whether C was developmentally able to believe that her hips and thighs were parts of her body that were not ordinarily allowed to be touched by strangers, and, accordingly, the court did not err in excluding it under OEC 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Returning to the cases cited by defendant, <em>Gherasim </em>and <em>Middleton, </em>we observe that the holdings in those cases support the proposition that an expert can testify to a person\u2019s mental state or motivations to the extent that the testimony is helpful to the jury. <em>See also State v. Hazlett, </em>269 Or App 483, 495, 345 P3d 482 (2015) (although harmless, it was error for trial court to exclude testimony of pharmacologist regarding the \u201ceffect of drug-induced dementia on a person\u2019s ability to form intent\u201d). Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s stated reasoning for excluding the proposed testimony\u2014 \u201cI do not believe that expert testimony is appropriate when it deals with a subjective state of mind in determining what a person\u2019s subjective state of mind is\u201d \u2014 appears to contain an incorrect statement of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Nevertheless, on appeal, the state asks us to affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling on a basis slightly different from the one the trial court <em>articulated </em>\u2014 i.e., asserting that the trial court was \u201cright for the wrong reason.\u201d <em>See Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001). We affirm a trial court\u2019s ruling on a basis other than that on which the court relied only when, if \u201cthe question presented is not purely one of law, * * * the evidentiary record [is] sufficient to support the proffered alternative basis for affirmance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659. That condition requires that (1) \u201cthe facts of record [are] sufficient to support the alternative basis for affirmance\u201d; (2) \u201cthe trial court\u2019s ruling [is] consistent with the view of the evidence under the alternative basis for affirmance\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe record materially [is] the same one that would have been developed had the prevailing party raised the alternative basis for affirmance below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659-60.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>\u201cIn other words, even if the record contains evidence sufficient to support an alternative basis for affirmance, if the losing party might have created a <em>different </em>record below had the prevailing party raised that issue, and that record could affect the disposition of the issue, then we will not consider the alternative basis for affirmance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 660 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In this case, defendant had ample opportunity to make an offer of proof regarding the testimony he sought to offer. Though the court\u2019s articulated basis for excluding the proffered testimony somewhat misstated the law, that did not affect defendant\u2019s proffer; the case law that defendant intended to address with the testimony was discussed by the parties and the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">We conclude that under a correct reading of that case law, the proffered testimony would not have been helpful to the jury. Accordingly, the court\u2019s ruling excluding Dragovich\u2019s testimony was not in error. Moreover, the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find that C regarded her hips and legs as intimate parts, and, thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. Consequently, we affirm defendant\u2019s first-degree sexual-abuse conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-5\"> On direct examination, mother was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">\u201cHad you ever talked to her about her privates being private or, you know, where her bathing suit covers, or any of those conversations about private places?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">She answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">\u201cWell, we used the term \u2018sicko.\u2019 You know, don\u2019t be \u2014 that\u2019s a sicko when you, you know, when you show your private part, or, you know, we told her that it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not appropriate to be doing that.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\"> OEC 702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">\u2019 \u201cIf scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\"> ORS 163.427 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree when that person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-12\">\u201c(a) Subjects another person to sexual contact and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-13\">\u201c(A) The victim is less than 14 years of age; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-14\">\u201c(B) The victim is subjected to forcible compulsion by the actor[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhV\">\u201cSexual contact\u201d is defined in ORS 163.305(6) as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-15\">\u201cany touching of the <em>sexual or other intimate parts </em>of a person or causing such person to touch the sexual or other intimate parts of the actor for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of either party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b293-17\"> The Supreme Court has explained that only breasts are \u201cintimate parts\u201d as a matter of law, and that otherwise it is for the jury to determine whether the touching at issue involved an intimate part. <em>See Woodley, </em>306 Or at 463 (\u201c[T]he court may not, in a criminal case, instruct the jury that any part is objectively \u2018intimate,\u2019 other than breasts.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\"> The court noted that the legislative history, in the form of commentary from the Criminal Law Revision Commission, indicated that \u201cother intimate parts\u201d included \u2018\u201cgenitalia, breasts and whatever anatomical areas the trier of fact deems \u2018intimate\u2019 in the particular cases which arise.

That is, in <em>Woodley, </em>the determination of what constitutes \u201cother intimate parts\u201d involved an adult victim who was capable of consent. 306 Or at 460. The state points out that the legislature chose to make sexual abuse based on incapacity (as opposed to lack of consent) an aggravated offense when committed against a child under the age of 14 and yet those same victims would most likely lack the capacity to form a subjective understanding of \u201cintimate\u201d for purposes of ORS 163.305(6). <em>See </em>ORS 163.427(1)(a); ORS 163.415(1)(a). Accordingly, the state contends that it would undermine the purpose of the statute to construe it in such a way that the protection afforded to the most vulnerable victims is significantly reduced by virtue of the same incapacity that otherwise creates an aggravated offense, and posits that we should not impose the subjective component of <em>Woodley </em>in the context of age-related sex offenses. Given our conclusion in this case that legally sufficient evidence exists to satisfy the subjective component of the <em>Woodley </em>test, we need not address the state\u2019s arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\"> Two other conditions must be met: (1) \u201cthe decision of the lower court must be correct for a reason other than that upon which the lower court relied\u201d and (2) \u201cthe reasons for the lower court\u2019s decision must be either (a) erroneous or (b) in the reviewing court\u2019s estimation, unnecessary in light of the of the alternative basis for affirmance.\u201d <em>Outdoor Media, </em>331 Or at 660.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
