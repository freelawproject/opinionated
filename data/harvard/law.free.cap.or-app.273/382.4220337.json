We review the board\u2019s order \u201cfor substantial evidence and errors of law, and to determine whether [its] analysis comports with substantial reason,\u201d <em>SAIF v. Ramos, </em>252 Or App 361, 363, 287 P3d 1220 (2012), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We first emphasize that the nature of the decision presently before us is limited. Claimant applied for unemployment compensation benefits beginning October 17, 2010. Following a hearing, on August 9, 2011, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found that claimant voluntarily quit work without good cause the week of October 17, 2010, and that she was, therefore, disqualified from benefits beginning that date and until she earned enough from subsequent employment to eliminate the disqualification. <em>See </em>ORS 657.176(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The August 9,2011, order became final when claimant failed to appeal it to the board, and claimant was bound by the determination that she was disqualified from receiving benefits beginning October 17, 2010. <em>See Nichols v. Employment Dept., </em>252 Or App 623, 625, 289 P3d 276 (2012) (in challenge to notice of overpayment based on finding that claimant voluntarily left work, claimant could not collaterally challenge prior final order that she voluntarily left work).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In the order on review, the ALJ found that claimant had not earned enough from employment after October 17, 2010, to end her disqualification from benefits for having voluntarily quit work without good cause and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>was not entitled to the $11,884 the department had paid to her. The ALJ also found that claimant had caused the overpayment because, when she sought benefits for the week of October 17,2010, she answered \u201cno\u201d to the question \u201c [d] id you quit a job last week,\u201d a response determined in the August 9, 2011, order to have been false. The ALJ thus concluded that claimant was liable to repay the $11,884, regardless of whether she knew her statement was inaccurate. The board adopted that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Claimant argues that the overpayment amount should not have included benefits paid \u201cfor the period February 13, 2011 through June 4, 2011, which total $6,748,\u201d because she \u201cwas approved to receive benefits\u201d for that period in a September 21, 2011, administrative order. The September 21, 2011, order to which claimant refers addressed a challenge by one of claimant\u2019s employers to a department determination that claimant was \u201cavailable for work\u201d during the period February 13, 2011 through June 4, 2011. The September 21, 2011, order that claimant was \u201cavailable for work\u201d did not preclude the department from later determining that she was ineligible for benefits because she \u201cvoluntarily quit work without good cause.\u201d Being \u201cavailable for work\u201d is only one part of eligibility for unemployment compensation. <em>See </em>ORS 657.155 (listing eligibility factors, including being \u201cavailable for work,\u201d and not being \u201cdisqualified from benefits or ineligible for benefits under any other section of this chapter\u201d); ORS 657.176(2)(c) (claimant is disqualified from receiving benefits if she \u201c[v]oluntarily left work without good cause\u201d). The record contains substantial evidence in support of the board\u2019s finding that, despite being available, claimant was nevertheless ineligible for benefits during that period because she had not worked enough hours to eliminate disqualification from receiving benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Claimant also argues that she should have been granted a waiver of the requirement to repay the overpayment \u201cbased on fairness and severe hardship.\u201d Under the Supplemental Appropriations Act 2008, Pub L 110-252, \u00a7 4005(b), 122 Stat 2323 (2008) \u2014 the law that provides for the benefits that claimant received \u2014 the state \u201cshall require\u201d repayment when an individual receives benefits to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>the individual was not entitled, but \u201cmay\u201d waive repayment if the individual \u201cwas without fault\u201d and if requiring repayment would be \u201ccontrary to equity and good conscience.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board determined that repayment would not be waived because claimant was \u201cat fault\u201d in causing the overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Claimant argues that repayment should be waived because she \u201ccould not have known at the time she made the claim\u201d that she was not entitled to the benefits. Although at the hearing claimant offered sympathetic reasons about why she did not view the circumstances under which she left work as quitting, the August 9, 2011, administrative order, which claimant cannot now challenge, determined that circumstances of claimant\u2019s departure from work amounted to voluntarily leaving work without good cause. The department argues that the prior determination means that claimant \u201cfailed to provide accurate information in applying and reapplying for the benefits at issue\u201d and that this makes her not without fault in obtaining the overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The Supplemental Appropriations Act 2008 does not define the \u201cwithout fault\u201d requirement for a discretionary waiver of repayment, but we agree with the department that a claimant is not \u201cwithout fault\u201d when the claimant provides inaccurate information that results in an overpayment, regardless of whether the claimant knowingly provided the inaccurate information. \u201cFault\u201d does not typically suggest a \u201cknowing\u201d or \u201cintentional\u201d mental state. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>829 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining \u201cfault\u201d as a \u201cmistake\u201d or \u201cerror\u201d). Moreover, the same section of the Supplemental Appropriations Act that addresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>waiver of repayment provides that if a claimant \u201cknowingly\u201d makes a false statement that results in compensation to which the claimant is not entitled, the consequences are far more severe than being required to repay the overpayment. Supplemental Appropriations Act 2008, \u00a7 4005(a). A claimant who \u201cknowingly\u201d makes a false statement or \u201cknowingly\u201d fails to disclose a material fact, \u201cshall be subject to prosecution[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we understand \u201cfault\u201d as used in section 4005(b) to include mistakenly providing inaccurate information that results in an overpayment. Given the prior, binding, determination that claimant voluntarily quit work without good cause the week of October 17, 2010, and her undisputed representation in applying for benefits that she did not \u201cquit\u201d employment that week, the department correctly determined that claimant was not \u201cwithout fault\u201d in obtaining the overpayment that resulted from that inaccurate information. Thus, the board correctly affirmed the determination that claimant is not eligible for a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\"> ORS 657.176(2) provides, in pertinent part, that an individual who has \u201c[vloluntarily left work without good cause\u201d is disqualified from receiving benefits until the individual earns four times the \u201cweekly benefit amount\u201d in subsequent employment. The August 9, 2011, order treats quitting work without good cause as equivalent to leaving work without good cause, and claimant does not contend that quitting a job means something different from voluntarily leaving the job without good cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\"> The Supplemental Appropriations Act 2008 permits states to enter into an agreement with the federal government under which the state can receive federal funds to pay emergency unemployment compensation to certain individuals who have exhausted their regular compensation rights. With respect to overpayments, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201cIn the case of individuals who have received amounts of emergency unemployment compensation under this title to which they were not entitled, the State <em>shall </em>require such individuals to repay the amounts of such emergency unemployment compensation to the State agency, except that the State agency <em>may </em>waive such repayment if it determines that- (1) the payment of such emergency unemployment compensation <em>was without fault </em>on the part of any such individual; and (2) such repayment would be contrary to equity and good conscience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Supplemental Appropriations Act 2008, \u00a7 4005(b) (emphases added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
