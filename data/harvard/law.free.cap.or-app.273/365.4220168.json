We conclude that the trial court erred, and we accordingly reverse and remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Defendant\u2019s convictions arise out of an incident involving S, a resident at a care facility where defendant worked as a member of the \u201cdirect care staff.\u201d On December 30, 2011, defendant accompanied S on an outing from the home. Shortly after their return to the home, S \u2014 who suffered from autism and other conditions \u2014 became \u201cvery upset.\u201d Coworkers who came to assist defendant described S as angry and \u201ccombative.\u201d As part of S\u2019s \u201cbehavior plan,\u201d one \u201ccalming mechanism\u201d was to get her into the shower. Defendant attempted to do so. The coworkers testified that, during the course of a struggle to get S into the shower, defendant \u201cpunched\u201d S in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Prior to trial, defendant gave the state notice of intent to assert the defense of self-defense. <em>See </em>ORS 161.055(3) (providing that the defense of self-defense is raised by the defendant either by \u201cnotice in writing to the state before commencement of trial\u201d or by \u201caffirmative evidence by a defense witness in the defendant\u2019s case in chief\u2019). The state filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to prevent defendant from presenting evidence to support a claim of self-defense, including evidence of S\u2019s alleged prior violent behavior. The state also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>argued that a defendant \u201cmust admit to criminal conduct\u201d before the court can instruct the jury on self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">At the hearing on the state\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>defendant argued that he intended to defend himself against the charged crimes based on alternative theories that (1) defendant did not cause the injuries to S, because she inflicted those injuries upon herself, or (2) any physical force that defendant used upon S was justified as self-defense to avoid what defendant reasonably believed to be S\u2019s imminent use of unlawful physical force. The state reiterated its position that defendant could rely on self-defense only if he admitted the elements of the charged crimes, including admitting that he caused S\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The trial court seemingly agreed with the state, and ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">\u201c[Defendant] will proceed according to how you wish to present your case, but I need you to understand that if, at the presentation of this evidence and if I find that the way in which it\u2019s unfolding is some sort of complete denial that there was an injury cause [d] and in the context of what I\u2019ve described I think it\u2019s more an issue of whether you\u2019re really challenging the state\u2019s burden of proof as opposed to the claim of [self-defense], I may end up electing not to give that instruction on self-defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">During trial, the court refused to let defense counsel ask defendant if he had \u201cknown [S] to be * * * dangerous.\u201d The court explained that \u201cstate of mind is irrelevant\u201d because \u201c[t]he testimony, as I listened very carefully to the defendant, was that, \u2018I\u2019m not even sure I touched her.\u2019 In the context of that characterization, this is not a claim for self-defense.\u201d The court also declined defendant\u2019s request for the Uniform Criminal Jury Instruction on self-defense. Defendant includes both rulings within his claim that the \u201ccourt erred in denying defendant the right to have the jury consider his claim of self-defense.\u201d We express no opinion about the court\u2019s ruling on state-of-mind testimony (about which there appears to have been no offer of proof), but we conclude that, just considering the evidence admitted at trial, defendant was entitled to a jury instruction on his alternative theory of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>We review a trial court\u2019s refusal to give a defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction for legal error and \u201cassess the evidence in the light most favorable to the party offering the jury instruction.\u201d <em>State v. Beck, </em>269 Or App 304, 309, 344 P3d 140, <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 164 (2015). We describe the testimony in light of that standard. Defendant\u2019s coworkers Huskey and Ugalde heard S screaming and went to see if defendant needed help managing her. When Ugalde entered, he saw defendant standing in the doorway to S\u2019s bedroom holding the door open with his back, and S was on the floor. Ugalde hopped over S to go to the shower and turn it on. Ugalde then looked back and saw defendant \u201chunkered over\u201d S. He testified that S \u201cwas clawing at him, which that\u2019s what she does,\u201d and that defendant \u201cpunched her\u201d in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">When Huskey came through the door into S\u2019s bedroom, defendant was hunched over and said, \u201c[S] just grabbed my nuts.\u201d Huskey watched defendant try to drag S toward the shower by her bra strap and hair. Huskey testified that S attempted to grab defendant\u2019s leg, and defendant \u201ckind of pushed her away and then punched her\u201d on the forehead. According to Huskey, S then got up and went into the bathroom and, once in the bathroom, \u201csmashed the back of her head on the concrete floor [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Defendant testified that, following his return with S from their outing, S went to her bedroom and began screaming a few minutes later. According to defendant, he went to S\u2019s bedroom and found her hitting her head against the walls, the closet door, the window; \u201c[p]retty much everywhere.\u201d In order to calm her down, defendant urged S, \u201ccome on, let\u2019s get in the shower.\u201d Defendant testified that, after Ugalde came to assist him, he momentarily took his attention off S and then:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">\u201cI felt something on my pants and I looked down and she had both of her hands grabbed onto my pants and she was * * * pulling me towards her. And she had her mouth open with teeth, you know, exposed. I mean, she was coming in to bite.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Defendant described pulling his pants away from S and moving back to \u201ckeep her from coming forward and biting me.\u201d He also apparently demonstrated a hand motion while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>testifying. Defense counsel elicited the following testimony about that motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You demonstrated a hand. Which hand would go towards her head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: My left hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: All right. Do you know if you * * * touched her head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: I really am not sure. I was moving back away from her. I mean, I could have * * * touched the top of her head, but I\u2019m not sure if I even made contact, to be perfectly honest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The following day, the site manager for the home observed that S had a cut above her nose and a black eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">On appeal, defendant renews his argument that he was entitled to have the jury instructed on his alternative theory of self-defense. A defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on self-defense if \u201c(1) there is evidence to support that theory and (2) the requested instruction is a correct statement of the law.\u201d <em>See State v. Wan, </em>251 Or App 74, 80, 281 P3d 662 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">ORS 161.209 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">\u201c[A] person is justified in using physical force upon another person for self-defense or to defend a third person from what the person reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force, and the person may use a degree of force which the person reasonably believes to be necessary for the purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Here, it is undisputed that the uniform self-defense instruction that defendant requested is a correct statement of the law. The evidence also supports defendant\u2019s alternative theory of self-defense. Defendant\u2019s coworkers testified that S was very upset and combative and was clawing or grabbing defendant\u2019s leg when he punched her head. Defendant testified that S had grabbed his pants and was pulling him toward her with her mouth open and teeth exposed, appearing to be coming in to bite him. He testified that he moved his hand toward her head in order to perform \u201ca head brace\u201d and \u201ckeep her from coming forward and biting\u201d him. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>other words, there is evidence from which a jury could find that defendant\u2019s act of extending his hand toward S\u2019s head was an act of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The state argues, however, that a self-defense instruction was inconsistent with defendant\u2019s theory of the case, because defendant \u201ccategorically denied intending or causing any of [the victim\u2019s] injuries.\u201d The state relies on our opinion in <em>State v. Boyce, </em>120 Or App 299, 852 P2d 276 (1993), and on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Shumway, </em>291 Or 153, 630 P2d 796 (1981), for the proposition that accidentally causing a victim\u2019s injury \u201cis not self-defense.\u201d In <em>Boyce, </em>the defendant testified that the victim attacked her first, pushing her against the wall and causing a beer glass in the defendant\u2019s hand to break. 120 Or App at 301-02. The defendant insisted that she was unaware that the glass had broken and that the victim \u201ccollided\u201d with the broken beer glass when she lunged toward the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 302. We held that \u201c[t]o act in self-defense, a person must intentionally or at least knowingly engage in an act to prevent another from imminent use of physical force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306. Because the defendant\u2019s theory was that her role in causing the injury was an \u201caccident,\u201d and because \u201cthere was no evidence to support the theory of self-defense,\u201d we affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the self-defense instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In <em>Shumway, </em>the defendant initially shot the victim when the victim approached in a threatening manner and then shot the victim in the head after he had fallen to the floor. 291 Or at 155. He claimed that the second shot\u2014 which killed the victim \u2014 was an accident. <em>Id. </em>The trial court instructed the jury on self-defense to the homicide, but the defendant excepted to the phrasing of one part of the instruction. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court concluded that any error in the trial court\u2019s self-defense instruction was harmless because there was no evidence that the defendant fired the fatal shot in self-defense. <em>Id. </em>As the Supreme Court emphasized, \u201c[according to the state\u2019s evidence, the second shot was fired deliberately after any necessity for self-defense had ceased. According to the defendant\u2019s evidence, the second shot was not self-defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>At least two significant factors distinguish this case from <em>Boyce </em>and <em>Shumway. </em>First, <em>Boyce </em>and <em>Shumway </em>both emphasize the absence of any evidence \u2014 from the defendant or otherwise \u2014 that the defendant caused harm through an act of self-defense. Here, as described above, the testimony of defendant as well as his two coworkers permits an inference that defendant extended his hand toward S\u2019s head in self-defense. The evidence also permits an inference that defendant\u2019s hand made contact with S\u2019s head and caused her injuries. Contrary to the state\u2019s contention, defendant has not \u201ccategorically denied\u201d that his act of self-defense caused injury. Although defendant testified that he is \u201cnot sure\u201d if he actually made contact with S when he put his hand out, he also admitted that he \u201ccould have * * * touched the top of her head[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Second, unlike the defendants in <em>Boyce </em>and <em>Shumway, </em>defendant has not claimed that he caused the harm by accident. Although the state is correct that defendant \u201ccategorically denied intending to\u201d cause injury to S, neither <em>Shumway </em>nor <em>Boyce </em>make that dispositive. Rather, both cases emphasize that the defendant claimed the act was unintentional, not just that the resulting injury was unintentional. Unlike <em>Boyce </em>and <em>Shumway, </em>the evidence in this case permits a jury to find that defendant acted with intent that his action would prevent the victim from biting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Moreover, defendant did not lose the ability to present a claim of self-defense when he refused to admit that his act caused injury to S. Neither the statute setting out the defense of self-defense, ORS 161.209, nor the case law requires a defendant to admit the acts in order to have the jury consider whether, if he committed the alleged acts, he did so in self-defense. As we emphasized in <em>State v. Dahrens, </em>192 Or App 283, 286, 84 P3d 1122 (2004), <em>Boyce </em>indicates that \u201cthe defense of self-defense is available where an act is done with the knowledge or intent that it will thwart another\u2019s application of unlawful force\u201d and, thus, that a defendant need not \u201cintend to assault another in order to claim self-defense.\u201d <em>See also State v. Burns, </em>15 Or App 552, 556, 516 P2d 748 (1973) (\u201cThe fact that defendant claimed accident by testifying that he did not intend to kill [the victim] does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>deprive him of the right to an instruction on self-defense if there is also evidence in the record from which the jury could have inferred that defendant was acting in self-defense</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Here, there is at least some evidence that defendant knowingly extended his arm to block S\u2019s head and some evidence that that action caused her injuries. Even if he did not intend to cause the injuries, he was entitled to have the jury instructed that, if it found defendant committed the charged offenses, then it should also consider whether defendant acted in self-defense. <em>See Wan, </em>251 Or App at 80. The trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on that theory, and the error requires us to reverse because \u201cwe cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to give defendant\u2019s requested instruction did not affect the result.\u201d <em>State v. Zolotoff, </em>354 Or 711, 720, 320 P3d 561 (2014) (citing <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 35, 77 P3d 1111 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Convictions for fourth-degree assault and first-degree criminal mistreatment reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\"> Defendant was acquitted of harassment, ORS 166.065(l)(a)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\"> We decline to address defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, which challenges the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence of the victim\u2019s history of self-harm and harm to others, because the record may develop differently on remand, particularly given our ruling regarding self-defense. <em>See State v. Valle, </em>255 Or App 805, 806 n 1, 298 P3d 1237 (2013) (declining to address the exclusion of impeachment evidence because \u201cthe record may develop differently on remand\u201d). We also decline to address defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, which challenges the trial court\u2019s quashing of a subpoena for the victim\u2019s medical records without conducting an <em>in camera </em>review. The trial court primarily based its ruling on procedural grounds that also may not exist on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
